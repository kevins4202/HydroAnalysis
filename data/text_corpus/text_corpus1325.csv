6625,understanding how tropical montane catchments store and release water and the resulting water ecosystem services they provide is crucial for improving water resource management but while research in high elevation tropical environments has made progress in defining streamflow generation processes we still lack fundamental knowledge regarding water storage characteristics of catchments here we explore catchment storage and the factors controlling its spatial variability in seven páramo catchments 0 20 7 53 km2 in southern ecuador we applied a field based approach using hydrometeorological water stable isotopic and soils hydrophysical data from a 3 year collection period to estimate the passive pass and dynamic dyns storage of the catchments we also investigated relations between these storages and landscape and hydrometric variables using linear regression analysis pass estimates from hydrophysical soil properties and soil water mean transit times were consistent with estimates using streamflow mean transit times computed catchment pass and dyns for the seven watersheds were 313 617 mm and 29 35 mm respectively pass increased directly with the areal proportion of histosol soils and cushion plant vegetation wetlands dyns increased linearly with precipitation intensity importantly only 6 10 of the mixing storage of the catchments dyns pass was hydrologically active in their water balance wetlands internal to the catchments were important for pass where constant input of low intensity precipitation sustained wetlands recharge and thus the water regulation capacity i e year round water supply of páramo catchments our findings provide new insights into the factors controlling the water regulation capacity of páramo catchments and other peaty soils dominated

worldwide viviroli et al 2007 this is particularly true for headwater tropical ecosystems aparecido et al 2018 asbjornsen et al 2017 hamel et al 2017 such as the andean páramo which occupies over 30 000 km2 of northern south america hofstede et al 2003 wright et al 2017 and sustains the economy of millions of people in the region iucn 2002 among the variety of ecosystem services provided by the páramo its high water production and regulation i e sustained streamflow production during a water year capacity are two of the most important buytaert 2004 poulenard et al 2003 while recent páramo hydrology research has focused on the investigation of the factors controlling the water production capacity of this ecosystem e g roa garcía and weiler 2010 buytaert and beven 2011 crespo et al 2011 2012 mosquera et al 2015 2016a 2016b correa et al 2017 polk et al 2017 the factors controlling its water regulation capacity have not been yet studied in detail water regulation by headwater catchments is highly influenced by their capacity to store and release water mcnamara et al 2011 as such in the last decade there has been an increasing interest within the hydrological science community towards improving our understanding of catchment water storage hereafter referred to as catchment storage for instance the study of catchment storage has helped improve our general understanding of the streamflow storage relationships e g spence 2007 soulsby and tetzlaff 2008 kirchner 2009 soulsby et al 2011 tetzlaff et al 2014 and how storage regulation and storage discharge hysteresis depends on the antecedent wetness flow rates and catchment scale davies and beven 2015 these findings in turn have been extremely useful as basis for the enhancement of the structure of hydrological models e g sayama and mcdonnell 2009 nippgen et al 2015 soulsby et al 2015 birkel and soulsby 2016 notwithstanding direct quantification of catchment storage remains difficult because of its largely unobservable nature hale et al 2016 and the marked internal i e subsurface spatial heterogeneity within and among catchments seyfried et al 2009 soulsby et al 2008 in response to this different approaches such as gravimetric techniques hasan et al 2008 rosenberg et al 2012 cosmic ray soil moisture observations heidbüchel et al 2015 soil moisture measurements grant et al 2004 seyfried et al 2009 streamflow recession analysis birkel et al 2011 kirchner 2009 water balance based wbb and tracer based tb techniques e g stable isotopes birkel et al 2011 hale et al 2016 mcnamara et al 2011 have been applied in order to investigate these important feature of the hydrologic cycle among these the combination of techniques has proven to provide the most valuable insights into water storage in catchments staudinger et al 2017 the combination of wbb and tb methods for example has allowed for an indirect quantification of dynamic storage storage that is determined by the fluxes of water into and out of the catchment over a given period of time sayama et al 2011 hereafter referred as dyns and passive storage the subsurface volume of water stored within the catchment that mixes with incoming precipitation dunn et al 2010 birkel et al 2011 hereafter referred as pass however to date only few studies have investigated storage combining different techniques e g pfister et al 2017 staudinger et al 2017 few studies too have yet quantified the relation between catchment storage and catchment features e g rainfall temporal variability vegetation soils geology and this remains an open question in hydrological science mcnamara et al 2011 most studies of catchment storage dynamics to date have been conducted in single catchments and using only one of the aforementioned storage quantification methods the few comparative studies have shown that soils and soil drainability play an important role on catchment storage on scottish peatland dominated catchments tetzlaff et al 2014 and canadian boreal wetland dominated catchments spence et al 2011 in contrast geology and topography have been observed to control storage dynamics in steep forested catchments with well drained soils in oregon usa hale et al 2016 mcguire et al 2005 bedrock geology has also been found to control catchment storage dynamics in 16 catchments in luxembourg pfister et al 2017 whereas catchment elevation controlled storage in 21 alpine swiss catchments as linked to snow versus soil water storage staudinger et al 2017 despite these recent efforts aimed at understanding storage and the factors controlling its dynamics in several parts of the world still there exist many remote and understudied regions such as the humid tropics where detailed wbb and tb information are usually lacking here we take advantage of a unique dataset of hydrometeorological and isotopic information collected in the nested system of headwater andean páramo catchments of the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory mosquera et al 2016a 2016b mosquera et al 2015 we present new wbb and tb storage estimations using these data in combination with detailed information on the biophysical features of the landscape e g soil type vegetation cover geology topography rainfall temporal variability and soils hydrophysical properties of the monitored catchments our overarching question for this work is how do vegetation soils and precipitation dynamics control passive and dynamic storage across catchments our specific research goals s are 1 to compare different pass calculation methods in order to validate the tb pass estimations 2 to quantify the pass and dyns of the catchments at different temporal scales event based to few years and 3 to examine whether catchment features if any control their pass and dyns information that is urgently needed to improve the understanding of the factors that control the water related ecosystem services i e water production and regulation provided by the páramo and the management of water resources of peat dominated catchments in tropical regions and elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory zeo located in south ecuador the zeo is situated on the western slope of the pacific atlantic continental divide within the andean mountain range the observatory expands over an altitudinal range between 3400 and 3900 m a s l fig 1 the climate is influenced by both atlantic and pacific regime crespo et al 2011 mean annual precipitation is 1345 mm with minimal seasonality rainfall is composed mainly of drizzle year round padrón et al 2015 mean annual temperature is 6 0 c and mean annual relative humidity is 90 at 3780 m a s l within the study site córdova et al 2015 the geomorphology is dominated by glaciated u shape valleys with an average slope of 17 most of the land surface 69 has slopes below 20 5 of the catchment has slopes 40 table 1 mosquera et al 2015 the geology of the observatory is composed of mostly volcanic rocks compacted by glacial activity coltorti and ollier 2000 two geologic formations dominate the site 1 the late miocene quimsacocha formation is composed of basaltic flows with plagioclases feldspars and andesitic pyroclastics and 2 the turi formation composed of tuffaceous andesitic breccias conglomerates and horizontal stratified sands the soils in the study area are mainly andosols and histosols iuss working group wrb 2015 these soils were formed by the accumulation of volcanic ash over the valley bottoms and low gradient slopes as a result of the cold humid environmental conditions they are black humic and acid soils rich in organic matter with high water storage capacity quichimbo et al 2012 andosols cover 76 of the observatory and are mainly found on the hillslopes while the histosols cover the remaining 24 and are found mainly in flat areas at valley bottoms and toe slope position mosquera et al 2015 vegetation at the study site is composed by cushion plants plantago rigida xenophyllum humile azorella spp mosses and lichens mainly covering the histosols tussock grass calamagrostis sp covers the andosols in the zeo as in most undisturbed páramo areas the areal proportion of histosol soils and cushion plants is strongly correlated r2 0 74 p 0 01 and have led to the formation of andean wetlands mosquera et al 2016a and hereafter we refer to them simply as wetlands 2 2 hydrometric information discharge precipitation amount and meteorological variables were recorded continuously from november 2011 to november 2014 discharge was measured in seven nested catchments it was measured using v notch weirs in catchments m1 m6 and a rectangular weir at the largest outlet catchment m7 fig 1 the weirs were instrumented with schlumberger pressure transducers with a precision of 5 mm water levels were recorded at a 5 minute resolution and transformed into discharge using the kindsvater shen relationship u s bureau of reclamation 2001 discharge equations were calibrated using constant rate salt dissolution measurements following moore 2004 even though the use of a single rain gauge for monitoring precipitation amounts is common in headwater catchments e g buttle 2016 cowie et al 2017 pearce et al 1986 safeeq and hunsaker 2016 sidle et al 1995 we used 4 hobo tipping bucket rain gauges with a resolution of 0 2 mm to capture the spatial variability of precipitation within the zeo sucozhañay and célleri 2018 fig 1 we selected these rain gauges since they have shown to provide optimal spatial distribution of precipitation within the zhurucay observatory with no bias and low mean daily precipitation errors 0 25 mm in comparison to the use of a dense network of rain gauges n 13 seminario 2016 we used the kruskal wallis test at a statistical significance level of 0 05 to evaluate differences among the 3 years rainfall data recorded by the 4 rain gages used in this study results from the test showed no significant differences p value 0 05 among the rainfall data as has been previously reported in nearby páramo areas buytaert et al 2006 we applied the thiessen polygon method to these data to estimate precipitation at each of our seven monitored catchments meteorological variables were also recorded using a campbell scientific meteorological station co located with the tipping bucket p1 fig 1 air temperature and relative humidity were recorded with a cs 215 probe protected with a radiation shield wind speed was recorded using a met one 034b windset anemometer and solar radiation was recorded with a cs300 apogee pyranometer we estimated reference evapotranspiration eto for each of our study catchments using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for this purpose we used the near surface air temperature lapse rate determined by córdova et al 2016 in a nearby páramo area to correct for differences in air temperature with elevation at each of our catchments no corrections for wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation were carried out considering the size of the study area 10 km2 and that these environmental variables have shown only limited influence on eto estimations within the study area córdova et al 2015 2 3 characterization of the soils hydrophysical properties given that the sampling of soils in the study area is labor intensive due to the harsh environmental conditions we selected three transects fig 1 to collect soil samples for soil properties analyses since the physiographic position along the landscape i e valley bottom toe slope lower slope middle slope upper slope and hilltop following fao 2009 schoeneberger et al 2012 has shown to influence the spatial variability of soil properties in the páramo guio blanco et al 2018 the transects were selected to capture this variability among physiographic positions within the catchment soil samples were collected at 45 sampling locations in total almost equally distributed every 150 m along the selected transects to capture the variability of the soil properties at different physiographic positions at each sampling location we characterized the soil depth soil types soil horizons organic and mineral and the thickness of each horizon as the presence of andosol and histosol soils dominates in our study area we used the criteria of the iuss working group wrb 2015 to classify their horizons types for both soil types the organic horizon corresponded to soils with organic matter contents higher than 5 and bulk densities lower than 0 90 g cm 3 whereas the mineral horizon presented organic matter contents lower than 5 and bulk densities higher than 0 9 g cm 3 additionally we collected three undisturbed soil samples of 100 cm3 using steel rings 5 cm diameter at each sampling location and soil horizon following collection the samples were saturated via capillary rise from a saturated sand support for analysis of the soil water tension water content θ relationships at saturation pf 0 and field capacity pf 2 54 at the soil hydrophysics laboratory of the university of cuenca the θ at saturation was obtained via gravimetry after the saturated samples were dried up in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and at field capacity via the ceramic plates system method usda and nrcs 2004 the θ values are reported as volumetric moisture cm3 cm 3 2 4 collection and analysis of isotopic data weekly water samples for oxygen 18 18o isotope analysis were collected for the period may 2012 may 2014 these samples were collected in streamflow precipitation and soil water grab samples in streamflow were collected at the same stations used for measuring discharge given the potential spatial variability of the isotopic composition of rainfall fischer et al 2017 water samples in precipitation were collected using two rain collectors located at 3780 and 3700 m a s l p1 and p2 in fig 1 respectively precipitation water samples were collected using circular funnels connected to polypropylene rain collectors covered with aluminum foil and with a 5 mm mineral oil layer to reduce evaporation of the stored water iaea 1997 once precipitation samples were collected the rain collectors were cleaned dried and the mineral oil replaced before their re installation soil water samples were collected using wick samplers installed at four locations 2 histosols and 2 andosols fig 1 the wick samplers were built with 9 5 mm diameter fiberglass wicks connected to a polypropylene container of 30 30 cm following boll et al 1991 1992 knutson et al 1993 one end of the wick was connected to the wick sampler and the other to a 1 5 l glass bottle where the soil water was collected and stored in order to collect the mobile soil water fraction landon et al 1999 we applied 1 m length of suction holder et al 1989 the wick samplers were installed at three depths at all soil water sampling stations in the histosols they were placed at 25 and 45 cm depths in the organic horizon and at 75 cm depth in the organic mineral horizons interface in the andosols they were placed at 25 and 35 cm depths in the organic horizon and at 65 cm depth in the shallowest part of the mineral horizon the wick samplers in the histosols were located in flat zones at the valley bottoms near the streams whereas in the andosols they were located at the middle and bottom parts of a hillslope rainfall and soil water samples were filtered using 0 45 µm filters in order to minimize organic matter contamination the collected water samples were stored in 2 ml amber glass bottles covered with parafilm and kept away from sunlight to minimize any fractionation by evaporation a cavity ring down spectrometer picarro l1102 i was used to measure the δ 18o isotopic composition of the water samples with a 0 1 precision to diminish the memory effect in the analyses penna et al 2012 and considering that this effect increases when samples from different water types e g precipitation streamflow soil water groundwater are analyzed together in individual runs we analyzed water samples of the same type in each run to minimize the memory effect in addition we applied six sample injections and discarded the first three as recommended by the manufacturer to further reduce this effect for the last three injections we calculated the maximum δ18o isotopic composition difference and compared it with the analytical precision given by the manufacturer and the standard deviation of the isotopic standards used for the analyses 0 2 for oxygen 18 samples that showed measurement differences larger than this value were re analyzed contamination of the isotopic signal was checked using chemcorrect 1 2 0 picarro 2010 this evaluation showed that only 3 soil samples 0 5 of the total were contaminated with organic compounds those samples were excluded from the analysis isotopic concentrations are presented in the δ notation and expressed in per mill according to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow craig 1961 2 5 soil water mean transit time mtt mean transit time is defined as the time it takes for a water molecule to travel subsurface in a hydrologic system mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 that is from the time it enters as precipitation or snow to the time it exists at an outlet point e g streamflow spring soil wick sampler or lysimeter the approach used to estimate soil water mtt was based on the lumped convolution method maloszewski and zuber 1996 which assumes a steady state condition of the flow system even though the steady state assumption has been criticized as an unrealistic catchment representation in a variety of environments the particular catchment features i e relatively homogeneous soil distribution and compact geology and low seasonal variation of hydrometeorological conditions at the zeo justify this assumption in our study catchment mosquera et al 2016b this method transforms the input tracer signal precipitation or snowmelt δin into the output tracer signal stream soils δout 1 δ o u t t 0 g τ w t τ δ i n t τ d τ 0 g τ w t τ d τ where τ is the integration variable representing the mtt of the tracer t τ is the time lag between the input and output tracer signals g τ is the transit time distribution ttd that describes the tracer s subsurface transport and w t is a recharge mass variation function the latter was applied to take into account the temporal variability in recharge rates by weighting the input isotopic composition based on precipitation amounts mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 as precipitation isotopic composition varies as a function of elevation within the study site the precipitation input signal for each catchment was corrected using the isotopic lapse rate determined for the zeo that is an increase of 0 31 in δ18o per 100 m decrease in elevation mosquera et al 2016a we used this isotopic lapse rate and the mean elevation of each study catchment to correct the weekly isotopic data obtained from our two rain gauges used to monitor the input isotopic signal in our study catchment mosquera et al 2016b we tested five ttds for the simulations the exponential model em exponential piston flow model epm the dispersion model dm małoszewski and zuber 1982 the gamma model gm kirchner et al 2000 and the two parallel linear reservoir model tplr weiler et al 2003 similarly to the findings of mosquera et al 2016b during the evaluation of streamflow mtts at the zeo the ttd that best represented the subsurface transport of water through the soils was the em therefore the soil water mtts reported below correspond to the estimations based on this ttd 2 6 passive storage estimations we define passive storage as 2 pass m t t i where i is the mean annual discharge over the period mtt was estimated for each catchment or soil horizon we estimated pass based on the streamflow mtts table 2 of the nested system of catchments reported by mosquera et al 2016b using the same methodology described in the section 2 5 and hereafter referred as pass q we also approximated the pass at the outlet of the basin m7 based on two additional methodologies in order to examine how much of the catchments pass q is represented by the soils the first approach was based on the soils hydrophysical properties hereafter referred as pass hp given the high water retention capacity of the páramo soils and the sustained year round rainfall at the study site padrón et al 2015 we assumed that their soil moisture content remained high and near saturation conditions throughout the year buytaert 2004 we also assumed that the contribution of the soils to the catchment pass should be between saturation and field capacity as such we used the θs at pf 0 saturation and pf 2 54 field capacity to estimate the water storage for each soil horizon at each of the positions where these soils hydrophysical properties were measured along the landscape as follows 3 pass hp j k θ j k d j k where pass hp represents the soil water storage and d the representative depth of the soil horizon j i e organic or mineral at position k across the landscape i e from valley bottom to hilltop where soil moisture θ at saturation or field capacity was measured using this approach and mapping the landscape surface that corresponded to the different positions k we estimated the water storage in the soils at each of these positions for the whole catchment for example for estimating the pass hp of the catchment at the middle of the slope we mapped the area of the whole catchment corresponding to a slope of 32 40 and with andosol soil type as indicated in table 3 the total catchment pass hp was then calculated as the sum of pass hp at all monitoring positions for both the organic and mineral horizons at saturation and field capacity the second approach was based on the soil water mtt estimations hereafter referred as pass s the average of the volume of water stored in the bottles used for the weekly collection of soil water samples was used to estimate the i discharge value in eq 2 this volume was converted to discharge by dividing it to the area of the samplers 30 cm 30 cm in this way we estimated the pass s for each soil type at each monitoring depth and position within the landscape given that the tracer signal at an outlet point within a catchment accounts for the mixing of all the flow paths above such points mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 this approach represents directly the storage of all the water draining down towards the outlet point consequently no further integration of different landscape units is needed this contrasts with the other alternative method where pass hp requires an integration of the water stored at different parts of the landscape 2 7 dynamic storage estimation the wbb volumes of water stored in the catchments were estimated for each day during the study period following sayama et al 2011 4 s t p t q t et a t where s t p t q t and eta t are the storage volume precipitation streamflow and actual evapotranspiration at time t respectively the long term dyns hereafter referred as dyns lt of the nested catchments was then defined as the difference between the maximum smax and the minimum smin daily storage volumes obtained from eq 3 over the period of analysis actual evapotranspiration was estimated as 5 et a f et o where eto is the potential evapotranspiration and f is a factor which was calculated as the result of the difference between p and q divided by eto i e p q eto for each catchment staudinger et al 2017 2 8 runoff events selection and variables we selected rainfall runoff events for the analysis of the temporal variability of dyns at the event scale hereafter referred as dyns es these events were defined as runoff response to rainfall inputs where discharge increased from below low flow values smakhtin 2001 below q35 non exceedance flow rates determined as low flows at the zeo mosquera et al 2015 to values higher than this threshold during the duration of the events we further used the minimum inter event time criteria defined as the minimum time lapse without precipitation between two consecutive events dunkerley 2008 to separate the precipitation time series into rainfall events given that at the study region rainfall occurs frequently and is sustained along the year padrón et al 2015 we selected a minimum inter event time of 6 hr to define independent events although rainfall runoff events were evaluated at all catchments only the results for the outlet of the catchment m7 are reported as similar trends for all catchments were found under these considerations 42 events were selected for the analysis at m7 for each event we evaluated the storage discharge hysteresis this was conducted by visual inspection of the plots of the normalized fractional storage sf and fractional discharge qf davies and beven 2015 these values are defined as the storage and discharge volumes as fractions of the pass q i e sf s pass q and qf q pass q respectively where s and q are the same as in eq 3 but estimated at 5 minute temporal resolution for the analysis at the event scale additionally we also estimated the cumulative q q cum cumulative p p cum cumulative eta eta cum the minimum mean and maximum rainfall intensity as well as the antecedent wetness conditions of the catchment represented as the amount of antecedent precipitation over different time periods 7 and 14 days before each event for each of the 42 events to investigate the influence of these hydrometeorological variables on dyns es 2 9 statistical analysis between storage and landscape hydrometric features we conducted a pearson linear correlation analysis between the estimates of pass q and dyns lt and different landscape features which included catchment area soil type vegetation cover geology and average slope of each catchment we also conducted a linear correlation analysis between pass q and dyns lt with hydrometric variables that included mean annual p mean annual q mean annual eta runoff coefficient q p and different non exceedance flow rates according to the catchment s flow duration curves the biophysical and hydrometric features of the catchments were obtained from mosquera et al 2015 table 1 at the event scale linear correlation analysis was used to investigate relations between dyns es with all the hydrometeorological variables estimated for the rainfall runoff events section 2 8 all correlations were evaluated using the determination coefficient r2 at a statistical significance level of 0 10 i e 90 confidence level using the t student test 3 results 3 1 catchment water passive storage 3 1 1 streamflow mtt based catchment passive storage estimations the pass q variation among the catchments was relatively large 304 mm these estimates varied from 313 to 617 mm with a value of 457 mm at the outlet of the basin m7 the maximum values were observed at catchments m3 and m4 while the minimum value at m2 table 2 3 1 2 hydrophysical soil properties based catchment passive storage estimations the hydrophysical properties of the soils i e θ at pfs 0 and 2 54 located at the different landscape positions and their areal extent within the zeo are presented in table 3 the histosols were only found at the valley bottom and toe slope positions their average thickness was 70 cm for the organic horizon and 50 cm for the mineral horizon histosols were normally found in low relief areas with slopes between 1 and 15 they presented the highest θs at saturation pf 0 for the organic 0 89 0 90 cm3 cm 3 and the mineral horizon 0 65 cm3 cm 3 the organic horizon of the histosols had significantly higher θs at field capacity pf 2 54 0 62 0 63 cm3 cm 3 in comparison to the mineral horizon 0 54 cm3 cm 3 the andosols on the other hand were found from the toe slope to the summit positions with slopes between 1 and 56 their thickness was more variable than for the histosols and ranged between 30 and 40 cm for the organic horizon and 20 30 cm for the mineral horizon the θ values at saturation of the organic horizon of the andosols 0 72 0 83 cm3 cm 3 were more variable than those of their mineral horizon 0 53 0 56 cm3 cm 3 for both horizons these values were significantly lower than for the histosols their θ values at field capacity for the organic horizon of these soils 0 62 0 69 cm3 mm 3 were more variable and higher than those for their mineral horizons 0 46 0 50 cm3 cm 3 the pass hp was variable among the different soil types and horizons at the different positions in the landscape table 3 the pass hp estimations using these soil properties and the spatial distribution and thickness of each soil horizon showed that the histosols stored a higher amount of water 711 mm at fc and 948 mm at saturation than the andosols 361 mm at fc and 420 mm at saturation table 4 integrating these pass hp values to the catchment scale using the areal proportions of the catchment covered by each soil type the pass hp at the outlet of the basin m7 were 445 mm at field capacity and 547 mm at saturation table 4 3 1 3 soil water mtt based catchment passive storage estimations soil water mtts for andosols and histosols at the three monitored depths are reported in table 5 the mtts in both soil types increased with depth mtts in the andosols were 35 and 48 days for the shallower organic horizons and 144 days for the organic mineral horizons interface mtts in the histosols were longer than in the andosols with values of 212 and 292 days for the shallower organic horizons and 338 days for the organic mineral horizon interface with these mtt values we estimated the pass s for each soil type at each monitoring depth table 5 andosols showed pass s values ranging between 14 and 49 mm with the highest contribution from the mineral horizon at 65 cm depth histosols showed higher pass s values similar to the soil water mtts these values increased with depth pass s was 191 and 263 mm at the shallower organic horizons and 304 mm at the organic mineral horizon interface at 65 cm depth based on the pass s values at each soil type and horizon the water storage was 97 mm for the andosols and 759 mm for the histosols 3 2 catchment water dynamic storage 3 2 1 long term dynamic storage estimations the catchments dyns lt ranged from 29 to 35 mm showing little differences among subcatchments 6 mm similar to the pass q catchments m3 and m4 showed the maximum values while the minimum value corresponded to m7 the fractions of dyns lt to pass q varied between 6 and 10 among the catchments table 2 fig 2 shows the daily temporal variability of the wbb catchments water storage volume the system showed a very flashy response of storage volume to precipitation but normally returned to a condition with s t of approximately 0 mm day 1 negative values s t 0 mm day 1 when the system loses or discharges higher amounts of water than the inputs and positive values s t 0 mm day 1 when the system gains or receives higher amounts of water than it discharges occurred at approximately the same frequency 53 and 47 respectively 3 2 2 event based dynamic storage estimations the 42 rainfall runoff events selected for the analysis represented a wide variety of hydrometeorologic conditions during the study period the p cum at the end of the events ranged between 0 2 and 56 0 mm with q cum varying between 1 2 and 52 8 mm eta cum between 0 1 and 16 6 mm and dyns es between 0 07 and 1 91 mm in addition maximum mean and minimum p intensities during the events were in the range of 0 6 22 3 mm h 1 0 1 5 4 mm h 1 and 0 to 1 1 mm h 1 respectively antecedent p for 7 and 14 days prior to the start of the events ranged between 2 6 and 68 5 mm and 15 8 113 3 mm the temporal variability of sf during the events was similar for all catchments a representative storm for the catchment m7 outlet is shown in fig 3 the event had a total duration of 50 h and during this period p cum and q cum were 32 2 and 32 3 mm respectively fig 3 shows that at the beginning of the event t0 the system was neither storing nor releasing water with sf 0 during the first 17 7 h t1 of the event 82 of the p cum entered to the system during this hydrograph rising limb black line in fig 3a the catchment both released water via q in response to the p inputs but was also dynamically recharged sf 0 mm thereafter and once rainfall intensity decreased the system continued to change from a diminished recharge state to a releasing water state until t2 at around 18 3 hr this period of water loss from the catchment was mostly linear the hydrograph peak t2 was mostly caused by contribution of the moisture from the recharged system rather than from precipitation inputs directly i e the black line in the negative region of the sf during the t1 t2 period in fig 3b after rainfall cessation the release of water from the catchment continued until t3 18 6 h at this point the hydrograph recession decreased linearly until the end of the event when the system again reached a stability condition sf 0 mm at 50 h tf the sf dynamics at the event scale formed an anticlockwise hysteretic loop all of the monitored events at all catchments followed the same hysteretic direction 3 3 relations between storage metrics and landscape features and hydrometric variables the pass q for our nested catchments was significantly positively correlated with mean annual q r2 0 73 p 0 07 runoff coefficient r2 0 75 p 0 06 and high flows represented by the q90 non exceedance flows r2 0 67 p 0 09 table 6 pass q was also significantly positively correlated with the cushion plants vegetation cover r2 0 68 p 0 08 and negatively correlated with the tussock grass vegetation cover r2 0 73 p 0 07 fig 4 even though similar correlation trends were found between the catchments pass q and their soils areal extent i e positive for the histosols and negative for the andosols these correlations were not statistically significant r2 0 55 p 0 15 the latter was most likely as a result of the higher uncertainty in the soil type distribution mapping of the zeo in relation to the vegetation distribution mapping that was better characterized directly in the field mosquera et al 2015 for the dyns lt estimations calculated from the daily wbb analysis we found statistically significant correlations with landscape and hydrologic variables however due to the small range of variation of dyns lt among catchments only 6 mm table 2 we acknowledge that these correlations may not be causal and thus do not report them on the short term when analyzing correlation between hydrometeorological variables and the dyns es during the events monitored at the outlet of the basin m7 we identified non significant correlations between this storage metric and most hydrometeorological variables r2 0 30 p 0 10 these variables included the p cum q cum eta cum mean and minimum p intensities and 7 and 14 days accumulated antecedent p the only significant correlation found was between the dyns es and the maximum p intensity during the events r2 0 91 p 0 001 fig 5 4 discussion hydrologic services provided by natural ecosystems help improve the well being of surrounding and downstream societies brauman et al 2007 however there is still an important knowledge gap regarding the relation between the eco hydrological behavior of catchments e g water storage and release and the hydrologic services e g water production and regulation that they provide sun et al 2017 our work presented here on how catchment storage influences the páramo water regulation capacity shows how highly organic and porous peaty páramo soils histosols and the local environmental conditions high humidity and year round low intensity precipitation interact to control the water regulation capacity of the ecosystem below we discuss key findings and contextualize our work with other sites where peaty soils dominate in the tropics and elsewhere 4 1 passive water storage at the catchment scale 4 1 1 comparison of passive storage estimation methods regarding the application of different methods for estimating the catchments pass capacity past investigations have yielded differing results e g brauer et al 2013 staudinger et al 2017 for instance at the girnock catchment in the scottish highlands several methods used to estimate the catchment s pass yielded different results these methods included the streamflow mtt based pass q soulsby et al 2009 a combination of distributed soil moisture and groundwater measurements and hydrologic modelling van huijgevoort et al 2016 bedrock geophysical surveys tetzlaff et al 2015a and tracer based hydrologic modelling birkel et al 2011 with the estimated pass values yielded amongst these methods varying within two orders of magnitude for this reason we first evaluated how our streamflow mtt based passive storage pass q estimations compared to those based on the monitoring of the soils hydrophysical properties pass hp and soil water mtts pass s the pass hp estimates for the catchment outlet m7 at field capacity and saturation 445 and 547 mm respectively table 4 showed a remarkable agreement with respect to the pass q estimate 457 mm table 2 for pass estimations based on the soil water mtts pass s landscape configuration affected the isotopic signal whereby the water from the andosols draining down the hillslopes was already mixed at the valley bottom wetlands mosquera et al 2016a tetzlaff et al 2014 as a result the storage estimations from the histosols added to the andosols storage the sum of the pass s estimations of the organic horizons of the histosols i e at 25 and 45 cm depth resulted in a total pass of 454 mm table 5 this values was also very similar to the pass q estimation these findings suggest that pass q provides accurate estimates of the total catchment pass and that catchment water storage capacity of the zeo outlet is effectively stored in the páramo soils consequently deep groundwater sources to runoff are minimal as has been hypothesized in past studies at the zeo correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a b these findings also suggest that the tracer signals from different parts of the catchments become well mixed within the valley bottom wetlands mosquera et al 2016b and that the integration of these signals provides accurate estimates of catchment passive storage streamflow based mtt has been used to estimate passive storage pass q in past investigations e g soulsby et al 2009 mcnamara et al 2011 tetzlaff et al 2015b hale et al 2016 staudinger et al 2017 but the accuracy of this method has been difficult to evaluate due the unobservable nature of large groundwater contributions to pass in these sense the zeo hydrologic conditions where we can exclude a groundwater component is an ideal site for investigating the accuracy of the pass q method given that the pass q estimations for the outlet of the catchment lie within those yielded by the potential storage of the soils i e the pass hp estimations at saturation and field capacity our results show that this method yields accurate catchment pass estimations in other catchments we hypothesize that through the combined application of both these methods indirect estimations of groundwater contributions can be obtained contributions that are still difficult to quantify in the field or are estimated with high uncertainty using hydrologic models e g birkel et al 2011 tetzlaff et al 2014 2015a van huijgevoort et al 2016 for example for catchment m3 which is influenced by the additional contribution of water from a shallow spring source to discharge pass hp estimations ranged between 399 and 472 mm at field capacity and saturation respectively the pass q for this catchment was 617 mm table 2 assuming that the potential water storage capacity of the soils in this catchment were at saturation it can be assumed that the extra storage capacity provided by this catchment i e the storage added by the additional spring water contribution is the difference between the pass estimates yielded by these methods i e about 145 mm these results suggest the usefulness of both the pass q and pass hp methods for providing indirect pass groundwater estimations elsewhere 4 1 2 passive storage estimation in relation to other catchments a summary of the studies in which pass has been evaluated using different calculation methods in peat dominated catchments is shown in table 7 our estimated pass q values at the zeo 313 617 mm table 2 are similar to those reported by bishop et al 2011 via the modelling of soil properties at the gardsjön catchment in sweden 300 mm and soulsby et al 2009 2011 using tb methods in a group of montane scottish catchments 265 688 mm they attributed these relatively small storage values to the retention of water in the relatively shallow 2 m peat type soils with little deeply sourced water contributions from groundwater storage by contrast our estimates are low relative to peat dominated catchments in north sweden estimated using soil moisture modelling 1189 1485 mm by amvrosiadi et al 2017 they are also low in relation to the values reported by birkel et al 2011 estimated via tb methods and van huijgevoort et al 2016 estimated using a tb distributed hydrological model for the peat dominated girnock catchment in the scottish highlands 1000 and 898 mm respectively our values were also lower than those of non peat dominated catchments with different land covers e g pasture grasslands and forests in a gradient between the swiss plateau and alpine regions 5000 mm reported by staudinger et al 2017 despite the differences in catchment features e g precipitation seasonality land cover soil type and depth among the study sites investigated by these authors they all attributed these high pass q estimates to water storage in deep groundwater reservoirs that is the highly fractured and permeable parental material at the zeo prior research has shown that water stored in the peat type histosol soils i e wetlands controls runoff generation correa et al 2016 mosquera et al 2015 in addition other studies have also shown that water originated from these wetlands is the main contributor to runoff year round and that deeply sourced groundwater contributions to runoff are minimal correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a our pass q estimates similar to those in catchments with low groundwater storage availability and much lower than those in catchments with highly fractured geology evidence that these wetlands do not only control water production at the zeo but also the catchment s water storage capacity 4 1 3 how vegetation soils and precipitation control passive storage past research at the zeo has shown the importance of the wetlands i e histosols and cushion plants vegetation on the catchments water production correa et al 2017 2016 mosquera et al 2015 the high correlation between pass q and the wetlands cover in our nested system of catchments table 6 fig 4 suggests that the wetlands also influence the catchments available storage for mixing similar hydrologic dependence on wetlands storage has been reported at the scottish highlands e g birkel et al 2011 tetzlaff et al 2014 geris et al 2015a b geris et al 2017 these findings also confirm that for catchments with low groundwater contribution the totality of pass q depends on their areal proportion of wetlands additionally the strong correlation between pass q with the catchments mean annual discharge and runoff coefficients r2 0 73 table 6 further evidences how the wetlands storage influence runoff generation and regulation here it is worth noting that even though wetlands cover only a relatively small proportion of the monitored catchment areas i e 13 24 table 1 they control the catchments water production and storage at the zeo these findings highlight the importance and the fragility of riparian wetlands as the main and in this particular case the only water storage reservoir in ecosystems where the presence of peaty soil i e histosols dominates we also identified some pass variations among the monitored catchments worth highlighting for instance even though two of the smaller headwater catchments m1 0 20 km2 and m2 0 38 km2 have similar areal proportions covered by wetlands 13 15 the smallest catchment m1 showed a much larger pass q than m2 394 mm versus 313 mm respectively in contrast even though catchments m5 1 40 km2 and m6 3 28 km2 also have similar wetland coverage 20 22 they presented similar pass q 400 411 mm these apparent discrepancies likely result from differences in the catchments average slopes as a metric of topography for example the steepest topography of catchment m2 24 in relation to m1 14 is likely to explain the lowest pass q of catchment m2 on the contrary catchments m5 and m6 have similar slopes 18 20 table 1 factor that seems to explain the similar amount of water stored by these catchments similar findings have been reported on scottish peat dominated catchments by tetzlaff et al 2014 these authors reported that low gradient terrain produced poor drainage conditions thus ensuring high volumes of water retained in peaty soils throughout the year whereas steeper terrain that enhances hydraulic gradients allows an enhanced water movement thus reducing the amount of water stored in the soils this combination of factors influencing the catchments pass has also been reported at other sites with different soil types e g sidle et al 2001 lehmann et al 2007 detty and mcguire 2010 soulsby et al 2016 overall these findings evidence that that even though we did not find a direct relationship between the catchments average slopes and their pass q via correlation analysis catchments topography exerts controls in the amount of water available for internal mixing it is also worth noting that two of the upper catchments m3 and m4 fig 1 showed the highest pass q 617 and 539 mm respectively among all monitored catchments within the zeo also pass q of catchment m3 was almost double than that of m2 table 2 despite they both have the same catchment areas similar findings have been reported by birkel et al 2011 and soulsby et al 2011 for a group of montane scottish catchments with similar soil conditions these authors found that catchments with fractured and permeable geology showed much higher pass q than catchments with less weathered and more impermeable bedrock at the zeo catchments m3 and m4 showed the longest streamflow mtts mosquera et al 2016b and the highest baseflows mosquera et al 2015 among the monitored catchments as a result of a shallow spring water contribution to runoff i e from the weathered mineral horizon or the fractured shallow bedrock correa et al 2017 together these findings suggest that even when the hydrology of the zeo is dominated by water flowing in the shallow organic horizon of the páramo soils correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a the presence of fractured parental material as is the case in other páramo catchments pass q could be much higher than that estimated at the zeo outlet m7 457 mm 4 2 dynamic water storage at the catchment scale 4 2 1 long term dynamic storage the dynamics of the daily water storage volumes s t indicate a fast system response to precipitation inputs with positive i e recharge and negative i e discharge values oscillating around a value of zero during the monitoring period fig 2 such system dynamics resulted in relatively low long term dyns dyns lt with values ranging between 29 and 35 mm table 2 for all the catchments at the zeo these values were low compared with those reported by peters and aulenbach 2011 40 70 mm buttle 2016 30 77 mm and pfister et al 2017 107 373 mm at other ecosystems with more drainable soils than those of the páramo on the other hand staudinger et al 2017 found a wider range of values in swiss pre alpine and alpine catchments 12 974 mm where catchments with similar values than the zeo were rainfall dominated and with only minor groundwater contributions soulsby et al 2011 reported dyns lt values ranging between 2 and 36 mm in a group of montane scottish catchments with similar pedological and land cover conditions to our sites they concluded that values close to 36 mm corresponded to catchments with relatively compacted bedrock whereas values close to 2 mm corresponded to catchments with high groundwater contributions i e fractured parental material long term dynamic storage at the zeo was affected by the porosity and hydraulic conductivity contrast between the histosols and the andosols histosols presence was almost exclusively restricted to flat areas with low hydraulic gradients i e valley bottoms and flat hilltops consequently their water movement was reduced and restricted mostly to the shallow rooted organic horizons correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a in this sense our relatively small dyns lt estimates which likely result from the low available storage in the rooted zone of the organic horizon of the histosol soils that are near saturation along the year mosquera et al 2016a suggest minimal unused storage during runoff generation these findings are supported by our estimated dyns lt to pass q ratios for the zeo catchments these ratios also depicted that only a relatively small proportion of the water stored and available for mixing within the catchment is hydrologically active i e 6 to 10 is active in the water balance table 2 4 2 2 event based dynamic storage the anticlockwise hysteretic loop pattern between the normalized fractional storage sf and the normalized fractional discharge qf fig 3 identified at the event scale has also been determined by field observations elsewhere e g botter et al 2009 creutzfeldt et al 2014 beven and davies 2015 hailegeorgis et al 2016 modelling studies have also shown this behavior e g kirchner 2009 davies and beven 2015 the direction of the loop pattern has been shown to depend on different climatic topographic and parent material sproles et al 2015 at the zeo the observed anticlockwise trend is likely explained by the combined effect of the histosols wetlands high water retention capacity and the year round input of low intensity precipitation in other words when water is added at the beginning of the event it quickly fills the available storage before effective precipitation drives the runoff that is released to the streams then after antecedent moisture controlled storage threshold is reached mosquera et al 2016a the soils begin releasing water to streams black lines in fig 3a and b once precipitation ceases the moisture gained by the soils allows for a sustained stormflow generation until the end of the event grey line in fig 3a and b when the system returns to a stability condition i e sf 0 because of the high water retention capacity of the soils these findings further explain the rapid changes in daily s t volumes fig 2 and the flashy discharge response to precipitation previously reported at the zeo mosquera et al 2016b 2015 such behavior has also been reported by fovet et al 2015 in poorly drained riparian zones at a headwater catchment in france the consistent anticlockwise direction observed during all monitored events at all catchments at zeo further highlights the importance of the riparian histosols in streamflow generation at the zeo correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a 4 2 3 how vegetation soils and precipitation control dynamic storage in the long term the range of variation of dyns lt among catchments was very small 29 35 mm as a result we could not attribute their spatial variability to any particular catchment features or hydrometric variables on the other hand at the event scale dyns es showed significant correlation with maximum p intensity fig 5 this observation suggests that the amount of hydraulically active water linearly increases with rainfall intensity this effect likely results from the rapid filling of unsaturated pores in the shallow 30 40 cm organic horizon of the páramo soils which then augment the connectivity of saturated soil patches as precipitation intensity and amount increases tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 tetzlaff et al 2014 this effect causes a rapid activation of soil dyns which in turn results in a rapid delivery of water towards the stream network during rainfall events 4 3 a conceptual model of vegetation soils and precipitation controls on páramo water storage our findings can be conceptualized in the context of the celerity of the hydraulic potentials i e the propagation speed of a perturbation within the hydrologic system mcdonnell and beven 2014 beven and davies 2015 in the páramo soils and the tracer velocity through the hydrologic system combined hydrological behavior that influences the hydrological services provided by páramo catchments fig 6 shows how the rapid filling of available storage during rainfall events leads to rapid streamflow response i e the system celerity response this response behavior in combination with low evapotranspiration due to the high year round humidity 90 córdova et al 2015 helps maintain the near saturated conditions of significant portions of the páramo i e the histosol soils and wetlands thus precipitation translates to runoff quickly via shallow subsurface flow in the first 30 40 cm of the páramo soils mosquera et al 2016a and this in turn controls the water production capacity of páramo catchments as seen on the lefthand side of fig 6 the righthand side of fig 6 depicts the attenuation of the stable isotopic composition in streamflow in relation to precipitation isotopic composition mosquera et al 2016a which results from the relatively long time that water resides in the hydrologic system mosquera et al 2016b the relatively high pass values in the organic horizon of the soils at the zeo shows that the velocity of the system is regulated by the high water retention capacity of the páramo wetlands this retention capacity is maintained by the year round input of low intensity precipitation padrón et al 2015 this combination of factors control the water storage capacity and thus provide páramo catchments with a high water regulation capacity as shown on the righthand side of fig 6 as a result when precipitation intensities increase the system s celerity perturbation is enhanced and thus a rapid response minutes to hours of dyns occurs this effect occurs despite the efficient mixing of tracer in the larger available pass of the wetlands soils mosquera et al 2016a which further reduces the velocity of the hydrologic system weeks to months this velocity reduction in turn increases the residence time of the isotopic tracer within the catchments these findings highlight the vulnerability of páramo catchments to changes in the temporal variability of precipitation and the potential changes in hydropedological conditions of the páramo soils in response to changes in land use and climate for instance this catchment hydrological behavior could be significantly altered by the impact of common anthropic practices in the study region previous studies have shown that pine afforestation decreased water yield and potato cultivation declined baseflow production in páramo catchments buytaert et al 2007 similarly afforestation with pine plantations has shown to decline significantly organic carbon and the water retention capacity of páramo soils farley et al 2004 these changes likely reflect a reduction in the mtt of water within the hydrologic system due to a significant reduction of the systems passive storage effect that is likely to result in a reduction of the flow regulation capacity of páramo catchments finally it is worth highlighting the similarities of our catchment storage findings in comparison to those in other regions of the world e g the scottish highlands birkel et al 2011 soulsby et al 2009 tetzlaff et al 2015a van huijgevoort et al 2016 despite differences in meteorological conditions these similarities indicate that our findings can serve as a baseline for future water storage evaluations and could be transferable to other peat dominated ecosystems in the andes and elsewhere 5 conclusions our catchment storage evaluation using a combination of hydrometric isotopic and hydrophysical soil properties data yielded valuable insights into the water passive and dynamic water storage of the páramo we demonstrated that streamflow mean transit time mtt is useful for estimating catchment passive storage pass and these estimates are comparable with hydrophysical soil properties and soil water mtt based approaches together these estimates provide a novel approach to infer groundwater contributions to catchment storage we found that the hydrologically active dynamic storage dyns corresponded to only a small proportion 6 10 of the total pass capacity of the andean páramo wetlands that contribute to runoff generation our findings also indicate that the dyns and water production capacity of the catchments is mainly controlled by rainfall intensity in contrast pass and water regulation capacity is controlled mostly by the high water retention capacity of the peaty soils histosols these findings provide baseline information about the factors controlling the water production and regulation ecosystem services provided by the páramo future research should be targeted towards the investigation of the resilience of the andean páramo wetlands to sustain water production and regulation in response to changes in environmental conditions due to climate change and to better understand the role of hillslope soils i e andosols in the

6625,understanding how tropical montane catchments store and release water and the resulting water ecosystem services they provide is crucial for improving water resource management but while research in high elevation tropical environments has made progress in defining streamflow generation processes we still lack fundamental knowledge regarding water storage characteristics of catchments here we explore catchment storage and the factors controlling its spatial variability in seven páramo catchments 0 20 7 53 km2 in southern ecuador we applied a field based approach using hydrometeorological water stable isotopic and soils hydrophysical data from a 3 year collection period to estimate the passive pass and dynamic dyns storage of the catchments we also investigated relations between these storages and landscape and hydrometric variables using linear regression analysis pass estimates from hydrophysical soil properties and soil water mean transit times were consistent with estimates using streamflow mean transit times computed catchment pass and dyns for the seven watersheds were 313 617 mm and 29 35 mm respectively pass increased directly with the areal proportion of histosol soils and cushion plant vegetation wetlands dyns increased linearly with precipitation intensity importantly only 6 10 of the mixing storage of the catchments dyns pass was hydrologically active in their water balance wetlands internal to the catchments were important for pass where constant input of low intensity precipitation sustained wetlands recharge and thus the water regulation capacity i e year round water supply of páramo catchments our findings provide new insights into the factors controlling the water regulation capacity of páramo catchments and other peaty soils dominated

catchments is highly influenced by their capacity to store and release water mcnamara et al 2011 as such in the last decade there has been an increasing interest within the hydrological science community towards improving our understanding of catchment water storage hereafter referred to as catchment storage for instance the study of catchment storage has helped improve our general

et al 2011 have been applied in order to investigate these important feature of the hydrologic cycle among these the combination of techniques has proven to provide the most valuable insights into water storage in catchments staudinger et al 2017 the combination of wbb and tb methods for example has allowed for an indirect quantification of dynamic storage storage that is determined by the fluxes of water into and out of the catchment over a given period of time sayama et al 2011 hereafter referred as dyns and passive storage the subsurface volume of water stored within the catchment

and this remains an open question in hydrological science mcnamara et al 2011 most studies of catchment storage dynamics to date have been conducted in single catchments and using only one of the aforementioned storage quantification methods the few comparative studies have shown that soils and soil drainability play an important role on catchment storage on scottish peatland dominated catchments tetzlaff et al 2014 and canadian boreal wetland dominated catchments spence et al 2011 in contrast geology and topography have been observed to control storage dynamics in steep forested catchments with well drained soils in oregon usa hale et al 2016 mcguire et al 2005 bedrock geology has also been found to control catchment storage dynamics in 16 catchments in luxembourg pfister et al 2017 whereas catchment elevation controlled storage in 21 alpine swiss catchments as linked to snow versus soil water storage staudinger et al 2017 despite these recent efforts aimed at understanding storage and the factors controlling its dynamics in several parts of the world still there exist many remote and understudied regions such as the humid tropics where detailed wbb and tb information are usually lacking here we take advantage of a unique dataset of hydrometeorological and isotopic information collected in the nested system of headwater andean páramo catchments of the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory mosquera et al 2016a 2016b mosquera et al 2015 we present new wbb and tb storage estimations using these data in combination with detailed information on the biophysical features of the landscape e g soil type vegetation cover geology topography rainfall temporal variability and soils hydrophysical properties of the monitored catchments our overarching question for this work is how do vegetation soils and precipitation dynamics control passive and dynamic storage across catchments our specific research goals s are 1 to compare different pass calculation methods in order to validate the tb pass estimations 2 to quantify the pass and dyns of the catchments at different temporal scales event based to few years and 3 to examine whether catchment features if any control their pass and dyns information that is urgently needed to improve the understanding of the factors that control the water related ecosystem services i e water production and regulation provided by the páramo and the management of water resources of peat dominated catchments in tropical regions and elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory zeo located in south ecuador the zeo is situated on the western slope of the pacific atlantic continental divide within the andean mountain range the observatory expands over an altitudinal range between 3400 and 3900 m a s l fig 1 the climate is influenced by both atlantic and pacific regime crespo et al 2011 mean annual precipitation is 1345 mm with minimal seasonality rainfall is composed mainly of drizzle year round padrón et al 2015 mean annual temperature is 6 0 c and mean annual relative humidity is 90 at 3780 m a s l within the study site córdova et al 2015 the geomorphology is dominated by glaciated u shape valleys with an average slope of 17 most of the land surface 69 has slopes below 20 5 of the catchment has slopes 40 table 1 mosquera et al 2015 the geology of the observatory is composed of mostly volcanic rocks compacted by glacial activity coltorti and ollier 2000 two geologic formations dominate the site 1 the late miocene quimsacocha formation is composed of basaltic flows with plagioclases feldspars and andesitic pyroclastics and 2 the turi formation composed of tuffaceous andesitic breccias conglomerates and horizontal stratified sands the soils in the study area are mainly andosols and histosols iuss working group wrb 2015 these soils were formed by the accumulation of volcanic ash over the valley bottoms and low gradient slopes as a result of the cold humid environmental conditions they are black humic and acid soils rich in organic matter with high water storage capacity quichimbo et al 2012 andosols cover 76 of the observatory and are mainly found on the hillslopes while the histosols cover the remaining 24 and are found mainly in flat areas at valley bottoms and toe slope position mosquera et al 2015 vegetation at the study site is composed by cushion plants plantago rigida xenophyllum humile azorella spp mosses and lichens mainly covering the histosols tussock grass calamagrostis sp covers the andosols in the zeo as in most undisturbed páramo areas the areal proportion of histosol soils and cushion plants is strongly correlated r2 0 74 p 0 01 and have led to the formation of andean wetlands mosquera et al 2016a and hereafter we refer to them simply as wetlands 2 2 hydrometric information discharge precipitation amount and meteorological variables were recorded continuously from november 2011 to november 2014 discharge was measured in seven nested catchments it was measured using v notch weirs in catchments m1 m6 and a rectangular weir at the largest outlet catchment m7 fig 1 the weirs were instrumented with schlumberger pressure transducers with a precision of 5 mm water levels were recorded at a 5 minute resolution and transformed into discharge using the kindsvater shen relationship u s bureau of reclamation 2001 discharge equations were calibrated using constant rate salt dissolution measurements following moore 2004 even though the use of a single rain gauge for monitoring precipitation amounts is common in headwater catchments e g buttle 2016 cowie et al 2017 pearce et al 1986 safeeq and hunsaker 2016 sidle et al 1995 we used 4 hobo tipping bucket rain gauges with a resolution of 0 2 mm to capture the spatial variability of precipitation within the zeo sucozhañay and célleri 2018 fig 1 we selected these rain gauges since they have shown to provide optimal spatial distribution of precipitation within the zhurucay observatory with no bias and low mean daily precipitation errors 0 25 mm in comparison to the use of a dense network of rain gauges n 13 seminario 2016 we used the kruskal wallis test at a statistical significance level of 0 05 to evaluate differences among the 3 years rainfall data recorded by the 4 rain gages used in this study results from the test showed no significant differences p value 0 05 among the rainfall data as has been previously reported in nearby páramo areas buytaert et al 2006 we applied the thiessen polygon method to these data to estimate precipitation at each of our seven monitored catchments meteorological variables were also recorded using a campbell scientific meteorological station co located with the tipping bucket p1 fig 1 air temperature and relative humidity were recorded with a cs 215 probe protected with a radiation shield wind speed was recorded using a met one 034b windset anemometer and solar radiation was recorded with a cs300 apogee pyranometer we estimated reference evapotranspiration eto for each of our study catchments using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for this purpose we used the near surface air temperature lapse rate determined by córdova et al 2016 in a nearby páramo area to correct for differences in air temperature with elevation at each of our catchments no corrections for wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation were carried out considering the size of the study area 10 km2 and that these environmental variables have shown only limited influence on eto estimations within the study area córdova et al 2015 2 3 characterization of the soils hydrophysical properties given that the sampling of soils in the study area is labor intensive due to the harsh environmental conditions we selected three transects fig 1 to collect soil samples for soil properties analyses since the physiographic position along the landscape i e valley bottom toe slope lower slope middle slope upper slope and hilltop following fao 2009 schoeneberger et al 2012 has shown to influence the spatial variability of soil properties in the páramo guio blanco et al 2018 the transects were selected to capture this variability among physiographic positions within the catchment soil samples were collected at 45 sampling locations in total almost equally distributed every 150 m along the selected transects to capture the variability of the soil properties at different physiographic positions at each sampling location we characterized the soil depth soil types soil horizons organic and mineral and the thickness of each horizon as the presence of andosol and histosol soils dominates in our study area we used the criteria of the iuss working group wrb 2015 to classify their horizons types for both soil types the organic horizon corresponded to soils with organic matter contents higher than 5 and bulk densities lower than 0 90 g cm 3 whereas the mineral horizon presented organic matter contents lower than 5 and bulk densities higher than 0 9 g cm 3 additionally we collected three undisturbed soil samples of 100 cm3 using steel rings 5 cm diameter at each sampling location and soil horizon following collection the samples were saturated via capillary rise from a saturated sand support for analysis of the soil water tension water content θ relationships at saturation pf 0 and field capacity pf 2 54 at the soil hydrophysics laboratory of the university of cuenca the θ at saturation was obtained via gravimetry after the saturated samples were dried up in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and at field capacity via the ceramic plates system method usda and nrcs 2004 the θ values are reported as volumetric moisture cm3 cm 3 2 4 collection and analysis of isotopic data weekly water samples for oxygen 18 18o isotope analysis were collected for the period may 2012 may 2014 these samples were collected in streamflow precipitation and soil water grab samples in streamflow were collected at the same stations used for measuring discharge given the potential spatial variability of the isotopic composition of rainfall fischer et al 2017 water samples in precipitation were collected using two rain collectors located at 3780 and 3700 m a s l p1 and p2 in fig 1 respectively precipitation water samples were collected using circular funnels connected to polypropylene rain collectors covered with aluminum foil and with a 5 mm mineral oil layer to reduce evaporation of the stored water iaea 1997 once precipitation samples were collected the rain collectors were cleaned dried and the mineral oil replaced before their re installation soil water samples were collected using wick samplers installed at four locations 2 histosols and 2 andosols fig 1 the wick samplers were built with 9 5 mm diameter fiberglass wicks connected to a polypropylene container of 30 30 cm following boll et al 1991 1992 knutson et al 1993 one end of the wick was connected to the wick sampler and the other to a 1 5 l glass bottle where the soil water was collected and stored in order to collect the mobile soil water fraction landon et al 1999 we applied 1 m length of suction holder et al 1989 the wick samplers were installed at three depths at all soil water sampling stations in the histosols they were placed at 25 and 45 cm depths in the organic horizon and at 75 cm depth in the organic mineral horizons interface in the andosols they were placed at 25 and 35 cm depths in the organic horizon and at 65 cm depth in the shallowest part of the mineral horizon the wick samplers in the histosols were located in flat zones at the valley bottoms near the streams whereas in the andosols they were located at the middle and bottom parts of a hillslope rainfall and soil water samples were filtered using 0 45 µm filters in order to minimize organic matter contamination the collected water samples were stored in 2 ml amber glass bottles covered with parafilm and kept away from sunlight to minimize any fractionation by evaporation a cavity ring down spectrometer picarro l1102 i was used to measure the δ 18o isotopic composition of the water samples with a 0 1 precision to diminish the memory effect in the analyses penna et al 2012 and considering that this effect increases when samples from different water types e g precipitation streamflow soil water groundwater are analyzed together in individual runs we analyzed water samples of the same type in each run to minimize the memory effect in addition we applied six sample injections and discarded the first three as recommended by the manufacturer to further reduce this effect for the last three injections we calculated the maximum δ18o isotopic composition difference and compared it with the analytical precision given by the manufacturer and the standard deviation of the isotopic standards used for the analyses 0 2 for oxygen 18 samples that showed measurement differences larger than this value were re analyzed contamination of the isotopic signal was checked using chemcorrect 1 2 0 picarro 2010 this evaluation showed that only 3 soil samples 0 5 of the total were contaminated with organic compounds those samples were excluded from the analysis isotopic concentrations are presented in the δ notation and expressed in per mill according to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow craig 1961 2 5 soil water mean transit time mtt mean transit time is defined as the time it takes for a water molecule to travel subsurface in a hydrologic system mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 that is from the time it enters as precipitation or snow to the time it exists at an outlet point e g streamflow spring soil wick sampler or lysimeter the approach used to estimate soil water mtt was based on the lumped convolution method maloszewski and zuber 1996 which assumes a steady state condition of the flow system even though the steady state assumption has been criticized as an unrealistic catchment representation in a variety of environments the particular catchment features i e relatively homogeneous soil distribution and compact geology and low seasonal variation of hydrometeorological conditions at the zeo justify this assumption in our study catchment mosquera et al 2016b this method transforms the input tracer signal precipitation or snowmelt δin into the output tracer signal stream soils δout 1 δ o u t t 0 g τ w t τ δ i n t τ d τ 0 g τ w t τ d τ where τ is the integration variable representing the mtt of the tracer t τ is the time lag between the input and output tracer signals g τ is the transit time distribution ttd that describes the tracer s subsurface transport and w t is a recharge mass variation function the latter was applied to take into account the temporal variability in recharge rates by weighting the input isotopic composition based on precipitation amounts mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 as precipitation isotopic composition varies as a function of elevation within the study site the precipitation input signal for each catchment was corrected using the isotopic lapse rate determined for the zeo that is an increase of 0 31 in δ18o per 100 m decrease in elevation mosquera et al 2016a we used this isotopic lapse rate and the mean elevation of each study catchment to correct the weekly isotopic data obtained from our two rain gauges used to monitor the input isotopic signal in our study catchment mosquera et al 2016b we tested five ttds for the simulations the exponential model em exponential piston flow model epm the dispersion model dm małoszewski and zuber 1982 the gamma model gm kirchner et al 2000 and the two parallel linear reservoir model tplr weiler et al 2003 similarly to the findings of mosquera et al 2016b during the evaluation of streamflow mtts at the zeo the ttd that best represented the subsurface transport of water through the soils was the em therefore the soil water mtts reported below correspond to the estimations based on this ttd 2 6 passive storage estimations we define passive storage as 2 pass m t t i where i is the mean annual discharge over the period mtt was estimated for each catchment or soil horizon we estimated pass based on the streamflow mtts table 2 of the nested system of catchments reported by mosquera et al 2016b using the same methodology described in the section 2 5 and hereafter referred as pass q we also approximated the pass at the outlet of the basin m7 based on two additional methodologies in order to examine how much of the catchments pass q is represented by the soils the first approach was based on the soils hydrophysical properties hereafter referred as pass hp given the high water retention capacity of the páramo soils and the sustained year round rainfall at the study site padrón et al 2015 we assumed that their soil moisture content remained high and near saturation conditions throughout the year buytaert 2004 we also assumed that the contribution of the soils to the catchment pass should be between saturation and field capacity as such we used the θs at pf 0 saturation and pf 2 54 field capacity to estimate the water storage for each soil horizon at each of the positions where these soils hydrophysical properties were measured along the landscape as follows 3 pass hp j k θ j k d j k where pass hp represents the soil water storage and d the representative depth of the soil horizon j i e organic or mineral at position k across the landscape i e from valley bottom to hilltop where soil moisture θ at saturation or field capacity was measured using this approach and mapping the landscape surface that corresponded to the different positions k we estimated the water storage in the soils at each of these positions for the whole catchment for example for estimating the pass hp of the catchment at the middle of the slope we mapped the area of the whole catchment corresponding to a slope of 32 40 and with andosol soil type as indicated in table 3 the total catchment pass hp was then calculated as the sum of pass hp at all monitoring positions for both the organic and mineral horizons at saturation and field capacity the second approach was based on the soil water mtt estimations hereafter referred as pass s the average of the volume of water stored in the bottles used for the weekly collection of soil water samples was used to estimate the i discharge value in eq 2 this volume was converted to discharge by dividing it to the area of the samplers 30 cm 30 cm in this way we estimated the pass s for each soil type at each monitoring depth and position within the landscape given that the tracer signal at an outlet point within a catchment accounts for the mixing of all the flow paths above such points mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 this approach represents directly the storage of all the water draining down towards the outlet point consequently no further integration of different landscape units is needed this contrasts with the other alternative method where pass hp requires an integration of the water stored at different parts of the landscape 2 7 dynamic storage estimation the wbb volumes of water stored in the catchments were estimated for each day during the study period following sayama et al 2011 4 s t p t q t et a t where s t p t q t and eta t are the storage volume precipitation streamflow and actual evapotranspiration at time t respectively the long term dyns hereafter referred as dyns lt of the nested catchments was then defined as the difference between the maximum smax and the minimum smin daily storage volumes obtained from eq 3 over the period of analysis actual evapotranspiration was estimated as 5 et a f et o where eto is the potential evapotranspiration and f is a factor which was calculated as the result of the difference between p and q divided by eto i e p q eto for each catchment staudinger et al 2017 2 8 runoff events selection and variables we selected rainfall runoff events for the analysis of the temporal variability of dyns at the event scale hereafter referred as dyns es these events were defined as runoff response to rainfall inputs where discharge increased from below low flow values smakhtin 2001 below q35 non exceedance flow rates determined as low flows at the zeo mosquera et al 2015 to values higher than this threshold during the duration of the events we further used the minimum inter event time criteria defined as the minimum time lapse without precipitation between two consecutive events dunkerley 2008 to separate the precipitation time series into rainfall events given that at the study region rainfall occurs frequently and is sustained along the year padrón et al 2015 we selected a minimum inter event time of 6 hr to define independent events although rainfall runoff events were evaluated at all catchments only the results for the outlet of the catchment m7 are reported as similar trends for all catchments were found under these considerations 42 events were selected for the analysis at m7 for each event we evaluated the storage discharge hysteresis this was conducted by visual inspection of the plots of the normalized fractional storage sf and fractional discharge qf davies and beven 2015 these values are defined as the storage and discharge volumes as fractions of the pass q i e sf s pass q and qf q pass q respectively where s and q are the same as in eq 3 but estimated at 5 minute temporal resolution for the analysis at the event scale additionally we also estimated the cumulative q q cum cumulative p p cum cumulative eta eta cum the minimum mean and maximum rainfall intensity as well as the antecedent wetness conditions of the catchment represented as the amount of antecedent precipitation over different time periods 7 and 14 days before each event for each of the 42 events to investigate the influence of these hydrometeorological variables on dyns es 2 9 statistical analysis between storage and landscape hydrometric features we conducted a pearson linear correlation analysis between the estimates of pass q and dyns lt and different landscape features which included catchment area soil type vegetation cover geology and average slope of each catchment we also conducted a linear correlation analysis between pass q and dyns lt with hydrometric variables that included mean annual p mean annual q mean annual eta runoff coefficient q p and different non exceedance flow rates according to the catchment s flow duration curves the biophysical and hydrometric features of the catchments were obtained from mosquera et al 2015 table 1 at the event scale linear correlation analysis was used to investigate relations between dyns es with all the hydrometeorological variables estimated for the rainfall runoff events section 2 8 all correlations were evaluated using the determination coefficient r2 at a statistical significance level of 0 10 i e 90 confidence level using the t student test 3 results 3 1 catchment water passive storage 3 1 1 streamflow mtt based catchment passive storage estimations the pass q variation among the catchments was relatively large 304 mm these estimates varied from 313 to 617 mm with a value of 457 mm at the outlet of the basin m7 the maximum values were observed at catchments m3 and m4 while the minimum value at m2 table 2 3 1 2 hydrophysical soil properties based catchment passive storage estimations the hydrophysical properties of the soils i e θ at pfs 0 and 2 54 located at the different landscape positions and their areal extent within the zeo are presented in table 3 the histosols were only found at the valley bottom and toe slope positions their average thickness was 70 cm for the organic horizon and 50 cm for the mineral horizon histosols were normally found in low relief areas with slopes between 1 and 15 they presented the highest θs at saturation pf 0 for the organic 0 89 0 90 cm3 cm 3 and the mineral horizon 0 65 cm3 cm 3 the organic horizon of the histosols had significantly higher θs at field capacity pf 2 54 0 62 0 63 cm3 cm 3 in comparison to the mineral horizon 0 54 cm3 cm 3 the andosols on the other hand were found from the toe slope to the summit positions with slopes between 1 and 56 their thickness was more variable than for the histosols and ranged between 30 and 40 cm for the organic horizon and 20 30 cm for the mineral horizon the θ values at saturation of the organic horizon of the andosols 0 72 0 83 cm3 cm 3 were more variable than those of their mineral horizon 0 53 0 56 cm3 cm 3 for both horizons these values were significantly lower than for the histosols their θ values at field capacity for the organic horizon of these soils 0 62 0 69 cm3 mm 3 were more variable and higher than those for their mineral horizons 0 46 0 50 cm3 cm 3 the pass hp was variable among the different soil types and horizons at the different positions in the landscape table 3 the pass hp estimations using these soil properties and the spatial distribution and thickness of each soil horizon showed that the histosols stored a higher amount of water 711 mm at fc and 948 mm at saturation than the andosols 361 mm at fc and 420 mm at saturation table 4 integrating these pass hp values to the catchment scale using the areal proportions of the catchment covered by each soil type the pass hp at the outlet of the basin m7 were 445 mm at field capacity and 547 mm at saturation table 4 3 1 3 soil water mtt based catchment passive storage estimations soil water mtts for andosols and histosols at the three monitored depths are reported in table 5 the mtts in both soil types increased with depth mtts in the andosols were 35 and 48 days for the shallower organic horizons and 144 days for the organic mineral horizons interface mtts in the histosols were longer than in the andosols with values of 212 and 292 days for the shallower organic horizons and 338 days for the organic mineral horizon interface with these mtt values we estimated the pass s for each soil type at each monitoring depth table 5 andosols showed pass s values ranging between 14 and 49 mm with the highest contribution from the mineral horizon at 65 cm depth histosols showed higher pass s values similar to the soil water mtts these values increased with depth pass s was 191 and 263 mm at the shallower organic horizons and 304 mm at the organic mineral horizon interface at 65 cm depth based on the pass s values at each soil type and horizon the water storage was 97 mm for the andosols and 759 mm for the histosols 3 2 catchment water dynamic storage 3 2 1 long term dynamic storage estimations the catchments dyns lt ranged from 29 to 35 mm showing little differences among subcatchments 6 mm similar to the pass q catchments m3 and m4 showed the maximum values while the minimum value corresponded to m7 the fractions of dyns lt to pass q varied between 6 and 10 among the catchments table 2 fig 2 shows the daily temporal variability of the wbb catchments water storage volume the system showed a very flashy response of storage volume to precipitation but normally returned to a condition with s t of approximately 0 mm day 1 negative values s t 0 mm day 1 when the system loses or discharges higher amounts of water than the inputs and positive values s t 0 mm day 1 when the system gains or receives higher amounts of water than it discharges occurred at approximately the same frequency 53 and 47 respectively 3 2 2 event based dynamic storage estimations the 42 rainfall runoff events selected for the analysis represented a wide variety of hydrometeorologic conditions during the study period the p cum at the end of the events ranged between 0 2 and 56 0 mm with q cum varying between 1 2 and 52 8 mm eta cum between 0 1 and 16 6 mm and dyns es between 0 07 and 1 91 mm in addition maximum mean and minimum p intensities during the events were in the range of 0 6 22 3 mm h 1 0 1 5 4 mm h 1 and 0 to 1 1 mm h 1 respectively antecedent p for 7 and 14 days prior to the start of the events ranged between 2 6 and 68 5 mm and 15 8 113 3 mm the temporal variability of sf during the events was similar for all catchments a representative storm for the catchment m7 outlet is shown in fig 3 the event had a total duration of 50 h and during this period p cum and q cum were 32 2 and 32 3 mm respectively fig 3 shows that at the beginning of the event t0 the system was neither storing nor releasing water with sf 0 during the first 17 7 h t1 of the event 82 of the p cum entered to the system during this hydrograph rising limb black line in fig 3a the catchment both released water via q in response to the p inputs but was also dynamically recharged sf 0 mm thereafter and once rainfall intensity decreased the system continued to change from a diminished recharge state to a releasing water state until t2 at around 18 3 hr this period of water loss from the catchment was mostly linear the hydrograph peak t2 was mostly caused by contribution of the moisture from the recharged system rather than from precipitation inputs directly i e the black line in the negative region of the sf during the t1 t2 period in fig 3b after rainfall cessation the release of water from the catchment continued until t3 18 6 h at this point the hydrograph recession decreased linearly until the end of the event when the system again reached a stability condition sf 0 mm at 50 h tf the sf dynamics at the event scale formed an anticlockwise hysteretic loop all of the monitored events at all catchments followed the same hysteretic direction 3 3 relations between storage metrics and landscape features and hydrometric variables the pass q for our nested catchments was significantly positively correlated with mean annual q r2 0 73 p 0 07 runoff coefficient r2 0 75 p 0 06 and high flows represented by the q90 non exceedance flows r2 0 67 p 0 09 table 6 pass q was also significantly positively correlated with the cushion plants vegetation cover r2 0 68 p 0 08 and negatively correlated with the tussock grass vegetation cover r2 0 73 p 0 07 fig 4 even though similar correlation trends were found between the catchments pass q and their soils areal extent i e positive for the histosols and negative for the andosols these correlations were not statistically significant r2 0 55 p 0 15 the latter was most likely as a result of the higher uncertainty in the soil type distribution mapping of the zeo in relation to the vegetation distribution mapping that was better characterized directly in the field mosquera et al 2015 for the dyns lt estimations calculated from the daily wbb analysis we found statistically significant correlations with landscape and hydrologic variables however due to the small range of variation of dyns lt among catchments only 6 mm table 2 we acknowledge that these correlations may not be causal and thus do not report them on the short term when analyzing correlation between hydrometeorological variables and the dyns es during the events monitored at the outlet of the basin m7 we identified non significant correlations between this storage metric and most hydrometeorological variables r2 0 30 p 0 10 these variables included the p cum q cum eta cum mean and minimum p intensities and 7 and 14 days accumulated antecedent p the only significant correlation found was between the dyns es and the maximum p intensity during the events r2 0 91 p 0 001 fig 5 4 discussion hydrologic services provided by natural ecosystems help improve the well being of surrounding and downstream societies brauman et al 2007 however there is still an important knowledge gap regarding the relation between the eco hydrological behavior of catchments e g water storage and release and the hydrologic services e g water production and regulation that they provide sun et al 2017 our work presented here on how catchment storage influences the páramo water regulation capacity shows how highly organic and porous peaty páramo soils histosols and the local environmental conditions high humidity and year round low intensity precipitation interact to control the water regulation capacity of the ecosystem below we discuss key findings and contextualize our work with other sites where peaty soils dominate in the tropics and elsewhere 4 1 passive water storage at the catchment scale 4 1 1 comparison of passive storage estimation methods regarding the application of different methods for estimating the catchments pass capacity past investigations have yielded differing results e g brauer et al 2013 staudinger et al 2017 for instance at the girnock catchment in the scottish highlands several methods used to estimate the catchment s pass yielded different results these methods included the streamflow mtt based pass q soulsby et al 2009 a combination of distributed soil moisture and groundwater measurements and hydrologic modelling van huijgevoort et al 2016 bedrock geophysical surveys tetzlaff et al 2015a and tracer based hydrologic modelling birkel et al 2011 with the estimated pass values yielded amongst these methods varying within two orders of magnitude for this reason we first evaluated how our streamflow mtt based passive storage pass q estimations compared to those based on the monitoring of the soils hydrophysical properties pass hp and soil water mtts pass s the pass hp estimates for the catchment outlet m7 at field capacity and saturation 445 and 547 mm respectively table 4 showed a remarkable agreement with respect to the pass q estimate 457 mm table 2 for pass estimations based on the soil water mtts pass s landscape configuration affected the isotopic signal whereby the water from the andosols draining down the hillslopes was already mixed at the valley bottom wetlands mosquera et al 2016a tetzlaff et al 2014 as a result the storage estimations from the histosols added to the andosols storage the sum of the pass s estimations of the organic horizons of the histosols i e at 25 and 45 cm depth resulted in a total pass of 454 mm table 5 this values was also very similar to the pass q estimation these findings suggest that pass q provides accurate estimates of the total catchment pass and that catchment water storage capacity of the zeo outlet is effectively stored in the páramo soils consequently deep groundwater sources to runoff are minimal as has been hypothesized in past studies at the zeo correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a b these findings also suggest that the tracer signals from different parts of the catchments become well mixed within the valley bottom wetlands mosquera et al 2016b and that the integration of these signals provides accurate estimates of catchment passive storage streamflow based mtt has been used to estimate passive storage pass q in past investigations e g soulsby et al 2009 mcnamara et al 2011 tetzlaff et al 2015b hale et al 2016 staudinger et al 2017 but the accuracy of this method has been difficult to evaluate due the unobservable nature of large groundwater contributions to pass in these sense the zeo hydrologic conditions where we can exclude a groundwater component is an ideal site for investigating the accuracy of the pass q method given that the pass q estimations for the outlet of the catchment lie within those yielded by the potential storage of the soils i e the pass hp estimations at saturation and field capacity our results show that this method yields accurate catchment pass estimations in other catchments we hypothesize that through the combined application of both these methods indirect estimations of groundwater contributions can be obtained contributions that are still difficult to quantify in the field or are estimated with high uncertainty using hydrologic models e g birkel et al 2011 tetzlaff et al 2014 2015a van huijgevoort et al 2016 for example for catchment m3 which is influenced by the additional contribution of water from a shallow spring source to discharge pass hp estimations ranged between 399 and 472 mm at field capacity and saturation respectively the pass q for this catchment was 617 mm table 2 assuming that the potential water storage capacity of the soils in this catchment were at saturation it can be assumed that the extra storage capacity provided by this catchment i e the storage added by the additional spring water contribution is the difference between the pass estimates yielded by these methods i e about 145 mm these results suggest the usefulness of both the pass q and pass hp methods for providing indirect pass groundwater estimations elsewhere 4 1 2 passive storage estimation in relation to other catchments a summary of the studies in which pass has been evaluated using different calculation methods in peat dominated catchments is shown in table 7 our estimated pass q values at the zeo 313 617 mm table 2 are similar to those reported by bishop et al 2011 via the modelling of soil properties at the gardsjön catchment in sweden 300 mm and soulsby et al 2009 2011 using tb methods in a group of montane scottish catchments 265 688 mm they attributed these relatively small storage values to the retention of water in the relatively shallow 2 m peat type soils with little deeply sourced water contributions from groundwater storage by contrast our estimates are low relative to peat dominated catchments in north sweden estimated using soil moisture modelling 1189 1485 mm by amvrosiadi et al 2017 they are also low in relation to the values reported by birkel et al 2011 estimated via tb methods and van huijgevoort et al 2016 estimated using a tb distributed hydrological model for the peat dominated girnock catchment in the scottish highlands 1000 and 898 mm respectively our values were also lower than those of non peat dominated catchments with different land covers e g pasture grasslands and forests in a gradient between the swiss plateau and alpine regions 5000 mm reported by staudinger et al 2017 despite the differences in catchment features e g precipitation seasonality land cover soil type and depth among the study sites investigated by these authors they all attributed these high pass q estimates to water storage in deep groundwater reservoirs that is the highly fractured and permeable parental material at the zeo prior research has shown that water stored in the peat type histosol soils i e wetlands controls runoff generation correa et al 2016 mosquera et al 2015 in addition other studies have also shown that water originated from these wetlands is the main contributor to runoff year round and that deeply sourced groundwater contributions to runoff are minimal correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a our pass q estimates similar to those in catchments with low groundwater storage availability and much lower than those in catchments with highly fractured geology evidence that these wetlands do not only control water production at the zeo but also the catchment s water storage capacity 4 1 3 how vegetation soils and precipitation control passive storage past research at the zeo has shown the importance of the wetlands i e histosols and cushion plants vegetation on the catchments water production correa et al 2017 2016 mosquera et al 2015 the high correlation between pass q and the wetlands cover in our nested system of catchments table 6 fig 4 suggests that the wetlands also influence the catchments available storage for mixing similar hydrologic dependence on wetlands storage has been reported at the scottish highlands e g birkel et al 2011 tetzlaff et al 2014 geris et al 2015a b geris et al 2017 these findings also confirm that for catchments with low groundwater contribution the totality of pass q depends on their areal proportion of wetlands additionally the strong correlation between pass q with the catchments mean annual discharge and runoff coefficients r2 0 73 table 6 further evidences how the wetlands storage influence runoff generation and regulation here it is worth noting that even though wetlands cover only a relatively small proportion of the monitored catchment areas i e 13 24 table 1 they control the catchments water production and storage at the zeo these findings highlight the importance and the fragility of riparian wetlands as the main and in this particular case the only water storage reservoir in ecosystems where the presence of peaty soil i e histosols dominates we also identified some pass variations among the monitored catchments worth highlighting for instance even though two of the smaller headwater catchments m1 0 20 km2 and m2 0 38 km2 have similar areal proportions covered by wetlands 13 15 the smallest catchment m1 showed a much larger pass q than m2 394 mm versus 313 mm respectively in contrast even though catchments m5 1 40 km2 and m6 3 28 km2 also have similar wetland coverage 20 22 they presented similar pass q 400 411 mm these apparent discrepancies likely result from differences in the catchments average slopes as a metric of topography for example the steepest topography of catchment m2 24 in relation to m1 14 is likely to explain the lowest pass q of catchment m2 on the contrary catchments m5 and m6 have similar slopes 18 20 table 1 factor that seems to explain the similar amount of water stored by these catchments similar findings have been reported on scottish peat dominated catchments by tetzlaff et al 2014 these authors reported that low gradient terrain produced poor drainage conditions thus ensuring high volumes of water retained in peaty soils throughout the year whereas steeper terrain that enhances hydraulic gradients allows an enhanced water movement thus reducing the amount of water stored in the soils this combination of factors influencing the catchments pass has also been reported at other sites with different soil types e g sidle et al 2001 lehmann et al 2007 detty and mcguire 2010 soulsby et al 2016 overall these findings evidence that that even though we did not find a direct relationship between the catchments average slopes and their pass q via correlation analysis catchments topography exerts controls in the amount of water available for internal mixing it is also worth noting that two of the upper catchments m3 and m4 fig 1 showed the highest pass q 617 and 539 mm respectively among all monitored catchments within the zeo also pass q of catchment m3 was almost double than that of m2 table 2 despite they both have the same catchment areas similar findings have been reported by birkel et al 2011 and soulsby et al 2011 for a group of montane scottish catchments with similar soil conditions these authors found that catchments with fractured and permeable geology showed much higher pass q than catchments with less weathered and more impermeable bedrock at the zeo catchments m3 and m4 showed the longest streamflow mtts mosquera et al 2016b and the highest baseflows mosquera et al 2015 among the monitored catchments as a result of a shallow spring water contribution to runoff i e from the weathered mineral horizon or the fractured shallow bedrock correa et al 2017 together these findings suggest that even when the hydrology of the zeo is dominated by water flowing in the shallow organic horizon of the páramo soils correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a the presence of fractured parental material as is the case in other páramo catchments pass q could be much higher than that estimated at the zeo outlet m7 457 mm 4 2 dynamic water storage at the catchment scale 4 2 1 long term dynamic storage the dynamics of the daily water storage volumes s t indicate a fast system response to precipitation inputs with positive i e recharge and negative i e discharge values oscillating around a value of zero during the monitoring period fig 2 such system dynamics resulted in relatively low long term dyns dyns lt with values ranging between 29 and 35 mm table 2 for all the catchments at the zeo these values were low compared with those reported by peters and aulenbach 2011 40 70 mm buttle 2016 30 77 mm and pfister et al 2017 107 373 mm at other ecosystems with more drainable soils than those of the páramo on the other hand staudinger et al 2017 found a wider range of values in swiss pre alpine and alpine catchments 12 974 mm where catchments with similar values than the zeo were rainfall dominated and with only minor groundwater contributions soulsby et al 2011 reported dyns lt values ranging between 2 and 36 mm in a group of montane scottish catchments with similar pedological and land cover conditions to our sites they concluded that values close to 36 mm corresponded to catchments with relatively compacted bedrock whereas values close to 2 mm corresponded to catchments with high groundwater contributions i e fractured parental material long term dynamic storage at the zeo was affected by the porosity and hydraulic conductivity contrast between the histosols and the andosols histosols presence was almost exclusively restricted to flat areas with low hydraulic gradients i e valley bottoms and flat hilltops consequently their water movement was reduced and restricted mostly to the shallow rooted organic horizons correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a in this sense our relatively small dyns lt estimates which likely result from the low available storage in the rooted zone of the organic horizon of the histosol soils that are near saturation along the year mosquera et al 2016a suggest minimal unused storage during runoff generation these findings are supported by our estimated dyns lt to pass q ratios for the zeo catchments these ratios also depicted that only a relatively small proportion of the water stored and available for mixing within the catchment is hydrologically active i e 6 to 10 is active in the water balance table 2 4 2 2 event based dynamic storage the anticlockwise hysteretic loop pattern between the normalized fractional storage sf and the normalized fractional discharge qf fig 3 identified at the event scale has also been determined by field observations elsewhere e g botter et al 2009 creutzfeldt et al 2014 beven and davies 2015 hailegeorgis et al 2016 modelling studies have also shown this behavior e g kirchner 2009 davies and beven 2015 the direction of the loop pattern has been shown to depend on different climatic topographic and parent material sproles et al 2015 at the zeo the observed anticlockwise trend is likely explained by the combined effect of the histosols wetlands high water retention capacity and the year round input of low intensity precipitation in other words when water is added at the beginning of the event it quickly fills the available storage before effective precipitation drives the runoff that is released to the streams then after antecedent moisture controlled storage threshold is reached mosquera et al 2016a the soils begin releasing water to streams black lines in fig 3a and b once precipitation ceases the moisture gained by the soils allows for a sustained stormflow generation until the end of the event grey line in fig 3a and b when the system returns to a stability condition i e sf 0 because of the high water retention capacity of the soils these findings further explain the rapid changes in daily s t volumes fig 2 and the flashy discharge response to precipitation previously reported at the zeo mosquera et al 2016b 2015 such behavior has also been reported by fovet et al 2015 in poorly drained riparian zones at a headwater catchment in france the consistent anticlockwise direction observed during all monitored events at all catchments at zeo further highlights the importance of the riparian histosols in streamflow generation at the zeo correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a 4 2 3 how vegetation soils and precipitation control dynamic storage in the long term the range of variation of dyns lt among catchments was very small 29 35 mm as a result we could not attribute their spatial variability to any particular catchment features or hydrometric variables on the other hand at the event scale dyns es showed significant correlation with maximum p intensity fig 5 this observation suggests that the amount of hydraulically active water linearly increases with rainfall intensity this effect likely results from the rapid filling of unsaturated pores in the shallow 30 40 cm organic horizon of the páramo soils which then augment the connectivity of saturated soil patches as precipitation intensity and amount increases tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 tetzlaff et al 2014 this effect causes a rapid activation of soil dyns which in turn results in a rapid delivery of water towards the stream network during rainfall events 4 3 a conceptual model of vegetation soils and precipitation controls on páramo water storage our findings can be conceptualized in the context of the celerity of the hydraulic potentials i e the propagation speed of a perturbation within the hydrologic system mcdonnell and beven 2014 beven and davies 2015 in the páramo soils and the tracer velocity through the hydrologic system combined hydrological behavior that influences the hydrological services provided by páramo catchments fig 6 shows how the rapid filling of available storage during rainfall events leads to rapid streamflow response i e the system celerity response this response behavior in combination with low evapotranspiration due to the high year round humidity 90 córdova et al 2015 helps maintain the near saturated conditions of significant portions of the páramo i e the histosol soils and wetlands thus precipitation translates to runoff quickly via shallow subsurface flow in the first 30 40 cm of the páramo soils mosquera et al 2016a and this in turn controls the water production capacity of páramo catchments as seen on the lefthand side of fig 6 the righthand side of fig 6 depicts the attenuation of the stable isotopic composition in streamflow in relation to precipitation isotopic composition mosquera et al 2016a which results from the relatively long time that water resides in the hydrologic system mosquera et al 2016b the relatively high pass values in the organic horizon of the soils at the zeo shows that the velocity of the system is regulated by the high water retention capacity of the páramo wetlands this retention capacity is maintained by the year round input of low intensity precipitation padrón et al 2015 this combination of factors control the water storage capacity and thus provide páramo catchments with a high water regulation capacity as shown on the righthand side of fig 6 as a result when precipitation intensities increase the system s celerity perturbation is enhanced and thus a rapid response minutes to hours of dyns occurs this effect occurs despite the efficient mixing of tracer in the larger available pass of the wetlands soils mosquera et al 2016a which further reduces the velocity of the hydrologic system weeks to months this velocity reduction in turn increases the residence time of the isotopic tracer within the catchments these findings highlight the vulnerability of páramo catchments to changes in the temporal variability of precipitation and the potential changes in hydropedological conditions of the páramo soils in response to changes in land use and climate for instance this catchment hydrological behavior could be significantly altered by the impact of common anthropic practices in the study region previous studies have shown that pine afforestation decreased water yield and potato cultivation declined baseflow production in páramo catchments buytaert et al 2007 similarly afforestation with pine plantations has shown to decline significantly organic carbon and the water retention capacity of páramo soils farley et al 2004 these changes likely reflect a reduction in the mtt of water within the hydrologic system due to a significant reduction of the systems passive storage effect that is likely to result in a reduction of the flow regulation capacity of páramo catchments finally it is worth highlighting the similarities of our catchment storage findings in comparison to those in other regions of the world e g the scottish highlands birkel et al 2011 soulsby et al 2009 tetzlaff et al 2015a van huijgevoort et al 2016 despite differences in meteorological conditions these similarities indicate that our findings can serve as a baseline for future water storage evaluations and could be transferable to other peat dominated ecosystems in the andes and elsewhere 5 conclusions our catchment storage evaluation using a combination of hydrometric isotopic and hydrophysical soil properties data yielded valuable insights into the water passive and dynamic water storage of the páramo we demonstrated that streamflow mean transit time mtt is useful for estimating catchment passive storage pass and these estimates are comparable with hydrophysical soil properties and soil water mtt based approaches together these estimates provide a novel approach to infer groundwater contributions to catchment storage we found that the hydrologically active dynamic storage dyns corresponded to only a small proportion 6 10 of the total pass capacity of the andean páramo wetlands that contribute to runoff generation our findings also indicate that the dyns and water production capacity of the catchments is mainly controlled by rainfall intensity in contrast pass and water regulation capacity is controlled mostly by the high water retention capacity of the peaty soils histosols these findings provide baseline information about the factors controlling the water production and regulation ecosystem services provided by the páramo future research should be targeted towards the investigation of the resilience of the andean páramo wetlands to sustain water production and regulation in response to changes in environmental conditions due to climate change and to better understand the role of hillslope soils i e andosols in the

6626,high spatial resolution soil moisture information is important for hydrological climatic and agricultural applications the lack of high resolution soil moisture data over large areas at the

high spatial resolution from a few kilometres to sub kilometre scale however soil moisture information is rarely available at adequate spatial and temporal scales soil moisture is measured at scales ranging from point in situ measurements to satellite measurements at 10 s of km scale given the limited availability of dense ground based soil moisture monitoring networks in most areas satellite soil moisture products are considered a most feasible option to provide spatial and temporal soil moisture data microwave remote sensing has been widely used to estimate global scale surface soil

their coarse resolutions validating and downscaling satellite soil moisture products are crucial for their utilization in various applications for example extensive calibration and validation cal val activities pre and post launch of smap have been used to develop and improve the retrieval algorithms using in situ soil network measurements jackson et al 2014 the quality requirement of in situ data and the spatial mismatching between remotely sensed and in situ soil moisture posed great challenges for the validation of satellite soil moisture products colliander et al 2017a crow et al 2012

information data and model based approaches peng et al 2017 satellite based soil moisture downscaling methods consist of fusion of active and passive microwave retrievals das et al 2011 2014 2018 leroux et al 2016 and fusion of microwave data with optical or thermal datasets piles et al 2014 2016 2011 portal et al 2018 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 chauhan et al 2003 the downscaled soil moisture of the active passive microwave data fusion methods provides products with a moderate resolution since carlson et al 1994 introduced the universal triangle concept between soil moisture surface temperature and vegetation index efforts have been made to downscale satellite soil moisture products by introducing optical thermal data optical thermal based downscaling approaches provide higher resolution soil moisture products and perform well in arid and semi arid areas with high atmospheric evaporative demand peng et al 2017 therefore these methods have a high potential over the

feasibility of developing a time series record of high spatial resolution soil moisture by downscaling satellite soil moisture products using an in situ data based model the regression tree method developed here is similar to fang et al 2013 2018 and fang and lakshmi 2014 but based on in situ observations with additional factors fang et al 2013 and fang and lakshmi 2014 developed monthly lookup regressions using model derived δt and θμ modulated by the ndvi and then used this regression tree method to downscale amsr e and smos soil moisture products using modis lsts since global scale land surface models are not fully calibrated to specific sites these products can be associated with high uncertainties caused by scaling issues accuracy of the input data and the model algorithms chen et al 2014 for arid or semi arid landscapes with the extreme climate variability and the complex ecosystem global land surface modelled data can be subjected to high prediction errors and they may not be reliable reference data for representing actual soil conditions without rigorous calibration and validation to avoid the uncertainties and errors associated with the model derived estimates the study presented here employed a high quality reliable in situ observations of soil moisture and temperature over a long period from well designed and maintained monitoring sites described in section 2 2 1 to develop the downscaling model also the downscaling model was generalized over the study catchment area i e relative soil moisture variability to mean catchment soil moisture condition considering site specific soil characteristics as a modulating factor to explain the spatial variability and temporal stability of surface soil moisture in a semi arid region cosh et al 2008 chen et al 2014 as the first step smap enhanced 9 km and smos 25 km gridded soil moisture products were compared with in situ soil moisture observations and then a regression tree model was developed to downscale the satellite soil moisture products to 1 km resolution based on thermal inertia theory finally the reliability of the downscaled products was assessed using ground observations and an airborne soil moisture retrieval the study presented in this paper was undertaken in the goulburn river catchment located in the south eastern region of australia where significant efforts have been made to measure soil moisture through continuous in situ soil moisture monitoring network field based studies and remote sensing chen et al 2014 martinez et al 2007 panciera et al 2008 rüdiger et al 2007 2 study area and data 2 1 description of the study area the goulburn river catchment is located approximately 150 km northwest of sydney extending from 31 46 s to 32 51 s and from 149 40 e to 150 36 e fig 1 the goulburn river is a tributary of the hunter river in south eastern australia the catchment size is 7000 km2 and its elevation varies from 100 m on the floodplains to 1300 m in the northern and southern mountain ranges the northern and southern halves of the catchment can be distinguished both geologically and on the basis of land use land cover the northern half of the catchment is dominated with basalt derived soils while the southern part is dominated with sandstone conglomerate and shale derived soils the northern part has been cleared mainly for cropping and grazing whereas the southern part consists of dense vegetation with forests the distribution of clay silt and sand contents of the top soils in the catchment is shown in fig 2 the area exhibits a semi arid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 700 mm however the study catchment shows an increasing gradient in precipitation towards higher altitudes resulting in a range from 500 mm to 1100 mm the monthly mean temperatures vary from 16 c to 30 c in the summer and from 3 c to 17 c in the winter rüdiger et al 2003 this region has experienced a range of climatic events during the last 15 years including the millennium drought from 2001 to 2009 van dijk et al 2013 strong la niña conditions in 2010 11 boening et al 2012 and an extreme storm event with a 100 year return period pasha bulker storm in 2007

assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow sasmas project the study site has been heavily instrumented for soil moisture rainfall and runoff since 2002 rüdiger et al 2007 the monitoring stations were established to provide in situ data to validate amsr e soil moisture retrievals develop downscaling algorithms for coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products assimilate remotely sensed soil moisture data to retrieve soil moisture profile and to improve streamflow forecasting rüdiger et al 2003 national airborne field experiment 2005 nafe 05 airborne campaign was conducted in this area using l band radiometers to provide simulated smos observations for soil moisture while validating the amsr e near surface soil moisture products panciera et al 2008 this study is focused on two sub catchments the krui 562 km2 and merriwa 651 km2 river located in the northern half of the goulburn river catchment these sub catchments include a dense soil moisture monitoring network fig 1 and have been mostly cleared for cropping and grazing fig 3 a fig 3b shows the average seasonal vegetation density in 2015 as inferred by the modis ndvi composites over these two sub catchments the dense vegetation in the north and south most parts of the two sub catchments is evident in fig 3b the temporal dynamics of ndvi in the krui river catchment sasmas monitoring stations retrieved from the modis 16 day ndvi composites are shown in fig 4 a high variability of ndvi can be observed at stations in croplands i e k1 and k3 compared to the other stations which are in grazing areas k6 shows a consistently high ndvi value possibly due to the high vegetation growth driven by the higher rainfall 2 2 data this section discusses details on in situ soil moisture observations the satellite soil moisture products and other geospatial data used for developing the downscaling algorithm table 1 provides a summary of the datasets used in this study 2 2 1 in situ soil moisture observations twenty six soil moisture and temperature monitoring stations were established from 2002 over the goulburn river catchment under the sasmas project http www eng newcastle edu au sasmas sasmas sasmas htm the sasmas soil moisture monitoring stations were established in the representative time stable locations of their surrounding landscape so that they could adequately represent the watershed as whole and the footprint scale radiometric satellite soil moisture products after upscaling grayson and western 1998 rüdiger et al 2003 2007 crow et al 2012 these sites were carefully chosen by selecting mid slope locations with representative vegetation soil type elevation aspect etc rüdiger et al 2003 2007 during the nafe 05 an intensive field campaign had been carried out to support the l band airborne soil moisture observations this ground sampling had been conducted from very high resolutions 6 25 and 12 5 m spacing to intermediate resolutions from 125 m to 250 m spacing and coarse resolutions from 500 m and or 1 km spacing the nafe 05 data analysis showed the potential of using the sasmas dataset to validate coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products such as smos over the goulburn river catchment area panciera et al 2008 the sites have been instrumented with three vertically inserted campbell scientific cs616 water content reflectometers at soil depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm at each station stevens water hydraprobes were later installed to measure soil temperature at 25 mm and soil moisture of the top 5 cm soil layer at the monitoring stations rüdiger et al 2007 six monitoring stations were established in the krui river catchment k1 to k6 and seven in the merriwa river catchment m1 to m7 in addition seven monitoring stations s1 to s7 were established over a densely monitored micro catchment stanley with a catchment size of 175 ha located within the krui river catchment martinez et al 2007 fig 1 these monitoring stations are located over a range of soil types varying from sandy to clayey soils the land cover and soil texture of the sasmas stations in the krui and merriwa river catchments are shown in table 2 the in situ soil moisture data were measured at 1 min interval and averaged using 20 min time window the sasmas dataset is available from 2003 to 2015 but contains a number of data gaps these data gaps are caused mainly due to failure of sensors telemetry and erroneous readings caused by extremely dry weather conditions that resulted in soil cracking especially dominate in the clay soils in the northern parts of the sub catchments erroneous readings were recorded at some of the stations during this time due to sensors not remaining in contact with soils during dry periods and the cracks getting filled with water during wet periods the sasmas datasets are available up to 2015 the daily mean soil moisture data and hourly soil temperature data of the 0 5 cm soil profile from 2003 to 2014 were employed in this study to develop the regression algorithms the daily mean soil moisture data in 2015 from the krui merriwa and stanley stations were employed in the validation of satellite and downscaled soil moisture products details discussed in section 3 2 2 2 satellite soil moisture products the esa s smos mission launched in 2009 barré et al 2008 kerr et al 2010 and the nasa s smap launched in 2015 chan et al 2016 entekhabi et al 2010a are two l band missions which use 1 4 ghz radiometer frequencies with approximately 3 day revisit times both smap and smos provide near surface soil moisture 0 5 cm based on the l band penetration depth one major objective of the smap mission was to fuse the coarse resolution 40 km radiometric measurements with fine resolution 1 3 km radar measurements 1 26 ghz to produce soil moisture products at intermediate resolution 9 km entekhabi et al 2014 however only the radiometric soil moisture products of smap are available following the failure of the smap radar on 7th july 2015 smap radar based products are available for the first three months prior to the failure involving its high power amplifier hpa neeck 2015 combining sentinel 1 radar data with smap radiometric data is an approach employed as a solution to the smap radar failure das and dunbar 2018 the target accuracy of both smap and smos is 0 04 cm3 cm3 the accuracy of smap derived soil moisture has been demonstrated as 0 04 cm3 cm3 for both 36 km and 9 km gridded products chan et al 2016 2017 colliander et al 2017a smos has demonstrated its expected accuracy of 0 04 m3 m3 at some of the sites al bitar et al 2012 jackson et al 2012 however higher uncertainties in smos products have been observed in a number of other studies djamai et al 2015 pacheco et al 2015 niclòs et al 2016 despite their identical l band frequencies and spatial and temporal resolutions there are notable differences between smap and smos smos measures surface emissions from a large number of view angles from 0 to 55 whereas smap measures surface emissions only at a 40 angle entekhabi et al 2014 karthikeyan et al 2017b moreover smap measures brightness temperatures with a better sensitivity with a noise equivalent delta temperature nedt 1 k for 17 ms samples piepmeier et al 2017 compared to smos which has a sensitivity of 2 4 5 k corbella et al 2011 furthermore the smap and smos soil moisture

actual observation resolutions 2 3 other geospatial data 2 3 1 modis derived ndvi and lst products ndvi data over the krui and merriwa river catchments from 2003 to 2015 were obtained from modis aqua

catchments in 2015 and for the period of nafe 05 in 2005 2 3 2 soil and landscape grid national soil attributes maps the clay content in the 0 50 mm soil profile over the krui and merriwa river catchments was extracted from the national soil attributes maps of the soil and landscape grid of australia grundy et al 2015 this is a new soils database for australia released in late 2014 as a part of the globalsoilmap initiative it provides quantitative soil properties on a 90 m grid for all of australia the australian site data and spectroscopic estimates were used to develop the soil and landscape grid dataset the site data had been collected from 1931 to 2013 by the state and territory government agencies and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation s csiro national soil archive and national soil database natsoil to develop the national soil site data collection nssdc the spectroscopic estimates were made with the national soil visible near infrared database nsvnird to estimate soil properties by using the soil samples collected for the national geochemical survey of australia rossel et al 2015 the clay content at 0 5 cm soil profile was used in this study for the regression tree as a modulating parameter of δt θμ relationship data from 15 192 nssdc sites and 1113 nsvnird sites were used to develop the clay content maps in the soil and landscape grid of australia rossel et al 2015 the uncertainties of the clay content of the top 5 cm soil layer is 18 5 with 14 1 and 23 0 at lower and upper 90 confidence limits respectively rossel et al 2015 the dataset was obtained from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro data access portal https data csiro au 2 3 3 nafe 05 airborne dataset soil moisture retrievals from the nafe 05 panciera et al 2008 were used in this study to validate the downscaling algorithms the nafe 05 was conducted in november 2005 in the goulburn river catchment to provide simulated smos observations from an l band radiometer along with the soil moisture and other relevant ground observations the objectives of the experiment were to develop the smos soil moisture retrieval algorithms the smos downscaling approaches and the assimilation of smos into land surface models for root zone soil moisture estimations the regional airborne data collection was carried out in four consecutive mondays starting from 31st october 2005 over a 40 km 40 km area in the northern part of the catchment fig 5a the long drying period followed by the heavy rainfall on october 31st and november 1st allowed the nafe 05 campaign to observe near surface soil moisture observations ranging from fully saturated conditions to very dry conditions panciera et al 2008 this covered the area cleared for cropping and grazing in the krui and merriwa river catchments where the sasmas monitoring stations were concentrated while the south most part of the nafe 05 study area included forested areas with dense vegetation the polarimetric l band multibeam radiometer plmr was employed for the regional nafe 05 airborne data collection the 1 km nafe 05 soil moisture products were derived from plmr brightness temperatures using a two channel inversion of the l meb model panciera et al 2009 although the nominal ground resolution of the dataset is 1 km the pixel size varied from 860 to 1070 m due to the constant altitude of the flights above the median elevation over the varying terrain the average flight altitude was 3000 m above ground level agl and the data was acquired in the morning between 6 00 h and 10 00 h along north south orientated flight lines herein the term nafe 05 is used in this paper to refer to this regional airborne campaign 3 methods the methodology section consists of 1 evaluation and inter comparison of smap and smos products with in situ data 2 developing the regression tree model for downscaling and 3 evaluation of the downscaled soil moisture data with sasmas in situ and nafe 05 airborne observations the overall approach is summarized in the flowchart shown in fig 6 3 1 evaluation and inter comparison of smap e and smos soil moisture products with in situ data the sasmas in situ soil moisture data from the top 5 cm soil profile was employed to evaluate near surface soil moisture measurements from smap e and smos fig 5 shows the distribution of smap e 9 km and smos 25 km grids as well as the sasmas in situ monitoring stations over the study area location details of the pixels used in this evaluation process are given in table 3 the average of available in situ observations of the top 5 cm over the smap and smos satellite foot prints were used in this comparison note that the spatial averaging of limited in situ observations can also contribute to the potential error in this comparison this comparison was conducted over one smap e 9 km pixel x fig 5b and one smos 25 km pixel r fig 5c average soil moisture of three sasmas monitoring stations over the nominal 33 km contribution domain fig 5b of the smap e 9 km pixel x and two stations on smos 25 km pixel r fig 5c were employed in this comparison chan et al 2018 colliander et al 2018 has employed a similar approach to validate smap e products with core validation sites then the smos and smap e soil moisture products over the krui and merriwa river catchments in 2015 16 were compared against each other over the four smos 25 km pixels p q r and s fig 5c by interpolating smap e soil moisture to the smos 25 km grid centres this interpolation of smap e into smos grid centres allows to capture a near approximation of average soil moisture from the actual contributing domain of smap e 3 2 developing the downscaling model the downscaling method presented in this paper is based on the soil thermal inertia relationship between δt and θμ which has been demonstrated by fang et al 2013 2018 for multiple sites in united states we first discuss the thermal inertia theory and then present details on the regression tree model developed for this study thermal inertia is a measure of the resistance of an objects temperature to the changes in its surrounding temperature sellers 1965 the objects with high thermal inertia show a lower temperature change compared to the objects with low thermal inertia therefore a low thermal inertia of soil shows a high variation in the diurnal temperature and vice versa accordingly the relationship between the thermal inertia ti and δt can be given as engman 1991 1 δ t f 1 t i 2 δ t t pm t am where tpm and tam are the afternoon and early morning soil surface temperatures ti can also be defined as wang et al 2010 3 ti ρ k c where ρ is the bulk density kg m 3 k is the specific heat capacity j kg 1 k 1 and c is the thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 of the material water has a high specific heat capacity compared to the dry soil therefore the thermal inertia of wet soil is significantly higher than dry soil and exhibits lower diurnal temperature fluctuation when the moisture content of the soil is increasing the thermal inertia of the soil increases proportionally therefore wet soils exhibit low diurnal soil temperature difference compared to dry soils verstraeten et al 2006 the relationship between the diurnal soil temperature difference and the daily mean soil moisture is complex and modulated by the season vegetation density and the soil texture engman 1991 farrar et al 1994 peng et al 2017 sandholt et al 2002 a regression tree model was used to represent this complex relationship a basic regression tree algorithm typically produces a set of rules in a decision tree format which can be used to represent the correlation between the independent variable and the predictor variables under different conditions de ath and fabricius 2000 this approach does not require the assumption of a globally linear relationship nor a priori knowledge of the mathematical form of nonlinear curve fitting methods breiman et al 1984 the downscaling method employed here is similar to the nldas product based regression model developed by fang et al 2013 2018 and fang and lakshmi 2014 but with in situ data and additional factors in this study continuous long term in situ observations of soil moisture and temperature were used together with a time series of remotely sensed ndvi data to develop the regression tree models by season the in situ data from the sasmas network provided details on surface soil moisture change under different climatic conditions over the range of soil types soil texture information was also considered in the regression tree models given the spatial variation in edaphic characteristics for this semi arid study site and its implication for the spatio temporal surface soil moisture dynamics chen et al 2014 cosh et al 2008 in particular a large portion of the study area is covered by vertisols extensively swelling soils with high clay content this type of soil shows large structural and volumetric changes during wetting and this directly affects the soil water retention characteristics and near surface soil moisture rüdiger et al 2005 the soils were classified into two classes as heavy clays clay content 35 and other soils bonan 2015 the soil clay content was considered as a modulating factor based on the effect of soil texture on the thermal conductivity with thermal conductivity directly proportional to the thermal inertia engman 1991 the θμ and δt values of the top 5 cm soil profile at each monitoring station were calculated from the sasmas in situ dataset between 2003 and 2014 the δt values δt lstam lstpm were computed by using the lst difference between early morning and afternoon based on the approximate modis aqua day and night overpass times over the study area i e 01 30 lstam and 13 30 h lstpm the ndvi tucker 1979 was used in the regression tree model to account for the impact of vegetation density in modulating soil temperature and soil moisture the ndvi is defined as 4 ndvi n i r r e d n i r r e d where nir and red are the reflectance values from infrared and red bands respectively ndvi values vary from 1 to 1 with negative values representing water near zero values no vegetation cover e g bare lands and urban areas and values closer to 1 dense vegetation three ndvi classes were defined for the classification of the δt θμ regression model based on the vegetation density i e ndvi 0 4 grasslands or no vegetation 0 4 ndvi 0 6 abundant and vigorous vegetation and ndvi 0 6 dense and vigorous vegetation de alcântara silva et al 2016 the ndvi values at each station over the period of 2003 2014 were estimated by using modis 16 day ndvi composites myd13a2 1 km resolution lastly the four austral seasons spring from september to november summer from december to february autumn from march to may and winter from june to august were used to classify the regression tree in view of the seasonal impact to the δt θμ relationship in summary the entire δt θμ regression model was classified into 24 classes i e three ndvi classes two soil classes and four seasonal classes fig 7 a shows the regression tree developed for the austral spring the regression tree for the other seasons were similarly developed the modis aqua lst myd11a1 values over the krui and merriwa stations showed a strong linear relationship with the sasmas observations in 2015 with a r2 value of 0 74 at day time and 0 76 at night time the day and night time modis aqua lst myd11a1 values over sasmas in situ stations were compared against the top 5 cm sasmas in situ soil temperature values at approximate modis overpass times 13 30 h at day time and 01 30 h at night time consequently modis day time and night time lst values were bias corrected using a linear calibration with the sasmas observations and subsequently used to calculate δt values at 1 km spatial resolution the modis derived δt values were input into the regression tree to calculate respective θμ estimates at 1 km spatial resolution the ndvi and soil clay content values at each 1 km δt pixel were extracted from the modis 16 day ndvi composites and the soil and landscape grid national soil attributes maps respectively the coarse resolution soil moisture products θsat were thereafter downscaled to 1 km pixel p θds p as 5 θ ds p θ est p θ sat 1 n 1 n θ est p where θest p is soil moisture content estimated by the regression tree at the 1 km pixel p θsat the satellite soil moisture product where p is laid within its foot print and n is the total number of 1 km pixels p 1 n within the coarse resolution satellite pixel 3 3 evaluation of the downscaled products evaluation of the downscaled soil moisture products and algorithms consisted of two parts 1 assessing the accuracy of the downscaled products against the sasmas in situ observations during 2015 and 2 evaluating the consistency in spatial patterns between high resolution l band airborne soil moisture retrievals and the downscaled soil moisture estimates derived from the upscaled airborne soil moisture retrievals 3 3 1 validating the downscaled products with sasmas in situ observations the downscaled soil moisture products were compared with the sasmas in situ observations of the top 5 cm soil profile from k3 m6 and s3 stations in 2015 due to the limited data availability only a single station per downscaled pixel was compared hence subgrid scale spatial variability of soil moisture within a downscaled pixel could not be assessed however in situ soil moisture observations albeit the limited availability were assumed to be a reasonable representation of downscaled soil moisture products with the following reasons first sasmas soil moisture monitoring sites are able to represent their surrounding landscape since they were established at carefully chosen time stable locations see section 2 2 1 it is noteworthy to mention that the intensive field sampling conducted at the nafe 05 and the careful positioning of stations supported the potential of using sasmas data for upscaling to a large spatial extent to validate coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products without significant errors crow et al 2012 panciera et al 2008 rüdiger et al 2003 2007 second subgrid spatial variability within the downscaled pixel deemed to be rather small there existed very little difference in environmental factors e g land cover vegetation soil type topography meteorological factors that could contribute to large uncertainties in soil moisture within the spatial extent of downscaled pixel indeed a multiscale analysis by martinez et al 2007 demonstrated very little soil moisture variability at a fine 1 km2 spatial scale based on intensive field campaigns conducted in this area during nafe 05 lastly chen et al 2014 showed the temporal stability of the sasmas network sites using the hydrus 1d soil water model the sensitivity analyses revealed soil type and leaf area index as the key parameters affecting soil moisture variability through time the calibrated model to a single site was able to simulate soil water storage for closely located monitoring sites as well as for distant sites up to 30 km if spatially variable rainfall was allowed chen et al 2014 demonstrated the potential usefulness of continuous time point scale sasmas in situ observations and simulations for predicting the soil wetness status over a catchment of significant size up to 1000 km2 across scales note that relative metrics see section 3 3 3 were used in this validation process due to the low density of in situ soil moisture monitoring stations 3 3 2 validating the downscaling algorithms using nafe 05 airborne observations one major problem in validating downscaled soil moisture products with sparse in situ networks is the large spacing between the monitoring stations when in situ observations are used as reference observation to assess downscaled products several problems could arise from resolution cell representation station to station biases and consistency of data records colliander et al 2017b use of high spatial resolution airborne soil moisture observations as reference observations has been considered as a robust alternative approach to validate spatial downscaling methods colliander et al 2017b merlin et al 2008 piles et al 2009 wu et al 2017 due to unavailable resources the field experiment to collect a set of high resolution airborne soil moisture observations could not be conducted during the study period instead our downscaling algorithms were further tested with the nafe 05 airborne soil moisture dataset over the 40 km 40 km study area covering krui and merriwa river catchments as follows this is the only high resolution airborne soil moisture dataset available in our study area the 1 km resolution airborne soil moisture data were first upscaled by taking the spatial mean over the study area to simulate a coarse resolution satellite soil moisture pixel the aggregated soil moisture data were then downscaled to 1 km using the developed regression tree models eq 5 with modis derived ndvi and lst datasets if the lst datasets had significant spatial data gaps due to the clouds on the nafe 05 campaign days the lst data prior to or just after the campaign days were used assuming no significant variation in the daily soil moisture between adjacent dates then the spatial patterns of the downscaled soil moisture were compared against the nafe 05 1 km resolution airborne soil moisture data and the absolute difference between the two datasets was calculated for each day the region covered by the dense vegetation along the southern border of the nafe 05 study area was masked and excluded from this analysis fig 8 a the data from 31st october 2005 was not considered in this comparison due to the large data gaps caused by the cloud cover 3 3 3 performance metrics the rmse ubrmse coefficient of determination r2 pearson s correlation coefficient r and coefficient of variation cv were used as metrics in data comparisons these metrics are computed as entekhabi et al 2010b colliander et al 2018 6 r m s e i 1 n θ ds i θ obs i 2 n 7 u b r m s e i 1 n θ ds i θ ds θ obs i θ obs 2 n 1 where θobs i is the i th value of soil moisture observations in situ or airborne used in these comparisons as the true values θds i the i th value of the downscaled 1 km soil moisture products and n is the number of observations θ obs and θ ds are the means of observed and downscaled soil moisture respectively the r2 value r and cv are estimated as 8 r 2 1 θ i θ reg i 2 θ i θ 2 9 r 1 n 1 i 1 n θ ds i θ ds s ds θ obs i θ obs s obs 10 cv s θ where θreg i is the predicted soil moisture from a regression fit between θds and θobs sds and sobs are the standard deviations of downscaled and observed soil moisture values respectively the standard deviation s is estimated by 11 s i 1 n θ i θ 2 n 1 here θi is the soil moisture estimate at the i th observation i 1 n and θ is the spatial or temporal mean of the soil moisture estimates 4 results 4 1 comparison of coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products the comparisons between the in situ observations and satellite soil moisture products are shown in fig 9 fig 9a shows the agreement between smap e products and the sasmas in situ data at smap e pixel x fig 5b along with the daily precipitation measured at the k3 station the response of smap soil moisture to the precipitation is evident in fig 9 the smap e soil moisture product showed a good agreement with the in situ data at pixel x showing an ubrmse value of 0 051 and r2 values of 0 73 fig 9a however a slight underestimation was observed from the smap products when compared with the in situ data particularly during the drying stage chen et al 2017 also explain an underestimation bias in smap data especially in drying conditions possibly caused by the mismatch between the measuring depths of in situ sensors and l band penetration depths the smos soil moisture products showed a notable underestimation when compared against sasmas in situ observations fig 9b at pixel r fig 5c the temporal pattern of soil moisture i e climatology was reasonably captured by the smos products fig 9b an ubrmse of 0 056 cm3 cm3 with r2 value of 0 64 was found between smos 25 km gridded product and in situ data at this pixel the limited in situ observations along with the errors in spatial averaging and instrument errors in in situ data were also potential error sources in these comparisons between satellite soil moisture products and in situ observations the underestimation is less evident in smap compared to smos soil moisture products a number of studies have observed the same behaviour of a general under estimation with smos al bitar et al 2012 dall amico et al 2012 gherboudj et al 2012 cui et al 2017 dente et al 2012 pacheco et al 2015 niclòs et al 2016 some of the possible reasons for the smos underestimation can be identified as the l band penetration depth being less than 5 cm for wet soils ulaby et al 1986 inability to represent spatial heterogeneity at the coarser resolution in situ measurements overestimating the soil moisture systematic bias created by the retrieval algorithm and the erroneous ancillary data such as soil texture and land use al bitar et al 2012 the improved instrument design and algorithm of smap karthikeyan et al 2017b can also contribute to the better accuracy of smap the comparison between smos and smap e soil moisture products over the smos pixels p q r and s shows a reasonably good agreement with rmses of 0 089 0 075 0 072 and 0 072 cm3 cm3 r2 0 58 0 57 0 69 and 0 68 p values 0 001 for all cases over the smos 25 km pixels p q r and s respectively fig 10 4 2 development of the downscaling model the regression fits developed for the class with clay 35 and 0 4 ndvi 0 6 for austral summer and winter are shown in fig 7 i and ii around 20 000 δt θμ data pairs obtained from ten sasmas stations from 2003 to 2014 were used to develop the regression tree model based on the availability of reliable near surface 0 5 cm datasets the large sample size collected over different climate conditions was sufficient to capture the variability as required by the regression tree classification 4 3 validating the downscaled products with in situ data fig 11 a shows the comparison of the downscaled soil moisture products of smap e km and smos with the in situ observations at k3 m6 and s3 stations the top 5 cm soil moisture data were unavailable at the other sasmas stations in 2015 therefore the only option was to compare the downscaled data with the available in situ measurements although these three monitoring stations are laid within separate 1 km pixels the downscaled soil moisture estimates of the satellite products smap e and smos have captured the temporal variability of soil moisture with a good accuracy at all stations fig 11a at the m6 monitoring station the downscaled products showed a general underestimation compared to the in situ record lack of spatial representativeness of m6 station and instrument errors can be possible causes for this mismatch fig 11b shows the agreement between the in situ data and downscaled soil moisture estimates of smap e and smos products these downscaled smap e and smos soil moisture products showed average ubrmse values of 0 068 and 0 051 cm3 cm3 with average r2 values of 0 40 and 0 61 respectively table 4 shows a summary of the agreement between the sasmas in situ observations and the downscaled soil moisture product at stations k3 m6 and s3 downscaled smos products show better ubrmse values and high r2 against in situ data compared to the downscaled smap e products fig 12 illustrates the spatial variability of soil moisture over the krui and merriwa river catchments as captured by the smap e and smos soil moisture products and their downscaled counterparts on 28th june 2015 this epoch was selected due to little cloud cover of the modis lst scene when compared to the coarse resolution soil moisture products it is evident that the downscale products have captured the sub catchment level spatial variability of soil moisture at a much finer scale it can be seen that the wet pixels in the middle of the krui river catchment and the northern half of the merriwa river catchment fig 12 are closely related to the clay content of the soils fig 2a the increasing soil moisture gradient towards north driven by the precipitation patterns and soil texture is visible in the downscaled products the subpixel scale spatial patterns of smos and smap soil moisture are similar since these patterns are based on the soil moisture estimates derived from modis lsts 4 4 validating the downscaling algorithms with the nafe 05 airborne observations fig 13 a shows the distribution of the nafe 05 soil moisture data of the regional airborne campaign on 7th november 14th november and 21st november 2005 with corresponding downscaled soil moisture estimates soil moisture variability of 31st october 2005 was excluded in this figure due large data gaps caused by clouds the nafe 05 regional soil moisture datasets of the four subsequent campaign days showed spatial means of 0 44 0 36 0 16 and 0 14 cm3 cm3 with cvs of 0 32 0 37 0 63 and 0 60 respectively over the 40 40 km study area this clearly showed a drying trend from 7th november to 21st november 2005 the smap e soil moisture products show a mean value of 0 20 cm3 cm3 standard deviation of 0 07 cm3 cm3 over the nafe 05 study area during 2015 and 2016 the spatial average of the nafe soil moisture data in the 40 km 40 km study area over the 4 days showed a mean value of 0 27 cm3 cm3 standard deviation 0 15 cm3 cm3 this shows that the nafe 05 data shows slightly high soil moisture content compared to the soil moisture content as measured by the smap over the two years yet displaying the typical soil moisture conditions of the area the downscaled data showed mean soil moisture values close to the nafe 05 observations but with less variability fig 14 the response from the saturated clay soils and the surface runoff caused by the early morning precipitation events is a probable reason for the high variability in nafe 05 datasets the sasmas in situ data shows precipitation of 20 mm at s2 on 30th and 31st october 2005 this included light precipitation events 12 mm in the early morning of 31st october i e a couple of hours before the flight time this resulted in wet conditions on 31st october 2005 observed from the nafe 05 dataset in addition the precipitation events on 31st october 2005 table 5 caused large data gaps in the modis lst due to the dense cloud cover on this day a 12 mm precipitation event was also recorded at s2 on 5th november 2005 which explains the higher mean soil moisture values observed from the nafe 05 dataset compared to the average of the smap soil moisture products over this area during 2015 16 furthermore table 5 shows a general gradient of precipitation towards north across the nafe 05 study area this can be a possible reason for the higher soil moisture values in the northern part of the nafe 05 area compared to the southern part the response from surface runoff and soil saturation can also be identified as possible reasons for the extreme wet pixels in the nafe 05 dataset fig 13 shows a good agreement in the spatial patterns between nafe 05 data and downscaled soil moisture products the lower soil moisture values resulting from the high sand content in the southern part of the 40 km 40 km nafe 05 area i e the southern parts of the krui and merriwa river catchments and the high soil moisture values resulting from the high clay content in the mid regions of the two sub catchments fig 8b were evident in both downscaled and nafe 05 maps especially during the dry conditions on 21st november 2005 fig 13a this highlights soil texture as a dominant factor regulating spatial patterns of soil moisture in the study area this is compatible with the findings of martinez et al 2007 at the stanley catchment explaining that the wettest areas of the catchment are dominated by the clay soils the error maps shown in fig 13b illustrate the absolute error between observed and downscaled datasets of the nafe 05 the two datasets have a reasonable agreement showing an error 0 1 cm3 cm3 for more than 80 of the area on 7th and 14th november 2005 over 95 of the area shows an error less than 0 1 cm3 cm3 on 21st november 2005 under the dry conditions higher error values 0 1 cm3 cm3 can be seen in the wetter pixels possibly caused by higher precipitation in the northern part of the study area a better agreement can be seen between the two datasets with increasing catchment dryness figs 13 and 14 overall the comparison between nafe 05 and downscaled soil moisture datasets show an average rmse of 0 07 cm3 cm3 with r value of 0 4 5 discussion and conclusion this paper explored the feasibility of generating a time record of soil moisture at high spatial resolution 1 km using smap e 9 km and smos 25 km gridded satellite soil moisture products over two semi arid river catchments in the upper hunter region of new south wales australia the soil moisture and soil temperature dataset for the top 5 cm soil layer obtained from the in situ soil moisture network sasmas over the goulburn river catchment was used to develop a thermal inertia based regression tree model between δt and θμ the regression tree model was classified based on the modulating factors season vegetation density and soil texture the modis lst products were then used to estimate soil moisture at 1 km resolution from the coarse satellite products using the rule based regression tree model the accuracy of the downscaled soil moisture products was evaluated by using the sasmas in situ and the nafe 05 airborne datasets both smap e and smos soil moisture products showed a temporal change consistent with the precipitation smap e soil moisture showed an agreement with the in situ data of 0 051 cm3 cm3 ubrmse r2 0 73 which is slightly higher than the accepted smap accuracy of 0 04 cm3 cm3 the smos 25 km gridded product showed ubrmse of 0 056 cm3 cm3 r2 0 64 against in situ data the unavailability of evenly and densely distributed in situ stations over the smap e footprint are a major limitation of this comparison beside the measurement errors from the in situ sensors 0 03 cm3 cm3 soil cracking over the clay soils was a serious issue for the near surface 0 5 cm soil moisture monitoring in the dry periods the cracks caused sensors to be not in contact with the soils whereas after precipitation the soils get flooded and swelled this creates a challenge for maintaining near surface sensors and assuring the data quality for in situ observations the limited availability of in situ observations and the error in spatial averaging of in situ data over the satellite footprints are the main sources of errors in this comparison because of the limited availability of the top 5 cm soil moisture observations senanayake et al 2017 tested the proposed downscaling approach with the in situ data of 0 30 cm soil layer soil moisture and temperature data from five krui river catchment monitoring stations in 2015 1700 data pairs were employed in this work based on the premise that the daily mean of the near surface soil moisture 0 5 cm was closely related to the daily mean soil moisture of the 0 30 cm soil layer in the study area martinez et al 2007 this study showed an rmse of 0 14 cm3 cm3 when the downscaled data were compared against the in situ observations the downscaled soil moisture products of the smap e and smos showed ubrmses of 0 068 and 0 051 cm3 cm3 respectively with the sasmas in situ observations the accuracy of the coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products directly affects the accuracy of their downscaled counterparts it is noteworthy to mention that the average of the downscaled soil moisture products within a coarse resolution satellite footprint was the same as the original value of the coarse resolution satellite soil moisture product see eq 5 the errors in modis lsts wan 2008 and the uncertainties in clay content values rossel et al 2015 can also be identified as possible sources of errors lack of in situ network sites within 1 km pixel was a major limitation in validating the downscaled soil moisture products therefore presenting metrics for absolute soil moisture i e rmse and bias is invalid accordingly relative metrics were used in presenting the results of this validation i e ubrmse and correlation in addition nafe 05 data was also used in this study as a solution to lack of ground measurements for validation the downscaled soil moisture showed a good agreement with the spatial patterns shown by nafe 05 airborne campaign both nafe 05 and downscaled data shows the spatial patterns driven by soil texture the clay rich mid catchment areas of the krui and merriwa river fig 8b can be distinguished from the north and south most regions in the soil moisture maps fg 13a this agrees with the findings of the previous studies cosh et al 2008 cantón et al 2004 gómez plaza et al 2000 that have shown soil properties and vegetation as the main factors affecting soil moisture variability in semi arid regions the results show that the algorithms work well over both spatially and temporally dry conditions compared to wet conditions another major limitation of this downscaling method is the data gaps in modis lst occurred due to the cloud cover one possible approach to address this problem is by using the lst products from geostationary satellites oyoshi et al 2014 yamamoto and ishikawa 2018 although their spatial resolution is slightly coarser than modis lst products the high temporal resolution of the geostationary lst data allows the retrieval of close representations of tam and tpm the 4 km spatial and one hour temporal resolution of multi functional transport satellite mtsat 1r himawari 6 lsts can be shown as an example dataset of lst however use of geostationary satellites do not completely ensure to avoid data gaps along a day due to the presence of clouds piles et al 2016 have proposed a technique to improve the spatio temporal resolution of soil moisture from the synergy of smos and meteosat second generation msg spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri observations seviri is a geostationary orbit optical imaging radiometer on board the msg satellite soil moisture retrievals from smos with lst and fractional vegetation cover fvc products from the seviri have been employed in this approach in addition djamai et al 2016 proposed a method to estimate soil moisture at high resolution on cloudy days by combining the canadian land surface scheme class with dispatch model this involves interpolating the input data of class at high resolution by kriging and subsequent near surface soil moisture simulation and calibrating the class using the downscaled soil moisture from dispatch model another potential way of filling these data gaps caused by the cloud cover is using the persistent spatial patterns of soil moisture a number of researchers have studied the temporal persistence of soil moisture patterns vanderlinden et al 2012 brocca et al 2009 gómez plaza et al 2000 cosh et al 2008 however the spatial pattern of catchment soil moisture can be changed based on the factors such as precipitation pattern seasonal vegetation dynamics and mean catchment wetness famiglietti et al 2008 chen et al 2014 therefore comprehensive studies on time stability of soil moisture is required prior to such approach the methodology introduced in this study shows a good potential in producing a time series record of high resolution soil moisture over arid and semi arid regions future studies should be directed on further refining the regression algorithms by combining model derived datasets and other forcing factors 6 declarations of interest none acknowledgements this research was funded by the university of newcastle postgraduate research scholarship

6626,high spatial resolution soil moisture information is important for hydrological climatic and agricultural applications the lack of high resolution soil moisture data over large areas at the required accuracy is a major impediment for such applications this study investigates the feasibility of downscaling satellite soil moisture products to 1 km resolution this study was undertaken in the semi arid goulburn river catchment located in south eastern australia the soil moisture active passive smap enhanced 9 km l3smp e and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos 25 km gridded smos catds l3 sm 3 day radiometric products were compared with in situ soil moisture observations and a regression tree model was developed for downscaling based on thermal inertia theory observations from a long term soil moisture monitoring network were employed to develop a regression tree model between the diurnal temperature difference and the daily mean soil moisture for soils with different clay content and vegetation greenness moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land surface temperatures were used to estimate the soil moisture at high spatial resolution by disaggregating the satellite soil moisture products through the regression model the downscaled smap enhanced 9 km and smos 25 km gridded soil moisture products showed unbiased root mean square errors ubrmse of 0 07 and 0 05 cm3 cm3 respectively against the in situ data these ubrmses include errors caused by measuring instrument and the scale mismatch between downscaled products and in situ data an rmse of 0 07 cm3 cm3 was observed when comparing the downscaled soil moisture against the passive airborne l band retrievals the findings here auger well for the use of satellite remote sensing for the assessment of high resolution soil moisture keywords downscaling disaggregation soil moisture smap smos modis 1 introduction soil moisture is a key variable in a number of environmental processes at both regional and global scales including hydrologic climatic and agricultural applications such as water management and irrigation scheduling hanson et al 2000 pacheco et al 2015 weather and climatic prediction dirmeyer et al 2016 huszar et al 1999 orth and seneviratne 2014 drought monitoring lorenz et al 2017 pablos et al 2017 wang et al 2011 flood forecasting brocca et al 2017 lacava et al 2005 norbiato et al 2008 tramblay et al 2010 and analysing nutrient and contaminant transport potential dickinson et al 2002 porporato and rodriguez iturbe 2002 many of these applications require soil moisture data at high spatial resolution from a few kilometres to sub kilometre scale however soil moisture information is rarely available at adequate spatial and temporal scales soil moisture is measured at scales ranging from point in situ measurements to satellite measurements at 10 s of km scale given the limited availability of dense ground based soil moisture monitoring networks in most areas satellite soil moisture products are considered a most feasible option to provide spatial and temporal soil moisture data microwave remote sensing has been widely used to estimate global scale surface soil moisture over the last three decades karthikeyan et al 2017a kerr et al 2016 schmugge and jackson 1993 schmugge 1976 in particular passive microwave radiometer measurements in the l band frequency regime have been shown to be the best option to retrieve soil moisture schmugge et al 1986 recently satellite soil moisture retrieval from l band sensors has been realized with the launch of the european space agency s esa smos soil moisture and ocean salinity and the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap satellites in 2009 and 2015 respectively these satellites provide global estimates of surface soil moisture at the top 5 cm of the soil profile entekhabi et al 2010a karthikeyan et al 2017b kerr et al 2010 frequently 3 day

products kerr et al 2012 wigneron et al 2007 despite their high accuracy the satellite products cannot fully capture the spatial variability of soil moisture as required in many applications due to their coarse resolutions validating and downscaling satellite soil moisture products are crucial for their utilization in various applications for example extensive calibration and validation cal val activities pre and post launch of smap have been used to develop and improve the retrieval algorithms using in situ soil network measurements jackson et al 2014 the quality requirement of in situ data and the spatial mismatching between remotely sensed and in situ soil moisture posed great challenges for the validation of satellite soil moisture products colliander et al 2017a crow et al 2012 jackson et al 2014 the intensive cal val phase of the smap mission demonstrated the smap radiometer based soil moisture products meet their expected performance 0 04 m3 m3 from globally selected core validation sites colliander et al 2017a given the accuracy of passive l band microwave remote sensing downscaling these reliable satellite soil moisture products is a logical step to estimate soil moisture at the required spatial resolution for many applications peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 the available satellite soil moisture downscaling methods can be classified as satellite geo information data and model based approaches peng et al 2017 satellite based soil moisture downscaling methods consist of fusion of active and passive microwave retrievals das et al 2011 2014 2018 leroux et al 2016 and fusion of microwave data with optical or thermal datasets piles et al 2014 2016 2011 portal et al 2018 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 chauhan et al 2003 the downscaled soil moisture of the active passive microwave data fusion methods provides products with a moderate resolution since carlson et al 1994 introduced the universal triangle concept between soil moisture surface temperature and vegetation index efforts have been made to downscale satellite soil moisture products by introducing optical thermal data optical thermal based downscaling approaches provide higher resolution soil moisture products and perform well in arid and semi arid areas with high atmospheric evaporative demand peng et al 2017 therefore these methods have a high potential over the

2017 petropolous et al 2009 piles et al 2011 the disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change dispatch model proposed by merlin et al 2012 is one such method of downscaling microwave soil moisture retrievals using optical thermal data in this study moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products were used to derive land surface temperatures lsts at high spatial

the in situ soil moisture in the murrumbidgee river catchment merlin et al 2012 sabaghy et al 2018 fang et al 2013 and fang and lakshmi 2014 proposed a regression model to downscale the smos and the

and unbiased rmses ubrmse of 0 042 m3 m3 and 0 026 m3 m3 against ground observations from the soil monitoring networks fang et al 2013 the spatial data gaps due to cloud cover and impact of vegetation on optical thermal observations are two major limitations in the optical thermal data based downscaling methods peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 the study presented in this paper investigates the feasibility of developing a time series record of high spatial resolution soil moisture by downscaling satellite soil moisture products using an in situ data based model the regression tree method developed here is similar to fang et al 2013 2018 and fang and lakshmi 2014 but based on in situ observations with additional factors fang et al 2013 and fang and lakshmi 2014 developed monthly lookup regressions using model derived δt and θμ modulated by the ndvi and then used this regression tree method to downscale amsr e and smos soil moisture products using modis lsts since global scale land surface models are not fully calibrated to specific sites these products can be associated with high uncertainties caused by scaling issues accuracy of the input data and the model algorithms chen et al 2014 for arid or semi arid landscapes with the extreme climate variability and the complex ecosystem global land surface modelled data can be subjected to high prediction errors and they may not be reliable reference data for representing actual soil conditions without rigorous calibration and validation to avoid the uncertainties and errors associated with the model derived estimates the study presented here employed a high quality reliable in situ observations of soil moisture and temperature over a long period from well designed and maintained monitoring sites described in section 2 2 1 to develop the downscaling model also the downscaling model was generalized over the study catchment area i e relative soil moisture variability to mean catchment soil moisture condition considering site specific soil characteristics as a modulating factor to explain the spatial variability and temporal stability of surface soil moisture in a semi arid region cosh et al 2008 chen et al 2014 as the first step smap enhanced 9 km and smos 25 km gridded soil moisture products were compared with in situ soil moisture observations and then a regression tree model was developed to downscale the satellite soil moisture products to 1 km resolution based on thermal inertia theory finally the reliability of the downscaled products was assessed using ground observations and an airborne soil moisture retrieval the study presented in this paper was undertaken in the goulburn river catchment located in the south eastern region of australia where significant efforts have been made to measure soil moisture through continuous in situ soil moisture monitoring network field based studies and remote sensing chen et al 2014 martinez et al 2007 panciera et al 2008 rüdiger et al 2007 2 study area and data 2 1 description of the study area the goulburn river catchment is located approximately 150 km northwest of sydney extending from 31 46 s to 32 51 s and from 149 40 e to 150 36 e fig 1 the goulburn river is a tributary of the hunter river in south eastern australia the catchment size is 7000 km2 and its elevation varies from 100 m on the floodplains to 1300 m in the northern and southern mountain ranges the northern and southern halves of the catchment can be distinguished both geologically and on the basis of land use land cover the northern half of the catchment is dominated with basalt derived soils while the southern part is dominated with sandstone conglomerate and shale derived soils the northern part has been cleared mainly for cropping and grazing whereas the southern part consists of dense vegetation with forests the distribution of clay silt and sand contents of the top soils in the catchment is shown in fig 2 the area exhibits a semi arid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 700 mm however the study catchment shows an increasing gradient in precipitation towards higher altitudes resulting in a range from 500 mm to 1100 mm the monthly mean temperatures vary from 16 c to 30 c in the summer and from 3 c to 17 c in the winter rüdiger et al 2003 this region has experienced a range of climatic events during the last 15 years including the millennium drought from 2001 to 2009 van dijk et al 2013 strong la niña conditions in 2010 11 boening et al 2012 and an extreme storm event with a 100 year return period pasha bulker storm in 2007 mills et al 2010 the study site has been thoroughly studied in order to develop a better understanding of the land surface processes driving soil moisture variability under the scaling and assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow sasmas project the study site has been heavily instrumented for soil moisture rainfall and runoff since 2002 rüdiger et al 2007 the monitoring stations were established to provide in situ data to validate amsr e soil moisture retrievals develop downscaling algorithms for coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products assimilate remotely sensed soil moisture data to retrieve soil moisture profile and to improve streamflow forecasting rüdiger et al 2003 national airborne field experiment 2005 nafe 05 airborne campaign was conducted in this area using l band radiometers to provide simulated smos observations for soil moisture while validating the amsr e near surface soil moisture products panciera et al 2008 this study is focused on two sub catchments the krui 562 km2 and merriwa 651 km2 river located in the northern half of the goulburn river catchment these sub catchments include a dense soil moisture monitoring network fig 1 and have been mostly cleared for cropping and grazing fig 3 a fig 3b shows the average seasonal vegetation density in 2015 as inferred by the modis ndvi composites over these two sub catchments the dense vegetation in the north and south most parts of the two sub catchments is evident in fig 3b the temporal dynamics of ndvi in the krui river catchment sasmas monitoring stations retrieved from the modis 16 day ndvi composites are shown in fig 4 a high variability of ndvi can be observed at stations in croplands i e k1 and k3 compared to the other stations which are in grazing areas k6 shows a consistently high ndvi value possibly due to the high vegetation growth driven by the higher rainfall 2 2 data this section discusses details on in situ soil moisture observations the satellite soil moisture products and other geospatial data used for developing the downscaling algorithm table 1 provides a summary of the datasets used in this study 2 2 1 in situ soil moisture observations twenty six soil moisture and temperature monitoring stations were established from 2002 over the goulburn river catchment under the sasmas project http www eng newcastle edu au sasmas sasmas sasmas htm the sasmas soil moisture monitoring stations were established in the representative time stable locations of their surrounding landscape so that they could adequately represent the watershed as whole and the footprint scale radiometric satellite soil moisture products after upscaling grayson and western 1998 rüdiger et al 2003 2007 crow et al 2012 these sites were carefully chosen by selecting mid slope locations with representative vegetation soil type elevation aspect etc rüdiger et al 2003 2007 during the nafe 05 an intensive field campaign had been carried out to support the l band airborne soil moisture observations this ground sampling had been conducted from very high resolutions 6 25 and 12 5 m spacing to intermediate resolutions from 125 m to 250 m spacing and coarse resolutions from 500 m and or 1 km spacing the nafe 05 data analysis showed the potential of using the sasmas dataset to validate coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products such as smos over the goulburn river catchment area panciera et al 2008 the sites have been instrumented with three vertically inserted campbell scientific cs616 water content reflectometers at soil depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm at each station stevens water hydraprobes were later installed to measure soil temperature at 25 mm and soil moisture of the top 5 cm soil layer at the monitoring stations rüdiger et al 2007 six monitoring stations were established in the krui river catchment k1 to k6 and seven in the merriwa river catchment m1 to m7 in addition seven monitoring stations s1 to s7 were established over a densely monitored micro catchment stanley with a catchment size of 175 ha located within the krui river catchment martinez et al 2007 fig 1 these monitoring stations are located over a range of soil types varying from sandy to clayey soils the land cover and soil texture of the sasmas stations in the krui and merriwa river catchments are shown in table 2 the in situ soil moisture data were measured at 1 min interval and averaged using 20 min time window the sasmas dataset is available from 2003 to 2015 but contains a number of data gaps these data gaps are caused mainly due to failure of sensors telemetry and erroneous readings caused by extremely dry weather conditions that resulted in soil cracking especially dominate in the clay soils in the northern parts of the sub catchments erroneous readings were recorded at some of the stations during this time due to sensors not remaining in contact with soils during dry periods and the cracks getting filled with water during wet periods the sasmas datasets are available up to 2015 the daily mean soil moisture data and hourly soil temperature data of the 0 5 cm soil profile from 2003 to 2014 were employed in this study to develop the regression algorithms the daily mean soil moisture data in 2015 from the krui merriwa and stanley stations were employed in the validation of satellite and downscaled soil moisture products details discussed in section 3 2 2 2 satellite soil moisture products the esa s smos mission launched in 2009 barré et al 2008 kerr et al 2010 and the nasa s smap launched in 2015 chan et al 2016 entekhabi et al 2010a are two l band missions which use 1 4 ghz radiometer frequencies with approximately 3 day revisit times both smap and smos provide near surface soil moisture 0 5 cm based on the l band penetration depth one major objective of the smap mission was to fuse the coarse resolution 40 km radiometric measurements with fine resolution 1 3 km radar measurements 1 26 ghz to produce soil moisture products at intermediate resolution 9 km entekhabi et al 2014 however only the radiometric soil moisture products of smap are available following the failure of the smap radar on 7th july 2015 smap radar based products are available for the first three months prior to the failure involving its high power amplifier hpa neeck 2015 combining sentinel 1 radar data with smap radiometric data is an approach employed as a solution to the smap radar failure das and dunbar 2018 the target accuracy of both smap and smos is 0 04 cm3 cm3 the accuracy of smap derived soil moisture has been demonstrated as 0 04 cm3 cm3 for both 36 km and 9 km gridded products chan et al 2016 2017 colliander et al 2017a smos has demonstrated its expected accuracy of 0 04 m3 m3 at some of the sites al bitar et al 2012 jackson et al 2012 however higher uncertainties in smos products have been observed in a number of other studies djamai et al 2015 pacheco et al 2015 niclòs et al 2016 despite their identical l band frequencies and spatial and temporal resolutions there are notable differences between smap and smos smos measures surface emissions from a large number of view angles from 0 to 55 whereas smap measures surface emissions only at a 40 angle entekhabi et al 2014 karthikeyan et al 2017b moreover smap measures brightness temperatures with a better sensitivity with a noise equivalent delta temperature nedt 1 k for 17 ms samples piepmeier et al 2017 compared to smos which has a sensitivity of 2 4 5 k corbella et al 2011 furthermore the smap and smos soil moisture products use different retrieval algorithms model parameters some of the ancillary datasets e g land cover maps and assumptions al yaari et al 2017 karthikeyan et al 2017b for downscaling two

method in microwave radiometry chaubell et al 2016 have been used to retrieve maximum information from smap antenna temperatures and then converted into brightness temperatures chan et al 2018 o neill

aggregation of the l3 catds daily product the soil moisture retrievals were resampled onto a 25 km global equal area scalable earth grid ease grid kerr et al 2013 the smos 25 km grid is shown in fig 5c it is noteworthy to mention that the spatial resolutions of the smap and smos soil moisture products stated in this article i e smap e 9 km and smos 25 km are their grid posting resolutions not the actual observation resolutions 2 3 other geospatial data 2 3 1 modis derived ndvi and lst products ndvi data over the krui and merriwa river catchments from 2003 to 2015 were obtained from modis aqua

catchments was extracted from the national soil attributes maps of the soil and landscape grid of australia grundy et al 2015 this is a new soils database for australia released in late 2014 as a part of the globalsoilmap initiative it provides quantitative soil properties on a 90 m grid for all of australia the australian site data and spectroscopic estimates were used to develop the soil and landscape grid dataset the site data had been collected from 1931 to 2013 by the state and territory government agencies and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation s csiro national soil archive and national soil database natsoil to develop the national soil site data collection nssdc the spectroscopic estimates were made with the national soil visible near infrared database nsvnird to estimate soil properties by using the soil samples collected for the national geochemical survey of australia rossel et al 2015 the clay content at 0 5 cm soil profile was used in this study for the regression tree as a modulating parameter of δt θμ relationship data from 15 192 nssdc sites and 1113 nsvnird sites were used to develop the clay content maps in the soil and landscape grid of australia rossel et al 2015 the uncertainties of the clay content of the top 5 cm soil layer is 18 5 with 14 1 and 23 0 at lower and upper 90 confidence limits respectively rossel et al 2015 the dataset was obtained from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro data access portal https data csiro au 2 3 3 nafe 05 airborne dataset soil moisture retrievals from the nafe 05 panciera et al 2008 were used in this study to validate the downscaling algorithms the nafe 05 was conducted in november 2005 in the goulburn river catchment to provide simulated smos observations from an l band radiometer along with the soil moisture and other relevant ground observations the objectives of the experiment were to develop the smos soil moisture retrieval algorithms the smos downscaling approaches and the assimilation of smos into land surface models for root zone soil moisture estimations the regional airborne data collection was carried out in four consecutive mondays starting from 31st october 2005 over a 40 km 40 km area in the northern part of the catchment fig 5a the long drying period followed by the heavy rainfall on october 31st and november 1st allowed the nafe 05 campaign to observe near surface soil moisture observations ranging from fully saturated conditions to very dry conditions panciera et al 2008 this covered the area cleared for cropping and grazing in the krui and merriwa river catchments where the sasmas monitoring stations were concentrated while the south most part of the nafe 05 study area included forested areas with dense vegetation the polarimetric l band multibeam radiometer plmr was employed for the regional nafe 05 airborne data collection the 1 km nafe 05 soil moisture products were derived from plmr brightness temperatures using a two channel inversion of the l meb model panciera et al 2009 although the nominal ground resolution of the dataset is 1 km the pixel size varied from 860 to 1070 m due to the constant altitude of the flights above the median elevation over the varying terrain the average flight altitude was 3000 m above ground level agl and the data was acquired in the morning between 6 00 h and 10 00 h along north south orientated flight lines herein the term nafe 05 is used in this paper to refer to this regional airborne campaign 3 methods the methodology section consists of 1 evaluation and inter comparison of smap and smos products with in situ data 2 developing the regression tree model for downscaling and 3 evaluation of the downscaled soil moisture data with sasmas in situ and nafe 05 airborne observations the overall approach is summarized in the flowchart shown in fig 6 3 1 evaluation and inter comparison of smap e and smos soil moisture products with in situ data the sasmas in situ soil moisture data from the top 5 cm soil profile was employed to evaluate near surface soil moisture measurements from smap e and smos fig 5 shows the distribution of smap e 9 km and smos 25 km grids as well as the sasmas in situ monitoring stations over the study area location details of the pixels used in this evaluation process are given in table 3 the average of available in situ observations of the top 5 cm over the smap and smos satellite foot prints were used in this comparison note that the spatial averaging of limited in situ observations can also contribute to the potential error in this comparison this comparison was conducted over one smap e 9 km pixel x fig 5b and one smos 25 km pixel r fig 5c average soil moisture of three sasmas monitoring stations over the nominal 33 km contribution domain fig 5b of the smap e 9 km pixel x and two stations on smos 25 km pixel r fig 5c were employed in this comparison chan et al 2018 colliander et al 2018 has employed a similar approach to validate smap e products with core validation sites then the smos and smap e soil moisture products over the krui and merriwa river catchments in 2015 16 were compared against each other over the four smos 25 km pixels p q r and s fig 5c by interpolating smap e soil moisture to the smos 25 km grid centres this interpolation of smap e into smos grid centres allows to capture a near approximation of average soil moisture from the actual contributing domain of smap e 3 2 developing the downscaling model the downscaling method presented in this paper is based on the soil thermal inertia relationship between δt and θμ which has been demonstrated by fang et al 2013 2018 for multiple sites in united states we first discuss the thermal inertia theory and then present details on the regression tree model developed for this study thermal inertia is a measure of the resistance of an objects temperature to the changes in its surrounding temperature sellers 1965 the objects with high thermal inertia show a lower temperature change compared to the objects with low thermal inertia therefore a low thermal inertia of soil shows a high variation in the diurnal temperature and vice versa accordingly the relationship between the thermal inertia ti and δt can be given as engman 1991 1 δ t f 1 t i 2 δ t t pm t am where tpm and tam are the afternoon and early morning soil surface temperatures ti can also be defined as wang et al 2010 3 ti ρ k c where ρ is the bulk density kg m 3 k is the specific heat capacity j kg 1 k 1 and c is the thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 of the material water has a high specific heat capacity compared to the dry soil therefore the thermal inertia of wet soil is significantly higher than dry soil and exhibits lower diurnal temperature fluctuation when the moisture content of the soil is increasing the thermal inertia of the soil increases proportionally therefore wet soils exhibit low diurnal soil temperature difference compared to dry soils verstraeten et al 2006 the relationship between the diurnal soil temperature difference and the daily mean soil moisture is complex and modulated by the season vegetation density and the soil texture engman 1991 farrar et al 1994 peng et al 2017 sandholt et al 2002 a regression tree model was used to represent this complex relationship a basic regression tree algorithm typically produces a set of rules in a decision tree format which can be used to represent the correlation between the independent variable and the predictor variables under different conditions de ath and fabricius 2000 this approach does not require the assumption of a globally linear relationship nor a priori knowledge of the mathematical form of nonlinear curve fitting methods breiman et al 1984 the downscaling method employed here is similar to the nldas product based regression model developed by fang et al 2013 2018 and fang and lakshmi 2014 but with in situ data and additional factors in this study continuous long term in situ observations of soil moisture and temperature were used together with a time series of remotely sensed ndvi data to develop the regression tree models by season the in situ data from the sasmas network provided details on surface soil moisture change under different climatic conditions over the range of soil types soil texture information was also considered in the regression tree models given the spatial variation in edaphic characteristics for this semi arid study site and its implication for the spatio temporal surface soil moisture dynamics chen et al 2014 cosh et al 2008 in particular a large portion of the study area is covered by vertisols extensively swelling soils with high clay content this type of soil shows large structural and volumetric changes during wetting and this directly affects the soil water retention characteristics and near surface soil moisture rüdiger et al 2005 the soils were classified into two classes as heavy clays clay content 35 and other soils bonan 2015 the soil clay content was considered as a modulating factor based on the effect of soil texture on the thermal conductivity with thermal conductivity directly proportional to the thermal inertia engman 1991 the θμ and δt values of the top 5 cm soil profile at each monitoring station were calculated from the sasmas in situ dataset between 2003 and 2014 the δt values δt lstam lstpm were computed by using the lst difference between early morning and afternoon based on the approximate modis aqua day and night overpass times over the study area i e 01 30 lstam and 13 30 h lstpm the ndvi tucker 1979 was used in the regression tree model to account for the impact of vegetation density in modulating soil temperature and soil moisture the ndvi is defined as 4 ndvi n i r r e d n i r r e d where nir and red are the reflectance values from infrared and red bands respectively ndvi values vary from 1 to 1 with negative values representing water near zero values no vegetation cover e g bare lands and urban areas and values closer to 1 dense vegetation three ndvi classes were defined for the classification of the δt θμ regression model based on the vegetation density i e ndvi 0 4 grasslands or no vegetation 0 4 ndvi 0 6 abundant and vigorous vegetation and ndvi 0 6 dense and vigorous vegetation de alcântara silva et al 2016 the ndvi values at each station over the period of 2003 2014 were estimated by using modis 16 day ndvi composites myd13a2 1 km resolution lastly the four austral seasons spring from september to november summer from december to february autumn from march to may and winter from june to august were used to classify the regression tree in view of the seasonal impact to the δt θμ relationship in summary the entire δt θμ regression model was classified into 24 classes i e three ndvi classes two soil classes and four seasonal classes fig 7 a shows the regression tree developed for the austral spring the regression tree for the other seasons were similarly developed the modis aqua lst myd11a1 values over the krui and merriwa stations showed a strong linear relationship with the sasmas observations in 2015 with a r2 value of 0 74 at day time and 0 76 at night time the day and night time modis aqua lst myd11a1 values over sasmas in situ stations were compared against the top 5 cm sasmas in situ soil temperature values at approximate modis overpass times 13 30 h at day time and 01 30 h at night time consequently modis day time and night time lst values were bias corrected using a linear calibration with the sasmas observations and subsequently used to calculate δt values at 1 km spatial resolution the modis derived δt values were input into the regression tree to calculate respective θμ estimates at 1 km spatial resolution the ndvi and soil clay content values at each 1 km δt pixel were extracted from the modis 16 day ndvi composites and the soil and landscape grid national soil attributes maps respectively the coarse resolution soil moisture products θsat were thereafter downscaled to 1 km pixel p θds p as 5 θ ds p θ est p θ sat 1 n 1 n θ est p where θest p is soil moisture content estimated by the regression tree at the 1 km pixel p θsat the satellite soil moisture product where p is laid within its foot print and n is the total number of 1 km pixels p 1 n within the coarse resolution satellite pixel 3 3 evaluation of the downscaled products evaluation of the downscaled soil moisture products and algorithms consisted of two parts 1 assessing the accuracy of the downscaled products against the sasmas in situ observations during 2015 and 2 evaluating the consistency in spatial patterns between high resolution l band airborne soil moisture retrievals and the downscaled soil moisture estimates derived from the upscaled airborne soil moisture retrievals 3 3 1 validating the downscaled products with sasmas in situ observations the downscaled soil moisture products were compared with the sasmas in situ observations of the top 5 cm soil profile from k3 m6 and s3 stations in 2015 due to the limited data availability only a single station per downscaled pixel was compared hence subgrid scale spatial variability of soil moisture within a downscaled pixel could not be assessed however in situ soil moisture observations albeit the limited availability were assumed to be a reasonable representation of downscaled soil moisture products with the following reasons first sasmas soil moisture monitoring sites are able to represent their surrounding landscape since they were established at carefully chosen time stable locations see section 2 2 1 it is noteworthy to mention that the intensive field sampling conducted at the nafe 05 and the careful positioning of stations supported the potential of using sasmas data for upscaling to a large spatial extent to validate coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products without significant errors crow et al 2012 panciera et al 2008 rüdiger et al 2003 2007 second subgrid spatial variability within the downscaled pixel deemed to be rather small there existed very little difference in environmental factors e g land cover vegetation soil type topography meteorological factors that could contribute to large uncertainties in soil moisture within the spatial extent of downscaled pixel indeed a multiscale analysis by martinez et al 2007 demonstrated very little soil moisture variability at a fine 1 km2 spatial scale based on intensive field campaigns conducted in this area during nafe 05 lastly chen et al 2014 showed the temporal stability of the sasmas network sites using the hydrus 1d soil water model the sensitivity analyses revealed soil type and leaf area index as the key parameters affecting soil moisture variability through time the calibrated model to a single site was able to simulate soil water storage for closely located monitoring sites as well as for distant sites up to 30 km if spatially variable rainfall was allowed chen et al 2014 demonstrated the potential usefulness of continuous time point scale sasmas in situ observations and simulations for predicting the soil wetness status over a catchment of significant size up to 1000 km2 across scales note that relative metrics see section 3 3 3 were used in this validation process due to the low density of in situ soil moisture monitoring stations 3 3 2 validating the downscaling algorithms using nafe 05 airborne observations one major problem in validating downscaled soil moisture products with sparse in situ networks is the large spacing between the monitoring stations when in situ observations are used as reference observation to assess downscaled products several problems could arise from resolution cell representation station to station biases and consistency of data records colliander et al 2017b use of high spatial resolution airborne soil moisture observations as reference observations has been considered as a robust alternative approach to validate spatial downscaling methods colliander et al 2017b merlin et al 2008 piles et al 2009 wu et al 2017 due to unavailable resources the field experiment to collect a set of high resolution airborne soil moisture observations could not be conducted during the study period instead our downscaling algorithms were further tested with the nafe 05 airborne soil moisture dataset over the 40 km 40 km study area covering krui and merriwa river catchments as follows this is the only high resolution airborne soil moisture dataset available in our study area the 1 km resolution airborne soil moisture data were first upscaled by taking the spatial mean over the study area to simulate a coarse resolution satellite soil moisture pixel the aggregated soil moisture data were then downscaled to 1 km using the developed regression tree models eq 5 with modis derived ndvi and lst datasets if the lst datasets had significant spatial data gaps due to the clouds on the nafe 05 campaign days the lst data prior to or just after the campaign days were used assuming no significant variation in the daily soil moisture between adjacent dates then the spatial patterns of the downscaled soil moisture were compared against the nafe 05 1 km resolution airborne soil moisture data and the absolute difference between the two datasets was calculated for each day the region covered by the dense vegetation along the southern border of the nafe 05 study area was masked and excluded from this analysis fig 8 a the data from 31st october 2005 was not considered in this comparison due to the large data gaps caused by the cloud cover 3 3 3 performance metrics the rmse ubrmse coefficient of determination r2 pearson s correlation coefficient r and coefficient of variation cv were used as metrics in data comparisons these metrics are computed as entekhabi et al 2010b colliander et al 2018 6 r m s e i 1 n θ ds i θ obs i 2 n 7 u b r m s e i 1 n θ ds i θ ds θ obs i θ obs 2 n 1 where θobs i is the i th value of soil moisture observations in situ or airborne used in these comparisons as the true values θds i the i th value of the downscaled 1 km soil moisture products and n is the number of observations θ obs and θ ds are the means of observed and downscaled soil moisture respectively the r2 value r and cv are estimated as 8 r 2 1 θ i θ reg i 2 θ i θ 2 9 r 1 n 1 i 1 n θ ds i θ ds s ds θ obs i θ obs s obs 10 cv s θ where θreg i is the predicted soil moisture from a regression fit between θds and θobs sds and sobs are the standard deviations of downscaled and observed soil moisture values respectively the standard deviation s is estimated by 11 s i 1 n θ i θ 2 n 1 here θi is the soil moisture estimate at the i th observation i 1 n and θ is the spatial or temporal mean of the soil moisture estimates 4 results 4 1 comparison of coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products the comparisons between the in situ observations and satellite soil moisture products are shown in fig 9 fig 9a shows the agreement between smap e products and the sasmas in situ data at smap e pixel x fig 5b along with the daily precipitation measured at the k3 station the response of smap soil moisture to the precipitation is evident in fig 9 the smap e soil moisture product showed a good agreement with the in situ data at pixel x showing an ubrmse value of 0 051 and r2 values of 0 73 fig 9a however a slight underestimation was observed from the smap products when compared with the in situ data particularly during the drying stage chen et al 2017 also explain an underestimation bias in smap data especially in drying conditions possibly caused by the mismatch between the measuring depths of in situ sensors and l band penetration depths the smos soil moisture products showed a notable underestimation when compared against sasmas in situ observations fig 9b at pixel r fig 5c the temporal pattern of soil moisture i e climatology was reasonably captured by the smos products fig 9b an ubrmse of 0 056 cm3 cm3 with r2 value of 0 64 was found between smos 25 km gridded product and in situ data at this pixel the limited in situ observations along with the errors in spatial averaging and instrument errors in in situ data were also potential error sources in these comparisons between satellite soil moisture products and in situ observations the underestimation is less evident in smap compared to smos soil moisture products a number of studies have observed the same behaviour of a general under estimation with smos al bitar et al 2012 dall amico et al 2012 gherboudj et al 2012 cui et al 2017 dente et al 2012 pacheco et al 2015 niclòs et al 2016 some of the possible reasons for the smos underestimation can be identified as the l band penetration depth being less than 5 cm for wet soils ulaby et al 1986 inability to represent spatial heterogeneity at the coarser resolution in situ measurements overestimating the soil moisture systematic bias created by the retrieval algorithm and the erroneous ancillary data such as soil texture and land use al bitar et al 2012 the improved instrument design and algorithm of smap karthikeyan et al 2017b can also contribute to the better accuracy of smap the comparison between smos and smap e soil moisture products over the smos pixels p q r and s shows a reasonably good agreement with rmses of 0 089 0 075 0 072 and 0 072 cm3 cm3 r2 0 58 0 57 0 69 and 0 68 p values 0 001 for all cases over the smos 25 km pixels p q r and s respectively fig 10 4 2 development of the downscaling model the regression fits developed for the class with clay 35 and 0 4 ndvi 0 6 for austral summer and winter are shown in fig 7 i and ii around 20 000 δt θμ data pairs obtained from ten sasmas stations from 2003 to 2014 were used to develop the regression tree model based on the availability of reliable near surface 0 5 cm datasets the large sample size collected over different climate conditions was sufficient to capture the variability as required by the regression tree classification 4 3 validating the downscaled products with in situ data fig 11 a shows the comparison of the downscaled soil moisture products of smap e km and smos with the in situ observations at k3 m6 and s3 stations the top 5 cm soil moisture data were unavailable at the other sasmas stations in 2015 therefore the only option was to compare the downscaled data with the available in situ measurements although these three monitoring stations are laid within separate 1 km pixels the downscaled soil moisture estimates of the satellite products smap e and smos have captured the temporal variability of soil moisture with a good accuracy at all stations fig 11a at the m6 monitoring station the downscaled products showed a general underestimation compared to the in situ record lack of spatial representativeness of m6 station and instrument errors can be possible causes for this mismatch fig 11b shows the agreement between the in situ data and downscaled soil moisture estimates of smap e and smos products these downscaled smap e and smos soil moisture products showed average ubrmse values of 0 068 and 0 051 cm3 cm3 with average r2 values of 0 40 and 0 61 respectively table 4 shows a summary of the agreement between the sasmas in situ observations and the downscaled soil moisture product at stations k3 m6 and s3 downscaled smos products show better ubrmse values and high r2 against in situ data compared to the downscaled smap e products fig 12 illustrates the spatial variability of soil moisture over the krui and merriwa river catchments as captured by the smap e and smos soil moisture products and their downscaled counterparts on 28th june 2015 this epoch was selected due to little cloud cover of the modis lst scene when compared to the coarse resolution soil moisture products it is evident that the downscale products have captured the sub catchment level spatial variability of soil moisture at a much finer scale it can be seen that the wet pixels in the middle of the krui river catchment and the northern half of the merriwa river catchment fig 12 are closely related to the clay content of the soils fig 2a the increasing soil moisture gradient towards north driven by the precipitation patterns and soil texture is visible in the downscaled products the subpixel scale spatial patterns of smos and smap soil moisture are similar since these patterns are based on the soil moisture estimates derived from modis lsts 4 4 validating the downscaling algorithms with the nafe 05 airborne observations fig 13 a shows the distribution of the nafe 05 soil moisture data of the regional airborne campaign on 7th november 14th november and 21st november 2005 with corresponding downscaled soil moisture estimates soil moisture variability of 31st october 2005 was excluded in this figure due large data gaps caused by clouds the nafe 05 regional soil moisture datasets of the four subsequent campaign days showed spatial means of 0 44 0 36 0 16 and 0 14 cm3 cm3 with cvs of 0 32 0 37 0 63 and 0 60 respectively over the 40 40 km study area this clearly showed a drying trend from 7th november to 21st november 2005 the smap e soil moisture products show a mean value of 0 20 cm3 cm3 standard deviation of 0 07 cm3 cm3 over the nafe 05 study area during 2015 and 2016 the spatial average of the nafe soil moisture data in the 40 km 40 km study area over the 4 days showed a mean value of 0 27 cm3 cm3 standard deviation 0 15 cm3 cm3 this shows that the nafe 05 data shows slightly high soil moisture content compared to the soil moisture content as measured by the smap over the two years yet displaying the typical soil moisture conditions of the area the downscaled data showed mean soil moisture values close to the nafe 05 observations but with less variability fig 14 the response from the saturated clay soils and the surface runoff caused by the early morning precipitation events is a probable reason for the high variability in nafe 05 datasets the sasmas in situ data shows precipitation of 20 mm at s2 on 30th and 31st october 2005 this included light precipitation events 12 mm in the early morning of 31st october i e a couple of hours before the flight time this resulted in wet conditions on 31st october 2005 observed from the nafe 05 dataset in addition the precipitation events on 31st october 2005 table 5 caused large data gaps in the modis lst due to the dense cloud cover on this day a 12 mm precipitation event was also recorded at s2 on 5th november 2005 which explains the higher mean soil moisture values observed from the nafe 05 dataset compared to the average of the smap soil moisture products over this area during 2015 16 furthermore table 5 shows a general gradient of precipitation towards north across the nafe 05 study area this can be a possible reason for the higher soil moisture values in the northern part of the nafe 05 area compared to the southern part the response from surface runoff and soil saturation can also be identified as possible reasons for the extreme wet pixels in the nafe 05 dataset fig 13 shows a good agreement in the spatial patterns between nafe 05 data and downscaled soil moisture products the lower soil moisture values resulting from the high sand content in the southern part of the 40 km 40 km nafe 05 area i e the southern parts of the krui and merriwa river catchments and the high soil moisture values resulting from the high clay content in the mid regions of the two sub catchments fig 8b were evident in both downscaled and nafe 05 maps especially during the dry conditions on 21st november 2005 fig 13a this highlights soil texture as a dominant factor regulating spatial patterns of soil moisture in the study area this is compatible with the findings of martinez et al 2007 at the stanley catchment explaining that the wettest areas of the catchment are dominated by the clay soils the error maps shown in fig 13b illustrate the absolute error between observed and downscaled datasets of the nafe 05 the two datasets have a reasonable agreement showing an error 0 1 cm3 cm3 for more than 80 of the area on 7th and 14th november 2005 over 95 of the area shows an error less than 0 1 cm3 cm3 on 21st november 2005 under the dry conditions higher error values 0 1 cm3 cm3 can be seen in the wetter pixels possibly caused by higher precipitation in the northern part of the study area a better agreement can be seen between the two datasets with increasing catchment dryness figs 13 and 14 overall the comparison between nafe 05 and downscaled soil moisture datasets show an average rmse of 0 07 cm3 cm3 with r value of 0 4 5 discussion and conclusion this paper explored the feasibility of generating a time record of soil moisture at high spatial resolution 1 km using smap e 9 km and smos 25 km gridded satellite soil moisture products over two semi arid river catchments in the upper hunter region of new south wales australia the soil moisture and soil temperature dataset for the top 5 cm soil layer obtained from the in situ soil moisture network sasmas over the goulburn river catchment was used to develop a thermal inertia based regression tree model between δt and θμ the regression tree model was classified based on the modulating factors season vegetation density and soil texture the modis lst products were then used to estimate soil moisture at 1 km resolution from the coarse satellite products using the rule based regression tree model the accuracy of the downscaled soil moisture products was evaluated by using the sasmas in situ and the nafe 05 airborne datasets both smap e and smos soil moisture products showed a temporal change consistent with the precipitation smap e soil moisture showed an agreement with the in situ data of 0 051 cm3 cm3 ubrmse r2 0 73 which is slightly higher than the accepted smap accuracy of 0 04 cm3 cm3 the smos 25 km gridded product showed ubrmse of 0 056 cm3 cm3 r2 0 64 against in situ data the unavailability of evenly and densely distributed in situ stations over the smap e footprint are a major limitation of this comparison beside the measurement errors from the in situ sensors 0 03 cm3 cm3 soil cracking over the clay soils was a serious issue for the near surface 0 5 cm soil moisture monitoring in the dry periods the cracks caused sensors to be not in contact with the soils whereas after precipitation the soils get flooded and swelled this creates a challenge for maintaining near surface sensors and assuring the data quality for in situ observations the limited availability of in situ observations and the error in spatial averaging of in situ data over the satellite footprints are the main sources of errors in this comparison because of the limited availability of the top 5 cm soil moisture observations senanayake et al 2017 tested the proposed downscaling approach with the in situ data of 0 30 cm soil layer soil moisture and temperature data from five krui river catchment monitoring stations in 2015 1700 data pairs were employed in this work based on the premise that the daily mean of the near surface soil moisture 0 5 cm was closely related to the daily mean soil moisture of the 0 30 cm soil layer in the study area martinez et al 2007 this study showed an rmse of 0 14 cm3 cm3 when the downscaled data were compared against the in situ observations the downscaled soil moisture products of the smap e and smos showed ubrmses of 0 068 and 0 051 cm3 cm3 respectively with the sasmas in situ observations the accuracy of the coarse resolution satellite soil moisture products directly affects the accuracy of their downscaled counterparts it is noteworthy to mention that the average of the downscaled soil moisture products within a coarse resolution satellite footprint was the same as the original value of the coarse resolution satellite soil moisture product see eq 5 the errors in modis lsts wan 2008 and the uncertainties in clay content values rossel et al 2015 can also be identified as possible sources of errors lack of in situ network sites within 1 km pixel was a major limitation in validating the downscaled soil moisture products therefore presenting metrics for absolute soil moisture i e rmse and bias is invalid accordingly relative metrics were used in presenting the results of this validation i e ubrmse and correlation in addition nafe 05 data was also used in this study as a solution to lack of ground measurements for validation the downscaled soil moisture showed a good agreement with the spatial patterns shown by nafe 05 airborne campaign both nafe 05 and downscaled data shows the spatial patterns driven by soil texture the clay rich mid catchment areas of the krui and merriwa river fig 8b can be distinguished from the north and south most regions in the soil moisture maps fg 13a this agrees with the findings of the previous studies cosh et al 2008 cantón et al 2004 gómez plaza et al 2000 that have shown soil properties and vegetation as the main factors affecting soil moisture variability in semi arid regions the results show that the algorithms work well over both spatially and temporally dry conditions compared to wet conditions another major limitation of this downscaling method is the data gaps in modis lst occurred due to the cloud cover one possible approach to address this problem is by using the lst products from geostationary satellites oyoshi et al 2014 yamamoto and ishikawa 2018 although their spatial resolution is slightly coarser than modis lst products the high temporal resolution of the geostationary lst data allows the retrieval of close representations of tam and tpm the 4 km spatial and one hour temporal resolution of multi functional transport satellite mtsat 1r himawari 6 lsts can be shown as an example dataset of lst however use of geostationary satellites do not completely ensure to avoid data gaps along a day due to the presence of clouds piles et al 2016 have proposed a technique to improve the spatio temporal resolution of soil moisture from the synergy of smos and meteosat second generation msg spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri observations seviri is a geostationary orbit optical imaging radiometer on board the msg satellite soil moisture retrievals from smos with lst and fractional vegetation cover fvc products from the seviri have been employed in this approach in addition djamai et al 2016 proposed a method to estimate soil moisture at high resolution on cloudy days by combining the canadian land surface scheme class with dispatch model this involves interpolating the input data of class at high resolution by kriging and subsequent near surface soil moisture simulation and calibrating the class using the downscaled soil moisture from dispatch model another potential way of filling these data gaps caused by the cloud cover is using the persistent spatial patterns of soil moisture a number of researchers have studied the temporal persistence of soil moisture patterns vanderlinden et al 2012 brocca et al 2009 gómez plaza et al 2000 cosh et al 2008 however the spatial pattern of catchment soil moisture can be changed based on the factors such as precipitation pattern seasonal vegetation dynamics and mean catchment wetness famiglietti et al 2008 chen et al 2014 therefore comprehensive studies on time stability of soil moisture is required prior to such approach the methodology introduced in this study shows a good potential in producing a time series record of high resolution soil moisture over arid and semi arid regions future studies should be directed on further refining the regression algorithms by combining model derived datasets and other forcing factors 6 declarations of interest none acknowledgements this research was funded by the university of newcastle postgraduate research scholarship

6627,increasing pressure on river catchment water resources has heightened the need for real time monitoring data for water management agencies and users this study investigates the capability to develop a technical basis for water co management at the catchment scale a web application dashboard was created that displayed real time data for weather soil water river flow and water quality at high spatial and temporal resolutions including streamflow and rainfall forecasts a method to predict stream water temperature was developed and tested using an interactive table for visualisation of complex data the dashboard was used to provide information and alerting to water users in an agricultural catchment through the ringarooma water users group rwug in ne tasmania australia the dashboard was updated several times per day using telemetry and data platform services and accessed by rwug members mainly during periods of low flow when water extraction restrictions can be applied irrigators gained an improved understanding of streamflow behaviour in response to weather variability and water extractions and releases and developed abilities to voluntarily manage the water resource as three sub groups the department of primary industries parks water and environment dpipwe collaborated with the rwug in this adaptive management approach as enabled by the ringarooma river catchment water management plan and later informed a new ministerial policy for water resource management during extreme dry conditions group management was assisted by using alerts sent through the existing dpipwe text messaging service results showed that stakeholder understanding of technical information and scenario implications using the sensor based dashboard increased capacity of irrigators to make decisions that improve production and social outcomes while considering environmental values this study demonstrates that the information provided through the dashboard enabled a high level of

world wide concern hermanowicz 2008 australia is one of the major food producing and exporting countries in the world poddar et al 2014 and as in other countries adaptive water management has become critical as competition between water uses increases with the prospect of these tensions amplifying as human population grows and rainfall patterns change richter et al 2003 bowmer 2014 and monitoring is fragmentary hannah et al 2011 in all water management contexts there is an increasing demand for real time data to aid water management and to secure environmental values in the river from which the water is extracted at the scale of managing the water resource for a region or catchment developing management options requires an understanding of the needs of all users the biophysical context bowmer 2014 and the potential for management to influence water availability however these understandings are often lacking when water availability and data are limited water users also share concerns about the environmental values of rivers which can deteriorate with changes in flow regime poff et al 2010 with water being an essential natural resource many freshwater systems are directly

climate change reisinger et al 2014 is likely to exacerbate these declines in flows and increases in temperature stresses in australia and elsewhere increasing pressure on water resources combined with a decline in the health of aquatic systems has brought about a recognition that the aquatic environment is not a user of water in competition with other users rather it is the base of the

2010 there has been recent convergence between real time data technological improvements to wireless communication and data protocols and enhanced stakeholder engagement and community involvement through citizen science buytaert et al 2014 paul et al 2018 the use of real time information for water availability and management could potentially improve stakeholder communication and shared understanding about water availability and thereby increase capacity for adaptive local management 1 2 water management in tasmania tasmania has a relative abundance of water resources in comparison to many other parts of australia however it is facing similar pressures to those experienced nationally agricultural production which is an important part of tasmania s economy relies heavily on the state s water resources over 46 of the 2400 agriculture businesses in tasmania use irrigation compared with an average usage of 25 for australia australian bureau of statistics 2018 plans by the state government supported by the commonwealth government have been successful in increasing the area of land under irrigated agriculture in tasmania post et al 2012 with ongoing programs of new irrigation schemes kidd et al 2018 as demand on water resources increases in future there is likely to be a concurrent decrease in rainfall and increase in potential evaporation as a result of climate change nunez and mcgregor 2007 modelling of future water availability predicts that there may be an average decrease in surface water availability in tasmania of 5 post et al 2012 and up to a 14 reduction in total available catchment yield in the ringarooma catchment by 2030 dpipwe 2011a water resources in tasmania as for much of temperate mainland australia generally experience greatest pressure during summer when periods of low flow coincide with the highest domestic stock and agricultural water demand hardie et al 2012 all rivers and streams experience occasional events in which flow is severely reduced but increased abstraction and diversion for human use has seen the prevalence of these events increase in many areas dobson 2009 across northern and eastern tasmania where agricultural production is most developed water use is spatially localised and seasonally concentrated and water use and environmental values across catchments are consequently highly variable bobbi et al 2014 1 3 adaptive water management this study investigated approaches for water co management at the catchment scale co management is the sharing of responsibility between the government and local resource users berkes 2009 where polycentric governance can balance top down and bottom up pathways of influence huitema et al 2009 pahl wostl et al 2013 to bring increased efficiency reduced risk or boosted sustainability implementation of hydrological and agricultural sensors has reached a stage where research is needed not only on technical but also on sociocultural and governance factors mao et al 2018 which is essential for developing water co management using sensors sensor data management and hydrological modelling our objective was to build a water information website visualisations and alerting to inductively investigate how it was utilised by irrigators in an agricultural catchment improved communication by stakeholders of technical information including scenario implications may increase capacity to make decisions on when where and how to use water to improve production environmental and social outcomes 2 methods 2 1 description of the study area the ringarooma catchment in north eastern tasmania of 974 km2 has headwaters around mount maurice 1122 m above sea level dpipwe 2014 and flows in a north easterly direction for c 60 km to discharge into bass strait fig 1 the catchment has a diverse geology stronach and lampert 2003 with upper catchment areas of low productivity granodiorite and granite cenozoic basalts through much of the middle catchment supporting fertile soils before extensive coastal dune fields enclosing a ramsar wetland large areas of the upper ringarooma catchment are covered by native wet and dry sclerophyll forests brown 1996 and by plantation forests dpiw 2008 while a concentrated area in the middle catchment of 25 is intensively farmed primary farming activities are dairy and cropping dpipwe 2014 with dairy herds outside all year on irrigated pastures and crops including potatoes and licenced opium poppies the climate is classified as temperate marine with a mean annual rainfall of 1 100 mm varying from 600 mm in the north to 1 800 mm at higher elevations in the south the total mean annual rain water input into the ringarooma catchment is approximately 1 014 000 ml dpipwe 2010a the ringarooma river has a predictable seasonal flow regime with high flows over winter spring low summer flows and no cease to flow periods bobbi et al 2014 about 80 of the total annual runoff volume occurs during winter dpipwe 2010a while the main channel of the ringarooma river is unregulated there are more than 170 dams in the catchment with a total storage capacity of approximately 16 778 ml dpipwe 2011a plus a new dam of 6 500 ml and associated irrigation infrastructure that commenced operation during the project tasmanian irrigation 2013 water use and irrigation development to support agriculture has increased during recent decades dpipwe 2011a and the total allocation of water in the catchment for 2013 was estimated at c 32 500 ml dpipwe 2014 which is 12 8 of average annual water yield dpipwe 2014 based on data from 1970 to 2009 consumptive demand is highest during the summer autumn period dpipwe 2014 when rainfall is typically low on farm dams are generally refilled during winter spring protected environmental values pevs are the values or uses of the water body for which it is determined that any given area of that water body should be protected dpiwe 2005 these values must be set for all tasmanian surface waters including estuarine and coastal waters under the state policy on water quality management 1997 epa 2018 between 1999 and 2005 pevs were set for the dorset and break o day municipal areas which includes the ringarooma catchment through a series of community forums dpiwe 2005 identified pevs for the ringarooma catchment include the vulnerable aquatic species tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish astacopsis gouldi and a dwarf galaxiid galaxiella pusilla in the last decade substantial efforts have been taken to maintain and improve river health in the ringarooma catchment the ringarooma water users group rwug consists of a sub set of irrigators actively cooperating in water management for more than a decade with a good record of innovation and conflict resolution the community has undertaken substantial environmental work including willow removal river bank stabilisation re establishing riparian vegetation and fencing of riparian zones a management plan has been developed for the lower ringarooma ramsar wetlands ghd 2008 and a water management plan has been implemented for the catchment dpipwe 2014 2 1 1 water allocations all consumptive users of water within the ringarooma catchment must hold a water licence that includes an annual allocation of water with a defined probability of supply the issuing of which involves historical social economic and environmental factors licenced allocations fall into two types direct take where water is taken directly from the water source for immediate use and storage take where water is taken into storage for use at a later date dpipwe 2011b licenced allocations also specify a take period during which a volume is authorised to be taken direct take allocations are generally taken during the summer irrigation period 1 december 30 april while storage allocations are generally taken during the autumn winter spring period 1 may 30 november for storage in dams for later use during the irrigation season dpipwe 2011b a water licence may also specify a surety level for the allocation surety levels determine the priority of water allocation when water supplies cannot meet the requirements of all users dpipwe 2014 starting with restrictions for the lowest priority user group surety levels 1 4 are higher priority and include stock and domestic use public health fire fighting ecosystems and hydro electricity less essential licences include surety 5 for commercial purposes and non essential town water supplies by either direct irrigation onto crops or pasture or for storage and surety 6 for commercial purposes at lower levels of reliability than surety level 5 2 1 2 water restrictions restrictions used in water management in tasmania generally take the form of cease to take ctt provisions which are river flows below which water users are restricted in extracting water ctt provisions are based on environmental flow assessments which in tasmania have historically focussed on the minimum amount of stream flow i e minimum environmental flow required to maintain instream habitat for aquatic flora and fauna dpipwe 2010b these assessments based on a mix of different methodologies graham et al 2000 used models of the amount of habitat available for instream aquatic organisms such as macroinvertebrates and fish under different discharges then determined the breakpoint at which a rapid loss of habitat occurred dpipwe 2010b historical current and proposed future restrictions are based on discharge at the gauging station at the ringarooma river upstream of moorina road bridge fig 1 historically a trigger point for imposition of restrictions of 43 ml day was developed for this site but more recently a staged restriction was developed table 1 the ctt is usually implemented when the flow at the moorina flow gauge fig 1 has been below the trigger for three consecutive days the rate of rise and fall in river flow and pending rainfall patterns are also considered when implementing restriction management dpipwe 2011b 2 2 data compilation modelling and visualisation historical and real time data from a variety of sources were compiled and web pages developed that were available to water users to inform management trials extended over a summer season in 2015 16 which eventuated to be the worst short term drought in recent tasmanian history with ringarooma recording its lowest spring total rainfall since 1918 bureau of meteorology 2015 of 145 66 mm relative to an average of 309 8 mm 2 2 1 weather and soil moisture data observed weather data were accessed from several bureau of meteorology bom weather stations in and nearby the ringarooma catchment these mostly record rainfall only and none was fully automatic high frequency for other weather variables of interest to the study i e rainfall relative humidity air temperature and wind speed and direction potential evapotranspiration pet a calculated parameter was also of high interest to farmers the nearest bom weather station of this capacity was 14 km outside the catchment boundary hence as a priority the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro established two fully automatic weather stations and four recording rain gauges in the catchment fig 1 rainfall data were additionally sourced from a community weather station in the catchment spatial predictions of weather from the australian digital forecast database at a 3 hour frequency were also provided by bom values of pet started to be calculated from observations within the study using the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 which is also used by bom but late in the study both current and forecast pet became available from bom near the mineral banks station fig 1 soil water was measured at five depths at 30 min intervals and used to provide soil moisture real time data using cosmic ray and capacitance sensors calibrated against volumetric soil water measurements hawdon et al 2014 2 2 2 river discharge data and modelling river flow or discharge observations were provided by dpipwe from three pre existing gauges in the catchment at legerwood branxholm and moorina fig 1 and four more streamflow stations were added by csiro as part of this study at federal creek ringarooma new river and mineral banks fig 1 the sense t data platform sense t 2018 was utilized with frequency of data ingestion ranging from every 15 min to daily depending on the frequency of downloading from sensors using telemetry and the frequency of data transfer from intermediate third party platforms early in the project during trials smethurst et al 2015 farmers identified that the preferred unit of flow was ml day with which they were already familiar such as from use of the ctt rates table 1 this unit for flow was used at daily and sub daily time steps historical data were used to develop models for predicting river discharge at two points in the catchment including moorina fig 1 which has over four decades of river gauge records and is the location of regulation keast and ellison 2013 the developed models were based on deterministic welsh et al 2013 ewater 2018 and machine learning methods using recurrent neural networks mhammedi et al 2016 during the project daily flow predictions also became available from bom for flow sub daily predictions went ahead for 1 day and daily predictions went ahead for 5 days although several types of flow predictions were available an evaluation by project participants decided that daily at moorina and branxholm and sub daily moorina flow predictions by machine learning methods best suited their needs at moorina dpipwe has the option of declaring a ctt for the catchment if flow rates go below a prescribed level set to protect environmental values table 1 but adaptive management as described in the water management plan and ministerial policy allows some flexibility about exercising this option adaptive management could be best provided using real time data and predictions though with prediction services in the study being reliant on data from external and internal sources delays occurred when data were not available 2 2 3 water quality monitoring and temperature prediction model water quality data temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were together monitored by utas dpipwe and csiro employing spot sampling short term deployment of water quality sensors and the establishment of fully telemetered continuous water quality monitoring sensors at the pre existing gauges at branxholm and upstream of moorina fig 1 fully telemetered continuous water quality monitoring sensors were established to monitor electrical conductivity temperature and dissolved oxygen parameters were monitored at 15 min intervals with the data telemetered to the sense t data cloud hourly via a dpipwe data platform at the four telemetered hydrological stations installed and managed by csiro fig 1 equipment used were water level and temperature loggers model 3001 levellogger solinst ltd georgetown canada compensated for barometric pressure with a solinst barologger and also measured with the doppler sensor sontek iq plus sontek san diego usa for water quality parameters of temperature ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen equipment used were pentair mp47 3000 multiparameter sensors installed and managed by utas and deployed at the dpipwe gauging stations at moorina and branxholm spot sampling was conducted using a hand held wtw multiprobe 3320 s provided by nrm north utas and dpipwe to provide in situ field measurements of temperature ph electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen and turbidity at 11 sites this sampling was undertaken to validate sensor monitoring sonde as well as to provide an indication of spatial variability in water quality parameters other potentially important water quality parameters were not measured e g sediment nitrate and phosphate as earlier measurements had discounted them as of concern or they were too difficult or expensive to measure in real time short term high res i button ds1922l water quality sensors were deployed in the ringarooma river at moorina and 5 km upstream of ringarooma township fig 1 for periods of approximately 48 h to monitor temperature and electrical conductivity at 30 min intervals both the spot sampling and continuous deployments are examples of inter agency co operation with equipment provided by nrm north utas and dpipwe a prediction model for river water temperature using machine learning techniques was developed from the weather water temperature and water depth data sets to predict water temperature along rivers in the catchment the rwug had identified water temperature as an indicator of stream health related to flow but the quantitative relationship between the two variables had not been established the data were collected from mineral banks hydrology and meteorology stations fig 1 and consisted of hourly data covering a period of 5 months from october 15 2014 to march 3 2015 the data were divided sequentially into two sets the training set 70 and the validation set 30 the training set was used for learning the parameters of the prediction model and the validation set containing the remaining data was used to independently test the accuracy of predictions for weather data hourly measurements of average wind direction air temperature relative humidity barometric pressure total rainfall rainfall preceding interval rainfall intensity global solar radiation and also the water depth in the river were used a probabilistic data driven modelling technique known as the kernel bayesian regression yu 2017 was used to model the relationship between predictor and dependent variables see supplementary information a relationship was established and used to predict the value of the dependent variable given a new set of predictor variable values prediction results of the modelling included water temperature and a confidence interval quantifying the uncertainty of the prediction 2 2 4 data set platform and visualisation observed and predicted data from several sources mostly bom and csiro were included in the data platform data services were managed using the sense t data platform the platform this platform was built using csiro s sensorcloud data platform now called senaps coombe et al 2017 the platform is a scalable ecosystem which has more than 38 000 data streams and over ten organisations currently contributing using and sharing data a basic overview of the platform is shown in fig 2 the data schema of the platform was influenced by ogc observation and measurements o m and waterml2 0 coombe et al 2017 compiled data were displayed on a mobile friendly website referred to as the dashboard which was accessible to farmers in the catchment and coordinated through the rwug the design of the dashboard focused on server push software technologies that provided a series of pages of graphs of temporal patterns of stream water weather and soil water data that were accompanied by descriptive text and a map showing sensor locations and spatial patterns a phone app was not developed rather users could view the dashboard on a phone desktop or laptop computer as web pages using a browser the dashboard was built on meteor software strack 2015 which is an open source real time javascript web application framework written on top of node js software it used the distributed data protocol strack 2015 and a publish subscribe pattern to automatically synchronize data between clients and the server in real time once sensors were registered into the dashboard the dashboard continuously monitored the data stream on the platform and pushed the latest data to the client asynchronous data pushing and chart rendering were able to avoid network bottlenecks and to allow users to watch the dynamic data stream updates on charts an authorised user of the dashboard was able to discover sensors registered on sense t and these people could generate their own categories of sensors page design allowing a user to prioritise the water information in which they were interested the charting system was fully customisable which allowed displayed data from multiple sensors to be on the same chart each data series could be shown as a line chart or bar chart with various attributes e g colours legend units axis etc this project included a significant component of citizen science as defined by buytaert et al 2014 because it involved participation of the general public in the research design data collection and interpretation process together with scientists and it represented a polycentric approach to governance ostrom 1990 that has a great potential for managing natural resources and risks paul et al 2018 the dashboard concept is not all novel but it is a good small catchment and community example of one that was focused on a particular use and it was an end to end case study of a 1st and 2nd generation environmental virtual observatory karpouzoglou et al 2016 2 3 management trials the rwug consists of farmers and irrigators located across the ringarooma catchment with a history of cooperation and active engagement in water management who participated in the research project trials in 2014 15 smethurst et al 2015 introduced new weather services for the catchment experimented with dashboard development and increased confidence amongst irrigators to expand the irrigation sector and to form and cooperate within a water users group and be pro active in managing the water resource these trials were not systematically deployed either temporally or spatially rather it was intended that water users could respond to any weather streamflow or production stimuli as needed the first trial period undertaken was during a wet summer that did not approach critical low flows and thereby precluded the need for adaptive management the subsequent summer of 2015 16 however developed a strong el niño southern oscillation with substantial drought conditions during this period at times of low flow coordinators of the rwug responded to weather and streamflow conditions by checking the dashboard several times per day considered management actions and communicated those to the group using a dpipwe messaging service these management actions were consistent with weekly discussion and decisions by the rwug leadership group and several meetings occurred during the irrigation season during which water management options and use of the dashboard were discussed as low flows were encountered the rwug experimented with several management options including voluntary ctts at catchment and sub catchment scales staggered extraction scheduling and voluntary release of privately held licenced water to improve flow conditions during these trials the dashboard including modelled values was used to observe the catchment response of river flows and water quality real time data 3 results and discussion the ringarooma dashboard provided a single point of access for a range of near real time and forecast data products with simple summary graphs of current conditions with forecast overlays when relevant forecast streams were available the aim was to provide a quick view of current conditions at specific locations across the catchment the summary page fig 3 provided an overview of conditions at the most relevant gauging station i e moorina fig 1 with the following data streams 1 river flows from dpipwe previous 7 days 2 rainfall observations for the nearest site from bom previous 7 days 3 river flow cease to take and upper bound indicators horizontal lines 4 predicted streamflow and 5 forecasted rainfall two types of streamflow estimates are shown i e a deterministic daily product from bom and sub daily product from the project based on machine learning there were differences between the two types of predictions because of methodology deterministic vs neural network frequency of up dates daily vs 3 hourly and range of inputs used e g rainfall we did not quantitatively compare the two types of predictions but the machine learning method came to be preferred as it was more frequently updated and the direction and magnitude of change seemed more realistic for example for the time period shown fig 3 the increase in stream flow due to 1 5 mm of rainfall was unrealistic for the bom forecast based on local experience although not implemented a method was developed whereby the dashboard would also allow participants to view model predictions for river water temperature 100 h into the future based on machine learning algorithms fig 4 separate from the dashboard these model results were visualised by irrigators using a touch screen showing the likely influences of riparian forest re establishment in various river reaches on water temperature results were provided to the rwug whose members recommended that considering the uncertainty it was most useful that only actionable information should be included on the dashboard and modifications were made during extremely dry conditions water users considered actionable information to be that on which they could make management decisions at a daily and sub daily basis for example streamflow predictions were considered immediately actionable whereas observed streamflow was educative because it provided direct evidence of management action impacts that would later inform management decisions under potentially similar conditions all water quality parameters electrical conductivity turbidity dissolved oxygen ph and temperature were considered educative and actionable but over longer time periods because the link between management actions and impact was not perceived to be direct or clearly observed in near real time development of the summary page of the dashboard required an iterative approach between farmers and software engineers via the scientists coordinating the project to hone its simplicity to reflect only the minimum of information that was required by the farmers to make decisions farmers key questions guiding content and functionality were where is streamflow now in relation to the ctt threshold and where will it be in the near future if no further water management is implemented and what is the quickest and clearest way to make that information viewable notwithstanding the uncertainty of temperature predictions farmers recognised that high stream water temperatures were occasionally being reached and they proposed solutions such as riparian tree plantings to shade the stream in response riparian planting options on private land in the strategic locations were identified such as on northern banks of the river and were carried out in some cases over the course of the study the state endured an extremely dry summer with rain 59 below average for most of tasmania for most of summer following on from a record dry spring september november of 2015 with ringarooma recording its lowest total rainfall since 1918 bureau of meteorology 2016 the drought did not end until late summer april 2016 and placed tasmanian rivers under extreme stress many rivers were on water extraction restrictions even in spring making it difficult for irrigators to be able to maintain crops or pasture over summer without significant water storages the rwug along with several other catchment groups lobbied to implement adaptive co management activities to manage very low flows the rwug s argument relied on their previous successes in collaborative water management including special permission to conduct water management trials and they pointed to the availability of real time streamflow data at a sub catchment scale as provided by this study to justify their request and to demonstrate the capacity to collaborate and manage water availability in november 2015 the ministerial policy on water resource management during extreme dry conditions was adopted dpipwe 2015a dpipwe 2015b allowing for the flexible implementation of restrictions set out in catchment water management plans it provided the ability for authorised officers to withhold restriction notices for individual catchments under specific conditions dpipwe 2015a including that the authorised officer work with water licence holders to ensure the orderly taking of available water during the relevant period dpipwe 2015b for the rwug these conditions included developing and implementing short term plans to manage water availability this option was taken up in several catchments around the state to varying degrees of success with support of dpipwe in several discussions work by the rwug was described as a key justification for the ministerial policy in the ringarooma catchment the water users group met weekly and communicated daily by sms to develop plans to reduce the impact of water takes on river levels these plans were deliberated with the regional water management officer and then approved by dpipwe giving irrigators licence to maintain minimal irrigation levels to sustain crops and pastures fortnightly plans involved commitments by some irrigators to forgo some water entitlements to alternate days on which water was extracted for irrigation and for some water users to rely solely on their dams and forgo all takes from the river as the season continued without rain it led some members to release water from their dams to maintain river levels and thereby avoid levels dropping below the absolute cease to take level at the rwug meetings members referred to the dashboard for gauging station data from several locations and discussed whether specific reaches of the river network needed to be more restricted than others including the dpipwe gauging station at moorina that determines water restriction levels for the catchment by trial and error of different groupings irrigators and dpipwe found it to be convenient and effective to operate as three geographical groups for coordination of water management activities researchers provided advice and support to irrigators when management actions became more targeted such as staggering extractions and releases according to location results are provided and discussed below from three periods that exemplify spring summer and late summer conditions demonstrating management group trial results october 20 november 1 2015 shows a trial of catchment wide ctt days january 12 29 2016 shows a trial of irrigation scheduling and february 9 25 2016 shows a trial of longer periods of ctt only applying to one category of licenced take 3 1 period 1 october 20 to november 1 2015 spring period 1 was in mid spring close to the start of the irrigation season with no rainfall recorded in the catchment from late september until 4 mm fell october 21 22 river flows had been falling from over 400 ml day on october 1 to c 150 ml day on october 20 fig 5 shows discharge for moorina as it appeared on the real time dashboard display to farmers for october 20 to november 2 during a period when the dashboard came into heavy use by the rwug on october 4 dpipwe advised the rwug that a full ctt would be imposed from october 6 ketelaar et al 2017 through negotiation with the department and ministerial officials the rwug was able to gain a 1 week exemption allowing time to organise a community meeting and begin development of catchment wide strategies these actions included targeted release of water from private storage dams and a catchment wide voluntary 24 h ctt to coincide with the derby river derby on october 24 during which community recreational activities occurred on the river a second voluntary ctt occurred on october 29 further to the initial 1 week exemption a second exemption was negotiated until november 1 to allow critical irrigation of recently sown crops and irrigated pastures for dairy production however irrigators were also required to show actions demonstrating that they were seeking to minimise water use and protect the health of the river utilising the dashboard to guide strategies river discharge fig 5 showed a diurnal fluctuation when discharge was below c 200 ml day through experimentation by the rwug this pattern was shown to be caused by the diurnal pattern of water extractions for irrigation due to electricity being cheaper during the night during the ctt day of october 23 24 the fluctuation is greatly reduced minimum flows were found not always to coincide exactly with the middle of the night probably because pumping times vary and because of lag times in flow reaching moorina results from the voluntary ctt trials for the periods of october 23 24 and october 29 fig 5 show that river flows had greatly reduced diurnal flow fluctuation and rose marginally subsequent flow levels fell back however to lower levels likely reflecting increased irrigation pressure following a day with reduced water availability hence while voluntary ctt days could alleviate low flows in the river this was found not to be sustained for more than a day after the trial ended however it did demonstrate that the rwug and dpipwe could effectively coordinate catchment wide water management irrigators were prepared to continue actions that they had begun in october to ensure a ctt was not enacted throughout november however they received several small rainfall events in early november which increased water flows november 1 also brought the release of the water resource management during extreme dry conditions policy extreme dry policy dpipwe 2015b these events ensured that there were no further threats of ctt events during november 2015 3 2 period 2 january 11 30 2016 summer period 2 was in mid summer and fig 6 a shows data as displayed at the time on the dashboard of river flow data from moorina along with rainfall patterns in the catchment the summer had eventuated to be a full el niño drought year and river water levels had fallen to c 60 ml day by this time a second water quality sensor had been added at the ringarooma river at moorina allowing near real time water temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen data to be added to the dashboard fig 6b results fig 6 showed clear diurnal fluctuations in discharge with a diurnal fluctuation in flow of up to 20 ml day and lowest flows mostly early to mid morning sometimes later diurnal water temperatures ranged from 15 to 25 c with the highest temperatures each day in the early afternoon electrical conductivity with a diurnal variation of 3 4 μsm outside of rain events and dissolved oxygen with a diurnal variation of 3 mg l outside of rain events also generally peaked in the early afternoon dissolved oxygen was consistently at lower values than those recorded by spot sampling in the upper catchment dpipwe 2014 during this period farmers trialled management practices of irrigation scheduling from mid january irrigators implemented a split pumping roster by dividing the catchment into 9 groups scattered along the catchment half pumping from 0800 to 2000 h and the other half from 2000 to 0800 h the objective of this action was to spread takes from the river over the 24 h period to reduce high water use time slots that would reduce river flow ketelaar et al 2017 with river water flows starting to fall below the ctt level of 60 ml day this was trialled january 22 27 resulting in river flows rising back to above 60 ml day fig 6 before the influence of rainfall on january 28 arrived to alleviate the pressure irrigation scheduling was found to be effective in reducing the diurnal fluctuation of the river flows and after the first day avoided the trend towards lower flow conditions that had occurred before the trial commenced fig 6 daily maximum water temperatures were lower during the five days when irrigation scheduling was conducted mean maximum temp 20 4 c than in the five days preceding scheduling mean maximum temp 22 3 c but this effect was likely partially related to lower maximum daily air temperatures during that period e g 3 2 c lower at scottsdale fig 1 voluntary releases from major private dams to the river were also implemented with releases of water of at least 10 days of 5 ml day being delivered to the environment to assist flows in the river this action was undertaken by farmers using their own water purchased before the summer season 3 3 period 3 february 9 25 2016 late summer february is late summer in tasmania with the warmest mean maximum temperatures of the year table 1 and after some rainfall january 29 31 little rainfall subsequently occurred during the period fig 7 river discharge fell below the ctt level on february 15 farmers trialled a voluntary surety 6 ctt operated over longer periods of time relative to previous voluntary ctt trials and only applying to their surety 6 licenced takes to explain surety 6 water licences may specify a surety level for the allocation and surety levels indicate the relative priority of an entitlement to take water when supply of water is limited dpipwe 2014 farmers undertook a voluntary ctt of their surety licenced water february 18 29 particularly in areas of the catchment where there was evidence of drought stress this resulted in preventing most daily river flow falling below the ctt level february 18 24 despite lack of rainfall fig 7 as had occurred during periods of january fig 6 this management trial was therefore demonstrated to be successful in reducing the length and severity of low flows during critical irrigation periods it may also have benefited aquatic health by reducing maximum daily temperatures as well as maintaining the amount of habitat available to aquatic organisms as wetted stream bank which is the objective of ctt provisions river flows during this trial period february 18 24 showed minimum maximum diurnal flow fluctuations of 55 74 ml day fig 7 slightly higher than during the previous trial period fig 6 3 4 overall findings the information provided by the dashboard was found to be very useful in communicating the impacts of various decisions to water managers in near real time with updates every few hours the dashboard also became a tool that facilitated community discussion collaboration and shared decision making improved community interactions were perceived by the water users group to be the main outcome evapotranspiration data proved to be important management information that assisted water allocation decision making by the rwug and soil moisture was also used as an indicator of irrigation needs the community was recognised as being successful in taking greater responsibility for implementing water sharing arrangements to achieve a range of mutually beneficial social economic and environmental outcomes cleary et al 2018 following the example of the rwug and working together in cooperation and with support from the authorised officer irrigation communities in other catchments in tasmania also began to share water information and schedule water extractions m mcshane chair of the tasmanian farmers and graziers association water committee personal communication north eastern tasmania has shown a significant trend in reduced annual precipitation 1951 2000 reisinger et al 2014 with increasing climatic variability and uncertainty and farmers having enormous investment in farm business infrastructure and business development a water management dashboard tool may foster intergenerational equity in farming practice there is good potential to employ this approach and its technology in other catchments and regions and early in 2018 the regulator dpipwe launched a new water information website that has many characteristics in common with the ringarooma dashboard dpipwe 2019 this may assist in resolving water management issues in areas where dry season irrigation raises similar problems in terms of water scarcity 4 conclusions the study has demonstrated an approach and methodology for real time monitoring of water resources aimed at supporting community engagement for maintaining environmental values whilst providing water for irrigating crops the study demonstrated how real time data from river flow and water quality sensors can be combined with data services from national and state agencies and private sources to provide a dashboard of data for use by a community water user group these data services included observations and forecasts for rainfall evapotranspiration and river flow at selected points in the catchment the summer season 2015 2016 was unusually dry in tasmania and the rwug obtained special permission for irrigation during this critical period while other catchments had enforced ctts on irrigation water this was because through the rwug and the dashboard the catchment satisfied state requirements for demonstrating effective co management the study also demonstrated that machine learning methods could be used to predict river water temperature accepted by the rwug as a key environmental value that they could potentially improve by increasing shading of rivers and water storages an interactive table demonstrated which reaches of the river network could be prioritised for shading and collaborating farmers planted trees to provide shade beside some river reaches recent scientific advances have seen the ability to collect water quality data at adequate temporal and spatial scales greatly improve through the development of sensor technologies that enable continuous data to be wirelessly communicated to an end user trevathan et al 2010 these advances offer opportunities to increase understanding of water resources and the aquatic ecosystems they support more efficiently and at low cost socio governmental factors associated with water resource sensors and how to facilitate collaboration coordination and trust in polycentric governance settings are viewed as emerging research needs huitema et al 2009 mao et al 2018 this study has shown that building the technical capacity for community water user access to real time data can improve the management of water resources to help balance the requirements of different water users and the environment community engagement is shown to be the key driver of change and when enabled by technology and governance permissions catchment water users can effectively undertake seasonal river low

6627,increasing pressure on river catchment water resources has heightened the need for real time monitoring data for water management agencies and users this study investigates the capability to develop a technical basis for water co management at the catchment scale a web application dashboard was created that displayed real time data for weather soil water river flow and water quality at high spatial and temporal resolutions including streamflow and rainfall forecasts a method to predict stream water temperature was developed and tested using an interactive table for visualisation of complex data the dashboard was used to provide information and alerting to water users in an agricultural catchment through the ringarooma water users group rwug in ne tasmania australia the dashboard was updated several times per day using telemetry and data platform services and accessed by rwug members mainly during periods of low flow when water extraction restrictions can be applied irrigators gained an improved understanding of streamflow behaviour in response to weather variability and water extractions and releases and developed abilities to voluntarily manage the water resource as three sub groups the department of primary industries parks water and environment dpipwe collaborated with the rwug in this adaptive management approach as enabled by the ringarooma river catchment water management plan and later informed a new ministerial policy for water resource management during extreme dry conditions group management was assisted by using alerts sent through the existing dpipwe text messaging service results showed that stakeholder understanding of technical information and scenario implications using the sensor based dashboard increased capacity of irrigators to make decisions that improve production and social outcomes while considering environmental values this study demonstrates that the information provided through the dashboard enabled a high level of community and inter agency co operation demonstrating potential to apply this management approach in other catchments keywords stream flow water management sensor water community group environmental

world wide concern hermanowicz 2008 australia is one of the major food producing and exporting countries in the world poddar et al 2014 and as in other countries adaptive water management has become critical as competition between water uses increases with the prospect of these tensions amplifying as human population grows and rainfall patterns change richter et al 2003 bowmer 2014 and monitoring is fragmentary hannah et al 2011 in all water management contexts there is an increasing demand for real time data to aid water management and to secure environmental values in the river from which the water is extracted at the scale of managing the water resource for a region or catchment developing management options requires an understanding of the needs of all users the biophysical context bowmer 2014 and the potential for management to influence water availability however these understandings are often lacking when water availability and data are limited water users also share concerns about the environmental values of rivers which can deteriorate with changes in flow regime poff et al 2010 with water being an essential natural resource many freshwater systems are directly threatened by human activities dudgeon et al 2006 with an estimated 65 of global river discharge and the aquatic habitat it supports being under moderate to high threat vörösmarty et al 2010 australia is the driest inhabited continent post et al 2012 with climatic variability for rainfall driven by the inter decadal pacific oscillation reisinger et al 2014 and highly variable streamflows mcmahon et al 2007 rivers in australia are important habitats for biodiversity such as freshwater fish and amphibians including high levels of endemic species collen et al 2014 although native species and systems have evolved to cope with the inherent shortage and variability of water in australia lough and hobday 2011 increasing pressure on water resources and modification of the landscape since european arrival have resulted in many rivers in south eastern australia experiencing decline in aquatic fauna ecosystem health balcombe et al 2011 magierowski et al 2012 increased water temperature

water flow is important for avoiding high river water temperatures sinokrot and gulliver 2000 webb et al 2003 with several studies showing that water temperature is inversely related to river discharge reflecting a reduced thermal capacity under decreasing flow volumes van vliet et al 2011 the predicted increased dryness and greater variability in weather in australia as a result of climate change reisinger et al 2014 is likely to exacerbate these declines in flows and increases in temperature stresses in australia and elsewhere increasing pressure on water resources combined with a decline in the health of aquatic systems has brought about a recognition that the aquatic environment is not a user of water in competition with other users rather it is the base of the resource itself which needs to be actively cared for if development is to be sustainable smakhtin 2001 poff et al 2010 federal and state governments in australia have acted jointly to reform and improve the management of water resources during recent decades there has been a focus by governments around australia on delivering more efficient approaches to water management approaches that will address community affordability concerns and support economic aspirations with recognition of the need to safeguard the economic social and environmental capital accumulated through previous reform efforts and to sustain options for future generations national water commission 2013 priority setting frameworks for water resources in australia need biophysical considerations to be better integrated with socioeconomics public expectations and communities bowmer 2014 real time data provides information to support adaptive water management at catchment scales including an understanding and quantification of water availability and the needs of all water users water users share concerns about environmental values of rivers which may become reduced by changes in flow regime poff et al 2010 there has been recent convergence between real time data technological improvements to wireless communication and data protocols and enhanced stakeholder engagement and community involvement through citizen science buytaert et al 2014 paul et al 2018 the use of real time information for water availability and management could potentially improve stakeholder communication and shared understanding about water availability and thereby increase capacity for adaptive local management 1 2 water management in tasmania tasmania has a relative abundance of water resources in comparison to many other parts of australia however it is facing similar pressures to those experienced nationally agricultural production which is an important part of tasmania s economy relies heavily on the state s water resources over 46 of the 2400 agriculture businesses in tasmania use irrigation compared with an average usage of 25 for australia australian bureau of statistics 2018 plans by the state government supported by the commonwealth government have been successful in increasing the area of land under irrigated agriculture in tasmania post et al 2012 with ongoing programs of new irrigation schemes kidd et al 2018 as demand on water resources increases in future there is likely to be a concurrent decrease in rainfall and increase in potential evaporation as a result of climate change nunez and mcgregor 2007 modelling of future water availability predicts that there may be an average decrease in surface water availability in tasmania of 5 post et al 2012 and up to a 14 reduction in total available catchment yield in the ringarooma catchment by 2030 dpipwe 2011a water resources in tasmania as for much of temperate mainland australia generally experience greatest pressure during summer when periods of low flow coincide with the highest domestic stock and agricultural water demand hardie et al 2012 all rivers and streams experience occasional events in which flow is severely reduced but increased abstraction and diversion for human use has seen the prevalence of these events increase in many areas dobson 2009 across northern and eastern tasmania where agricultural production is most developed water use is spatially localised and seasonally concentrated and water use and environmental values across catchments are consequently highly variable bobbi et al 2014 1 3 adaptive water management this study investigated approaches for water co management at the catchment scale co management is the sharing of responsibility between the government and local resource users berkes 2009 where polycentric governance can balance top down and bottom up pathways of influence huitema et al 2009 pahl wostl et al 2013 to bring increased efficiency reduced risk or boosted sustainability implementation of hydrological and agricultural sensors has reached a stage where research is needed not only on technical but also on sociocultural and governance factors mao et al 2018 which is essential for developing water co management using sensors sensor data management and hydrological modelling our objective was to build a water information website visualisations and alerting to inductively investigate how it was utilised by irrigators in an agricultural catchment improved communication by stakeholders of technical information including scenario implications may increase capacity to make decisions on when where and how to use water to improve production environmental and social outcomes 2 methods 2 1 description of the study area the ringarooma catchment in north eastern tasmania of 974 km2 has headwaters around mount maurice 1122 m above sea level dpipwe 2014 and flows in a north easterly direction for c 60 km to discharge into bass strait fig 1 the catchment has a diverse geology stronach and lampert 2003 with upper catchment areas of low productivity granodiorite and granite cenozoic basalts through much of the middle catchment supporting fertile soils before extensive coastal dune fields enclosing a ramsar wetland large areas of the upper ringarooma catchment are covered by native wet and dry sclerophyll forests brown 1996 and by plantation forests dpiw 2008 while a concentrated area in the middle catchment of 25 is intensively farmed primary farming activities are dairy and cropping dpipwe 2014 with dairy herds outside all year on irrigated pastures and crops including potatoes and licenced opium poppies the climate is classified as temperate marine with a mean annual rainfall of 1 100 mm varying from 600 mm in the north to 1 800 mm at higher elevations in the south the total mean annual rain water input into the ringarooma catchment is approximately 1 014 000 ml dpipwe 2010a the ringarooma river has a predictable seasonal flow regime with high flows over winter spring low summer flows and no cease to flow periods bobbi et al 2014 about 80 of the total annual runoff volume occurs during winter dpipwe 2010a while the main channel of the ringarooma river is unregulated there are more than 170 dams in the catchment with a total storage capacity of approximately 16 778 ml dpipwe 2011a plus a new dam of 6 500 ml and associated irrigation infrastructure that commenced operation during the project tasmanian irrigation 2013 water use and irrigation development to support agriculture has increased during recent decades dpipwe 2011a and the total allocation of water in the catchment for 2013 was estimated at c 32 500 ml dpipwe 2014 which is 12 8 of average annual water yield dpipwe 2014 based on data from 1970 to 2009 consumptive demand is highest during the summer autumn period dpipwe 2014 when rainfall is typically low on farm dams are generally refilled during winter spring protected environmental values pevs are the values or uses of the water body for which it is determined that any given area of that water body should be protected dpiwe 2005 these values must be set for all tasmanian surface waters including estuarine and coastal waters under the state policy on water quality management 1997 epa 2018 between 1999 and 2005 pevs were set for the dorset and break o day municipal areas which includes the ringarooma catchment through a series of community forums dpiwe 2005 identified pevs for the ringarooma catchment include the vulnerable aquatic species tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish astacopsis gouldi and a dwarf galaxiid galaxiella pusilla in the last decade substantial efforts have been taken to maintain and improve river health in the ringarooma catchment the ringarooma water users group rwug consists of a sub set of irrigators actively cooperating in water management for more than a decade with a good record of innovation and conflict resolution the community has undertaken substantial environmental work including willow removal river bank stabilisation re establishing riparian vegetation and fencing of riparian zones a management plan has been developed for the lower ringarooma ramsar wetlands ghd 2008 and a water management plan has been implemented for the catchment dpipwe 2014 2 1 1 water allocations all consumptive users of water within the ringarooma catchment must hold a water licence that includes an annual allocation of water with a defined probability of supply the issuing of which involves historical social economic and environmental factors licenced allocations fall into two types direct take where water is taken directly from the water source for immediate use and storage take where water is taken into storage for use at a later date dpipwe 2011b licenced allocations also specify a take period during which a volume is authorised to be taken direct take allocations are generally taken during the summer irrigation period 1 december 30 april while storage allocations are generally taken during the autumn winter spring period 1 may 30 november for storage in dams for later use during the irrigation season dpipwe 2011b a water licence may also specify a surety level for the allocation surety levels determine the priority of water allocation when water supplies cannot meet the requirements of all users dpipwe 2014 starting with restrictions for the lowest priority user group surety levels 1 4 are higher priority and include stock and domestic use public health fire fighting ecosystems and hydro electricity less essential licences include surety 5 for commercial purposes and non essential town water supplies by either direct irrigation onto crops or pasture or for storage and surety 6 for commercial purposes at lower levels of reliability than surety level 5 2 1 2 water restrictions restrictions used in water management in tasmania generally take the form of cease to take ctt provisions which are river flows below which water users are restricted in extracting water ctt provisions are based on environmental flow assessments which in tasmania have historically focussed on the minimum amount of stream flow i e minimum environmental flow required to maintain instream habitat for aquatic flora and fauna dpipwe 2010b these assessments based on a mix of different methodologies graham et al 2000 used models of the amount of habitat available for instream aquatic organisms such as macroinvertebrates and fish under different discharges then determined the breakpoint at which a rapid loss of habitat occurred dpipwe 2010b historical current and proposed future restrictions are based on discharge at the gauging station at the ringarooma river upstream of moorina road bridge fig 1 historically a trigger point for imposition of restrictions of 43 ml day was developed for this site but more recently a staged restriction was developed table 1 the ctt is usually implemented when the flow at the moorina flow gauge fig 1 has been below the trigger for three consecutive days the rate of rise and fall in river flow and pending rainfall patterns are also considered when implementing restriction management dpipwe 2011b 2 2 data compilation modelling and visualisation historical and real time data from a variety of sources were compiled and web pages developed that were available to water users to inform management trials extended over a summer season in 2015 16 which eventuated to be the worst short term drought in recent tasmanian history with ringarooma recording its lowest spring total rainfall since 1918 bureau of meteorology 2015 of 145 66 mm relative to an average of 309 8 mm 2 2 1 weather and soil moisture data observed weather data were accessed from several bureau of meteorology bom weather stations in and nearby the ringarooma catchment these mostly record rainfall only and none was fully automatic high frequency for other weather variables of interest to the study i e rainfall relative humidity air temperature and wind speed and direction potential evapotranspiration pet a calculated parameter was also of high interest to farmers the nearest bom weather station of this capacity was 14 km outside the catchment boundary hence as a priority the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro established two fully automatic weather stations and four recording rain gauges in the catchment fig 1 rainfall data were additionally sourced from a community weather station in the catchment spatial predictions of weather from the australian digital forecast database at a 3 hour frequency were also provided by bom values of pet started to be calculated from observations within the study using the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 which is also used by bom but late in the study both current and forecast pet became available from bom near the mineral banks station fig 1 soil water was measured at five depths at 30 min intervals and used to provide soil moisture real time data using cosmic ray and capacitance sensors calibrated against volumetric soil water measurements hawdon et al 2014 2 2 2 river discharge data and modelling river flow or discharge observations were provided by dpipwe from three pre existing gauges in the catchment at legerwood branxholm and moorina fig 1 and four more streamflow stations were added by csiro as part of this study at federal creek ringarooma new river and mineral banks fig 1 the sense t data platform sense t 2018 was utilized with frequency of data ingestion ranging from every 15 min to daily depending on the frequency of downloading from sensors using telemetry and the frequency of data transfer from intermediate third party platforms early in the project during trials smethurst et al 2015 farmers identified that the preferred unit of flow was ml day with which they were already familiar such as from use of the ctt rates table 1 this unit for flow was used at daily and sub daily time steps historical data were used to develop models for predicting river discharge at two points in the catchment including moorina fig 1 which has over four decades of river gauge records and is the location of regulation keast and ellison 2013 the developed models were based on deterministic welsh et al 2013 ewater 2018 and machine learning methods using recurrent neural networks mhammedi et al 2016 during the project daily flow predictions also became available from bom for flow sub daily predictions went ahead for 1 day and daily predictions went ahead for 5 days although several types of flow predictions were available an evaluation by project participants decided that daily at moorina and branxholm and sub daily moorina flow predictions by machine learning methods best suited their needs at moorina dpipwe has the option of declaring a ctt for the catchment if flow rates go below a prescribed level set to protect environmental values table 1 but adaptive management as described in the water management plan and ministerial policy allows some flexibility about exercising this option adaptive management could be best provided using real time data and predictions though with prediction services in the study being reliant on data from external and internal sources delays occurred when data were not available 2 2 3 water quality monitoring and temperature prediction model water quality data temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were together monitored by utas dpipwe and csiro employing spot sampling short term deployment of water quality sensors and the establishment of fully telemetered continuous water quality monitoring sensors at the pre existing gauges at branxholm and upstream of moorina fig 1 fully telemetered continuous water quality monitoring sensors were established to monitor electrical conductivity temperature and dissolved oxygen parameters were monitored at 15 min intervals with the data telemetered to the sense t data cloud hourly via a dpipwe data platform at the four telemetered hydrological stations installed and managed by csiro fig 1 equipment used were water level and temperature loggers model 3001 levellogger solinst ltd georgetown canada compensated for barometric pressure with a solinst barologger and also measured with the doppler sensor sontek iq plus sontek san diego usa for water quality parameters of temperature ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen equipment used were pentair mp47 3000 multiparameter sensors installed and managed by utas and deployed at the dpipwe gauging stations at moorina and branxholm spot sampling was conducted using a hand held wtw multiprobe 3320 s provided by nrm north utas and dpipwe to provide in situ field measurements of temperature ph electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen and turbidity at 11 sites this sampling was undertaken to validate sensor monitoring sonde as well as to provide an indication of spatial variability in water quality parameters other potentially important water quality parameters were not measured e g sediment nitrate and phosphate as earlier measurements had discounted them as of concern or they were too difficult or expensive to measure in real time short term high res i button ds1922l water quality sensors were deployed in the ringarooma river at moorina and 5 km upstream of ringarooma township fig 1 for periods of approximately 48 h to monitor temperature and electrical conductivity at 30 min intervals both the spot sampling and continuous deployments are examples of inter agency co operation with equipment provided by nrm north utas and dpipwe a prediction model for river water temperature using machine learning techniques was developed from the weather water temperature and water depth data sets to predict water temperature along rivers in the catchment the rwug had identified water temperature as an indicator of stream health related to flow but the quantitative relationship between the two variables had not been established the data were collected from mineral banks hydrology and meteorology stations fig 1 and consisted of hourly data covering a period of 5 months from october 15 2014 to march 3 2015 the data were divided sequentially into two sets the training set 70 and the validation set 30 the training set was used for learning the parameters of the prediction model and the validation set containing the remaining data was used to independently test the accuracy of predictions for weather data hourly measurements of average wind direction air temperature relative humidity barometric pressure total rainfall rainfall preceding interval rainfall intensity global solar radiation and also the water depth in the river were used a probabilistic data driven modelling technique known as the kernel bayesian regression yu 2017 was used to model the relationship between predictor and dependent variables see supplementary information a relationship was established and used to predict the value of the dependent variable given a new set of predictor variable values prediction results of the modelling included water temperature and a confidence interval quantifying the uncertainty of the prediction 2 2 4 data set platform and visualisation observed and predicted data from several sources mostly bom and csiro were included in the data platform data services were managed using the sense t data platform the platform this platform was built using csiro s sensorcloud data platform now called senaps coombe et al 2017 the platform is a scalable ecosystem which has more than 38 000 data streams and over ten organisations currently contributing using and sharing data a basic overview of the platform is shown in fig 2 the data schema of the platform was influenced by ogc observation and measurements o m and waterml2 0 coombe et al 2017 compiled data were displayed on a mobile friendly website referred to as the dashboard which was accessible to farmers in the catchment and coordinated through the rwug the design of the dashboard focused on server push software technologies that provided a series of pages of graphs of temporal patterns of stream water weather and soil water data that were accompanied by descriptive text and a map showing sensor locations and spatial patterns a phone app was not developed rather users could view the dashboard on a phone desktop or laptop computer as web pages using a browser the dashboard was built on meteor software strack 2015 which is an open source real time javascript web application framework written on top of node js software it used the distributed data protocol strack 2015 and a publish subscribe pattern to automatically synchronize data between clients and the server in real time once sensors were registered into the dashboard the dashboard continuously monitored the data stream on the platform and pushed the latest data to the client asynchronous data pushing and chart rendering were able to avoid network bottlenecks and to allow users to watch the dynamic data stream updates on charts an authorised user of the dashboard was able to discover sensors registered on sense t and these people could generate their own categories of sensors page design allowing a user to prioritise the water information in which they were interested the charting system was fully customisable which allowed displayed data from multiple sensors to be on the same chart each data series could be shown as a line chart or bar chart with various attributes e g colours legend units axis etc this project included a significant component of citizen science as defined by buytaert et al 2014 because it involved participation of the general public in the research design data collection and interpretation process together with scientists and it represented a polycentric approach to governance ostrom 1990 that has a great potential for managing natural resources and risks paul et al 2018 the dashboard concept is not all novel but it is a good small catchment and community example of one that was focused on a particular use and it was an end to end case study of a 1st and 2nd generation environmental virtual observatory karpouzoglou et al 2016 2 3 management trials the rwug consists of farmers and irrigators located across the ringarooma catchment with a history of cooperation and active engagement in water management who participated in the research project trials in 2014 15 smethurst et al 2015 introduced new weather services for the catchment experimented with dashboard development and increased confidence amongst irrigators to expand the irrigation sector and to form and cooperate within a water users group and be pro active in managing the water resource these trials were not systematically deployed either temporally or spatially rather it was intended that water users could respond to any weather streamflow or production stimuli as needed the first trial period undertaken was during a wet summer that did not approach critical low flows and thereby precluded the need for adaptive management the subsequent summer of 2015 16 however developed a strong el niño southern oscillation with substantial drought conditions during this period at times of low flow coordinators of the rwug responded to weather and streamflow conditions by checking the dashboard several times per day considered management actions and communicated those to the group using a dpipwe messaging service these management actions were consistent with weekly discussion and decisions by the rwug leadership group and several meetings occurred during the irrigation season during which water management options and use of the dashboard were discussed as low flows were encountered the rwug experimented with several management options including voluntary ctts at catchment and sub catchment scales staggered extraction scheduling and voluntary release of privately held licenced water to improve flow conditions during these trials the dashboard including modelled values was used to observe the catchment response of river flows and water quality real time data 3 results and discussion the ringarooma dashboard provided a single point of access for a range of near real time and forecast data products with simple summary graphs of current conditions with forecast overlays when relevant forecast streams were available the aim was to provide a quick view of current conditions at specific locations across the catchment the summary page fig 3 provided an overview of conditions at the most relevant gauging station i e moorina fig 1 with the following data streams 1 river flows from dpipwe previous 7 days 2 rainfall observations for the nearest site from bom previous 7 days 3 river flow cease to take and upper bound indicators horizontal lines 4 predicted streamflow and 5 forecasted rainfall two types of streamflow estimates are shown i e a deterministic daily product from bom and sub daily product from the project based on machine learning there were differences between the two types of predictions because of methodology deterministic vs neural network frequency of up dates daily vs 3 hourly and range of inputs used e g rainfall we did not quantitatively compare the two types of predictions but the machine learning method came to be preferred as it was more frequently updated and the direction and magnitude of change seemed more realistic for example for the time period shown fig 3 the increase in stream flow due to 1 5 mm of rainfall was unrealistic for the bom forecast based on local experience although not implemented a method was developed whereby the dashboard would also allow participants to view model predictions for river water temperature 100 h into the future based on machine learning algorithms fig 4 separate from the dashboard these model results were visualised by irrigators using a touch screen showing the likely influences of riparian forest re establishment in various river reaches on water temperature results were provided to the rwug whose members recommended that considering the uncertainty it was most useful that only actionable information should be included on the dashboard and modifications were made during extremely dry conditions water users considered actionable information to be that on which they could make management decisions at a daily and sub daily basis for example streamflow predictions were considered immediately actionable whereas observed streamflow was educative because it provided direct evidence of management action impacts that would later inform management decisions under potentially similar conditions all water quality parameters electrical conductivity turbidity dissolved oxygen ph and temperature were considered educative and actionable but over longer time periods because the link between management actions and impact was not perceived to be direct or clearly observed in near real time development of the summary page of the dashboard required an iterative approach between farmers and software engineers via the scientists coordinating the project to hone its simplicity to reflect only the minimum of information that was required by the farmers to make decisions farmers key questions guiding content and functionality were where is streamflow now in relation to the ctt threshold and where will it be in the near future if no further water management is implemented and what is the quickest and clearest way to make that information viewable notwithstanding the uncertainty of temperature predictions farmers recognised that high stream water temperatures were occasionally being reached and they proposed solutions such as riparian tree plantings to shade the stream in response riparian planting options on private land in the strategic locations were identified such as on northern banks of the river and were carried out in some cases over the course of the study the state endured an extremely dry summer with rain 59 below average for most of tasmania for most of summer following on from a record dry spring september november of 2015 with ringarooma recording its lowest total rainfall since 1918 bureau of meteorology 2016 the drought did not end until late summer april 2016 and placed tasmanian rivers under extreme stress many rivers were on water extraction restrictions even in spring making it difficult for irrigators to be able to maintain crops or pasture over summer without significant water storages the rwug along with several other catchment groups lobbied to implement adaptive co management activities to manage very low flows the rwug s argument relied on their previous successes in collaborative water management including special permission to conduct water management trials and they pointed to the availability of real time streamflow data at a sub catchment scale as provided by this study to justify their request and to demonstrate the capacity to collaborate and manage water availability in november 2015 the ministerial policy on water resource management during extreme dry conditions was adopted dpipwe 2015a dpipwe 2015b allowing for the flexible implementation of restrictions set out in catchment water management plans it provided the ability for authorised officers to withhold restriction notices for individual catchments under specific conditions dpipwe 2015a including that the authorised officer work with water licence holders to ensure the orderly taking of available water during the relevant period dpipwe 2015b for the rwug these conditions included developing and implementing short term plans to manage water availability this option was taken up in several catchments around the state to varying degrees of success with support of dpipwe in several discussions work by the rwug was described as a key justification for the ministerial policy in the ringarooma catchment the water users group met weekly and communicated daily by sms to develop plans to reduce the impact of water takes on river levels these plans were deliberated with the regional water management officer and then approved by dpipwe giving irrigators licence to maintain minimal irrigation levels to sustain crops and pastures fortnightly plans involved commitments by some irrigators to forgo some water entitlements to alternate days on which water was extracted for irrigation and for some water users to rely solely on their dams and forgo all takes from the river as the season continued without rain it led some members to release water from their dams to maintain river levels and thereby avoid levels dropping below the absolute cease to take level at the rwug meetings members referred to the dashboard for gauging station data from several locations and discussed whether specific reaches of the river network needed to be more restricted than others including the dpipwe gauging station at moorina that determines water restriction levels for the catchment by trial and error of different groupings irrigators and dpipwe found it to be convenient and effective to operate as three geographical groups for coordination of water management activities researchers provided advice and support to irrigators when management actions became more targeted such as staggering extractions and releases according to location results are provided and discussed below from three periods that exemplify spring summer and late summer conditions demonstrating management group trial results october 20 november 1 2015 shows a trial of catchment wide ctt

november 1 2015 spring period 1 was in mid spring close to the start of the irrigation season with no rainfall recorded in the catchment from late september until 4 mm fell october 21 22 river flows had been falling from over 400 ml day on october 1 to c 150 ml day on october 20 fig 5 shows discharge for moorina as it appeared on the real time dashboard display to farmers for october 20 to november 2 during a period when the dashboard came into heavy use by the rwug on october 4 dpipwe advised the rwug that a full ctt would be imposed from october 6 ketelaar et al 2017 through negotiation with the department and ministerial officials the rwug was able to gain a 1 week exemption allowing time to organise a community meeting and begin development of catchment wide strategies these actions included targeted release of water from private storage dams and a catchment wide voluntary 24 h ctt to coincide with the derby river derby on october 24 during which community recreational activities occurred on the river a second voluntary ctt occurred on october 29 further to the initial 1 week exemption a second exemption was negotiated until november 1 to allow critical irrigation of recently sown crops and irrigated pastures for dairy production however irrigators were also required to show actions demonstrating that they were seeking to minimise water use and protect the health of the river utilising the dashboard to guide strategies river discharge fig 5 showed a diurnal fluctuation when discharge was below c 200 ml day through experimentation by the rwug this pattern was shown to be caused by the diurnal pattern of water extractions for irrigation due to electricity being cheaper during the night during the ctt day of october 23 24 the fluctuation is greatly reduced minimum flows were found not always to coincide exactly with the middle of the night probably because pumping times vary and because of lag times in flow reaching moorina results from the voluntary ctt trials for the periods of october 23 24 and october 29 fig 5 show that river flows had greatly reduced diurnal flow fluctuation and rose marginally subsequent flow levels fell back however to lower levels likely reflecting increased irrigation pressure following a day with reduced water availability hence while voluntary ctt days could alleviate low flows in the river this was found not to be sustained for more than a day after the trial ended however it did demonstrate that the rwug and dpipwe could effectively coordinate catchment wide water management irrigators were prepared to continue actions that they had begun in october to ensure a ctt was not enacted throughout november however they received several small rainfall events in early november which increased water flows november 1 also brought the release of the water resource management during extreme dry conditions policy extreme dry policy dpipwe 2015b these events ensured that there were no further threats of ctt events during november 2015 3 2 period 2 january 11 30 2016 summer period 2 was in mid summer and fig 6 a shows data as displayed at the time on the dashboard of river flow data from moorina along with rainfall patterns in the catchment the summer had eventuated to be a full el niño drought year and river water levels had fallen to c 60 ml day by this time a second water quality sensor had been added at the ringarooma river at moorina allowing near real time water temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen data to be added to the dashboard fig 6b results fig 6 showed clear diurnal fluctuations in discharge with a diurnal fluctuation in flow of up to 20 ml day and lowest flows mostly early to mid morning sometimes later diurnal water temperatures ranged from 15 to 25 c with the highest temperatures each day in the early afternoon electrical conductivity with a diurnal variation of 3 4 μsm outside of rain events and dissolved oxygen with a diurnal variation of 3 mg l outside of rain events also generally peaked in the early afternoon dissolved oxygen was consistently at lower values than those recorded by spot sampling in the upper catchment dpipwe 2014 during this period farmers trialled management practices of irrigation scheduling from mid january irrigators implemented a split pumping roster by dividing the catchment into 9 groups scattered along the catchment half pumping from 0800 to 2000 h and the other half from 2000 to 0800 h the objective of this action was to spread takes from the river over the 24 h period to reduce high water use time slots that would reduce river flow ketelaar et al 2017 with river water flows starting to fall below the ctt level of 60 ml day this was trialled january 22 27 resulting in river flows rising back to above 60 ml day fig 6 before the influence of rainfall on january 28 arrived to alleviate the pressure irrigation scheduling was found to be effective in reducing the diurnal fluctuation of the river flows and after the first day avoided the trend towards lower flow conditions that had occurred before the trial commenced fig 6 daily maximum water temperatures were lower during the five days when irrigation scheduling was conducted mean maximum temp 20 4 c than in the five days preceding scheduling mean maximum temp 22 3 c but this effect was likely partially related to lower maximum daily air temperatures during that period e g 3 2 c lower at scottsdale fig 1 voluntary releases from major private dams to the river were also implemented with releases of water of at least 10 days of 5 ml day being delivered to the environment to assist flows in the river this action was undertaken by farmers using their own water purchased before the summer season 3 3 period 3 february 9 25 2016 late summer february is late summer in tasmania with the warmest mean maximum temperatures of the year table 1 and after some rainfall january 29 31 little rainfall subsequently occurred during the period fig 7 river discharge fell below the ctt level on february 15 farmers trialled a voluntary surety 6 ctt operated over longer periods of time relative to previous voluntary ctt trials and only applying to their surety 6 licenced takes to explain surety 6 water licences may specify a surety level for the allocation and surety levels indicate the relative priority of an entitlement to take water when supply of water is limited dpipwe 2014 farmers undertook a voluntary ctt of their surety licenced water february 18 29 particularly in areas of the catchment where there was evidence of drought stress this resulted in preventing most daily river flow falling below the ctt level february 18 24 despite lack of rainfall fig 7 as had occurred during periods of january fig 6 this management trial was therefore demonstrated to be successful in reducing the length and severity of low flows during critical irrigation periods it may also have benefited aquatic health by reducing maximum daily temperatures as well as maintaining the amount of habitat available to aquatic organisms as wetted stream bank which is the objective of ctt provisions river flows during this trial period february 18 24 showed minimum maximum diurnal flow fluctuations of 55 74 ml day fig 7 slightly higher than during the previous trial period fig 6 3 4 overall findings the information provided by the dashboard was found to be very useful in communicating the impacts of various decisions to water managers in near real time with updates every few hours the dashboard also became a tool that facilitated community discussion collaboration and shared decision making improved community interactions were perceived by the water users group to be the main outcome evapotranspiration data proved to be important management information that assisted water allocation decision making by the rwug and soil moisture was also used as an indicator of irrigation needs the community was recognised as being successful in taking greater responsibility for implementing water sharing arrangements to achieve a range of mutually beneficial social economic and environmental outcomes cleary et al 2018 following the example of the rwug and working together in cooperation and with support from the authorised officer irrigation communities in other catchments in tasmania also began to share water information and schedule water extractions m mcshane chair of the tasmanian farmers and graziers association water committee personal communication north eastern tasmania has shown a significant trend in reduced annual precipitation 1951 2000 reisinger et al 2014 with increasing climatic variability and uncertainty and farmers having enormous investment in farm business infrastructure and business development a water management dashboard tool may foster intergenerational equity in farming practice there is good potential to employ this approach and its technology in other catchments and regions and early in 2018 the regulator dpipwe launched a new water information website that has many characteristics in common with the ringarooma dashboard dpipwe 2019 this may assist in resolving water management issues in areas where dry season irrigation raises similar problems in terms of water scarcity 4 conclusions the study has demonstrated an approach and methodology for real time monitoring of water resources aimed at supporting community engagement for maintaining environmental values whilst providing water for irrigating crops the study demonstrated how real time data from river flow and water quality sensors can be combined with data services from national and state agencies and private sources to provide a dashboard of data for use by a community water user group these data services included observations and forecasts for rainfall evapotranspiration and river flow at selected points in the catchment the summer season 2015 2016 was unusually dry in tasmania and the rwug obtained special permission for irrigation during this critical period while other catchments had enforced ctts on irrigation water this was because through the rwug and the dashboard the catchment satisfied state requirements for demonstrating effective co management the study also demonstrated that machine learning methods could be used to predict river water temperature accepted by the rwug as a key environmental value that they could potentially improve by increasing shading of rivers and water storages an interactive table demonstrated which reaches of the river network could be prioritised for shading and collaborating farmers planted trees to provide shade beside some river reaches recent scientific advances have seen the ability to collect water quality data at adequate temporal and spatial scales greatly improve through the development of sensor technologies that enable continuous data to be wirelessly communicated to an end user trevathan et al 2010 these advances offer opportunities to increase understanding of water resources and the aquatic ecosystems they support more efficiently and at low cost socio governmental factors associated with water resource sensors and how to facilitate collaboration coordination and trust in polycentric governance settings are viewed as emerging research needs huitema et al 2009 mao et al 2018 this study has shown that building the technical capacity for community water user access to real time data can improve the management of water resources to help balance the requirements of different water users and the environment community engagement is shown to be the key driver of change and when enabled by technology and governance permissions catchment water users can effectively undertake seasonal river low

6628,the nonlinear dynamics of streamflow time series from 667 reference hydrometric stations in north america spanning the pluvial nival hydrological continuum are explored using minimum embedding dimensions as determined by false nearest neighbor fnn methods simulations using synthetic time series demonstrate that snowmelt dominated time series have lower embedding dimensions than those that are rainfall dominated and that mixtures of the two processes result in a nearly linear change in the embedding dimension the majority of the reference hydrometric stations drop below a 1 threshold at a dimension less than 30 showing a high degree of natural complexity in the signals ranging from annual snowmelt to weather driven pseudo stochastic systems a less restrictive threshold 5 is suggested to be more appropriate for streamflow time series time series smoothing impacts the embedding dimension and over smoothing results in incorrect reductions of embedding dimensions the relationship of the embedding dimensions to watershed and statistical properties of streamflow record showed the lowest embedding dimensions are restricted to large drainage areas high elevations and large mean annual flows and variance high autocorrelations and large fractions of the records with only small changes in magnitude times series that have a large proportion of consecutive days of equal streamflow typically result in higher embedding dimensions mapping of the embedding dimension shows spatial patterns related to the streamflow generating processes and geographical features the use of embedding dimension resolved different dynamics across the hydrological continuum for rainfall to snowmelt over many climate zones changes in the embedding dimension might indicate process changes related to climate variability and change keywords streamflow climate change pluvial nival spectrum delay embedding space nonlinear analysis false nearest neighbor 1 introduction rainfall driven and snowmelt driven hydrological systems exhibit distinct streamflow behavior and shape their landscapes differently in changing climates the necessity of a better understanding of the distinguishing factors of pluvial and nival rivers has increased burn and whitfield 2017 for example if typically nival rivers receive more rain events in the future flood generating mechanisms will change as will the magnitude and frequency of rain on snow floods the ability to diagnose such process changes in hydrology is still limited the present research seeks to illuminate and quantify the pluvial to nival spectrum through nonlinear time series analysis of streamflow time series from a large collection of north american reference hydrological stations the ability to quantify the position on this spectrum based upon historical data can contribute to detecting changes in process related to future climate variations and change hydrology is fundamentally a study of nonlinear processes conducted extensively with linear methods amorocho 1963 1967 schertzer et al 2010 argue that simplistic approximations in linear operational hydrological models are divorced from hydrological theory this need not be the case as the real world dynamics of hydrological systems that appear to be highly variable complex and often random may be diagnosed reconstructed characterized and modelled using mathematically rigorous procedures coulibaly and baldwin 2005 huffaker et al 2017 operational hydrology often ignores nonlinear aspects included in theoretical hydrology schertzer et al 2010 seasonal patterns of streamflow and other hydroclimatic variables is a widely covered topic in hydrology flow regime classification the classification of hydrographs based upon streamflow generating mechanisms or other common hydrological features seldom has included nonlinear techniques because of the difficulty of the methods dooge 1986 objective methods have been attempted with shape and magnitude classification for proglacial stream hydrographs hannah et al 2000 or classifications of patterns of peaks and their timing to associate sites the latter methods suffer at larger scales and in complex terrain where differences in latitude and elevation result in the same pattern being identified in separate clusters fleming et al 2007 swain et al 2016 used nonlinear techniques self organized maps and kernel principle components analysis to classify streamflow signatures and found nonlinear methods outperformed linear approaches principal components analysis and k means furthermore sivakumar et al 2007 make the point that linear tools such as autocorrelation and power spectrum may not be adequate for studying system complexity where the use of nonlinear concepts is necessary it is well known that climatic variables and trends influence hydrological regimes and complicate classifications fleming et al 2007 showed that ocean circulation patterns such as enso and the pacific decadal oscillation have different impacts on different streamflow regimes or rather the streamflow generating processes hannaford and buys 2012 examined trends in flow regimes in the uk in relation to climate and observed increased winter flows and high flows associated with increased rainfall and spatial heterogeneity in trends arnell and gosling 2013 examined how indicators of hydrologic regime might be affected in a future climate where shifts in timing of snowmelt is an indicator coopersmith et al 2014 demonstrated regional differences in runoff regime in the united states measuring shifts in indicators of regimes and that the expansion of the regimes from the american southeast to the north and west generally reflect the projected increased role of precipitation and decrease in snow untangling how changes in the climatic system affect hydrological processes is a complex nonlinear problem nonlinear time series analysis is a rich field of mathematics involving many methods adapted from the study of dynamical systems kantz and schreiber 2003 a time series can be viewed as a one dimensional measurement of a dynamical system and the behavior and evolution of the full system can be represented and analyzed in a phase space phase space or state space is an abstract construction that allows a dynamical system to be presented in multiple dimensions each coordinate representing a key feature of the system and each point representing a specific state if one considers all the hydrological processes that exist in a watershed as components of a dynamical system a few processes may dominate and result in a low dimensional system as more processes exist or the more complex the processes and their timing the higher the dimension of the dynamical system becomes the time evolution of a hydrological system can be represented in phase space but as in all natural sciences hydrologists are only able to obtain measurements of a subset of the active hydrological process this means hydrologists always work with a lower dimensional phase space that represents the state of a watershed through a finite number of hydrological variables e g streamflow meteorology ground water that are measured at discrete times thus attempting a full phase space representation is classically problematic as all the relevant variables are not always measured takens theorem takens 1981 fortunately proves that the full behavior of a dynamical system can be studied by looking at a time delay embedding of a subspace of the full phase space for hydrologists the implication of takens theorem is that the dimension of the dominant dynamics in a basin can be identified from just the streamflow time series furthermore if a dynamical system contains a strange attractor of dimension m takens theorem and the whitney embedding theorem prove that this attractor can be fully unfolded in an embedding space of dimension 2 m 1 this minimum embedding dimension can be considered a metric of complexity or stochasticity of the processes in the basin sivakumar and singh 2012 from a hydrological perspective a time delay embedded time series may be low dimensional if there is consistent magnitude and timing of a dominant runoff process through the choice of the delay parameter τ this process may be attributed to short or long cycles and trends in precipitation a high embedding dimension may be caused by variable timing of runoff such that the delay τ is insufficient to return the embedded time series to the same neighborhoods of the phase space variable magnitude the presence of stochastic processes or other complex mechanisms kennel et al 1992 explored how to determine the acceptable minimum embedding dimension by examining nearest neighbors the embedding dimension allows a time delay reconstruction of a phase space that then illustrates the system dynamics kostelich and yorke 1990 for physicists the recommended procedure seeks to reduce the number of false nearest neighbors to less than 1 kennel et al 1992 1997 though 5 may be sufficient for hydrologists kennel et al 1992 proposed the geometric unfolding method to determine the number of false nearest neighbors that was used here this technique has seen limited application in hydrology and can be supplemented with recurrence plots to visualize recurrent patterns in a time series such as by zbilut and webber 1992 and march et al 2005 khatibi et al 2012 investigated chaotic behavior in river stage and discharge time series using five nonlinear methods phase space reconstruction false nearest neighbors correlation dimension lyapunov exponents and a local approximation method they showed that low dimensional chaotic structure exists in the two time series studied mann et al 1995 lall and mann 1995 and lall et al 1996 demonstrated early connections between decadal climate variation and the variations in the volume of great salt lake a 100 000 km2 closed basin suggesting that decadal variations in volume follow low frequency shifting of storm tracks abarbanel et al 1996 and abarbanel and lall 1996 examined this reconstructed 1842 1992 15 day time series of lake volume sangoyomi et al 1996 using nonlinear methods including fnn and showed that the system dynamic has an embedding dimension of 4 with components lagged by 6 months this large basin smooths a large number of atmospheric and climatological motions reducing the complexity but retaining its long term climate sensing while a number of analyses of climate and weather data find low dimensional attractors e g abarbanel and lall 1996 lall et al 1996 and others lorenz 1991 indicates that the actual climate attractor is likely to be of much higher dimension and gives several reasons for evidence of low dimensional representations abarbanel and lall 1996 suggest that analyses similar to those they present might work for large rivers e g mississippi where the smoothing of the climate signal is large but small streams may be more difficult to analyze either because of increased complexity in the dynamics or because of a relatively poor signal to noise ratio in the data sivakumar et al 2002 investigated correlation dimension as an indicator of low dimensional chaotic structure in hydrological time series using monthly runoff for 48 years the correlation dimension was in agreement with the optimal embedding dimension of the phase space suggesting it could make a reliable indicator we would comment that using monthly data removed so much noise and structure from the time series as to not be a sufficient test as demonstrated below sivakumar 2004 proposed a procedure to identify dominant processes that used correlation dimension to quantify the number of processes expert knowledge to identify the processes and a sensitivity analysis to order the processes by dominance they suggest that more effort be placed on finding patterns and hidden order sivakumar et al 2007 explored the classification issue from the perspective of a simple phase state reconstruction technique representing a multidimensional system using a single variable time series through a delay coordinate procedure the complexity of the reconstruction can then be used to classify systems as low medium or high depending on a user chosen metric for whichever embedding dimension was used sivakumar et al 2007 sivakumar and singh 2012 argue that hydrological systems are appropriate for such a classification applying the correlation dimension method to monthly streamflow time series from more than 100 watersheds they describe four categories low medium and high complexity and unidentifiable sivakumar and singh 2012 this classification scheme provided some local homogeneity but exceptions existed in contrast tongal and sivakumar 2017 consider a cross entropy clustering method that used embedding dimension sample entropy and a coefficient of variability the combination of nonlinear and linear variables successfully determined distinct flow generating mechanisms in different parts of australia vignesh et al 2015 used a false nearest neighbor fnn algorithm to examine the spatial variability over a region of the united states using monthly streamflow data vignesh et al 2015 varied the delay time values monthly seasonal annual autocorrelation and the average mutual information and found that the fnn embedding dimensions may or may not change with different delay times in contrast to a fixed fnn threshold such as by abarbanel et al 1993 vignesh et al 2015 simply use the embedding dimension of the lowest fnn by mapping fnn embedding dimension vignesh et al 2015 demonstrate differences in variability in streamflow dynamics across the us lower delay times result in wider variability in the embedding dimension in the west than in the east vignesh et al 2015 also compared fnn dimensions to catchment characteristics and streamflow statistical properties low embedding dimensions occur in both small and large drainage basins but high embedding dimensions are associated only with small drainage areas low embedding dimensions occur at both low and high elevations but high values are only at low elevations high embedding dimensions are associated only with low annual mean flows since embedding dimension and coefficient of variation are both measures of variability nonlinear and linear there has been shown to be a positive relationship between them vignesh et al 2015 the previous review of the field indicates that using the minimum embedding dimension as an indicator of the hydrologic regime is a novel application of the technique the basic hypothesis of the present research is that a simple annual snowmelt signal e g a modified sine curve will reflect a low dimensional dynamical system and thus will have a low minimum embedding dimension respectively pluvial systems may have strong seasonal patterns but are more stochastic at single day time steps than snowmelt and cannot be fully unfolded at low dimensions and thus the false nearest neighbor calculations are expected to produce higher minimum embedding dimension expanding our focus beyond low dimensional systems allows a consideration of chaotic or stochastic signals not as merely evidence of meaningless noise but rather as signals representing a poorly understood and much more complex weather driven process abarbanel and lall 1996 it is shown that excessive smoothing may have the adverse effect of destroying information that is actually characteristic of a hydrologic regime and it should not be assumed a priori that hydrological systems can represented with only a few state variables the present study uses both synthetic time series that mimic snowmelt rainfall and noise contributions and streamflow time series from 667 hydrological reference sites in north america this allows the embedding dimension to be explored in some detail to demonstrate that minimum embedding dimensions provide information about separation of these two processes a sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess the effects on minimum embedding dimension d e several hydrologically important influences 1 how long and or how much of a streamflow record is required to determine d e 2 does the scaling of the time series affect d e 3 does the basin area and elevation affect d e 4 how much averaging is required to reduce random noise to the point where a d e estimate can be found and what happens if over smoothing results and 5 how is d e related to statistical properties of the time series the utility of the method is demonstrated by estimating the minimum embedding dimension for hydrological reference sites in north america and exploring the spatial distribution of d e 2 methods the theoretical basis for the false nearest neighbor methodology is outlined first followed by the nature of the streamflow time series from reference hydrologic networks and the synthetic time series used in method testing 2 1 delay embedding spaces and false nearest neighbors for a one dimensional time series measurement of a nonlinear system x t a time delay reconstruction can be used to view the underlying dynamics the parameterized curve y n t x t x t τ x t τ n 1 where τ is a choice of time delay and n is the dimension chosen to unfold the dynamics of the system traces out an orbit in the system the convention used in the present research is a time delay at which the average mutual information ami is one fifth of the value attained at no time delay cf abarbanel et al 1993 and will not be a focus of the current research the choice of one fifth ami instead of the time of first local minimum was necessary as some time series had ami that was monotonically decreasing the central premise of this study is to find an appropriate dimension n at which the full dynamics of the system can be unfolded while there are several techniques to estimate this value the geometric approach of kennel et al 1992 to identify the minimum dimension through identification of false nearest neighbors fnn is widely used and sufficient for comparison of hydrological systems an efficient fnn computation script written in matlab from the university of potsdam http tocsy pik potsdam de crptoolbox marwan et al 2007 was used this code calculates the embedding dimension of the total time series with a cost saving computation based on identifying fnn for many subsections of the time series and can result in small variability from one approximation to the next as the focus on this research will not be on identifying behavior that results in each dimension this small variability was deemed acceptable and did not influence the results detailed explanations of the theory of fnn can be found elsewhere e g abarbanel et al 1993 kantz and schreiber 2003 but a brief explanation is given here for completeness for a given time t and a point y n t x t x t τ x t τ n 1 in the orbit of our time series in an embedding space of dimension n the r th nearest neighbor to y n t call it y n r t is a point at the euclidean distance r n 2 t r k 0 n 1 x t k τ x r t k τ 2 kennel et al 1992 use two criteria that may designate this neighbor as false by comparing r n 2 t r to r n 1 2 t r k 0 n x t k τ x r t k τ 2 the distance of the same two orbital points in the next higher delay embedding dimension the first criterion eliminates points that only appear close in a given dimension because the orbit is not fully unfolded in a higher dimension where the orbit is actually unfolded the points are relatively far apart this is demonstrated in fig 1 where for simplicity our orbit of points all fall on a circle points a and b on the circle appear close when projected onto one dimension n 1 but in reality are far apart when the orbit is fully unfolded n 2 points a and c are examples of true nearest neighbors this criterion is formally stated as y n r t is a fnn to y n t if r n 1 2 t r r n 2 t r r n 2 t r 1 2 x t n τ x r t n τ r n t r r tol where r tol 10 is sufficient the second criterion helps manage the influence of high dimensional noise in nonlinear systems that have a limited time series length if the closest point to y n t is actually not close that is r n t r is of the order of the width of the orbit and r n 1 t r is also large then y n r t should also be considered false formally r n 1 t 1 r a a tol where r a 2 1 n t x t x 2 and x 1 n t x t and n is the length of the time series in the kennel method the first dimension d e at which the percent of nearest neighbors that are false drops below 1 is then defined as d e we found that the 1 threshold was too restrictive for streamflow data that contains significant noise and about 14 of the cases failed to converge appendix instead a threshold of 5 resulted in only one case which did not converge so that threshold was used for the remainder of this study it is worth noting that the two criteria are also unaffected by linear translation and rescaling consider a time series x t and a modified series y t a x t b where a and b are real numbers and their respective metrics r n x r n y r a x and r a y r n y 2 t r k 0 n 1 y t k τ y r t k τ 2 k 0 n 1 ax t k τ b a x r t k τ b 2 a 2 k 0 n 1 x t k τ x r t k τ 2 a 2 r n x 2 t r thus r n 1 y 2 t r r n y 2 t r r n y 2 t r 1 2 a 2 r n 1 x 2 t r a 2 r n x 2 t r a 2 r n x 2 t r 1 2 r n 1 x 2 t r r n x 2 t r r n x 2 t r 1 2 similarly y 1 n t ax t b 1 n nb a t x t b a x r a y 2 1 n t y t a x b 2 1 n t ax t a x 2 a 2 r a x 2 and r n 1 y t 1 r a y r n 1 x t 1 r a x this implies it is not necessary or beneficial to standardize the streamflow prior to analysis it is not the mean flow or the absolute range of streamflow values measured that determines d e but only the dynamics of the flow fnn were calculated for embedding dimensions ranging from 1 to 30 for each time series a transition to a dynamical system with more noise or with more stochastic determinism results in more fnn at higher dimensions and generates potentially spurious d e requirements kennel et al 1992 this measure of complexity may help quantify where a basin exists on the spectrum of pluvial to nival as determined by a river streamflow time series additionally non stationarity in the hydrographs and year to year shifts on the pluvial nival spectrum will also add complex dynamics to the system and potentially increase d e an example of the fnn embedding dimension estimate applied to the x component of the classic lorenz system can be seen in fig 2 this particular system is governed by the system of ordinary differential equations dx dt 10 y x dy dt x 28 z y dz dt x y 8 z 3 and the strange attractor is fully unfolded in three dimensions shown in fig 2a the color of the parametric curve varies with rescaled time from t 0 to t 1 as seen in the color bar the effect of adding random sections of uniformly distributed noise to 30 of the time series x t potentially representative of signal noise or an additional complementary stochastic process is seen in fig 2b here the percent of fnn per embedding dimension for the clean signal x t and noisy signals x noise t are displayed for the clean signal the percent of fnn drops below 1 at n 4 and reaches 0 at n 7 which is sufficient for the lorenz attractor of dimension m 2 06 according to the whitney embedding theorem the amplitude of the added noise was twice the standard deviation of x t and increased d e to 15 it is worth noting the fnn estimates of d e were unaffected if the noise was added to the entire time series as intended by the algorithm design 2 2 dataset the daily streamflow time series used in the following analysis consists of records from 462 usgs reference hydrological stations in the contiguous united states hawaii alaska and puerto rico as well as 205 reference sites in canada reference hydrological stations were chosen as they are thought to be minimally affected by land use changes and their dynamics only vary with time as a result of climate whitfield et al 2012 the time series of streamflow were required to span at least 40 years but measurement gaps resulted in a length of data ranging from 27 to 107 years prior to fnn calculations time series of streamflow were smoothed by a 5 day sliding average this is in accordance with the work of whitfield 1998 that suggests a smoothing of high frequency components shorter than five days allows a fairer comparison between large and small streams a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effect of the amount of smoothing on d e for all stations in an east to west transect between 38 5 n and 39 5 n and all stations in a north to south transect between 114 5 w and 116 5 w these bands were chosen as they included a large geographic span of stations and did not result in an overly burdensome number of extra calculations d e was calculated for the entire duration of each time series in the transects with sliding window sizes varying from 2 to 30 days during preprocessing since climate and weather are largely non stationary and the method here treats streamflow data as stationary a sensitivity analysis that examined the effect of time series length was also conducted for the same transects of stations d e was calculated with a fixed sliding window size of 5 days with the length of series ranging from 10 to 66 of the entire series length d e was calculated for multiple sections of the original time series at each shortened length 10 4 4 2 and 2 sections for 10 25 33 50 66 respectively with the start dates chosen randomly in the series basin drainage area and elevation and streamflow record statistical properties were examined to assess how they may be related to d e statistical properties included mean annual flow the standard deviation and the autocorrelation of the streamflow record at a time lag equivalent to that used for the d e calculation some of the streamflow records contain extended periods of zero discharge and we calculated the fraction of the total records where there was no change in flow from one day to the next to address this 2 3 synthetic signals to further test the theory that fnn can help classify hydrographs on a continuum from rainfall to snowmelt driven systems synthetic 50 year time series of river flow were generated three fundamental building block mechanisms were created to generate synthetic streamflows these include rainfall snowmelt and white noise linear combinations of the three components were varied and d e was computed to identify the effect of the transition from a snowmelt to a rainfall driven system examples of three different synthetic streamflows can be found in fig 3 the presence of rainfall contribution to streamflow was arbitrarily chosen to occupy no more than 30 of the time series the start date of the influence of a rainfall event was randomly chosen in the time series as was a random duration of 1 5 days during these 1 to 5 day periods the rainfall signal rf t consisted of uniformly distributed noise with values in the open set 0 1 the remaining rainfall signal consisted of zeros the fundamental snowmelt signal sm t consisted of a rescaled sine curve with a period of 1 year and a range of 0 1 the sine curve was unchanged for two hundred days of the year surrounding the maximum the remaining days were set to a fixed base flow equal to the 200th day of the snowmelt oscillation constant uniformly distributed random values n t were also added to the time series the final synthetic river flow was of the form 1 f t a r f t b s m t c n t where a b c 1 values of a ranged from 0 to 0 9 and c was fixed at 0 1 the same preprocessing and fnn calculations described in the previous section were applied to these synthetic time series 3 results 3 1 synthetic data synthetic streamflow time series as described in section 2 3 were generated and analyzed to test whether increasing the relative amplitude of random days of rainfall contribution to streamflow would increase the embedding dimension from a simulated nival baseline a plot comparing the minimum delay embedding dimension of the synthetic river signals versus the value of coefficient a in eq 1 can be found in fig 4 a as the rainfall coefficient a in eq 1 increased from 0 to 0 9 the minimum delay embedding dimension increased nearly linearly from 5 to 13 in fig 4b the increase of fnn for each embedding dimension for increasingly pluvial regimes is also displayed fig 4 indicates that d e and false nearest neighbors could be used as a measure of the shift in runoff in a simple nival to a pluvial transition as a further investigation in the ability to diagnose changes in the streamflow generating processes a synthetic time series was generated that spanned 100 years with a linear transition of a b 0 0 9 nival at year 1 to a b 0 9 0 pluvial at year 100 minimum embedding dimensions were calculated for consecutive 10 and 20 year subsections to see if d e could identify the regime change over time as could be suspected by the previous synthetic time series analysis the embedding dimension steadily increased with time from d e 6 in years 1 10 to d e 12 in years 91 100 results using 20 year subsections were similar this indicates potential for diagnostic applications in climatic regions undergoing transitions from snowmelt to rainfall dominant processes and is further investigated with real streamflow time series in section 3 2 it should be noted that the synthetic time series were unable to attain the same level of complexity and the same range of minimum embedding dimensions as the natural signals this is understandable because of their fundamentally simple construction and the ability of the fnn algorithm to disregard white noise kennel et al 1992 3 2 hydrological network analysis the minimum delay embedding dimension was computed for all 667 stream flow time series values ranged from 3 to a maximum possible dimension of 30 and can be seen in fig 5 the one series where the percent of fnn never dropped below 5 is marked in fig 5 as having an embedding dimension of 31 outside the range of calculated values this time series dry creek at union city ca did eventually drop below 5 fnn at a dimension of 50 a transition to lower embedding dimensions suggesting less complexity in the flow can be seen in much of the colder snow dominated northern regions of fig 5 as well as in the major mountain ranges in the east and west a complementary plot computed at the 1 threshold is available in the appendix fig a1 the spectrum of values reached its peaks primarily along the west coast and into parts of the desert southwest as well as a region spanning portions of the canadian prairies and united states great plains southwards to the gulf coast of texas and louisiana similar to the findings of vignesh et al 2015 d e had a slight dependence on the size of the drainage area with the lowest values of d e only being attained from the largest basins fig 6 a a5 and document supplement but low and high values of de are seen across the range of basin areas and elevations similarly the lowest embedding dimensions were associated with high annual mean flow fig 6c high flow variance fig 6d autocorrelation fig 6e and low first differenced zeros fig 6f while this was true for the lowest embedding dimensions a range of low and high embedding dimensions are observed below the maximum of these ranges to further investigate this spectrum of d e a sensitivity analysis for 37 stations along an east to west transect between the latitudes of 38 5 and 39 5 n and 24 stations along a north to south transect between 114 5 and 116 5 w was conducted these transects are indicated as the regions bounded by red lines in fig 5 regime plots and embedding dimension de for selected stations in the east to west longitudinal and north to south latitudinal transects can be found in figs 7 and 8 regime plots summarize the seasonal variation of streamflow showing the mean and median discharge and the 0 1 to 0 9 quantiles with the maximum and minimum values being shown as points from the regime plots in each transect it is clear that the most snow dominated watersheds those that exhibit large peaks in flow during spring and summer have low embedding dimensions e g fig 7f g fig 8c h where rainfall has a seasonally consistent pattern higher embedding dimensions are observed fig 7b d where the streamflow pattern has little or no seasonal structure fig 7a e h fig 8a b the highest embedding dimensions greater than 13 and up to 23 were found along this transect 3 3 sensitivity analysis an evaluation of the kennel et al 1992 fnn method as a tool to determine stream flow complexity was conducted this involved varying the length of record investigated for all stations and the degree of smoothing applied in preprocessing for the two transects across north america shown in fig 5 3 3 1 length of series for the 667 stations the length of streamflow time series varied in length from 27 to 107 years and did not appear to directly affect the embedding dimension fig 9 stations along the two transects were resampled to provide shorter records of 10 66 of the full record length multiple runs were analyzed for each shortened record with the start dates randomly chosen as detailed in section 2 2 the d e calculated from the entire time series was either within the range of values calculated or slightly greater never more than 2 dimensions than the range obtained from the collection of subseries no full series values of d e were less than the minimum value calculated for a subseries indicating complexity was never simplified when looking at a larger time window it was equally likely for d e in a pluvial or nival system to lie either within the range of subseries values or slightly above this demonstrates that minimum embedding dimension may fluctuate around a common value or potentially increase with length however as indicated in fig 9 time series length is not a necessary nor sufficient condition for high or low minimum embedding dimensions rather it is more likely for rivers with increasing embedding dimensions that the dynamics may evolve over time and the embedding dimension describing a longer period of the hydrological system is more complicated one explicit example of the sensitivity to record length is shown in fig 10 the embedding dimension computed for each series length is computed at 5 and 1 fnn with 5 showing fluctuations likely related to signal noise around a mostly steady value the 1 threshold shows a clearer increasing trend at 1 d e appears underestimated for records less than 10 years in length and with longer records the dimension increases slightly after 45 years of data both cases suggest that 10 years of record may be sufficient to obtain a decent estimate of de and that strictly comparative estimates should have similar lengths of at least this length so as to avoid non stationarity in embedding dimension estimates the displayed increase in complexity with the 1 threshold may result from long term shifts in streamflow generating processes related to climate variations this then suggests that changes in embedding dimension might be used to detect change in complexity and changes in streamflow generation though sensitivity to such changes is dependent on the criteria for calculating d e further comparisons with the 1 threshold can be found in the appendix as has been indicated by many authors e g freudiger et al 2014 mccabe et al 2007 vormoor et al 2016 there have been increases of rain and rain on snow generated streamflow in mountain catchments in north america and europe mountain streams in the western united states with periods of record spanning more than 80 years were analyzed to see if distinct changes in 10 year subperiod d e values were identifiable over time subtle changes in hydrographs were noticed such as the salmon river at somes bar california which showed a distinct spike in d e for the decades from 1946 to 1976 these decades coincided with some of the highest flows on record as well as multiple peak flows during single water years as well lamoille creek near lamoille nevada exhibited an increase from d e 12 to d e 14 over ten year periods spanning 1915 2015 this indicates d e is worth future investigation as a metric for understanding hydrological regime changes and the effect of the changing climate 3 3 2 degree of smoothing for both the latitudinal and longitudinal transects increasing the sliding average window size typically decreased values of d e though not always monotonically this general decreasing trend is to be expected as brief high peaks are averaged over more days and a smoother low frequency fluctuating structure appears on the pluvial end of the spectrum smoothing had a significant effect on the greenbrier river at durbin west virginia and indian kentuck creek near canaan indiana fig 11 a b values of d e reduced from 13 to 5 and 17 to 7 respectively when increasing smoothing from 2 days to 30 for both signals the effect of smoothing diminished after about 10 days though d e continued to slowly decrease some nival stations with snowmelt runoff occupying a large temporal portion of the hydrograph had a resiliency to smoothing that is the signal remained largely unchanged as fluctuations around the main flow structure were minimal in magnitude and smoothing negligibly affected false nearest neighbors the annual signal of snowmelt was not considerably altered up to 30 days of smoothing this is shown with examples of the pipestone river near lake louise and the north saskatchewan river at whirlpool point alberta in fig 11c and d where smoothing only decreases the embedding dimension from 10 to 7 though the magnitude of the two streams differ by an order of magnitude and the average peak flow differs by a month both are driven by similar snowmelt processes on the east side of the canadian rocky mountains and have nearly identical embedding dimensions for all degrees of smoothing some ephemeral streams in the southwestern united states and prairie streams with little seasonal structure did not respond with monotonically decreasing values of d e for increased smoothing rather a concave down shape appeared a five year example of two such smoothed time series kings creek near manhattan kansas and deep creek near palm desert california and are shown in fig 11a it is worth noting that at the 1 threshold this concave down shape did not appear and indicates the potential over sensitivity of the 5 threshold with largely unstructured signals as it stands this is a topic of further investigation and indicates that excessive smoothing may have the unintended result of disregarding complex dynamics critical for describing pluvial systems to further compare with the results of vignesh et al 2015 fnn calculations were conducted using monthly mean values the findings mimicked that of vignesh et al 2015 with eastern and west coast stations obtaining the lowest embedding dimensions and mountain west stations obtaining relatively higher measures of complexity fig 12 this is the inverse of what was found at daily timescales and is discussed more in section 4 d e values for all computation methods are available in the manuscript supplement 4 discussion the embedding dimensions determined using fnn from daily streamflow provides considerable insight into streamflow dynamics across north america streamflow characteristics are driven by flow generation mechanisms which are determined by the physical and biological properties of watersheds trancoso et al 2018 the utility of the method is demonstrated by estimating the minimum embedding dimension d e for 667 hydrological reference sites in north america and exploring the spatial distribution of d e rainfall driven and snowmelt driven hydrological systems exhibit distinctly different embedding dimensions fig 5 low embedding dimensions are found in nival rather than in pluvial watersheds large rather than small watersheds at high elevation rather than low elevation watersheds and at higher latitudes rather than low latitude watersheds a similar study by vignesh et al 2015 also compared fnn dimensions of monthly streamflow to catchment characteristics and streamflow statistical properties low embedding dimensions occurred at both low and high elevations in both studies but vignesh et al 2015 suggests that high values are predominant at low elevations this is not the case with the present study where the highest elevations were associated with lowest values of d e but the lowest elevations also had low values in both studies high embedding dimensions were associated only with lower mean flows fig 6 standard deviation of flow appears to be a weak measures of streamflow dynamics as there was no positive relationship with d e in contrast to vignesh et al 2015 it is clear that at the extremes of these explanatory variables there is some clarity but for each of these variables low and high embedding dimensions are obtained across most of the range porporato and ridolfi 2003 present a state space method reconstruction of a streamflow time series using nonlinear methods such as those proposed by abarbanel et al 1993 porporato and ridolfi 2003 detected low dimensional nonlinear components and dynamics and deterministic and nonlinear components on longer time scales when glaciers and snowmelt contribute to streamflow this is the case in the present work low embedding dimensions are associated with the predominance of snowmelt as a generating process and higher dimensions associated with seasonal or more random rainfall patterns at high embedding dimensions fnn failed for vignesh et al 2015 but this was not the case for our study even for cases that were non convergent cases using a 1 threshold appendix this is likely a difference in the codes used as they report that they followed the same geometric method of kennel this is also potentially a good indicator that their method was not overly resistant to noise it might also be a reason why they used monthly data and minimum d e values instead of a threshold abarbanel et al 1993 suggest that a 1 fnn threshold is sufficient for physicists interested in the dimension of dynamical systems for 14 of the cases considered here the fnn never falls below the 1 used in abarbanel et al 1993 see appendix for details other studies have avoided this problem by using correlation dimension instead of the fnn technique sivakumar et al 2015 or simply using the embedding dimension of the lowest fnn vignesh et al 2015 correlation dimensions also resulted in some rivers to be unidentifiable sivakumar et al 2015 in contrast to the fnn plots of vignesh et al 2015 there was a general decrease in fnn with increasing embedding dimension even for the non convergent cases figs a2 3 the reality might be that 1 is too strict for dealing with streamflow time series and we have used a 5 threshold here as 95 cases did not reach the 1 threshold by d e 30 there is a tradeoff as at 5 as d e computations are less stable and more sensitive to varying signal length and smoothing e g fig 10 11e f false nearest neighbor algorithms are invariant under linear translations and rescaling e g subtracting means and dividing by standard deviations additionally abarbanel et al 1993 demonstrated that the addition of uniform noise does not affect the embedding dimension in the lorenz and synthetic streamflow example the amount of white noise added affects the embedding dimension fig 2b but does so by affecting the percentage of false nearest neighbors in random subseries this sort of process in nature may have resulted in the threshold of 1 being too low as is evident in fig 2b and figs a1 and a3 synthetic data were used to explore several aspects of the determination of embedding dimension synthetic time series that mimic snowmelt rainfall and noise contributions to time series allow the embedding dimension to be explored in some detail to demonstrate that embedding dimension provides information about separation of these two processes the results from embedding dimensions on synthetic data show that the embedding dimension is lowest when dominated by a fixed period snowmelt signal and highest when dominated by a random rainfall signal fig 3 fig 4a the simulations showed that this change in dimension was quasi linear when only two signals contributed to the embedding dimension but the embedding dimensions obtained were much lower that with real streamflow time series which are obviously more complex fig 4a that the embedding dimension changes when the ratio of snowmelt to rainfall changes suggests that embedding dimension might be used to assess dynamic structure that changes over time either due to linear trends or climate system variability future work may lead to methods that approach measuring these changes more directly than current linear methods that try to demonstrate shifts in timing related to changes in generating processes burn and whitfield 2017 2018a b smoothing and the choice of a time delay are important considerations of the fnn method we used daily data with a five day smoothing based upon a desire to make fair comparisons between large and small basins whitfield 1998 showed that the information content of small and more pluvial watersheds were more information rich than large snowmelt driven watersheds the five day smoothing reduces the difference without over smoothing the mapping of de that vignesh et al 2015 provide for embedding dimensions for monthly data is qualitatively the opposite pattern to that presented in our fig 5 by mapping fnn embedding dimension vignesh et al 2015 demonstrate differences in variability in streamflow dynamics across the us lower delay times result in wider variability in the embedding dimension in the west than in the east fig 5 shows the results from our method daily streamflow smoothed to 5 days 5 threshold and an ami based time delay this plot is markedly different to that presented in vignesh et al 2015 using mean monthly data a 5 threshold and the same ami based time delay we obtain a result fig 12 that is similar to fig 3 provided in vignesh et al 2015 the main differences between the generation of the two figures is that we use a 5 threshold and they use of the embedding dimension of the minimum number of false nearest neighbors based upon five different delay times the dataset is also not identical though both sets of us data come from the us reference hydrological network the differences between fig 5 and fig 12 and to fig 3 of vignesh et al 2015 are due to the use of monthly data rather than smoothed daily data some of the relationships between d e and physical or statistical measures of streamflow were similar to those that vignesh et al 2015 had obtained using monthly data although vignesh et al 2015 found low embedding dimensions occur in both small and large drainage basins and relatively high embedding dimensions are associated only with small drainage areas our contention would be that while some smoothing of a daily streamflow series is necessary to deal with the basic issues of more information being present in small rainfall driven watersheds to make fair comparisons with larger or snowmelt driven systems the amount of smoothing should be small since over smoothing over simplifies the short time scale dynamics driving streamflow as mentioned above with the exception of khatibi et al 2012 who also used daily data all of the other papers we have cited use monthly data our view would be that the use of monthly data over smooths the short timescale dynamics and leads to incorrect results the sensitivity studies presented here demonstrate that a sufficient length of series is necessary but this length is short 10 years in fig 10 and increasing the length beyond this has no consistent effect between rivers we found no relationship between embedding dimension and total record length fig 9 when considering long term temporal changes such as those related to changes in climate and runoff generating processes a reasonable length of record is still needed to estimate an embedding dimension and to also allow multiple measurements of the dimension to be made over time we have demonstrated that embedding dimension does respond to changes in complexity over time in simple experiments with synthetic data fig 4a the sensitivity studies limited themselves to daily time steps it would be useful to extend the studies to smaller time steps to capture diel scale or finer processes finding such clear relationships in nature was more difficult and suggests further refinement of such a technique is necessary further development could complement maskey et al 2016 who used a deterministic fractal multifractal approach to identify fractal parameters in streamflow time series and showed that the time evolution of the parameters is useful for tracking and predicting change in streamflow generating processes future work should also consider how combinations of processes contribute to the complexity as such information would be useful in determining simulation model structure and for assessing changes over time particular where the relative contributions of processes change or processes are added or removed we examined the streamflow pattern from stations along two transects shown in fig 5 stations from the east to west transect are shown in fig 7 and from the south to north transect are shown in fig 8 along both transects the sites with the lowest embedding dimensions have strong snowmelt signatures where the variability in timing and magnitude of peak flows is lowest at high latitude and or high elevation the embedding dimensions are lowest peterson et al 1987 examined the hydrology of a north south transect of the west coast of north america trancoso et al 2018 examined how the biophysical properties from 354 catchments across a climatic gradient in australia contributed to hydrological attributes transects across a gradient or as in our case multiple gradients provide a useful check on the structure of results in figs 7 and 8 there are clear progressions in both embedding dimension and structure of the hydrograph related to the physical environments encountered along the transects many classification systems fail because they do not simultaneously deal with hydrograph shape magnitude and timing as examples hannah et al 2005 showed classification of hydrographs using shape and magnitude fleming et al 2007 showed that differences in latitude or elevation resulted in temporal shifts that place hydrographs generated by the same processes into different classes because of timing differences these are artifacts of using linear methods where non linear methods would be preferable in figs 5 7 and 8 it is clear that embedding dimension shows differences that are related to process differences and not simply temporal and magnitude shifts sivakumar et al 2007 argue on behalf of a globally accepted classification system for hydrology while we agree that a classification system in hydrology is desirable most classification systems place items in subjective bins based upon specific criteria sivakumar and singh 2012 used correlation dimension of 117 stations in the united states to create a four level classification low medium high and unidentifiable their classification shows some homogeneity within some regions but contained strong exceptions this supports the suggestion of burn and whitfield 2017 that discrete hydrologic regimes are an artificial construct and that the processes should be considered along a continuum sivakumar et al 2015 stress the need for a measurement of system complexity as a basis for a classification framework and identified the potential for nonlinear dynamics and other recent concepts of complex systems for assessing complexity sivakumar et al 2007 considered classification from a phase space perspective and building a classification based upon complexity sivakumar et al 2007 report attractors ranging from very clear to very blurred the embedding dimension results presented here and elsewhere suggest that hydrologic dynamics fall across a continuum and formal bins would not be appropriate the many mechanisms that govern river flow dynamics are expressed across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales porporato and ridolfi 2003 porporato and ridolfi 2003 report that the distinction between linearity and nonlinearity as a function of discharge becomes more precise as the attractor is better unfolded only at higher embedding dimensions up to m 9 while the present research did not focus on the existence of attractors we have demonstrated that embedding dimension is a useful measure for quantifying the pluvial nival continuum when estimated to much higher dimensions future work should also consider how combinations of processes contribute to the complexity as such information would be useful in determining simulation model structure and for assessing temporal changes where proportions of process contributions change or processes are added or removed similarly the methods may be also applied to other situations such as changing land use and urbanization within watersheds considering high dimensional descriptions of these streamflow processes as meaningful information and not the effect of meaningless noise is consistent with the theory that weather systems are unlikely to be able to represented at low dimensions lorenz 1991 abarbanel et al 1993 abarbanel and lall 1996 many of the pluvial rivers display high frequency dynamics and high embedding dimensions likely only represented at the weather system scale furthermore some ephemeral streams such as deep creek fig 11 respond directly to weather systems and only once every few years a return period that may be influenced by climate this degree of complexity should be considered before accurate representations of climate change in these hydrological systems are expected to be representable the necessity of a better understanding of the distinguishing factors of pluvial and nival rivers in changing climate has increased burn and whitfield 2017 if warming causes a shift to pluvial processes from nival processes more frequent rain on snow and rainfall driven floods may result burn and whitfield 2017 whitfield et al 2012 while nonlinear processes are common in hydrology the use of nonlinear methods is less so the mathematically rigorous procedures that can be used to examine the real world dynamics from time series that appear to be highly variable complex and often random huffaker et al 2017 such as was demonstrated here may improve our ability to understand watershed hydrological processes and diagnose change from streamflow time series while the difficulty of the methods remains a barrier dooge 1986 recent developments including the examples presented here suggest this is an area with great promise 5 conclusions a nonlinear false nearest neighbor approach was used to determine the minimum embedding dimension of 667 streamflow time series from reference hydrological stations across canada and the united states including alaska hawaii and puerto rico low embedding dimensions are found in cold areas at higher elevations and latitudes with strongly periodic snowmelt signals high embedding dimensions are associated with rainfall and less periodic more stochastic runoff patterns this suggests that embedding dimension is a useful measure of location on a previously hypothesized pluvial nival continuum burn and whitfield 2016 2017 and that high dimensions may actually be indicative of complex underlying physics not purely noise further investigation explaining the influence of specific noise generating processes in environmental studies would benefit future users of this method sensitivity investigations demonstrate that a streamflow time series of about 10 years duration may be sufficient to obtain a comparatively meaningful estimate of the embedding dimension low embedding dimension is associated with high latitude high and low elevation and large watersheds these are predominantly nival watersheds higher embedding dimensions are associated with smaller watersheds low elevations and low latitudes coastal areas of north america hawaii and puerto rico have higher embedding dimensions when using a 1 threshold for fnn some watersheds did not converge using a 5 threshold is perhaps more appropriate for streamflow time series as it reduced the number of non convergent cases reinterpreting high embedding dimensions as valuable information instead of smoothing for simpler results actually expands our working framework to allow for weather driven systems that have been known to be very high or infinite dimension and follows the suggestion of lorenz 1991 synthetic time series were used to demonstrate that embedding dimension captures the role of the mixture of rainfall and snowmelt in a streamflow time series synthetic time series result in lower embedding dimension than real streamflow series because they are less complex varying the mixture of snowmelt to rainfall over a long time series demonstrated that the embedding dimension can be used to diagnose changes over time in a single series the nonlinear fnn technique used here quantifies and accounts for hydrological processes that are highly variable complex and often random the differences in embedding dimension illustrate the relative position on the pluvial nival continuum and reflect the differences in complexity of these systems changes in the embedding dimension of the streamflow time series over time are expected to provide insight to changes in streamflow generating processes that result from climate variations global warming and land use change declaration of interests none acknowledgments the streamflow time series used in this study were obtained from the water survey of canada and united states geological survey web portals we would also like to thank john pomeroy for his comments and suggestions and for financial support from his grants from the canada research chairs programme nserc and alberta environment and sustainable development the comments and suggestions from two reviewers were helpful in preparing the final manuscript the authors declare no conflict of interest appendix abarbanel et al 1993 suggest that a 1 threshold of false nearest neighbors should be adequate for physics applications though hydrological data contains considerable noise with many compounding physical processes fig a1 shows the spatial map of embedding distances obtained using a 1 threshold with non convergence indicated with a value of d e 31 values ranged from 4 to the maximum dimension we allowed 30 non convergence is prevalent in vignesh et al 2015 and they addressed this issue by using the first dimension at which fnn reaches its minimum instead of a percent threshold sivakumar and singh 2012 considered those that did not converge to be unidentifiable the results obtained with the 1 threshold proposed by abarbanel et al 1993 are shown here and indicate that 5 may be a reasonable compromise for streamflow time series most of the non convergent sites at 1 appear as high d e sites at 5 indicating a high level of complexity was detected at both thresholds the non convergent watersheds are investigated in this appendix to address potential future improvements on the application of delay embedding dimensions to better understand streamflow dynamics the amount low or no flow conditions in non convergent streams is examined in fig a2 each non convergent watershed was binned into a 2 wide bin according to the temporal percent of no streamflow fig a2 top or 1 mean streamflow bottom the histograms indicate that while there is a higher proportion of non convergent watersheds with long low or no flow periods as compared to the total sample set there are still 30 of non convergent sites that have 2 of no flow in the entire time series similarly 18 of non convergent watersheds had 2 low flow in their entire time series this suggests that while periods of low flow are often present in high dimensional watersheds it is not a necessary condition for large d e this can be understood as a recurrent low or no flow season forces time series embedding returns to a periodic point that is a 0 dimensional subset in the delay embedding space this was also the case for the synthetic pure snowmelt signal in section 3 1 instead it is actually the irregularity of the on off signal that increases the complexity of the signal and continues to generate false nearest neighbors thus forcing a higher embedding dimension in hydrology this could be manifested by irregular rain events as seen above variable snowmelt runoff or multiple snowmelt peaks among other processes in fig a3 we show the results for the 95 cases that never reached the 1 threshold and were considered non convergent the positive direction on the horizontal axis represents increases in embedding dimension and the raster plot shows a decreasing trend in fnn for all watersheds when the fnn falls below a 5 threshold the colormap transition to a brown color scheme for clarity some cases fall below the 5 and 10 thresholds at d e 5 or 6 while only one still fails to converge by an embedding dimension of 30 it is worth noting that this river dry creek at union city california converged at d e 50 and was largely ephemeral containing 65 no flow in fig a4 we show the decreasing fnn for 10 non convergent stations selected at random to show that some of these stations reach a minimum without that minimum being below the 1 threshold five year periods of streamflow for these 10 rivers are displayed in the lower subplots of fig a4 the majority of the rivers show complex irregular rain fall influenced dynamics but an irregular snowmelt signal in british columbia canada is also presented fig a4j showing snowmelt alone does not guarantee low embedding dimension abarbanel et al 1993 figure 17 and our fig 2b show that noise in the streamflow record would not affect the embedding dimension but would affect the threshold that can be achieved one technique to address high values of fnn may be the cleaning technique as suggested by abarbanel et al 1993 as many of the non convergent time series in the present work contain periods with zero discharge exploring this issue is a subject for future investigations a reasonable compromise of a 5 threshold instead of the 1 abarbanel et al 1993 may appropriately account for the dynamics and noise present in streamflow signals the corresponding relationships between d e basin characteristics and streamflow statistics with this threshold can also be found in that plot fig a5 note that the scatter plots effectively show the same patterns as fig 6 
6628,the nonlinear dynamics of streamflow time series from 667 reference hydrometric stations in north america spanning the pluvial nival hydrological continuum are explored using minimum embedding dimensions as determined by false nearest neighbor fnn methods simulations using synthetic time series demonstrate that snowmelt dominated time series have lower embedding dimensions than those that are rainfall dominated and that mixtures of the two processes result in a nearly linear change in the embedding dimension the majority of the reference hydrometric stations drop below a 1 threshold at a dimension less than 30 showing a high degree of natural complexity in the signals ranging from annual snowmelt to weather driven pseudo stochastic systems a less restrictive threshold 5 is suggested to be more appropriate for streamflow time series time series smoothing impacts the embedding dimension and over smoothing results in incorrect reductions of embedding dimensions the relationship of the embedding dimensions to watershed and statistical properties of streamflow record showed the lowest embedding dimensions are restricted to large drainage areas high elevations and large mean annual flows and variance high autocorrelations and large fractions of the records with only small changes in magnitude times series that have a large proportion of consecutive days of equal streamflow typically result in higher embedding dimensions mapping of the embedding dimension shows spatial patterns related to the streamflow generating processes and geographical features the use of embedding dimension resolved different dynamics across the hydrological continuum for rainfall to snowmelt over many climate zones changes in the embedding dimension might indicate process changes related to climate variability and change keywords streamflow climate change pluvial nival spectrum delay embedding space nonlinear analysis false nearest neighbor 1 introduction rainfall driven and snowmelt driven hydrological systems exhibit distinct streamflow behavior and shape their landscapes differently in changing climates the necessity of a better understanding of the distinguishing factors of pluvial and nival rivers has increased burn and whitfield 2017 for example if typically nival rivers receive more rain events in the future flood generating mechanisms will change as will the magnitude and frequency of rain on snow floods the ability to diagnose such process changes in hydrology is still limited the present research seeks to illuminate and quantify the pluvial to nival spectrum through nonlinear time series analysis of streamflow time series from a large collection of north american reference hydrological stations the ability to quantify the position on this spectrum based upon historical data can contribute to detecting changes in process related to future climate variations and change hydrology is fundamentally a study of nonlinear processes conducted extensively with linear methods amorocho 1963 1967 schertzer et al 2010 argue that simplistic approximations in linear operational hydrological models are divorced from hydrological theory this need not be the case as the real world dynamics of hydrological systems that appear to be highly variable complex and often random may be diagnosed reconstructed characterized and modelled using mathematically rigorous procedures coulibaly and baldwin 2005 huffaker et al 2017 operational hydrology often ignores nonlinear aspects included in theoretical hydrology schertzer et al 2010 seasonal patterns of streamflow and other hydroclimatic variables is a widely covered topic in hydrology flow regime classification the classification of hydrographs based upon streamflow generating mechanisms or other common hydrological features seldom has included nonlinear techniques because of the difficulty of the methods dooge 1986 objective methods have been attempted with shape and magnitude classification for proglacial stream hydrographs hannah et al 2000 or classifications of patterns of peaks and their timing to associate sites the latter methods suffer at larger scales and in complex terrain where differences in latitude and elevation result in the same pattern being identified in separate clusters fleming et al 2007 swain et al 2016 used nonlinear techniques self organized maps and kernel principle components analysis to classify streamflow signatures and found nonlinear methods outperformed linear approaches principal components analysis and k means furthermore sivakumar et al 2007 make the point that linear tools such as autocorrelation and power spectrum may not be adequate for studying system complexity where the use of nonlinear concepts is necessary it is well known that climatic variables and trends influence hydrological regimes and complicate classifications fleming et al 2007 showed that ocean circulation patterns such as enso and the pacific decadal oscillation have different impacts on different streamflow regimes or rather the streamflow generating processes hannaford and buys 2012 examined trends in flow regimes in the uk in relation to climate and observed increased winter flows and high flows associated with increased rainfall and spatial heterogeneity in trends arnell and gosling 2013 examined how indicators of hydrologic regime might be affected in a future climate where shifts in timing of snowmelt is an indicator coopersmith et al 2014 demonstrated regional differences in runoff regime in the united states measuring shifts in indicators of regimes and that the expansion of the regimes from the american southeast to the north and west generally reflect the projected increased role of precipitation and decrease in snow untangling how changes in the climatic system affect hydrological processes is a complex nonlinear problem nonlinear time series analysis is a rich field of mathematics involving many methods adapted from the study of dynamical systems kantz and schreiber 2003 a time series can be viewed as a one dimensional measurement of a dynamical system and the behavior and evolution of the full system can be represented and analyzed in a phase space phase space or state space is an abstract construction that allows a dynamical system to be presented in multiple dimensions each coordinate representing a key feature of the system and each point representing a specific state if one considers all the hydrological processes that exist in a watershed as components of a dynamical system a few processes may dominate and result in a low dimensional system as more processes exist or the more complex the processes and their timing the higher the dimension of the dynamical system becomes the time evolution of a hydrological system can be represented in phase space but as in all natural sciences hydrologists are only able to obtain measurements of a subset of the active hydrological process this means hydrologists always work with a lower dimensional phase space that represents the state of a watershed through a finite number of hydrological variables e g streamflow meteorology ground water that are measured at discrete times thus attempting a full phase space representation is classically problematic as all the relevant variables are not always measured takens theorem takens 1981 fortunately proves that the full behavior of a dynamical system can be studied by looking at a time delay embedding of a subspace of the full phase space for hydrologists the implication of takens theorem is that the dimension of the dominant dynamics in a basin can be identified from just the streamflow time series furthermore if a dynamical system contains a strange attractor of dimension m takens theorem and the whitney embedding theorem prove that this attractor can be fully unfolded in an embedding space of dimension 2 m 1 this minimum embedding dimension can be considered a metric of complexity or stochasticity of the processes in the basin sivakumar and singh 2012 from a hydrological perspective a time delay embedded time series may be low dimensional if there is consistent magnitude and timing of a dominant runoff process through the choice of the delay parameter τ this process may be attributed to short or long cycles and trends in precipitation a high embedding dimension may be caused by variable timing of runoff such that the delay τ is insufficient to return the embedded time series to the same neighborhoods of the phase space variable magnitude the presence of stochastic processes or other complex mechanisms kennel et al 1992 explored how to determine the acceptable minimum embedding dimension by examining nearest neighbors the embedding dimension allows a time delay reconstruction of a phase space that then illustrates the system dynamics kostelich and yorke 1990 for physicists the recommended procedure seeks to reduce the number of false nearest neighbors to less than 1 kennel et al 1992 1997 though 5 may be sufficient for hydrologists kennel et al 1992 proposed the geometric unfolding method to determine the number of false nearest neighbors that was used here this technique has seen limited application in hydrology and can be supplemented with recurrence plots to visualize recurrent patterns in a time series such as by zbilut and webber 1992 and march et al 2005 khatibi et al 2012 investigated chaotic behavior in river stage and discharge time series using five nonlinear methods phase space reconstruction false nearest neighbors correlation dimension lyapunov exponents and a local approximation method they showed that low dimensional chaotic structure exists in the two time series studied mann et al 1995 lall and mann 1995 and lall et al 1996 demonstrated early connections between decadal climate variation and the variations in the volume of great salt lake a 100 000 km2 closed basin suggesting that decadal variations in volume follow low frequency shifting of storm tracks abarbanel et al 1996 and abarbanel and lall 1996 examined this reconstructed 1842 1992 15 day time series of lake volume sangoyomi et al 1996 using nonlinear methods including fnn and showed that the system dynamic has an embedding dimension of 4 with components lagged by 6 months this large basin smooths a large number of atmospheric and climatological motions reducing the complexity but retaining its long term climate sensing while a number of analyses of climate and weather data find low dimensional attractors e g abarbanel and lall 1996 lall et al 1996 and others lorenz 1991 indicates that the actual climate attractor is likely to be of much higher dimension and gives several reasons for evidence of low dimensional representations abarbanel and lall 1996 suggest that analyses similar to those they present might work for large rivers e g mississippi where the smoothing of the climate signal is large but small streams may be more difficult to analyze either because of increased complexity in the dynamics or because of a relatively poor signal to noise ratio in the data sivakumar et al 2002 investigated correlation dimension as an indicator of low dimensional chaotic structure in hydrological time series using monthly runoff for 48 years the correlation dimension was in agreement with the optimal embedding dimension of the phase space suggesting it could make a reliable indicator we would comment that using monthly data removed so much noise and structure from the time series as to not be a sufficient test as demonstrated below sivakumar 2004 proposed a procedure to identify dominant processes that used correlation dimension to quantify the number of processes expert knowledge to identify the processes and a sensitivity analysis to order the processes by dominance they suggest that more effort be placed on finding patterns and hidden order sivakumar et al 2007 explored the classification issue from the perspective of a simple phase state reconstruction technique representing a multidimensional system using a single variable time series through a delay coordinate procedure the complexity of the reconstruction can then be used to classify systems as low medium or high depending on a user chosen metric for whichever embedding dimension was used sivakumar et al 2007 sivakumar and singh 2012 argue that hydrological systems are appropriate for such a classification applying the correlation dimension method to monthly streamflow time series from more than 100 watersheds they describe four categories low medium and high complexity and unidentifiable sivakumar and singh 2012 this classification scheme provided some local homogeneity but exceptions existed in contrast tongal and sivakumar 2017 consider a cross entropy clustering method that used embedding dimension sample entropy and a coefficient of variability the combination of nonlinear and linear variables successfully determined distinct flow generating mechanisms in different parts of australia vignesh et al 2015 used a false nearest neighbor fnn algorithm to examine the spatial variability over a region of the united states using monthly streamflow data vignesh et al 2015 varied the delay time values monthly seasonal annual autocorrelation and the average mutual information and found that the fnn embedding dimensions may or may not change with different delay times in contrast to a fixed fnn threshold such as by abarbanel et al 1993 vignesh et al 2015 simply use the embedding dimension of the lowest fnn by mapping fnn embedding dimension vignesh et al 2015 demonstrate differences in variability in streamflow dynamics across the us lower delay times result in wider variability in the embedding dimension in the west than in the east vignesh et al 2015 also compared fnn dimensions to catchment characteristics and streamflow statistical properties low embedding dimensions occur in both small and large drainage basins but high embedding dimensions are associated only with small drainage areas low embedding dimensions occur at both low and high elevations but high values are only at low elevations high embedding dimensions are associated only with low annual mean flows since embedding dimension and coefficient of variation are both measures of variability nonlinear and linear there has been shown to be a positive relationship between them vignesh et al 2015 the previous review of the field indicates that using the minimum embedding dimension as an indicator of the hydrologic regime is a novel application of the technique the basic hypothesis of the present research is that a simple annual snowmelt signal e g a modified sine curve will reflect a low dimensional dynamical system and thus will have a low minimum embedding dimension respectively pluvial systems may have strong seasonal patterns but are more stochastic at single day time steps than snowmelt and cannot be fully unfolded at low dimensions and thus the false nearest neighbor calculations are expected to produce higher minimum embedding dimension expanding our focus beyond low dimensional systems allows a consideration of chaotic or stochastic signals not as merely evidence of meaningless noise but rather as signals representing a poorly understood and much more complex weather driven process abarbanel and lall 1996 it is shown that excessive smoothing may have the adverse effect of destroying information that is actually characteristic of a hydrologic regime and it should not be assumed a priori that hydrological systems can represented with only a few state variables the present study uses both synthetic time series that mimic snowmelt rainfall and noise contributions and streamflow time series from 667 hydrological reference sites in north america this allows the embedding dimension to be explored in some detail to demonstrate that minimum embedding dimensions provide information about separation of these two processes a sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess the effects on minimum embedding dimension d e several hydrologically important influences 1 how long and or how much of a streamflow record is required to determine d e 2 does the scaling of the time series affect d e 3 does the basin area and elevation affect d e 4 how much averaging is required to reduce random noise to the point where a d e estimate can be found and what happens if over smoothing results and 5 how is d e related to statistical properties of the time series the utility of the method is demonstrated by estimating the minimum embedding dimension for hydrological reference sites in north america and exploring the spatial distribution of d e 2 methods the theoretical basis for the false nearest neighbor methodology is outlined first followed by the nature of the streamflow time series from reference hydrologic networks and the synthetic time series used in method testing 2 1 delay embedding spaces and false nearest neighbors for a one dimensional time series measurement of a nonlinear system x t a time delay reconstruction can be used to view the underlying dynamics the parameterized curve y n t x t x t τ x t τ n 1 where τ is a choice of time delay and n is the dimension chosen to unfold the dynamics of the system traces out an orbit in the system the convention used in the present research is a time delay at which the average mutual information ami is one fifth of the value attained at no time delay cf abarbanel et al 1993 and will not be a focus of the current research the choice of one fifth ami instead of the time of first local minimum was necessary as some time series had ami that was monotonically decreasing the central premise of this study is to find an appropriate dimension n at which the full dynamics of the system can be unfolded while there are several techniques to estimate this value the geometric approach of kennel et al 1992 to identify the minimum dimension through identification of false nearest neighbors fnn is widely used and sufficient for comparison of hydrological systems an efficient fnn computation script written in matlab from the university of potsdam http tocsy pik potsdam de crptoolbox marwan et al 2007 was used this code calculates the embedding dimension of the total time series with a cost saving computation based on identifying fnn for many subsections of the time series and can result in small variability from one approximation to the next as the focus on this research will not be on identifying behavior that results in each dimension this small variability was deemed acceptable and did not influence the results detailed explanations of the theory of fnn can be found elsewhere e g abarbanel et al 1993 kantz and schreiber 2003 but a brief explanation is given here for completeness for a given time t and a point y n t x t x t τ x t τ n 1 in the orbit of our time series in an embedding space of dimension n the r th nearest neighbor to y n t call it y n r t is a point at the euclidean distance r n 2 t r k 0 n 1 x t k τ x r t k τ 2 kennel et al 1992 use two criteria that may designate this neighbor as false by comparing r n 2 t r to r n 1 2 t r k 0 n x t k τ x r t k τ 2 the distance of the same two orbital points in the next higher delay embedding dimension the first criterion eliminates points that only appear close in a given dimension because the orbit is not fully unfolded in a higher dimension where the orbit is actually unfolded the points are relatively far apart this is demonstrated in fig 1 where for simplicity our orbit of points all fall on a circle points a and b on the circle appear close when projected onto one dimension n 1 but in reality are far apart when the orbit is fully unfolded n 2 points a and c are examples of true nearest neighbors this criterion is formally stated as y n r t is a fnn to y n t if r n 1 2 t r r n 2 t r r n 2 t r 1 2 x t n τ x r t n τ r n t r r tol where r tol 10 is sufficient the second criterion helps manage the influence of high dimensional noise in nonlinear systems that have a limited time series length if the closest point to y n t is actually not close that is r n t r is of the order of the width of the orbit and r n 1 t r is also large then y n r t should also be considered false formally r n 1 t 1 r a a tol where r a 2 1 n t x t x 2 and x 1 n t x t and n is the length of the time series in the kennel method the first dimension d e at which the percent of nearest neighbors that are false drops below 1 is then defined as d e we found that the 1 threshold was too restrictive for streamflow data that contains significant noise and about 14 of the cases failed to converge appendix instead a threshold of 5 resulted in only one case which did not converge so that threshold was used for the remainder of this study it is worth noting that the two criteria are also unaffected by linear translation and rescaling consider a time series x t and a modified series y t a x t b where a and b are real numbers and their respective metrics r n x r n y r a x and r a y r n y 2 t r k 0 n 1 y t k τ y r t k τ 2 k 0 n 1 ax t k τ b a x r t k τ b 2 a 2 k 0 n 1 x t k τ x r t k τ 2 a 2 r n x 2 t r thus r n 1 y 2 t r r n y 2 t r r n y 2 t r 1 2 a 2 r n 1 x 2 t r a 2 r n x 2 t r a 2 r n x 2 t r 1 2 r n 1 x 2 t r r n x 2 t r r n x 2 t r 1 2 similarly y 1 n t ax t b 1 n nb a t x t b a x r a y 2 1 n t y t a x b 2 1 n t ax t a x 2 a 2 r a x 2 and r n 1 y t 1 r a y r n 1 x t 1 r a x this implies it is not necessary or beneficial to standardize the streamflow prior to analysis it is not the mean flow or the absolute range of streamflow values measured that determines d e but only the dynamics of the flow fnn were calculated for embedding dimensions ranging from 1 to 30 for each time series a transition to a dynamical system with more noise or with more stochastic determinism results in more fnn at higher dimensions and generates potentially spurious d e requirements kennel et al 1992 this measure of complexity may help quantify where a basin exists on the spectrum of pluvial to nival as determined by a river streamflow time series additionally non stationarity in the hydrographs and year to year shifts on the pluvial nival spectrum will also add complex dynamics to the system and potentially increase d e an example of the fnn embedding dimension estimate applied to the x component of the classic lorenz system can be seen in fig 2 this particular system is governed by the system of ordinary differential equations dx dt 10 y x dy dt x 28 z y dz dt x y 8 z 3 and the strange attractor is fully unfolded in three dimensions shown in fig 2a the color of the parametric curve varies with rescaled time from t 0 to t 1 as seen in the color bar the effect of adding random sections of uniformly distributed noise to 30 of the time series x t potentially representative of signal noise or an additional complementary stochastic process is seen in fig 2b here the percent of fnn per embedding dimension for the clean signal x t and noisy signals x noise t are displayed for the clean signal the percent of fnn drops below 1 at n 4 and reaches 0 at n 7 which is sufficient for the lorenz attractor of dimension m 2 06 according to the whitney embedding theorem the amplitude of the added noise was twice the standard deviation of x t and increased d e to 15 it is worth noting the fnn estimates of d e were unaffected if the noise was added to the entire time series as intended by the algorithm design 2 2 dataset the daily streamflow time series used in the following analysis consists of records from 462 usgs reference hydrological stations in the contiguous united states hawaii alaska and puerto rico as well as 205 reference sites in canada reference hydrological stations were chosen as they are thought to be minimally affected by land use changes and their dynamics only vary with time as a result of climate whitfield et al 2012 the time series of streamflow were required to span at least 40 years but measurement gaps resulted in a length of data ranging from 27 to 107 years prior to fnn calculations time series of streamflow were smoothed by a 5 day sliding average this is in accordance with the work of whitfield 1998 that suggests a smoothing of high frequency components shorter than five days allows a fairer comparison between large and small streams a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effect of the amount of smoothing on d e for all stations in an east to west transect between 38 5 n and 39 5 n and all stations in a north to south transect between 114 5 w and 116 5 w these bands were chosen as they included a large geographic span of stations and did not result in an overly burdensome number of extra calculations d e was calculated for the entire duration of each time series in the transects with sliding window sizes varying from 2 to 30 days during preprocessing since climate and weather are largely non stationary and the method here treats streamflow data as stationary a sensitivity analysis that examined the effect of time series length was also conducted for the same transects of stations d e was calculated with a fixed sliding window size of 5 days with the length of series ranging from 10 to 66 of the entire series length d e was calculated for multiple sections of the original time series at each shortened length 10 4 4 2 and 2 sections for 10 25 33 50 66 respectively with the start dates chosen randomly in the series basin drainage area and elevation and streamflow record statistical properties were examined to assess how they may be related to d e statistical properties included mean annual flow the standard deviation and the autocorrelation of the streamflow record at a time lag equivalent to that used for the d e calculation some of the streamflow records contain extended periods of zero discharge and we calculated the fraction of the total records where there was no change in flow from one day to the next to address this 2 3 synthetic signals to further test the theory that fnn can help classify hydrographs on a continuum from rainfall to snowmelt driven systems synthetic 50 year time series of river flow were generated three fundamental building block mechanisms were created to generate synthetic streamflows these include rainfall snowmelt and white noise linear combinations of the three components were varied and d e was computed to identify the effect of the transition from a snowmelt to a rainfall driven system examples of three different synthetic streamflows can be found in fig 3 the presence of rainfall contribution to streamflow was arbitrarily chosen to occupy no more than 30 of the time series the start date of the influence of a rainfall event was randomly chosen in the time series as was a random duration of 1 5 days during these 1 to 5 day periods the rainfall signal rf t consisted of uniformly distributed noise with values in the open set 0 1 the remaining rainfall signal consisted of zeros the fundamental snowmelt signal sm t consisted of a rescaled sine curve with a period of 1 year and a range of 0 1 the sine curve was unchanged for two hundred days of the year surrounding the maximum the remaining days were set to a fixed base flow equal to the 200th day of the snowmelt oscillation constant uniformly distributed random values n t were also added to the time series the final synthetic river flow was of the form 1 f t a r f t b s m t c n t where a b c 1 values of a ranged from 0 to 0 9 and c was fixed at 0 1 the same preprocessing and fnn calculations described in the previous section were applied to these synthetic time series 3 results 3 1 synthetic data synthetic streamflow time series as described in section 2 3 were generated and analyzed to test whether increasing the relative amplitude of random days of rainfall contribution to streamflow would increase the embedding dimension from a simulated nival baseline a plot comparing the minimum delay embedding dimension of the synthetic river signals versus the value of coefficient a in eq 1 can be found in fig 4 a as the rainfall coefficient a in eq 1 increased from 0 to 0 9 the minimum delay embedding dimension increased nearly linearly from 5 to 13 in fig 4b the increase of fnn for each embedding dimension for increasingly pluvial regimes is also displayed fig 4 indicates that d e and false nearest neighbors could be used as a measure of the shift in runoff in a simple nival to a pluvial transition as a further investigation in the ability to diagnose changes in the streamflow generating processes a synthetic time series was generated that spanned 100 years with a linear transition of a b 0 0 9 nival at year 1 to a b 0 9 0 pluvial at year 100 minimum embedding dimensions were calculated for consecutive 10 and 20 year subsections to see if d e could identify the regime change over time as could be suspected by the previous synthetic time series analysis the embedding dimension steadily increased with time from d e 6 in years 1 10 to d e 12 in years 91 100 results using 20 year subsections were similar this indicates potential for diagnostic applications in climatic regions undergoing transitions from snowmelt to rainfall dominant processes and is further investigated with real streamflow time series in section 3 2 it should be noted that the synthetic time series were unable to attain the same level of complexity and the same range of minimum embedding dimensions as the natural signals this is understandable because of their fundamentally simple construction and the ability of the fnn algorithm to disregard white noise kennel et al 1992 3 2 hydrological network analysis the minimum delay embedding dimension was computed for all 667 stream flow time series values ranged from 3 to a maximum possible dimension of 30 and can be seen in fig 5 the one series where the percent of fnn never dropped below 5 is marked in fig 5 as having an embedding dimension of 31 outside the range of calculated values this time series dry creek at union city ca did eventually drop below 5 fnn at a dimension of 50 a transition to lower embedding dimensions suggesting less complexity in the flow can be seen in much of the colder snow dominated northern regions of fig 5 as well as in the major mountain ranges in the east and west a complementary plot computed at the 1 threshold is available in the appendix fig a1 the spectrum of values reached its peaks primarily along the west coast and into parts of the desert southwest as well as a region spanning portions of the canadian prairies and united states great plains southwards to the gulf coast of texas and louisiana similar to the findings of vignesh et al 2015 d e had a slight dependence on the size of the drainage area with the lowest values of d e only being attained from the largest basins fig 6 a a5 and document supplement but low and high values of de are seen across the range of basin areas and elevations similarly the lowest embedding dimensions were associated with high annual mean flow fig 6c high flow variance fig 6d autocorrelation fig 6e and low first differenced zeros fig 6f while this was true for the lowest embedding dimensions a range of low and high embedding dimensions are observed below the maximum of these ranges to further investigate this spectrum of d e a sensitivity analysis for 37 stations along an east to west transect between the latitudes of 38 5 and 39 5 n and 24 stations along a north to south transect between 114 5 and 116 5 w was conducted these transects are indicated as the regions bounded by red lines in fig 5 regime plots and embedding dimension de for selected stations in the east to west longitudinal and north to south latitudinal transects can be found in figs 7 and 8 regime plots summarize the seasonal variation of streamflow showing the mean and median discharge and the 0 1 to 0 9 quantiles with the maximum and minimum values being shown as points from the regime plots in each transect it is clear that the most snow dominated watersheds those that exhibit large peaks in flow during spring and summer have low embedding dimensions e g fig 7f g fig 8c h where rainfall has a seasonally consistent pattern higher embedding dimensions are observed fig 7b d where the streamflow pattern has little or no seasonal structure fig 7a e h fig 8a b the highest embedding dimensions greater than 13 and up to 23 were found along this transect 3 3 sensitivity analysis an evaluation of the kennel et al 1992 fnn method as a tool to determine stream flow complexity was conducted this involved varying the length of record investigated for all stations and the degree of smoothing applied in preprocessing for the two transects across north america shown in fig 5 3 3 1 length of series for the 667 stations the length of streamflow time series varied in length from 27 to 107 years and did not appear to directly affect the embedding dimension fig 9 stations along the two transects were resampled to provide shorter records of 10 66 of the full record length multiple runs were analyzed for each shortened record with the start dates randomly chosen as detailed in section 2 2 the d e calculated from the entire time series was either within the range of values calculated or slightly greater never more than 2 dimensions than the range obtained from the collection of subseries no full series values of d e were less than the minimum value calculated for a subseries indicating complexity was never simplified when looking at a larger time window it was equally likely for d e in a pluvial or nival system to lie either within the range of subseries values or slightly above this demonstrates that minimum embedding dimension may fluctuate around a common value or potentially increase with length however as indicated in fig 9 time series length is not a necessary nor sufficient condition for high or low minimum embedding dimensions rather it is more likely for rivers with increasing embedding dimensions that the dynamics may evolve over time and the embedding dimension describing a longer period of the hydrological system is more complicated one explicit example of the sensitivity to record length is shown in fig 10 the embedding dimension computed for each series length is computed at 5 and 1 fnn with 5 showing fluctuations likely related to signal noise around a mostly steady value the 1 threshold shows a clearer increasing trend at 1 d e appears underestimated for records less than 10 years in length and with longer records the dimension increases slightly after 45 years of data both cases suggest that 10 years of record may be sufficient to obtain a decent estimate of de and that strictly comparative estimates should have similar lengths of at least this length so as to avoid non stationarity in embedding dimension estimates the displayed increase in complexity with the 1 threshold may result from long term shifts in streamflow generating processes related to climate variations this then suggests that changes in embedding dimension might be used to detect change in complexity and changes in streamflow generation though sensitivity to such changes is dependent on the criteria for calculating d e further comparisons with the 1 threshold can be found in the appendix as has been indicated by many authors e g freudiger et al 2014 mccabe et al 2007 vormoor et al 2016 there have been increases of rain and rain on snow generated streamflow in mountain catchments in north america and europe mountain streams in the western united states with periods of record spanning more than 80 years were analyzed to see if distinct changes in 10 year subperiod d e values were identifiable over time subtle changes in hydrographs were noticed such as the salmon river at somes bar california which showed a distinct spike in d e for the decades from 1946 to 1976 these decades coincided with some of the highest flows on record as well as multiple peak flows during single water years as well lamoille creek near lamoille nevada exhibited an increase from d e 12 to d e 14 over ten year periods spanning 1915 2015 this indicates d e is worth future investigation as a metric for understanding hydrological regime changes and the effect of the changing climate 3 3 2 degree of smoothing for both the latitudinal and longitudinal transects increasing the sliding average window size typically decreased values of d e though not always monotonically this general decreasing trend is to be expected as brief high peaks are averaged over more days and a smoother low frequency fluctuating structure appears on the pluvial end of the spectrum smoothing had a significant effect on the greenbrier river at durbin west virginia and indian kentuck creek near canaan indiana fig 11 a b values of d e reduced from 13 to 5 and 17 to 7 respectively when increasing smoothing from 2 days to 30 for both signals the effect of smoothing diminished after about 10 days though d e continued to slowly decrease some nival stations with snowmelt runoff occupying a large temporal portion of the hydrograph had a resiliency to smoothing that is the signal remained largely unchanged as fluctuations around the main flow structure were minimal in magnitude and smoothing negligibly affected false nearest neighbors the annual signal of snowmelt was not considerably altered up to 30 days of smoothing this is shown with examples of the pipestone river near lake louise and the north saskatchewan river at whirlpool point alberta in fig 11c and d where smoothing only decreases the embedding dimension from 10 to 7 though the magnitude of the two streams differ by an order of magnitude and the average peak flow differs by a month both are driven by similar snowmelt processes on the east side of the canadian rocky mountains and have nearly identical embedding dimensions for all degrees of smoothing some ephemeral streams in the southwestern united states and prairie streams with little seasonal structure did not respond with monotonically decreasing values of d e for increased smoothing rather a concave down shape appeared a five year example of two such smoothed time series kings creek near manhattan kansas and deep creek near palm desert california and are shown in fig 11a it is worth noting that at the 1 threshold this concave down shape did not appear and indicates the potential over sensitivity of the 5 threshold with largely unstructured signals as it stands this is a topic of further investigation and indicates that excessive smoothing may have the unintended result of disregarding complex dynamics critical for describing pluvial systems to further compare with the results of vignesh et al 2015 fnn calculations were conducted using monthly mean values the findings mimicked that of vignesh et al 2015 with eastern and west coast stations obtaining the lowest embedding dimensions and mountain west stations obtaining relatively higher measures of complexity fig 12 this is the inverse of what was found at daily timescales and is discussed more in section 4 d e values for all computation methods are available in the manuscript supplement 4 discussion the embedding dimensions determined using fnn from daily streamflow provides considerable insight into streamflow dynamics across north america streamflow characteristics are driven by flow generation mechanisms which are determined by the physical and biological properties of watersheds trancoso et al 2018 the utility of the method is demonstrated by estimating the minimum embedding dimension d e for 667 hydrological reference sites in north america and exploring the spatial distribution of d e rainfall driven and snowmelt driven hydrological systems exhibit distinctly different embedding dimensions fig 5 low embedding dimensions are found in nival rather than in pluvial watersheds large rather than small watersheds at high elevation rather than low elevation watersheds and at higher latitudes rather than low latitude watersheds a similar study by vignesh et al 2015 also compared fnn dimensions of monthly streamflow to catchment characteristics and streamflow statistical properties low embedding dimensions occurred at both low and high elevations in both studies but vignesh et al 2015 suggests that high values are predominant at low elevations this is not the case with the present study where the highest elevations were associated with lowest values of d e but the lowest elevations also had low values in both studies high embedding dimensions were associated only with lower mean flows fig 6 standard deviation of flow appears to be a weak measures of streamflow dynamics as there was no positive relationship with d e in contrast to vignesh et al 2015 it is clear that at the extremes of these explanatory variables there is some clarity but for each of these variables low and high embedding dimensions are obtained across most of the range porporato and ridolfi 2003 present a state space method reconstruction of a streamflow time series using nonlinear methods such as those proposed by abarbanel et al 1993 porporato and ridolfi 2003 detected low dimensional nonlinear components and dynamics and deterministic and nonlinear components on longer time scales when glaciers and snowmelt contribute to streamflow this is the case in the present work low embedding dimensions are associated with the predominance of snowmelt as a generating process and higher dimensions associated with seasonal or more random rainfall patterns at high embedding dimensions fnn failed for vignesh et al 2015 but this was not the case for our study even for cases that were non convergent cases using a 1 threshold appendix this is likely a difference in the codes used as they report that they followed the same geometric method of kennel this is also potentially a good indicator that their method was not overly resistant to noise it might also be a reason why they used monthly data and minimum d e values instead of a threshold abarbanel et al 1993 suggest that a 1 fnn threshold is sufficient for physicists interested in the dimension of dynamical systems for 14 of the cases considered here the fnn never falls below the 1 used in abarbanel et al 1993 see appendix for details other studies have avoided this problem by using correlation dimension instead of the fnn technique sivakumar et al 2015 or simply using the embedding dimension of the lowest fnn vignesh et al 2015 correlation dimensions also resulted in some rivers to be unidentifiable sivakumar et al 2015 in contrast to the fnn plots of vignesh et al 2015 there was a general decrease in fnn with increasing embedding dimension even for the non convergent cases figs a2 3 the reality might be that 1 is too strict for dealing with streamflow time series and we have used a 5 threshold here as 95 cases did not reach the 1 threshold by d e 30 there is a tradeoff as at 5 as d e computations are less stable and more sensitive to varying signal length and smoothing e g fig 10 11e f false nearest neighbor algorithms are invariant under linear translations and rescaling e g subtracting means and dividing by standard deviations additionally abarbanel et al 1993 demonstrated that the addition of uniform noise does not affect the embedding dimension in the lorenz and synthetic streamflow example the amount of white noise added affects the embedding dimension fig 2b but does so by affecting the percentage of false nearest neighbors in random subseries this sort of process in nature may have resulted in the threshold of 1 being too low as is evident in fig 2b and figs a1 and a3 synthetic data were used to explore several aspects of the determination of embedding dimension synthetic time series that mimic snowmelt rainfall and noise contributions to time series allow the embedding dimension to be explored in some detail to demonstrate that embedding dimension provides information about separation of these two processes the results from embedding dimensions on synthetic data show that the embedding dimension is lowest when dominated by a fixed period snowmelt signal and highest when dominated by a random rainfall signal fig 3 fig 4a the simulations showed that this change in dimension was quasi linear when only two signals contributed to the embedding dimension but the embedding dimensions obtained were much lower that with real streamflow time series which are obviously more complex fig 4a that the embedding dimension changes when the ratio of snowmelt to rainfall changes suggests that embedding dimension might be used to assess dynamic structure that changes over time either due to linear trends or climate system variability future work may lead to methods that approach measuring these changes more directly than current linear methods that try to demonstrate shifts in timing related to changes in generating processes burn and whitfield 2017 2018a b smoothing and the choice of a time delay are important considerations of the fnn method we used daily data with a five day smoothing based upon a desire to make fair comparisons between large and small basins whitfield 1998 showed that the information content of small and more pluvial watersheds were more information rich than large snowmelt driven watersheds the five day smoothing reduces the difference without over smoothing the mapping of de that vignesh et al 2015 provide for embedding dimensions for monthly data is qualitatively the opposite pattern to that presented in our fig 5 by mapping fnn embedding dimension vignesh et al 2015 demonstrate differences in variability in streamflow dynamics across the us lower delay times result in wider variability in the embedding dimension in the west than in the east fig 5 shows the results from our method daily streamflow smoothed to 5 days 5 threshold and an ami based time delay this plot is markedly different to that presented in vignesh et al 2015 using mean monthly data a 5 threshold and the same ami based time delay we obtain a result fig 12 that is similar to fig 3 provided in vignesh et al 2015 the main differences between the generation of the two figures is that we use a 5 threshold and they use of the embedding dimension of the minimum number of false nearest neighbors based upon five different delay times the dataset is also not identical though both sets of us data come from the us reference hydrological network the differences between fig 5 and fig 12 and to fig 3 of vignesh et al 2015 are due to the use of monthly data rather than smoothed daily data some of the relationships between d e and physical or statistical measures of streamflow were similar to those that vignesh et al 2015 had obtained using monthly data although vignesh et al 2015 found low embedding dimensions occur in both small and large drainage basins and relatively high embedding dimensions are associated only with small drainage areas our contention would be that while some smoothing of a daily streamflow series is necessary to deal with the basic issues of more information being present in small rainfall driven watersheds to make fair comparisons with larger or snowmelt driven systems the amount of smoothing should be small since over smoothing over simplifies the short time scale dynamics driving streamflow as mentioned above with the exception of khatibi et al 2012 who also used daily data all of the other papers we have cited use monthly data our view would be that the use of monthly data over smooths the short timescale dynamics and leads to incorrect results the sensitivity studies presented here demonstrate that a sufficient length of series is necessary but this length is short 10 years in fig 10 and increasing the length beyond this has no consistent effect between rivers we found no relationship between embedding dimension and total record length fig 9 when considering long term temporal changes such as those related to changes in climate and runoff generating processes a reasonable length of record is still needed to estimate an embedding dimension and to also allow multiple measurements of the dimension to be made over time we have demonstrated that embedding dimension does respond to changes in complexity over time in simple experiments with synthetic data fig 4a the sensitivity studies limited themselves to daily time steps it would be useful to extend the studies to smaller time steps to capture diel scale or finer processes finding such clear relationships in nature was more difficult and suggests further refinement of such a technique is necessary further development could complement maskey et al 2016 who used a deterministic fractal multifractal approach to identify fractal parameters in streamflow time series and showed that the time evolution of the parameters is useful for tracking and predicting change in streamflow generating processes future work should also consider how combinations of processes contribute to the complexity as such information would be useful in determining simulation model structure and for assessing changes over time particular where the relative contributions of processes change or processes are added or removed we examined the streamflow pattern from stations along two transects shown in fig 5 stations from the east to west transect are shown in fig 7 and from the south to north transect are shown in fig 8 along both transects the sites with the lowest embedding dimensions have strong snowmelt signatures where the variability in timing and magnitude of peak flows is lowest at high latitude and or high elevation the embedding dimensions are lowest peterson et al 1987 examined the hydrology of a north south transect of the west coast of north america trancoso et al 2018 examined how the biophysical properties from 354 catchments across a climatic gradient in australia contributed to hydrological attributes transects across a gradient or as in our case multiple gradients provide a useful check on the structure of results in figs 7 and 8 there are clear progressions in both embedding dimension and structure of the hydrograph related to the physical environments encountered along the transects many classification systems fail because they do not simultaneously deal with hydrograph shape magnitude and timing as examples hannah et al 2005 showed classification of hydrographs using shape and magnitude fleming et al 2007 showed that differences in latitude or elevation resulted in temporal shifts that place hydrographs generated by the same processes into different classes because of timing differences these are artifacts of using linear methods where non linear methods would be preferable in figs 5 7 and 8 it is clear that embedding dimension shows differences that are related to process differences and not simply temporal and magnitude shifts sivakumar et al 2007 argue on behalf of a globally accepted classification system for hydrology while we agree that a classification system in hydrology is desirable most classification systems place items in subjective bins based upon specific criteria sivakumar and singh 2012 used correlation dimension of 117 stations in the united states to create a four level classification low medium high and unidentifiable their classification shows some homogeneity within some regions but contained strong exceptions this supports the suggestion of burn and whitfield 2017 that discrete hydrologic regimes are an artificial construct and that the processes should be considered along a continuum sivakumar et al 2015 stress the need for a measurement of system complexity as a basis for a classification framework and identified the potential for nonlinear dynamics and other recent concepts of complex systems for assessing complexity sivakumar et al 2007 considered classification from a phase space perspective and building a classification based upon complexity sivakumar et al 2007 report attractors ranging from very clear to very blurred the embedding dimension results presented here and elsewhere suggest that hydrologic dynamics fall across a continuum and formal bins would not be appropriate the many mechanisms that govern river flow dynamics are expressed across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales porporato and ridolfi 2003 porporato and ridolfi 2003 report that the distinction between linearity and nonlinearity as a function of discharge becomes more precise as the attractor is better unfolded only at higher embedding dimensions up to m 9 while the present research did not focus on the existence of attractors we have demonstrated that embedding dimension is a useful measure for quantifying the pluvial nival continuum when estimated to much higher dimensions future work should also consider how combinations of processes contribute to the complexity as such information would be useful in determining simulation model structure and for assessing temporal changes where proportions of process contributions change or processes are added or removed similarly the methods may be also applied to other situations such as changing land use and urbanization within watersheds considering high dimensional descriptions of these streamflow processes as meaningful information and not the effect of meaningless noise is consistent with the theory that weather systems are unlikely to be able to represented at low dimensions lorenz 1991 abarbanel et al 1993 abarbanel and lall 1996 many of the pluvial rivers display high frequency dynamics and high embedding dimensions likely only represented at the weather system scale furthermore some ephemeral streams such as deep creek fig 11 respond directly to weather systems and only once every few years a return period that may be influenced by climate this degree of complexity should be considered before accurate representations of climate change in these hydrological systems are expected to be representable the necessity of a better understanding of the distinguishing factors of pluvial and nival rivers in changing climate has increased burn and whitfield 2017 if warming causes a shift to pluvial processes from nival processes more frequent rain on snow and rainfall driven floods may result burn and whitfield 2017 whitfield et al 2012 while nonlinear processes are common in hydrology the use of nonlinear methods is less so the mathematically rigorous procedures that can be used to examine the real world dynamics from time series that appear to be highly variable complex and often random huffaker et al 2017 such as was demonstrated here may improve our ability to understand watershed hydrological processes and diagnose change from streamflow time series while the difficulty of the methods remains a barrier dooge 1986 recent developments including the examples presented here suggest this is an area with great promise 5 conclusions a nonlinear false nearest neighbor approach was used to determine the minimum embedding dimension of 667 streamflow time series from reference hydrological stations across canada and the united states including alaska hawaii and puerto rico low embedding dimensions are found in cold areas at higher elevations and latitudes with strongly periodic snowmelt signals high embedding dimensions are associated with rainfall and less periodic more stochastic runoff patterns this suggests that embedding dimension is a useful measure of location on a previously hypothesized pluvial nival continuum burn and whitfield 2016 2017 and that high dimensions may actually be indicative of complex underlying physics not purely noise further investigation explaining the influence of specific noise generating processes in environmental studies would benefit future users of this method sensitivity investigations demonstrate that a streamflow time series of about 10 years duration may be sufficient to obtain a comparatively meaningful estimate of the embedding dimension low embedding dimension is associated with high latitude high and low elevation and large watersheds these are predominantly nival watersheds higher embedding dimensions are associated with smaller watersheds low elevations and low latitudes coastal areas of north america hawaii and puerto rico have higher embedding dimensions when using a 1 threshold for fnn some watersheds did not converge using a 5 threshold is perhaps more appropriate for streamflow time series as it reduced the number of non convergent cases reinterpreting high embedding dimensions as valuable information instead of smoothing for simpler results actually expands our working framework to allow for weather driven systems that have been known to be very high or infinite dimension and follows the suggestion of lorenz 1991 synthetic time series were used to demonstrate that embedding dimension captures the role of the mixture of rainfall and snowmelt in a streamflow time series synthetic time series result in lower embedding dimension than real streamflow series because they are less complex varying the mixture of snowmelt to rainfall over a long time series demonstrated that the embedding dimension can be used to diagnose changes over time in a single series the nonlinear fnn technique used here quantifies and accounts for hydrological processes that are highly variable complex and often random the differences in embedding dimension illustrate the relative position on the pluvial nival continuum and reflect the differences in complexity of these systems changes in the embedding dimension of the streamflow time series over time are expected to provide insight to changes in streamflow generating processes that result from climate variations global warming and land use change declaration of interests none acknowledgments the streamflow time series used in this study were obtained from the water survey of canada and united states geological survey web portals we would also like to thank john pomeroy for his comments and suggestions and for financial support from his grants from the canada research chairs programme nserc and alberta environment and sustainable development the comments and suggestions from two reviewers were helpful in preparing the final manuscript the authors declare no conflict of interest appendix abarbanel et al 1993 suggest that a 1 threshold of false nearest neighbors should be adequate for physics applications though hydrological data contains considerable noise with many compounding physical processes fig a1 shows the spatial map of embedding distances obtained using a 1 threshold with non convergence indicated with a value of d e 31 values ranged from 4 to the maximum dimension we allowed 30 non convergence is prevalent in vignesh et al 2015 and they addressed this issue by using the first dimension at which fnn reaches its minimum instead of a percent threshold sivakumar and singh 2012 considered those that did not converge to be unidentifiable the results obtained with the 1 threshold proposed by abarbanel et al 1993 are shown here and indicate that 5 may be a reasonable compromise for streamflow time series most of the non convergent sites at 1 appear as high d e sites at 5 indicating a high level of complexity was detected at both thresholds the non convergent watersheds are investigated in this appendix to address potential future improvements on the application of delay embedding dimensions to better understand streamflow dynamics the amount low or no flow conditions in non convergent streams is examined in fig a2 each non convergent watershed was binned into a 2 wide bin according to the temporal percent of no streamflow fig a2 top or 1 mean streamflow bottom the histograms indicate that while there is a higher proportion of non convergent watersheds with long low or no flow periods as compared to the total sample set there are still 30 of non convergent sites that have 2 of no flow in the entire time series similarly 18 of non convergent watersheds had 2 low flow in their entire time series this suggests that while periods of low flow are often present in high dimensional watersheds it is not a necessary condition for large d e this can be understood as a recurrent low or no flow season forces time series embedding returns to a periodic point that is a 0 dimensional subset in the delay embedding space this was also the case for the synthetic pure snowmelt signal in section 3 1 instead it is actually the irregularity of the on off signal that increases the complexity of the signal and continues to generate false nearest neighbors thus forcing a higher embedding dimension in hydrology this could be manifested by irregular rain events as seen above variable snowmelt runoff or multiple snowmelt peaks among other processes in fig a3 we show the results for the 95 cases that never reached the 1 threshold and were considered non convergent the positive direction on the horizontal axis represents increases in embedding dimension and the raster plot shows a decreasing trend in fnn for all watersheds when the fnn falls below a 5 threshold the colormap transition to a brown color scheme for clarity some cases fall below the 5 and 10 thresholds at d e 5 or 6 while only one still fails to converge by an embedding dimension of 30 it is worth noting that this river dry creek at union city california converged at d e 50 and was largely ephemeral containing 65 no flow in fig a4 we show the decreasing fnn for 10 non convergent stations selected at random to show that some of these stations reach a minimum without that minimum being below the 1 threshold five year periods of streamflow for these 10 rivers are displayed in the lower subplots of fig a4 the majority of the rivers show complex irregular rain fall influenced dynamics but an irregular snowmelt signal in british columbia canada is also presented fig a4j showing snowmelt alone does not guarantee low embedding dimension abarbanel et al 1993 figure 17 and our fig 2b show that noise in the streamflow record would not affect the embedding dimension but would affect the threshold that can be achieved one technique to address high values of fnn may be the cleaning technique as suggested by abarbanel et al 1993 as many of the non convergent time series in the present work contain periods with zero discharge exploring this issue is a subject for future investigations a reasonable compromise of a 5 threshold instead of the 1 abarbanel et al 1993 may appropriately account for the dynamics and noise present in streamflow signals the corresponding relationships between d e basin characteristics and streamflow statistics with this threshold can also be found in that plot fig a5 note that the scatter plots effectively show the same patterns as fig 6 
6629,the different types of soil macropores e g biopores and non biopores vary in the conductivity of water or air due to the difference in the 3d pore characteristics the objectives of this study were to reveal which types of macropores and which macropore characteristics played the most important roles in regulating water or air flow intact soil columns sampled from the subsoil of a long term fertilization experiment were scanned by medical x ray computed tomography ct and subsequently saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and air permeability at 12 cm water potential ka12 were measured the 3d characteristics of macropores were then analyzed with image analysis the biopores and the percolating biopores that connected the top and the bottom of a soil column were separated for the biopore dominated samples with percolating biopores and their 3d characteristics were also quantified our results showed that the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer mdll presented the best relationships with ks and ka12 compared with the other macropore characteristics for all the samples the biopores and percolating biopores contributed 27 8 74 5 and 3 26 64 4 of the volume of total macropores respectively for the biopore dominated samples the hydraulic radius mean diameter compactness global and local connectivities and mdll of biopores especially those of percolating biopores were generally larger than those of total macropores the global connectivity γ of biopores performed very well for estimating ks and ka12 the mdll of percolating biopores could predict ks much better than the mdll of biopores and total macropores moreover the performance of mdll for estimating ka12 was as good as the mdll of biopores but was much better than the mdll of total macropores the findings of this study reveal that the mdll is a more useful parameter in estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability at low water potential than the other ct derived pore characteristics keywords soil structure macropore characteristics percolating biopores saturated hydraulic conductivity air permeability 1 introduction soil macropores can conduct water and air preferentially in soils to facilitate root growth devitt and smith 2002 katuwal et al 2015 colombi et al 2017 meanwhile surface applied agro chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides can be transported to deeper soils and even to groundwater via macropores resulting in low use efficiency of these chemicals and a higher potential of groundwater pollution coquet et al 2005 jarvis 2007 zhang et al 2014 soil macropores consist of different pore types from different biological or non biological origins such as earthworm burrows root channels cracks and inter aggregate packing voids these types of macropores vary in size shape orientation and ability to conduct water and gas ringrose voase 1996 abou najm et al 2010 biopores are reportedly much more continuous and effective in transporting water solutes and air than non biopores koestel and larsbo 2014 zhang et al 2018 luo et al 2008 found that the macropore network by itself cannot arbitrarily be equal to a preferential flow network since only a small fraction of the macropores especially the highly continuous biopores in the subsurface are active in transporting water and solutes soil pore structure governs how fast water air and solutes can enter and move through soils vervoort et al 1999 uteau et al 2013 paradelo et al 2016 many researchers have tried to link soil pore characteristics and hydraulic conductivity or air permeability logsdon et al 1990 dexter et al 2004 deepagoda et al 2011 larsbo et al 2014 koestel et al 2018 dexter and richard 2009 proposed a simple model for estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity with the pore size distribution by assuming soil pore space as bundles of capillaries of different radii the widely used kozeny carmen equation predicts saturated hydraulic conductivity with porosity tortuosity and specific area ahuja et al 1984 in the past soil pore size distribution was usually estimated indirectly with water retention curve or mercury intrusion dexter 1988 soil pore morphologies in two dimensions have been quantified using thin sections and image analysis alves et al 2014 in recent years the detailed pore characteristics in three dimensions 3d have been noninvasively identified using x ray computed tomography ct luo et al 2010b were among the pioneers to relate ct derived macropore features to water and solute transport they revealed that the best predictors of saturated hydraulic conductivity were macroporosity and path number the number of independent macropore paths between two boundaries lamande et al 2013 reported that the ct estimated number of macropores rather than ct estimated air filled volume of macropores could be related to the air permeability at 100 hpa matric potential smet et al 2018 observed that saturated hydraulic conductivity was positively related to global connectivity and fractal dimension of ct inferred macropores in addition these authors found that air permeability at 700 hpa was best explained by the average pore volume of the smallest pores that accounted for 10 of the pore volume by representing 90 of the number of pores recently ct inferred limiting macroporosity defined as the minimum macroporosity for any section of a whole soil column has been reported to be effective as a bottleneck function in regulating hydraulic conductivity air permeability or solute transport in many studies naveed et al 2013 katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 müller et al 2018 in general of the ct derived pore characteristics no consensus exists on which ct derived pore characteristics are the best predictors for water or air flow in complex soils many studies have analyzed the characteristics of total macropores and their relations with soil hydraulic conductivity or air permeability only a few studies for example naveed et al 2016 noticed that biopore dominated and matrix dominated flow columns should be differentiated prior to examining relationships between macropore flow and ct derived macroporosity zhang et al 2018 separated biopores and non biopores based on their differences in morphological features and inferred that biopore characteristics would be more effective in predicting water flow than those of non biopores or total macropores due to greater connectivity mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 observed that the macroporosity of the percolating biopores that are connected to both the top and the bottom of soil samples was better at predicting saturated hydraulic conductivity than that of total macropores therefore a comprehensive study that distinguishes among total macropores biopores and percolating biopores with ct image analysis and relates their 3d characteristics to water or air conductivity is desirable in this study soil columns were sampled from the subsoils of three fertilization treatments no fertilizer control chemical fertilizer npk and chemical fertilizer plus organic manure npkm the columns were scanned with a medical ct the total macropores biopores and percolating biopores were separated and their 3d characteristics were quantified the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability at 12 hpa water potential were determined our hypothesis was the following the saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability could be better explained by the 3d characteristics of biopores especially the percolating biopores than those of total macropores in addition the specific aim of this study was to find the best predictor of saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability from the ct derived pore characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the sampling site was at the jiangxi institute of red soil jinxian county jiangxi province china 116 10 e 28 21 n which has a mean annual temperature and precipitation of 17 7 c and 1727 mm respectively the soil is classified as an ultisol according to the usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 a long term fertilization experiment established in 1986 was chosen for this study three fertilization treatments were considered 1 no fertilizer as the control control 2 inorganic fertilizers including 60 kg n ha 1 30 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 for each maize growing season npk and 3 combined inorganic fertilizers same rates as npk and 15 t ha 1 fresh weight organic pig manure npkm the experimental design used 22 2 m2 plots and was a randomized complete block with three replicates of each treatment spring maize autumn maize was the cropping system a moldboard plow by cattle was used to till the topsoil 0 20 cm after each maize season the seedbed was prepared using manual hoeing after tillage the maize was sowed manually with the spacing of 50 cm 30 cm yan et al 2013 2 2 soil sampling and ct scanning the intact soil columns 150 mm in height and 100 mm in diameter were sampled with pvc cylinders from the subsoil 20 35 cm in april 2017 before the sowing of spring maize the pvc cylinders were hammered into the subsoil with a metal handle after the topsoil 0 20 cm was removed two replicates were collected from each plot and each fertilization treatment had six columns except the control treatment which had only five replicates due to unexpected problems during sampling therefore a total of seventeen undisturbed soil columns were collected these columns were sealed with plastic film and transported to the laboratory carefully in order to avoid any disturbance a medical x ray ct discovery ct hd 750 ge usa was used to scan the soil columns with voltage 120 kv and current 600 ma for each column after reconstruction 240 slices 512 pixels 512 pixels with voxel size 0 234 mm 0 234 mm 0 625 mm were generated 2 3 measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability after ct scanning the soil columns were saturated from the bottom up with capillary rise for one week the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured with the constant head method klute 1986 then the columns were drained to 12 hpa water potential in a sand box which meant that the water in soil macropores with equivalent diameter 0 25 mm was drained out based on the capillary theory zhang et al 2016 the air permeability ka was determined with the steady state method yi 2009 the air permeability was calculated according to darcy s law 1 k a q l η a δ p where q is the air flow rate l3 t 1 l is the length of the soil sample l η is the dynamic air viscosity m l 1 t 1 a is the cross sectional area of the soil sample l2 and δp is the pressure difference m l 1 t 2 the air permeability of the soil columns measured at the water potential 12 hpa is denoted as ka12 after measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability the soil columns were oven dried to determine total porosity and air filled porosity at 12 hpa water potential some of the basic soil properties have been reported previously zhang et al 2018 the soc and clay content of the soils from the different fertilization treatments were 9 76 11 5 g kg 1 and 50 7 51 6 respectively 2 4 separation of the different types of macropores during sampling of soil columns the soil in the upper half was generally disturbed unintentionally the soil biopores of the upper half were destroyed and soil macroporosity of the upper half was generally larger than the lower half due to the disturbance as demonstrated by previous studies the water or air flow is restricted by the limiting soil layer with the lowest macroporosity katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 therefore we believe that the 3d characteristics of intact lower half was more effective than the disturbed upper half in determining water or air flow thus the images of the upper half of the soil columns were removed and only the images of the lower half 75 mm were considered for further analysis moreover to remove the pvc wall effect a region of interest roi that was 93 75 mm in diameter and 75 mm in height was selected from the central part the roi was then rescaled to a new roi with the voxel 0 25 mm 0 25 mm 0 25 mm to facilitate further image processing and analysis using imagej 1 52a luo et al 2010a the bilinear interpolation was used to rescale all the ct images in the vertical direction zitová and flusser 2003 the software 3dma lindquist and venkatarangan 1999 using a locally adaptive segmentation method i e the indicator kriging method oh and lindquist 1999 segmented the grayscale images into binary images after segmentation the pores smaller than 4 voxels 0 06 mm3 were removed to reduce noise peth et al 2008 the percolating biopores were defined as the biopores that were connected from top to bottom in the roi the samples with and without percolating biopores were considered as biopore dominated and matrix dominated samples respectively the separation of biopores and percolating biopores was only performed for biopore dominated samples the detailed procedures for the separation of soil biopores are described in zhang et al 2018 and only a brief summary is provided here first the small pores with a size less than 500 voxels 7 8 mm3 were eliminated second the ratio of pore length l to pore equivalent radius r was calculated the pores with the ratio l r 20 were considered as non biopores and deleted third based on visual observation a few of the remaining pores that did not appear to be biopores were removed manually after the above three steps the remaining pores were referred to as biopores the percolating biopores were acquired by removing all other isolated macropores these procedures were accomplished with the software matlab 2012a 2 5 quantification of macropore characteristics the total macropores biopores and percolating biopores were analyzed to determine their macroporosity hydraulic radius mean diameter md length density compactness cp euler number and global connectivity γ using the software imagej 1 52a the macroporosity was defined as the percentage of the ct derived macropore volume to the total volume of the roi the hydraulic radius was computed as the ratio of amount of macropore volume to amount of macropore surface area larsbo et al 2014 the diameter of each macropore was determined with a local thickness algorithm in the bone j plugin of imagej which defines the thickness as the diameter of the greatest sphere that fits within the pore at a specific point dougherty and kunzelmann 2007 the mean diameter of macropores md was calculated as 2 md i 0 n d i v i i 0 n v i where di and vi are the diameter and the volume of each macropore respectively and n is the number of isolated macropores the macropores were skeletonized to determine the macropore length to remove the effect of noisy skeletons only the branches with a length larger than 4 voxels were used to compute length density the length density was the length of the macropores divided by the volume of the roi the compactness of a pore was defined as follows 3 compactness a 1 5 v where a and v are the surface area and the volume of the pore respectively bribiesca 2000 the compactness is a pore shape factor whose value increases as the pore deviates more from a sphere the mean compactness cp was computed as the volume weighted average of compactness of each pore the euler number can be used as an indicator for local pore connectivity vogel and roth 2001 and was measured using the particle analyzer plugin in imagej the more negative the euler number is the more connected the pore networks smet et al 2018 according to the percolation theory the global connectivity γ of pore networks can be defined as follows 4 γ i 0 n v i 2 i 0 n v i 2 the γ measures the probability that two pores belong to the same pore the γ is equal to 1 as all pores are connected in one percolating pore and is close to 0 when pores with similar size are scattered hovadik and larue 2007 the variation in ct derived macroporosity along the roi depth was determined for each slice with a 0 25 mm increment for total macropores biopores and percolating biopores the layer with the minimum value of macroporosity was defined as the limiting layer in addition the minimum value of macroporosity along the roi depth was referred to as the macroporosity of the limiting layer mpll the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer mdll was also determined with the local thickness algorithm in the bone j plugin of imagej 2 6 statistics spearman rank correlation analyses were performed to test the relationships between ct derived macropore characteristics total porosity and air filled porosity and ks and ka12 the regression analyses between the ks and ka12 and selected macropore characteristics were performed with linear power or exponential models the goodness of fit for these models was assessed by the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse the natural logarithm of ks and ka12 was used in the regression analysis the statistical analyses were completed using the software package ibm spss statistics 19 3 results 3 1 soil macropore characteristics saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability the total macroporosity ranged from 0 98

average of 1 50 mm more cylindrical and continuous biopores such as earthworm burrows and root channels were observed in the biopore dominated than in the matrix dominated samples fig 1 for the biopore dominated samples the biopores and the percolating biopores were separated for further characterization figs 2 and 3 the biopores were generally tubular in shape with only a portion of these pores that were highly continuous the macroporosity of biopores was in the range of 0 35 3 22 with an average value of 1 62 accounting for 27 8 74 5 51 5 on average of the total macropores table 2 the morphological features of percolating biopores varied significantly among different samples for example some were thick earthworm burrows control 1 control 4 and npk6 and some were a cluster of root channels npk 1 npk 2 and npkm 5 fig 3 the macroporosity of percolating biopores was in the range of 0 041 2 78 with a cv of 78 3 table 3 contributing 3 26 64 4 29 9 on average to the total macroporosity the hydraulic radius md cp local connectivity euler umber γ and mdll generally increased in the order of total macropores biopores and percolating biopores for the biopore dominated samples the different fertilizations had no significant effect on most of the macropore characteristics with cp and mpll the exceptions for all the samples data not shown however more tubular biopores were perceived in the samples of npk and npkm treatments than those of the control treatment from the 3d visualizations of macropores fig 1 the percolating biopores were observed in 4 of the 6 samples for npk and npkm treatments and in 2 of the 5 samples for the control treatment as presented in fig 4 the porosities of total macropores biopores and percolating biopores varied greatly with depth in the roi the total macroporosity generally decreased with depth for samples from the control treatment with the sample control 2 the exception but the decrease was only observed in the upper 3 cm depth of the roi for samples from the npkm treatment whereas no obvious decrease with depth in the roi was observed for the npk treatment for the biopore dominated samples the trends in macroporosity distribution with depth were generally similar among total macropores biopores and percolating biopores both the ks 0 22 515 8 mm h 1 and ka12 0 0019 156 8 μm2 showed large variation with cvs of 179 and 245 respectively table 1 both control 1 and npk 6 samples with percolating earthworm burrows presented the highest ks and ka12 moreover the ks and ka12 were 5 11 and 32 0 fold larger respectively for the biopore dominated samples than those for the matrix dominated samples 3 2 relationships between biopore and matrix dominated flow parameters and macropore characteristics for all the samples the best correlation was mdll with both ks and ka12 followed by the correlations with mpll cp and γ while the other macropore characteristics were poorly correlated with ks and ka12 table 4 the cp and mdll were strongly correlated with ks and ka12 for biopore dominated samples but only the mdll was significantly correlated with ks for matrix dominated samples the natural logarithm transformed ks and ka12 values were linearly related p 0 05 irrespective of whether samples were biopore dominated or matrix dominated fig 5 a indicating that air filled macropores that conducted air at 12 hpa water potential were also effective in conducting water in a saturated condition an exponential function gave a good fit to the relationship between total porosity and ka12 for the matrix dominated samples but for the biopore dominated samples an exponential function was not a good fit fig 5b for all the samples the power function performed very well for modeling the relationships between selected macropore characteristics mpll and mdll and ks and ka12 fig 6 similar to ks a power function showed a better fit when ka12 was plotted against mdll rather than mpll with r2 increasing from 0 193 to 0 477 and rmse decreasing from 2 999 to 2 414 when the biopore dominated samples were separated the relationship between ka12 and mdll was better fitted with a power function r2 0 713 vs 0 477 rmse 1 101 vs 2 414 than that for all the samples figs 6d and 7d in contrast a power function relationship between ks and mdll showed a weaker fit for the biopore dominated samples than that for all the samples with r2 decreasing from 0 610 to 0 516 fig 6b and 7c 3 3 relationships between the characteristics of biopores and water or air flow parameters for the biopore dominated samples the γ of biopores was better correlated with ks than the mdll mpll hydraulic radius and md of biopores table 5 the mdll of biopores showed the best correlation with ka12 followed by γ and mpll of bioproes the mdll and macroporosity of percolating biopores were both better correlated with ks and ka12 than the mpll and the percentage of percolating biopore volume to the total macropore volume pb the ks or ka12 values were plotted with selected characteristics of the different types of macropores for the biopore dominated samples fig 7 the cp presented good power and exponential relationships with ks and ka12 respectively for the total macropores compared to the mdll of total macropores and biopores the mdll of percolating biopores improved the power relationship with ks r2 0 784 rmse 0 999 the γ of biopores could predict ks slightly better r2 0 831 rmse 0 883 than the macroporosity r2 0 795 rmse 0 974 and mdll of percolating biopores to explain the variation in ka12 the mdll of both biopores r2 0 833 rmse 0 841 and percolating biopores r2 0 812 rmse 0 893 performed better than the mdll of total macropores r2 0 713 rmse 1 101 with a power function 4 discussion water or air flow is strongly restricted at the bottleneck of soil layers thus quantifying the macropore characteristics in the limiting layer is important to understand the soil hydraulic properties deng and zhu 2015 katuwal et al 2015 we found that the macroporosity of the limiting layer mpll was significantly correlated with ks and ka12 for all the samples table 4 similar results are also reported by some other studies katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 müller et al 2018 however in this study we found that a newly introduced parameter the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer mdll was more effective in estimating ks and ka12 than the mpll for the different types of macropores figs 6 and 7 according to poiseuille s equation the larger the pore diameter is the more effective the pore in conducting water or air the thickness algorithm for the mdll determination can maximize the fractions of large and cylindrical macropores and minimize the fractions of small and irregular macropores in a thin limiting layer dougherty and kunzelmann 2007 while the macroporosity characterizing the amount of macropores could not represent the macropore shape that is vital for conducting water and air thus the mdll performed better than the mpll to estimate ks and ka in this study providing that water and air flow is governed by the characteristics of the limiting layer the 3d features of all the macropores over the depth of the roi are not expected to be related to water and air flow especially when they vary significantly with depth fig 4 as a result we could not find significant correlations between ks and ka12 and the macropore features except the cp and γ of all the macropores over the depth of the roi table 4 the significantly positive correlation between the cp and the ks or ka12 indicated that the long and cylindrical shaped macropores root channels and earthworm burrows with higher cp were more beneficial for conducting water and air than the spherical shaped macropores the relationships between the mpll and mdll and both the ks and ka12 were well fitted with a power function in this study fig 6 likewise in some studies the relationship between ct inferred macroporosity and the ks could be fitted with a power function very well mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 naveed et al 2016 however katuwal et al 2015 and naveed et al 2013 documented a good linear relationship between ka and both ct derived macroporosity and mpll a significant exponential relationship between total porosity and ka12 was observed for the matrix dominated samples but not for the biopore dominated samples fig 5 this finding is similar to that of the study of naveed et al 2016 who observed that the air filled porosity could estimate ka very well for matrix dominated samples but failed to predict ka for the biopore dominated samples moreover the correlation between cp and both ks and ka12 was strong for the biopore dominated samples but very weak for the matrix dominated samples in our study table 4 these results suggested that water or air flow in the matrix dominated columns depended on the amount of soil pores whereas in the biopore dominated columns the flow was mainly governed by the highly continuous biopores thus the separation of biopore dominated and matrix dominated samples is required before establishing the relationships between macropore flow and ct derived macropore characteristics naveed et al 2016 in our previous work we separated biopores from the total macropores zhang et al 2018 and in this study we further isolated percolating biopores from the biopores for the biopore dominated samples after progressively removing the non biopores and less continuous biopores the biopores and percolating biopores were increased in hydraulic radius md cp local connectivity euler umber γ and mdll implying that the biopores particularly the percolating biopores have greater potential in conducting water and air than the total macropores consequently the mdll of percolating biopores predicted ka12 as well as the mdll of biopores but much better than the mdll of total macropores for estimating ks the mdll of percolating biopores performed better than the mdll of biopores and total macropores fig 7 these results indicated that percolating biopores play a vital role in conducting water or air the good relationships between ks and ka12 and the macroporosity of percolating biopores instead of biopores or total macropores further confirmed this inference fig 7 similarly mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 found that ks could be better predicted by the connected macroporosity that connects both the top and bottom of the roi than the total macroporosity for the total macropores and biopores some of these pores are not active in conducting water and air because of air or water entrapment and hydrological discontinuities luo et al 2008 sammartino et al 2015 only highly continuous biopores for example the percolating biopores that connected from the top to the bottom of the soil column are effective in transporting water or air allaire leung et al 2000 the results clarified that preferential flow through the percolating biopores dominated ks or ka and that the mdll of the percolating biopores determined the effectiveness of the macropore flow for the biopore dominated samples for biopore dominated samples the variation in ks and ka12 was better explained by global connectivity γ of biopores than that of the total macropores fig 7e and f this result further indicated that the biopore characteristics were more effective in estimating water or air flow than those of the total macropores naveed et al 2016 and that the biopore connectivity was important for the flow of water or air through the soils katuwal et al 2015 sammartino et al 2015 however the γ of percolating biopores was not correlated with ks and ka12 table 5 this result was because when the percolating biopores are connected to one percolating cluster the γ values are all equal to 1 although percolating biopores for different samples may vary significantly in conducting water or air jarvis et al 2017 in general global connectivity γ cannot be used to characterize the difference in water or air conductivity if all pores are connected to only one percolating cluster 5 conclusions in this study the characteristics of different types of macropores were quantified and their relationships with water and air flow parameters were investigated among all the characteristics of macropores derived from the ct images the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer mdll was identified as the best variable that correlated well with the ks and ka12 for all the soil samples for the biopore dominated samples the biopores and percolating biopores accounted for 52 4 and 32 8 of the total macropores in volume respectively but increased in hydraulic radius md cp global and local connectivities and mdll relative to those of total macropores the mdll of the percolating biopores was the better predictor for ks than the mdll of the biopores and the total macropores the global connectivity of biopores rather than percolating biopores was slightly better at predicting ks than the mdll of percolating biopores for estimating ka12 the performance of the mdll of percolating biopores was similar to that of the mdll of biopores both of which showed better performance than the mdll of total macropores our results indicate that it is critical to quantify the biopore characteristics of the limiting soil layer for example mdll in this study to predict the saturated water flow or air flow at low water potential especially when soil macropores are vertically heterogeneous which is commonly the case for natural

6629,the different types of soil macropores e g biopores and non biopores vary in the conductivity of water or air due to the difference in the 3d pore characteristics the objectives of this study were to reveal which types of macropores and which macropore characteristics played the most important roles in regulating water or air flow intact soil columns sampled from the subsoil of a long term fertilization experiment were scanned by medical x ray computed tomography ct and subsequently saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and air permeability at 12 cm water potential ka12 were measured the 3d characteristics of macropores were then analyzed with image analysis the biopores and the percolating biopores that connected the top and the bottom of a soil column were separated for the biopore dominated samples with percolating biopores and their 3d characteristics were also quantified our results showed that the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer mdll presented the best relationships with ks and ka12 compared with the other macropore characteristics for all the samples the biopores and percolating biopores contributed 27 8 74 5 and 3 26 64 4 of the volume of total macropores respectively for the biopore dominated samples the hydraulic radius mean diameter compactness global and local connectivities and mdll of biopores especially those of percolating biopores were generally larger than those of total macropores the global connectivity γ of biopores performed very well for estimating ks and ka12 the mdll of percolating biopores could predict ks much better than the mdll of biopores and total macropores moreover the performance of mdll for estimating ka12 was as good as the mdll of biopores but was much better than the mdll of total macropores the findings of this study reveal that the mdll is a more useful parameter in estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability at low water potential than the other ct derived pore characteristics keywords soil structure macropore characteristics percolating biopores saturated hydraulic conductivity air permeability 1 introduction soil macropores can conduct water and air preferentially in soils to facilitate root growth devitt and smith 2002 katuwal et al 2015 colombi et al 2017 meanwhile surface applied agro chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides can be transported to deeper soils and even to groundwater via macropores resulting in low use efficiency of these chemicals and a higher potential of groundwater pollution coquet et al 2005 jarvis 2007 zhang et al 2014 soil macropores consist of different pore types from different biological or non biological origins such as earthworm burrows root channels cracks and inter aggregate packing voids these types of macropores vary in size shape orientation and ability to conduct water and gas ringrose voase 1996 abou najm et al 2010 biopores are reportedly much more continuous and effective in transporting water solutes and air than non biopores koestel and larsbo 2014 zhang et al 2018 luo et al 2008 found that the macropore network by itself cannot arbitrarily be equal to a preferential flow network since only a small fraction of the macropores especially the highly continuous biopores in the subsurface are active in transporting water and solutes soil pore structure governs how fast water air and solutes can enter and move through soils vervoort et al 1999 uteau et al 2013 paradelo et al 2016 many researchers have tried to link soil pore characteristics and hydraulic conductivity or air permeability logsdon et al 1990 dexter et al 2004 deepagoda et al 2011 larsbo et al 2014 koestel et al 2018 dexter and richard 2009 proposed a simple model for estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity with the pore size distribution by assuming soil pore space as bundles of capillaries of different radii the widely used kozeny carmen equation predicts saturated hydraulic conductivity with porosity tortuosity and specific area ahuja et al 1984 in the past soil pore size distribution was usually estimated indirectly with water retention curve or mercury intrusion dexter 1988 soil pore morphologies in two dimensions have been quantified using thin sections and image analysis alves et al 2014 in recent years the detailed pore characteristics in three dimensions 3d have been noninvasively identified using x ray computed tomography ct luo et al 2010b were among the pioneers to relate ct derived macropore features to water and solute transport they revealed that the best predictors of saturated hydraulic conductivity were macroporosity and path number the number of independent macropore paths between two boundaries lamande et al 2013 reported that the ct estimated number of macropores rather than ct estimated air filled volume of macropores could be related to the air permeability at 100 hpa matric potential smet et al 2018 observed that saturated hydraulic conductivity was positively related to global connectivity and fractal dimension of ct inferred macropores in addition these authors found that air permeability at 700 hpa was best explained by the average pore volume of the smallest pores that accounted for 10 of the pore volume by representing 90 of the number of pores recently ct inferred limiting macroporosity defined as the minimum macroporosity for any section of a whole soil column has been reported to be effective as a bottleneck function in regulating hydraulic conductivity air permeability or solute transport in many studies naveed et al 2013 katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 müller et al 2018 in general of the ct derived pore characteristics no consensus exists on which ct derived pore characteristics are the best predictors for water or air flow in complex soils many studies have analyzed the characteristics of total macropores and their relations with soil hydraulic conductivity or air permeability only a few studies for example naveed et al 2016 noticed that biopore dominated and matrix dominated flow columns should be differentiated prior to examining relationships between macropore flow and ct derived macroporosity zhang et al 2018 separated biopores and non biopores based on their differences in morphological features and inferred that biopore characteristics would be more effective in predicting water flow than those of non biopores or total macropores due to greater connectivity mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 observed that the macroporosity of the percolating biopores that are connected to both the top and the bottom of soil samples was better at predicting saturated hydraulic conductivity than that of total macropores therefore a comprehensive study that distinguishes among total macropores biopores and percolating biopores with ct image analysis and relates their 3d characteristics to water or air conductivity is desirable in this study soil columns were sampled from the subsoils of three fertilization treatments no fertilizer control chemical fertilizer npk and chemical fertilizer plus organic manure npkm the columns were scanned with a medical ct the total macropores biopores and percolating biopores were separated and their 3d characteristics were quantified the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability at 12 hpa water potential were determined our hypothesis was the following the saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability could be better explained by the 3d characteristics of biopores especially the percolating biopores than those of total macropores in addition the specific aim of this study was to find the best predictor of saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability from the ct derived pore characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the sampling site was at the jiangxi institute of red soil jinxian county jiangxi province china 116 10 e 28 21 n which has a mean annual temperature and precipitation of 17 7 c and 1727 mm respectively the soil is classified as an ultisol according to the usda soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 a long term fertilization experiment established in 1986 was chosen for this study three fertilization treatments were considered 1 no fertilizer as the control control 2 inorganic fertilizers including 60 kg n ha 1 30 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 for each maize growing season npk and 3 combined inorganic fertilizers same rates as npk and 15 t ha 1 fresh weight organic pig manure npkm the experimental design used 22 2 m2 plots and was a randomized complete block with three replicates of each treatment spring maize autumn maize was the cropping system a moldboard plow by cattle was used to till the topsoil 0 20 cm after each maize season the seedbed was prepared using manual hoeing after tillage the maize was sowed manually with the spacing of 50 cm 30 cm yan et al 2013 2 2 soil sampling and ct scanning the intact soil columns 150 mm in height and 100 mm in diameter were sampled with pvc cylinders from the subsoil 20 35 cm in april 2017 before the sowing of spring maize the pvc cylinders were hammered into the subsoil with a metal handle after the topsoil 0 20 cm was removed two replicates were collected from each plot and each fertilization treatment had six columns except the control treatment which had only five replicates due to unexpected problems during sampling therefore a total of seventeen undisturbed soil columns were collected these columns were sealed with plastic film and transported to the laboratory carefully in order to avoid any disturbance a medical x ray ct discovery ct hd 750 ge usa was used to scan the soil columns with voltage 120 kv and current 600 ma for each column after reconstruction 240 slices 512 pixels 512 pixels with voxel size 0 234 mm 0 234 mm 0 625 mm were generated 2 3 measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability after ct scanning the soil columns were saturated from the bottom up with capillary rise for one week the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured with the constant head method klute 1986 then the columns were drained to 12 hpa water potential in a sand box which meant that the water in soil macropores with equivalent diameter 0 25 mm was drained out based on the capillary theory zhang et al 2016 the air permeability ka was determined with the steady state method yi 2009 the air permeability was calculated according to darcy s law 1 k a q l η a δ p where q is the air flow rate l3 t 1 l is the length of the soil sample l η is the dynamic air viscosity m l 1 t 1 a is the cross sectional area of the soil sample l2 and δp is the pressure difference m l 1 t 2 the air permeability of the soil columns measured at the water potential 12 hpa is denoted as ka12 after measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability the soil columns were oven dried to determine total porosity and air filled porosity at 12 hpa water potential some of the basic soil properties have been reported previously zhang et al 2018 the soc and clay content of the soils from the different fertilization treatments were 9 76 11 5 g kg 1 and 50 7 51 6 respectively 2 4 separation of the different types of macropores during sampling of soil columns the soil in the upper half was generally disturbed unintentionally the soil biopores of the upper half were destroyed and soil macroporosity of the upper half was generally larger than the lower half due to the disturbance as demonstrated by previous studies the water or air flow is restricted by the limiting soil layer with the lowest macroporosity katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 therefore we believe that the 3d characteristics of intact lower half was more effective than the disturbed upper half in determining water or air flow thus the images of the upper half of the soil columns were removed and only the images of the lower half 75 mm were considered for further analysis moreover to remove the pvc wall effect a region of interest roi that was 93 75 mm in diameter and 75 mm in height was selected from the central part the roi was then rescaled to a new roi with the voxel 0 25 mm 0 25 mm 0 25 mm to facilitate further image processing and analysis using imagej 1 52a luo et al 2010a the bilinear interpolation was used to rescale all the ct images in the vertical direction zitová and flusser 2003 the software 3dma lindquist and venkatarangan 1999 using a locally adaptive segmentation method i e the indicator kriging method oh and lindquist 1999 segmented the grayscale images into binary images after segmentation the pores smaller than 4 voxels 0 06 mm3 were removed to reduce noise peth et al 2008 the percolating biopores were defined as the biopores that were connected from top to bottom in the roi the samples with and without percolating biopores were considered as biopore dominated and matrix dominated samples respectively the separation of biopores and percolating biopores was only performed for biopore dominated samples the detailed procedures for the separation of soil biopores are described in zhang et al 2018 and only a brief summary is provided here first the small pores with a size less than 500 voxels 7 8 mm3 were eliminated second the ratio of pore length l to pore equivalent radius r was calculated the pores with the ratio l r 20 were considered as non biopores and deleted third based on visual observation a few of the remaining pores that did not appear to be biopores were removed manually after the above three steps the remaining pores were referred to as biopores the percolating biopores were acquired by removing all other isolated macropores these procedures were accomplished with the software matlab 2012a 2 5 quantification of macropore characteristics the total macropores biopores and percolating biopores were analyzed to determine their macroporosity hydraulic radius mean diameter md length density compactness cp euler number and global connectivity γ using the software imagej 1 52a the macroporosity was defined as the percentage of the ct derived macropore volume to the total volume of the roi the hydraulic radius was computed as the ratio of amount of macropore volume to amount of macropore surface area larsbo et al 2014 the diameter of each macropore was determined with a local thickness algorithm in the bone j plugin of imagej which defines the thickness as the diameter of the greatest sphere that fits within the pore at a specific point dougherty and kunzelmann 2007 the mean diameter of macropores md was calculated as 2 md i 0 n d i v i i 0 n v i where di and vi are the diameter and the volume of each macropore respectively and n is the number of isolated macropores the macropores were skeletonized to determine the macropore length to remove the effect of noisy skeletons only the branches with a length larger than 4 voxels were used to compute length density the length density was the length of the macropores divided by the volume of the roi the compactness of a pore was defined as follows 3 compactness a 1 5 v where a and v are the surface area and the volume of the pore respectively bribiesca 2000 the compactness is a pore shape factor whose value increases as the pore deviates more from a sphere the mean compactness cp was computed as the volume weighted average of compactness of each pore the euler number can be used as an indicator for local pore connectivity vogel and roth 2001 and was measured using the particle analyzer plugin in imagej the more negative the euler number is the more connected the pore networks smet et al 2018 according to the percolation theory the global connectivity γ of pore networks can be defined as follows 4 γ i 0 n v i 2 i 0 n v i 2 the γ measures the probability that two pores belong to the same pore the γ is equal to 1 as all pores are connected in one percolating pore and is close to 0 when pores with similar size are scattered hovadik and larue 2007 the variation in ct derived macroporosity along the roi depth was determined for each slice with a 0 25 mm increment for total macropores biopores and percolating biopores the layer with the minimum value of macroporosity was defined as the limiting layer in addition the minimum value of macroporosity along the roi depth was referred to as the macroporosity of the limiting layer mpll the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer mdll was also determined with the local thickness algorithm in the bone j plugin of imagej 2 6 statistics spearman rank correlation analyses were performed to test the relationships between ct derived macropore characteristics total porosity and air filled porosity and ks and ka12 the regression analyses between the ks and ka12 and selected macropore characteristics were performed with linear power or exponential models the goodness of fit for these models was assessed by the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse the natural logarithm of ks and ka12 was used in the regression analysis the statistical analyses were completed using the software package ibm spss statistics 19 3 results 3 1 soil macropore characteristics saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability the total macroporosity ranged from 0 98 to 4 37 with an average of 2 77 and a high variation cv 40 6 accounting for 6 12 of the total porosity on average table 1 the air filled porosity at 12 hpa water potential 3 63 on average with a pore size similar to the macropores derived from the ct scanning was higher than the ct derived macroporosity the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer mdll ranged from 1 07 to 2 54 mm with an average of 1 50 mm more cylindrical and continuous biopores such as earthworm burrows and root channels were observed in the biopore dominated than in the matrix dominated samples fig 1 for the biopore dominated samples the biopores and the percolating biopores were separated for further characterization figs 2 and 3 the biopores were generally tubular in shape with only a portion of these pores that were highly continuous the macroporosity of biopores was in the range of 0 35 3 22 with an average value of 1 62 accounting for 27 8 74 5 51 5 on average of the total macropores table 2 the morphological features of percolating biopores varied significantly among different samples for example some were thick earthworm burrows control 1 control 4 and npk6 and some were a cluster of root channels npk 1 npk 2 and npkm 5 fig 3 the macroporosity of percolating biopores was in the range of 0 041 2 78 with a cv of 78 3 table 3 contributing 3 26 64 4 29 9 on average to the total macroporosity the hydraulic radius md cp local connectivity euler umber γ and mdll generally increased in the order of total macropores biopores and percolating biopores for the biopore dominated samples the different fertilizations had no significant effect on most of the macropore characteristics with cp and mpll the exceptions for all the samples data not shown however more tubular biopores were perceived in the samples of npk and npkm treatments than those of the control treatment from the 3d visualizations of macropores fig 1 the percolating biopores were observed in 4 of the 6 samples for npk and npkm treatments and in 2 of the 5 samples for the control treatment as presented in fig 4 the porosities of total macropores biopores and percolating biopores varied greatly with depth in the roi the total macroporosity generally decreased with depth for samples from the control treatment with the sample control 2 the exception but the decrease was only observed in the upper 3 cm depth of the roi for samples from the npkm treatment whereas no obvious decrease with depth in the roi was observed for the npk treatment for the biopore dominated samples the trends in macroporosity distribution with depth were generally similar among total macropores biopores and percolating biopores both the ks 0 22 515 8 mm h 1 and ka12 0 0019 156 8 μm2 showed large variation with cvs of 179 and 245 respectively table 1 both control 1 and npk 6 samples with percolating earthworm burrows presented the highest ks and ka12 moreover the ks and ka12 were 5 11 and 32 0 fold larger respectively for the biopore dominated samples than those for the matrix dominated samples 3 2 relationships between biopore and matrix dominated flow parameters and macropore characteristics for all the samples the best correlation was mdll with both ks and ka12 followed by the correlations with mpll cp and γ while the other macropore characteristics were poorly correlated with ks and ka12 table 4 the cp and mdll were strongly correlated with ks and ka12 for biopore dominated samples but only the mdll was significantly correlated with ks for matrix dominated samples the natural logarithm transformed ks and ka12 values were linearly related p 0 05 irrespective of whether samples were biopore dominated or matrix dominated fig 5 a indicating that air filled macropores that conducted air at 12 hpa water potential were also effective in conducting water in a saturated condition an exponential function gave a good fit to the relationship between total porosity and ka12 for the matrix dominated samples but for the biopore dominated samples an exponential function was not a good fit fig 5b for all the samples the power function performed very well for modeling the relationships between selected macropore characteristics mpll and mdll and ks and ka12 fig 6 similar to ks a power function showed a better fit when ka12 was plotted against mdll rather than mpll with r2 increasing from 0 193 to 0 477 and rmse decreasing from 2 999 to 2 414 when the biopore dominated samples were separated the relationship between ka12 and mdll was better fitted with a power function r2 0 713 vs 0 477 rmse 1 101 vs 2 414 than that for all the samples figs 6d and 7d in contrast a power function relationship between ks and mdll showed a weaker fit for the biopore dominated samples than that for all the samples with r2 decreasing from 0 610 to 0 516 fig 6b and 7c 3 3 relationships between the characteristics of biopores and water or air flow parameters for the biopore dominated samples the γ of biopores was better correlated with ks than the mdll mpll hydraulic radius and md of biopores table 5 the mdll of biopores showed the best correlation with ka12 followed by γ and mpll of bioproes the mdll and macroporosity of percolating biopores were both better correlated with ks and ka12 than the mpll and the percentage of percolating biopore volume to the total macropore volume pb the ks or ka12 values were plotted with selected characteristics of the different types of macropores for the biopore dominated samples fig 7 the cp presented good power and exponential relationships with ks and ka12 respectively for the total macropores compared to the mdll of total macropores and biopores the mdll of percolating biopores improved the power relationship with ks r2 0 784 rmse 0 999 the γ of biopores could predict ks slightly better r2 0 831 rmse 0 883 than the macroporosity r2 0 795 rmse 0 974 and mdll of percolating biopores to explain the variation in ka12 the mdll of both biopores r2 0 833 rmse 0 841 and percolating biopores r2 0 812 rmse 0 893 performed better than the mdll of total macropores r2 0 713 rmse 1 101 with a power function 4 discussion water or air flow is strongly restricted at the bottleneck of soil layers thus quantifying the macropore characteristics in the limiting layer is important to understand the soil hydraulic properties deng and zhu 2015 katuwal et al 2015 we found that the macroporosity of the limiting layer mpll was significantly correlated with ks and ka12 for all the samples table 4 similar results are also reported by some other studies katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 müller et al 2018 however in this study we found that a newly introduced parameter the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer mdll was more effective in estimating ks and ka12 than the mpll for the different types of macropores figs 6 and 7 according to poiseuille s equation the larger the pore diameter is the more effective the pore in conducting water or air the thickness algorithm for the mdll determination can maximize the fractions of large and cylindrical macropores and minimize the fractions of small and irregular macropores in a thin limiting layer dougherty and kunzelmann 2007 while the macroporosity characterizing the amount of macropores could not represent the macropore shape that is vital for conducting water and air thus the mdll performed better than the mpll to estimate ks and ka in this study providing that water and air flow is governed by the characteristics of the limiting layer the 3d features of all the macropores over the depth of the roi are not expected to be related to water and air flow especially when they vary significantly with depth fig 4 as a result we could not find significant correlations between ks and ka12 and the macropore features except the cp and γ of all the macropores over the depth of the roi table 4 the significantly positive correlation between the cp and the ks or ka12 indicated that the long and cylindrical shaped macropores root channels and earthworm burrows with higher cp were more beneficial for conducting water and air than the spherical shaped macropores the relationships between the mpll and mdll and both the ks and ka12 were well fitted with a power function in this study fig 6 likewise in some studies the relationship between ct inferred macroporosity and the ks could be fitted with a power function very well mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 naveed et al 2016 however katuwal et al 2015 and naveed et al 2013 documented a good linear relationship between ka and both ct derived macroporosity and mpll a significant exponential relationship between total porosity and ka12 was observed for the matrix dominated samples but not for the biopore dominated samples fig 5 this finding is similar to that of the study of naveed et al 2016 who observed that the air filled porosity could estimate ka very well for matrix dominated samples but failed to predict ka for the biopore dominated samples moreover the correlation between cp and both ks and ka12 was strong for the biopore dominated samples but very weak for the matrix dominated samples in our study table 4 these results suggested that water or air flow in the matrix dominated columns depended on the amount of soil pores whereas in the biopore dominated columns the flow was mainly governed by the highly continuous biopores thus the separation of biopore dominated and matrix dominated samples is required before establishing the relationships between macropore flow and ct derived macropore characteristics naveed et al 2016 in our previous work we separated biopores from the total macropores zhang et al 2018 and in this study we further isolated percolating biopores from the biopores for the biopore dominated samples after progressively removing the non biopores and less continuous biopores the biopores and percolating biopores were increased in hydraulic radius md cp local connectivity euler umber γ and mdll implying that the biopores particularly the percolating biopores have greater potential in conducting water and air than the total macropores consequently the mdll of percolating biopores predicted ka12 as well as the mdll of biopores but much better than the mdll of total macropores for estimating ks the mdll of percolating biopores performed better than the mdll of biopores and total macropores fig 7 these results indicated that percolating biopores play a vital role in conducting water or air the good relationships between ks and ka12 and the macroporosity of percolating biopores instead of biopores or total macropores further confirmed this inference fig 7 similarly mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 found that ks could be better predicted by the connected macroporosity that connects both the top and bottom of the roi than the total macroporosity for the total macropores and biopores some of these pores are not active in conducting water and air because of air or water entrapment and hydrological discontinuities luo et al 2008 sammartino et al 2015 only highly continuous biopores for example the percolating biopores that connected from the top to the bottom of the soil column are effective in transporting water or air allaire leung et al 2000 the results clarified that preferential flow through the percolating biopores dominated ks or ka and that the mdll of the percolating biopores determined the effectiveness of the macropore flow for the biopore dominated samples for biopore dominated samples the variation in ks and ka12 was better explained by global connectivity γ of biopores than that of the total macropores fig 7e and f this result further indicated that the biopore characteristics were more effective in estimating water or air flow than those of the total macropores naveed et al 2016 and that the biopore connectivity was important for the flow of water or air through the soils katuwal et al 2015 sammartino et al 2015 however the γ of percolating biopores was not correlated with ks and ka12 table 5 this result was because when the percolating biopores are connected to one percolating cluster the γ values are all equal to 1 although percolating biopores for different samples may vary significantly in conducting water or air jarvis et al 2017 in general global connectivity γ cannot be used to characterize the difference in water or air conductivity if all pores are connected to only one percolating cluster 5 conclusions in this study the characteristics of different types of macropores were quantified and their relationships with water and air flow parameters were investigated among all the characteristics of macropores derived from the ct images the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer mdll was identified as the best variable that correlated well with the ks and ka12 for all the soil samples for the biopore dominated samples the biopores and percolating biopores accounted for 52 4 and 32 8 of the total macropores in volume respectively but increased in hydraulic radius md cp global and local connectivities and mdll relative to those of total macropores the mdll of the percolating biopores was the better predictor for ks than the mdll of the biopores and the total macropores the global connectivity of biopores rather than percolating biopores was slightly better at predicting ks than the mdll of percolating biopores for estimating ka12 the performance of the mdll of percolating biopores was similar to that of the mdll of biopores both of which showed better performance than the mdll of total macropores our results indicate that it is critical to quantify the biopore characteristics of the limiting soil layer for example mdll in this study to predict the saturated water flow or air flow at low water potential especially when soil macropores are vertically heterogeneous which is commonly the case for natural
