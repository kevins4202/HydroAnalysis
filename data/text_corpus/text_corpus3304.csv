16520,recently studies have increasingly focused on the occurrence of plastic leachate and its effects on aquatic environments however few studies have aimed to identify microplastic derived dissolved organic matter mp dom from environmental samples that are often enriched with natural organic matter nom in this study three mp dom eps dom pvc dom and pet dom and eight aquatic nom samples and their mixtures were used to identify a unique optical surrogate for mp dom within background nom three major fluorescence peaks peaks p h and l were identified in the excitation emission matrix eem spectra of both dom sources i e mp dom and nom the first two peaks were more pronounced for mp dom than for aquatic nom whereas peak l showed the opposite trend the summed intensity ratio of the ranges of the first two peaks relative to peak l namely h p l clearly distinguished between mp dom and nom samples the mp dom source discrimination capability was compared for several selected spectroscopic indices by tracking their changes in the mixtures of two source groups with increasing fraction of mp dom via end member mixing analysis this was further evaluated based on the three criteria built on the significance of the difference between the two groups the correlation coefficients of the regressions and the minimum fraction of mp dom in mixtures that can be distinguished from 100 nom samples irrespective of the plastic type and leaching conditions i e uv irradiated or not the new optical index h p l was superior at distinguishing mp dom from the mixtures when compared to other commonly used optical indices the new index can serve as a sensitive robust and reliable fluorescence indicator with minimal interference from nom for detecting plastic leachate in aquatic samples graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics source discrimination fluorescence end member mixing analysis natural organic matter 1 introduction increasing amounts of uncontrolled plastic disposal and its subsequent environmental impacts have become a critical global issue in particular research has focused on micro sized plastic particles i e microplastics or mps that are unintentionally generated from initial waste materials during their transport to the ocean via rivers or coastal systems galloway et al 2017 su et al 2020 in addition to the occurrence of mps in various environments dissolved organic substances leached from disposed mps referred to as plastic derived dom are another critical aspect for understanding the fate and environmental significance of mps romera castillo et al 2018 the degree of leaching from mps and the characteristics of plastic derived dom are dependent on the weathering processes exerted on mps such as exposure to uv light potthoff et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 plastic derived dom actively interacts with environmental media and other pollutants lee et al 2021 lee and hur 2020 this phenomenon is more pronounced when mps are exposed to sunlight or uv light devices installed in treatment facilities as mp exposure to uv stimulates the release of plastic derived dom from mps egessa et al 2020 shen et al 2020 given that plastic derived dom may contain several additives and or carbon chain scission products and that many of these substances are light absorbing gewert et al 2018 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 it is necessary to explore the feasibility of detecting these plastic derived substances by employing uv visible and or fluorescence spectroscopy this idea is partly supported by many previous examples of applying fluorescence spectroscopy to probe the occurrence and dynamics of naturally occurring dom carstea et al 2016 he et al 2016 jaffé et al 2014 regarding the optical probing of plastic derived dom a few recent studies spagnuolo et al 2017 have examined protein like fluorescence features of bisphenol a that were leached from plastics as a common additive more recently lee et al 2020a demonstrated that protein like fluorophores were optical proxies for plastic derived dom which is likely to contain additives and plastic polymers they further found that a humic like fluorescence peak was a distinctive signature of plastic derived dom produced under uv irradiation however these fluorescence signatures from plastic derived dom highly overlapped with those of natural organic matter nom which hampered their applicability as a probing index for plastic derived dom in aquatic systems enriched with nom lee et al 2021 2020a optical indices derived from simple calculations such as relative abundance or the ratio of different optical features have been widely used to identify and track dom sources and also to characterize dom dynamics due to their advantages of high sensitivity ease of analysis and online monitoring and low cost derrien et al 2017 li and hur 2017 the application of these spectroscopic indicators for source discrimination is primarily rooted in the differences in the light absorbing dom levels at a particular wavelength across contrasting end members or different source samples derrien et al 2019 lee et al 2018 yang and hur 2014 for instance lee et al 2018 proposed several reasonable criteria for selecting a reliable discrimination index that is least affected by biogeochemical processing among the commonly used indices such as the biological index bix huguet et al 2009 specific uv absorbance suva weishaar et al 2003 and the fluorescence index fi mcknight et al 2001 although the commonly used optical indices have been successful for nom source discrimination it is uncertain whether they are still feasible for plastic derived dom because the previously reported proxies were all based on the inherent characteristics of aquatic nom only in this context it is necessary to unearth a reliable optical proxy for identifying plastic derived dom in environmental samples containing background nom moreover the effort to find out the proxy can be further developed into the basis of a cost effective screening tool for the initial detection of mps before applying conventional detection methods such as infrared spectroscopy or particle counting to the best of our knowledge previous studies have not yet suggested a new spectroscopic indicator to probe plastic derived dom in nom containing environmental samples in this context this study specifically aimed to 1 compare the spectroscopic characteristics of dom leached from two commercial mps in different nom background solutions e g rivers lakes streams and wastewater effluents 2 evaluate the source discrimination capabilities of several selected optical parameters including newly proposed indices at varying mixing ratios of plastic derived dom and aquatic nom i e two dom end members and 3 provide insight into the applicability of a new spectroscopic proxy for detecting mp contamination in aquatic samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of microplastic derived organic matter mp dom expanded polystyrene eps polyvinylchloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet were selected as the representative plastics in this study eps and pet represent buoyant plastic types with a relatively low density which are more likely to be impacted by sunlight in aquatic environment compared to the non floating pvc particles commercial plastics were purchased in sheet form 1 mm in thickness for pvc as windshield and pet as part of facial mask and as beads 1 mm in diameter for eps from a local market in seoul south korea the sheet types of plastic were cut into pieces of approximately 1 1 mm which were then sufficiently washed with distilled water to remove any impurities that might occur during sample handling for mp dom samples as end members leaching experiments were conducted in an artificial freshwater solution containing 5 0 g plastic l under two leaching conditions i e under dark and uv irradiation conditions the leaching solution was composed of nahco3 96 mg l caso4 47 4 mg l mgso4 122 86 mg l and kcl 4 mg l majedi et al 2014 the uv irradiation was intended to simulate an environment in which the plastic pieces are exposed to sunlight for a long period of time in this experiment the leaching lasted for 14 days lee and hur 2020 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 the mp doses in the solution was set higher than the range typically observed in natural environments alimi et al 2018 chae and an 2018 to obtain the maximum amount of mp dom for further end member mixing for the uv irradiation setting the freshwater solutions containing the mp pieces were transferred to quartz beakers 1 l that had previously been autoclaved at 120 c for 15 min the leaching was performed in beakers in triplicate for the leaching experiment with exposure to uv light a beaker was placed in the center of a closed cabinet with six 8 w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl as the light source the reactor temperature was maintained at 25 3 c by circulating cooling air with fans phong and hur 2015 the top of the beaker was covered with aluminum foil to prevent the volatilization of the solution a stirrer was placed at the bottom of each beaker for continuous mixing throughout the leaching period at the end of leaching the mixing solutions were filtered through pre ashed whatman gf f filters to obtain the mp dom samples a glass vacuum filtration device was used to avoid unnecessary contact with any extraneous plastic material the final dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of the mp dom samples were 0 63 to 0 68 mg c l for the dark condition and 1 14 to 3 99 mg c l for the uv irradiation setup for end member mixing experiment only uv irradiated mp dom samples were used in which eps dom pvc dom and pet dom were arbitrarily denoted as mp1 mp2 and mp3 respectively table s1 for another experiment to mimic the real leaching situation in natural and engineered systems section 3 4 the artificial freshwater solution was replaced with pre filtered lake water from lake paldang in south korea l2 or treated effluent from an industrial wastewater treatment facility e2 as background solutions at a fixed doc concentration of 1 mg c l eps a buoyant plastic was selected as a representative plastic type for this study the leaching process lasted for a shorter time period i e 7 days but under the same conditions as the previous experiment both dark and uv irradiation conditions for the designated leaching time the reported residence time 7 days of lake paldang as a background solution was taken into account to determine the leaching period kim et al 2002 the added eps plastic dose 500 and 1000 pieces eps l was set at a similar level to those previously reported in mp polluted aquatic environments which were 0 01 to 519 mp l in rivers and 338 to 1473 mp l in wastewater effluents pivokonsky et al 2018 the details of the research method are presented in figure s1 2 2 preparation of end member dom and the mixtures eight water samples from different sources and locations river r1 and r2 lake reservoir l1 and l2 stream s1 and s2 and treated effluent e1 and e2 were selected as an aquatic nom source group in contrast to mp dom suwanee river fulvic acid srfa r1 and poly lake fulvic acid plfa l1 purchased from the international humic substances society ihss http ihss humicsubstances org were also included in the nom end member group table s1 powdered ihss nom materials 5 mg were dissolved in 1 l of deionized water to prepare the nom solutions the other aquatic nom samples were collected from several sources including the han river r2 lake paldang l2 toypeong stream s1 nakhwaam stream s2 and municipal e1 and industrial e2 wastewater treatment facilities from june 2020 to march 2021 details of the sampling sites are presented in table s1 all samples were acidified using sulfuric acid in the field to minimize deterioration before they were transported to the laboratory for filtration through a pre ashed whatman gf f filter the ph was then adjusted to 7 0 to recover the field ph condition the initial doc concentrations of the samples ranged from 1 0 to 10 8 mg c l table s1 uv irradiated mp dom and aquatic nom were diluted to a constant concentration of 1 0 mg c l and adjusted to ph 7 the two end members were mixed with ten different volume ratios of 0 100 1 99 3 97 5 95 10 90 20 80 30 70 50 50 75 25 and 100 0 in which a ratio of 0 100 represents 100 aquatic nom while a ratio of 100 0 represents pure mp dom the mp1 solution irradiated eps dom was mixed with all types of aquatic nom solutions whereas mp2 and mp3 irradiated pvc dom and pet dom were mixed with the ihss nom solutions or srfa r1 and plfa l1 thus a total twelve different solutions of dom mixtures i e mp1 r1 mp1 r2 mp1 l1 mp1 l2 mp1 s1 mp1 s2 mp1 e1 mp1 e2 mp2 r1 mp2 l1 mp3 r1 and mp3 l1 were considered for end member mixing experiment 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 dissolved organic carbon doc and uv vis spectroscopy doc concentrations were measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu l series tocchp japan absorption spectra from 200 to 800 nm were scanned at 1 nm intervals using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan the absorption coefficients of chromophoric dom cdom were measured at 254 nm and 355 nm a254 and a355 aλ 2 303 aλ pathlength where aλ is the optical density hu et al 2002 the absorption ratios at 254 to 436 nm and 300 to 400 nm e2 e4 and e3 e4 and the spectral slope s275 295 which is the slope of a linear regression for the log transformed absorption spectrum between 275 and 295 nm were calculated following the definitions in previous literature battin 1998 claret et al 2003 helms et al 2008 2 3 2 fluorescence eem measurements and parallel factor analysis parafac modeling fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were obtained using a luminescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan the eems were scanned at emission wavelengths em of 280 550 nm in 1 nm increments over an excitation wavelength ex range of 220 500 nm with a stepwise increase of 5 nm the excitation and emission slits were adjusted to 10 nm the fluorescence responses to distilled water were subtracted from the measured spectra to obtain the final eem data of the dom samples the fluorescence intensities were normalized to raman units r u using the fluorescence intensity of an integrated raman peak at 350 nm em lawaetz and stedmon 2009 three commonly used fluorescence indicators for source discrimination were estimated from the eem spectra the fluorescence index fi mcknight et al 2001 humification index hix ohno 2002 and biological index bix huguet et al 2009 the fi is the ratio of the emission intensity at 450 nm to that at 500 nm with an ex fixed at 370 nm which has a value of 1 9 for microbially derived dom and 1 4 for terrestrially derived dom mcknight et al 2001 the hix was utilized to indicate the degree of humification in dom which was calculated using the emission intensity area from 435 to 480 nm divided by the sum of two intensity areas from 300 to 345 nm and from 435 to 480 nm at 254 nm ex ohno 2002 bix is a rough descriptor for probing the presence of autochthonous dom which is associated with the presence of freshly produced dom from planktonic or microbial sources it was calculated using the intensity ratio at 310 nm 380 nm ex em to 310 nm 430 nm ex em huguet et al 2009 parallel factor analysis parafac modeling was performed using matlab 7 0 mathworks natick ma with the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 the number of independent fluorescent dom fdom components was determined using split half validation of the eem results from the end member mixtures n 275 and the percentage of the explained variance 98 7 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of the peak of the identified components was used to represent the relative quantities of the individual fdom components 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of spectroscopic features between mp dom and aquatic nom 3 1 1 uv absorption properties the uv absorption spectra of aquatic nom and mp dom under different leaching conditions i e dark and uv irradiation are shown in fig s2 and five typical absorption based parameters two absorption coefficients two absorption ratios and spectral slope were compared table s1 the spectra of pvc dom and pet dom showed a shoulder between 220 and 260 nm which was not observed in aquatic nom samples or eps dom a similar observation of a shoulder at 280 nm in the absorption spectra was previously reported for photo aged plastic derived dom samples shi et al 2021 after exposure to uv light both mp types released more cdom resulting in a higher uv absorption coefficient as compared to the cases without uv irradiation for example pvc dom exhibited 0 88 0 05 l m 1 mg c 1 for dark treated samples at 254 nm and 1 74 0 28 l m 1 mg c 1 for uv irradiated samples the a254 and a355 values of aquatic nom samples were higher than those of mp dom per the same doc concentration a254 0 88 2 03 m 1 mg c 1 for mp dom versus 1 99 8 47 m 1 mg c 1 for aquatic nom a355 0 03 0 98 m 1 mg c 1 for mp dom versus 0 78 5 07 m 1 mg c 1 for aquatic nom moreover the s275 295 values of mp dom 0 015 0 045 exhibited the opposite trend which were generally higher than those of aquatic nom 0 013 0 018 our results suggest that the aromatic content and average molecular weight of mp dom may be lower than those of typical aquatic nom galgani et al 2018 lee et al 2020b in contrast the difference in the two absorption ratios i e e2 e4 and e3 e4 between the two dom end members was nearly negligible student s test p 0 2015 and 0 4431 respectively probably because of the poor signals in the longer wavelength range from 350 to 500 nm fig s1 3 1 2 fluorescence properties and eem parafac modeling a prominent peak appeared in the protein phenol like fluorescence region of mp dom irrespective of the leaching conditions and the plastic types figs 1 a 1b and s3a s3d which was similar to peak b 225 280 305 nm defined by coble 1996 this peak was also observed in other plastic leachates containing bisphenol a which is a phenol like fluorescent substance spagnuolo et al 2017 as well as in wastewater samples comprising lignin phenols and polyaromatic hydrocarbons huang et al 2012 navalon et al 2011 the dominant peak was assigned to peak p in the present study the fluorescence intensity of peak p was much more pronounced in mp dom samples obtained under uv light than in the dark 0 113 to 0 139 r u for dark treated samples versus 0 173 to 0 197 r u for irradiated samples furthermore the doc normalized peak p intensities of all mp dom samples were more than six fold higher than those of aquatic nom figs 1e and 1f for example the peak p intensities of mp dom ranged from 0 113 to 0 196 r u whereas those of aquatic nom ranged from 0 031 to 0 108 r u the predominance of protein phenol like fluorescence features in this study was consistent with previous observations of other mp doms lee et al 2020a luo et al 2019 regardless of plastic types a notable difference in the eems between the dark and the uv treated mp dom was the occurrence of additional peaks in the humic like region at ex em of 230 405 nm and 290 405 nm for the latter figs 1b and s2b which were also reported in other mp dom studies lee et al 2021 2020a in this study the humic like peaks at 290 nm ex and 230 nm ex were designated as peaks h and l respectively two peaks were also observed in the aquatic nom samples figs 1c 1d and s3e to s3j however we observed a clear difference in the peaks between mp dom and the aquatic nom samples peak l was more pronounced than peak h in the aquatic nom samples while the higher intensity of peak l relative to peak h was not observed for mp dom meanwhile peak h exhibited a much higher intensity than peak l for the irradiated mp dom samples the dark treated mp dom samples showed similar levels of the two peak intensities figs 1g and 1h for example the intensities of peaks h and l were 0 103 r u and 0 064 r u respectively for the uv irradiated pvc dom fig 1e these distinctive features between mp dom and aquatic nom can produce a source discrimination index consisting of peaks h p and l in a way that maximizes the discrimination between the two dom end member groups the ratio of h l can distinguish between irradiated mp dom and aquatic nom furthermore the extremely high intensity of peak p in dark treated mp dom can also be effectively used to discriminate mp dom from aquatic nom in the absence of uv light i e no humic like fluorescence peak however the exact location of the peaks might vary slightly depending the type of samples or the conditions of the instrument for example the position of the highest peak of un irradiated pvc dom i e ex em of 250 305 nm did not coincide with that of peak p i e ex em of 270 305 nm fig s3a to compensate for this variation an excitation wavelength region with 40 nm interval at a fixed emission wavelength was considered to define the peaks p h and l as shown in figs 1e 1h in other words ex em of 250 290 305 nm 270 310 305 nm and 220 260 405 nm were designated as the integrated ranges of peaks p h and l respectively in previous literature several fluorescence indicators have been derived from the intensity ratios of different wavelength ranges rather than ratios of individual peaks heo et al 2016 ohno 2002 in the present study we proposed a relative ratio of the integrated regions of the three peak ranges namely h p l as a source discrimination index for mp dom the suggested index h p l showed significant differences between mp dom and aquatic nom compared to the simple ratio of h l i e h l fig 2 a significant difference was observed in the h p l ratios between the two groups irrespective of the leaching conditions i e dark versus uv irradiation student s t test p 0 001 while the difference in the simple h l peak ratio was negligible p 0 165 moreover the fluorescence proxies that have been widely used for nom source discrimination such as bix and fi exhibited insignificant differences between the two groups p 0 729 and 0 083 respectively fig s3 hix values which represent the relative degree of humification were higher in the aquatic nom group 0 706 0 918 than in the mp dom samples 0 078 to 0 337 p 0 001 this result was consistent with the previous observation of the absorption properties which indicated relatively higher aromatic contents in aquatic nom than in mp dom three different fdom components were identified via eem parafac modeling which included two humic like components components 1 and 2 and one protein phenol like component component 3 fig s6 their peak locations were compared with those previously reported in the literature on aquatic nom and mp dom table s2 components 1 c1 and 2 c2 exhibited maxima at 260 330 452 nm and 240 285 385 nm ex em respectively component 3 c3 exhibited its maximum intensity at 270 307 nm ex em the two humic like components c1 and c2 were analogous to those typically reported in natural aquatic systems kowalczuk et al 2013 lee et al 2018 li et al 2016 although the feature of c2 partially overlapped with peaks h and l in the previous eem spectra of the mp dom samples however the peak location of c3 matched with peak p in the eems of the mp dom samples similar results have been reported for leached solutions from plastic materials lee et al 2020a spagnuolo et al 2017 the mp dom group was characterized by the abundant presence of c3 at 74 1 84 0 while aquatic nom was dominated by the other two components i e c1 c2 at 65 2 60 2 table s2 the relatively higher distribution of the protein phenol like component c3 in the mp dom versus aquatic nom groups was in line with a previous report demonstrating the higher bio labile properties of mp dom compared with aquatic nom romera castillo et al 2018 in this regard c3 can be considered an indicator of the presence of mp dom whereas c1 appears to be highly linked to aquatic nom in typical aquatic systems although c2 was more abundant in aquatic nom than in mp dom 23 1 50 1 for aquatic nom vs 11 4 18 4 for mp dom the component was present as a common fluorescence feature of both dom groups hampering the clear discrimination between the two groups taken together in this study c1 and c3 were assigned as nom dominating humic like and mp dominating protein phenol like components and c2 as a typical humic like component table s3 3 2 changes in optical indices with varying abundances of mp dom in the mixtures with nom the changes in the selected spectroscopic indices with increasing mp dom carbon content in the mixtures with aquatic nom are shown in fig 3 except for some indices e2 e4 e3 e4 bix and fi most measured optical indices showed significant relationships with increasing mp dom fraction p 0 001 notably the mixing experiments were conducted with the same doc concentration i e 1 mg c l so the investigated indices should be dependent only on the physical mixing ratios of the two end members the observed changes in the indices with increasing mp dom abundance presented one of the following four patterns 1 a linear decreasing trend which was shown by the humic like fluorescence related indices i e peaks h and l hix c1 and c2 2 a linear increasing trend which was led by s275 295 peak p c3 and the ratio of peak h to l h l 3 a nonlinear decreasing trend which was revealed by the absorption coefficients at 254 nm and 355 nm and 4 a nonlinear increasing trend exhibited by the h p l ratio fig 3 the optical indices showing decreasing trends were all related to the dom aromatic carbon structure which included humic like fluorescence and hix in contrast the protein phenol like fluorescence properties presented an increasing trend with higher mp dom fractions which was well matched with our previous observation as well as other prior reports on the release of predominant protein like fluorophores from commercial plastics in contact with water lee et al 2020a the dominance of protein phenol like fluorescence features can be attributed in part to the release of plastic additives from commercial plastics which are often detected by fluorescence spectroscopy in the wavelength ranges related to protein or phenol like fluorescence spagnuolo et al 2017 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 except for the h l ratio we observed a common trend in which these spectral ratios showed better capabilities for mp dom detection in the mixtures than those directly obtained from a particular wavelength as shown by their higher r2 values r2 0 6169 0 8566 versus 0 1706 0 8213 among the regressions with p values of 0 001 fig 3 3 3 evaluation of source discrimination indices for mp dom the source discrimination capability of the selected optical indices was evaluated by comparing 1 the p values of the student s t test between 0 and 100 mp dom samples 2 the r2 values of the linear regressions between the optical indices and mp dom fraction in which nonlinear relationships were log transformed to make them comparable with linear indices and 3 the minimum distinguishable mp dom value which was defined by the minimum mp dom value with a p value of 0 05 based on the student s t test with 0 mp dom samples or pure aquatic nom samples lee et al 2018 yang and hur 2014 table 1 the first evaluation criterion refers to the minimum requirement for the source discrimination indicator between the two end members i e mp dom vs aquatic nom while the second one can serve as a measure of the index s accuracy to estimate the relative abundance of mp dom in the mixture with aquatic nom thus the index revealing a statistically significant difference between two end member groups with a relatively higher r2 value can be regarded as a better surrogate for detecting plastic derived dom in environmental samples containing aquatic nom for example although c2 exhibited a significant difference between the two end member groups it inaccurately distinguish mp dom from typical nom solutions because of the relatively low r2 value 0 2854 among the tested optical indices three optical indices satisfied the first two criteria peak p hix and the h p l ratio finally the minimum distinguishable mp dom was compared for the three indices which helped to choose the best source discrimination index with a high accuracy for mp dom detection in environmental samples among the three candidates the newly suggested eem peak ratio h p l presented the lowest mp dom i e 3 which suggests that it is the most robust and reliable indicator for discriminating plastic derived carbon sources in aquatic systems romera castillo et al 2018 have demonstrated that up to 10 of doc in sea surface microlayer could originate from wasted floating plastics in the polluted aquatic environment although the estimate was extrapolated from the results of laboratory experiments the study implies that the discrimination level of our proposed index is sufficient to detect mp dom in any water body suffering from severe plastic pollution 3 4 applicability of mp dom discrimination indices for environmental samples although the h p l ratio performs the best as a source discriminator for mp dom among the three candidate indices it is still necessary to further evaluate its feasibility for environmental samples containing mp particles to this end additional leaching tests were conducted using commercial eps plastics 500 and 1000 eps per liter for 7 days under dark and uv irradiation conditions in artificial freshwater as well as in two different nom solutions i e paldang reservoir l2 treated effluent e2 table 2 and fig s7 for all the prepared solutions significant changes in the three indices occurred as a result of the production of mp dom or leaching student s t test p 0 05 which was in contrast to the insignificant difference in the doc concentrations before versus after leaching p 0 061 for 500 pieces of eps l p 0 052 for 1000 pieces of eps l table 2 the leaching driven changes were more pronounced for the samples under uv irradiation than for those in the dark for example the intensity of peak p increased by 1 86 to 2 94 times in the dark treated samples after leaching while the increase reached 2 36 to 3 69 times in the irradiated counterparts when 1000 pieces per liter were added to the solutions irrespective of the added amount of plastics and the leaching conditions the new fluorescence indicator h p l showed the most significant difference in the background solutions with and without mps p 0 01 for all cases these findings are noteworthy because the amount of added plastics falls within the ranges previously reported in freshwater 0 01 to 519 pieces per liter and wastewater effluent samples 338 to 1473 pieces per liter pivokonsky et al 2018 furthermore the h p l ratio showed relatively small variations 2 0 to 5 5 fold across the different background nom solutions i e artificial freshwater reservoir and effluents when compared with the other indices doc 0 96 to 17 3 fold hix 0 93 to 7 0 fold and peak p 1 6 to 53 5 fold the intensity of peak p increased by 48 times in artificial freshwater containing 1000 eps per liter under uv irradiation which changed from 0 002 0 000 r u in the control samples i e no mp to 0 096 0 001 r u while it increased by only six folds in the effluent samples i e e2 varying from 0 017 0 001 r u to 0 104 0 006 r u in contrast the h p l ratio showed relatively stable incremental changes against the three nom background solutions showing 5 0 to 5 5 fold changes across the three nom solutions containing 1000 pieces of eps per liter compared to the control samples in the light condition the results suggest that the new index is not significantly affected by the sources of nom as the background therefore it can be effectively used to track mp dom in environmental samples the incorporation of peaks h and l in the new index seems to partially resolve the overlapping problem of peak p in mp dom with the protein phenol like fluorescence in the nom samples another benefit is that the h p l ratio as a source discriminator is not dependent upon the concentrations of samples in this work the excellent discrimination capability of the h p l ratio for mp dom and the minimal interference from nom background solutions suggest that the ratio is a robust indicator for detecting the presence of plastic derived dom in mp polluted aquatic systems that are affected by various nom sources 3 5 limitations and environmental implications for future studies our results identified unique fluorescence features of mp dom that can be distinguished from aquatic nom from various sources based on a careful comparison of the eem features between mp dom and aquatic nom groups a new source discrimination indicator was proposed we demonstrate that the new indicator h p l has higher sensitivity and accuracy in detecting mp dom presence in environmental samples relative to other commonly used optical descriptors for nom as well as to other fluorescence features uniquely observed in mp dom the new index was a robust source discriminator because the value showed little variability with background nom sources however a limitation of this study was that the new index was only evaluated for mp dom leached from a few plastic types furthermore the effect of background nom concentrations on the relationships between optical indices and mp dom abundance was not fully considered in the end member mixing analysis therefore further comparative experiments are required to confirm whether the new index is applicable to other plastic materials and or other background nom solutions with varying doc concentrations in the same vein complementary studies need to be conducted to extend its applicability to a wider range of environmental samples including those presenting an extremely high peak p e g petroleum industry wastewater which might lower the discrimination capability of the h p l ratio tracking the potential alternation in the suggested index during natural transformation processes of dom such as microbial photo degradation or interactions with other media is another interesting topic for future investigations which can help strengthen the feasibility of source discrimination in the field in particular considering the dominant presence of protein phenol like fluorescence in mp dom and the strong association between the peak intensity and the liability of dom which is well documented in the literature the effect of biodegradation on the change in the new index h p l should be further explored in the future various leaching conditions using different ph ionic strengths and sizes of plastic pieces should also be tested to enhance the robustness of the new source discriminator finally encouraged by the finding that the distinctive fluorescence signal of plastic derived dom is enhanced by uv irradiation on mps future studies should focus on optimizing conditions to produce a closed detection system equipped with an artificial uv irradiation to maximize the plastic related signal in environmental samples the system could be further developed into a cost effective and fast screening tool to complement the conventional time consuming detection methods for mp contamination such as particle counting ft ir and mass spectroscopy 4 conclusions given that plastic waste is a global fast growing environmental issue and non negligible amount of dom could be leached from the plastic in aquatic environment the quantitative tracking of mp dom in the presence of aquatic nom is important for fully understand the fate and the dynamics of dom in aquatic systems suffering from plastic pollution this study took advantage of the unique spectroscopic properties of plastic derived dom generated under dark and uv irradiation conditions to propose an optical source discrimination index for the presence of mp dom in environmental samples two distinct changing patterns were identified for the tested optical indices during the mixing of two contrasting dom end members i e mp dom and typical aquatic nom samples after careful examination a new optical descriptor the ratio of h p l was proposed to track the plastic originated carbon in the presence of nom solutions based on the results the following key conclusions were determined 1 three prominent peaks were commonly observed in the eem spectra of mp dom particularly uv irradiated peaks which included one phenol protein like fluorescence peak p and two humic like fluorescence peaks peaks h and l distinctive features between mp dom and aquatic nom led to the establishment of a source discrimination index consisting of the three peaks which was defined as h p l 2 the source tracking index showed a clear change during end member mixing compared with other well known optical indices the ratio of h p l served as a good surrogate for discriminating the mp c source fraction which was corroborated by the highest positive correlation and the minimum detectable mp c r2 0 8767 3 of mp fraction among the tested indices for two mp dom and eight aquatic nom solutions 3 irrespective of the added amount of mps and the leaching conditions the new fluorescence index presented the highest distinction between nom solutions with and without the plastic the index was relatively invariable between the sources of nom background solutions suggesting that the h p l ratio can serve as a robust indicator of plastic derived dom in the presence of aquatic nom declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16520,recently studies have increasingly focused on the occurrence of plastic leachate and its effects on aquatic environments however few studies have aimed to identify microplastic derived dissolved organic matter mp dom from environmental samples that are often enriched with natural organic matter nom in this study three mp dom eps dom pvc dom and pet dom and eight aquatic nom samples and their mixtures were used to identify a unique optical surrogate for mp dom within background nom three major fluorescence peaks peaks p h and l were identified in the excitation emission matrix eem spectra of both dom sources i e mp dom and nom the first two peaks were more pronounced for mp dom than for aquatic nom whereas peak l showed the opposite trend the summed intensity ratio of the ranges of the first two peaks relative to peak l namely h p l clearly distinguished between mp dom and nom samples the mp dom source discrimination capability was compared for several selected spectroscopic indices by tracking their changes in the mixtures of two source groups with increasing fraction of mp dom via end member mixing analysis this was further evaluated based on the three criteria built on the significance of the difference between the two groups the correlation coefficients of the regressions and the minimum fraction of mp dom in mixtures that can be distinguished from 100 nom samples irrespective of the plastic type and leaching conditions i e uv irradiated or not the new optical index h p l was superior at distinguishing mp dom from the mixtures when compared to other commonly used optical indices the new index can serve as a sensitive robust and reliable fluorescence indicator with minimal interference from nom for detecting plastic leachate in aquatic samples graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics source discrimination fluorescence end member mixing analysis natural organic matter 1 introduction increasing amounts of uncontrolled plastic disposal and its subsequent environmental impacts have become a critical global issue in particular research has focused on micro sized plastic particles i e microplastics or mps that are unintentionally generated from initial waste materials during their transport to the ocean via rivers or coastal systems galloway et al 2017 su et al 2020 in addition to the occurrence of mps in various environments dissolved organic substances leached from disposed mps referred to as plastic derived dom are another critical aspect for understanding the fate and environmental significance of mps romera castillo et al 2018 the degree of leaching from mps and the characteristics of plastic derived dom are dependent on the weathering processes exerted on mps such as exposure to uv light potthoff et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 plastic derived dom actively interacts with environmental media and other pollutants lee et al 2021 lee and hur 2020 this phenomenon is more pronounced when mps are exposed to sunlight or uv light devices installed in treatment facilities as mp exposure to uv stimulates the release of plastic derived dom from mps egessa et al 2020 shen et al 2020 given that plastic derived dom may contain several additives and or carbon chain scission products and that many of these substances are light absorbing gewert et al 2018 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 it is necessary to explore the feasibility of detecting these plastic derived substances by employing uv visible and or fluorescence spectroscopy this idea is partly supported by many previous examples of applying fluorescence spectroscopy to probe the occurrence and dynamics of naturally occurring dom carstea et al 2016 he et al 2016 jaffé et al 2014 regarding the optical probing of plastic derived dom a few recent studies spagnuolo et al 2017 have examined protein like fluorescence features of bisphenol a that were leached from plastics as a common additive more recently lee et al 2020a demonstrated that protein like fluorophores were optical proxies for plastic derived dom which is likely to contain additives and plastic polymers they further found that a humic like fluorescence peak was a distinctive signature of plastic derived dom produced under uv irradiation however these fluorescence signatures from plastic derived dom highly overlapped with those of natural organic matter nom which hampered their applicability as a probing index for plastic derived dom in aquatic systems enriched with nom lee et al 2021 2020a optical indices derived from simple calculations such as relative abundance or the ratio of different optical features have been widely used to identify and track dom sources and also to characterize dom dynamics due to their advantages of high sensitivity ease of analysis and online monitoring and low cost derrien et al 2017 li and hur 2017 the application of these spectroscopic indicators for source discrimination is primarily rooted in the differences in the light absorbing dom levels at a particular wavelength across contrasting end members or different source samples derrien et al 2019 lee et al 2018 yang and hur 2014 for instance lee et al 2018 proposed several reasonable criteria for selecting a reliable discrimination index that is least affected by biogeochemical processing among the commonly used indices such as the biological index bix huguet et al 2009 specific uv absorbance suva weishaar et al 2003 and the fluorescence index fi mcknight et al 2001 although the commonly used optical indices have been successful for nom source discrimination it is uncertain whether they are still feasible for plastic derived dom because the previously reported proxies were all based on the inherent characteristics of aquatic nom only in this context it is necessary to unearth a reliable optical proxy for identifying plastic derived dom in environmental samples containing background nom moreover the effort to find out the proxy can be further developed into the basis of a cost effective screening tool for the initial detection of mps before applying conventional detection methods such as infrared spectroscopy or particle counting to the best of our knowledge previous studies have not yet suggested a new spectroscopic indicator to probe plastic derived dom in nom containing environmental samples in this context this study specifically aimed to 1 compare the spectroscopic characteristics of dom leached from two commercial mps in different nom background solutions e g rivers lakes streams and wastewater effluents 2 evaluate the source discrimination capabilities of several selected optical parameters including newly proposed indices at varying mixing ratios of plastic derived dom and aquatic nom i e two dom end members and 3 provide insight into the applicability of a new spectroscopic proxy for detecting mp contamination in aquatic samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of microplastic derived organic matter mp dom expanded polystyrene eps polyvinylchloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet were selected as the representative plastics in this study eps and pet represent buoyant plastic types with a relatively low density which are more likely to be impacted by sunlight in aquatic environment compared to the non floating pvc particles commercial plastics were purchased in sheet form 1 mm in thickness for pvc as windshield and pet as part of facial mask and as beads 1 mm in diameter for eps from a local market in seoul south korea the sheet types of plastic were cut into pieces of approximately 1 1 mm which were then sufficiently washed with distilled water to remove any impurities that might occur during sample handling for mp dom samples as end members leaching experiments were conducted in an artificial freshwater solution containing 5 0 g plastic l under two leaching conditions i e under dark and uv irradiation conditions the leaching solution was composed of nahco3 96 mg l caso4 47 4 mg l mgso4 122 86 mg l and kcl 4 mg l majedi et al 2014 the uv irradiation was intended to simulate an environment in which the plastic pieces are exposed to sunlight for a long period of time in this experiment the leaching lasted for 14 days lee and hur 2020 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 the mp doses in the solution was set higher than the range typically observed in natural environments alimi et al 2018 chae and an 2018 to obtain the maximum amount of mp dom for further end member mixing for the uv irradiation setting the freshwater solutions containing the mp pieces were transferred to quartz beakers 1 l that had previously been autoclaved at 120 c for 15 min the leaching was performed in beakers in triplicate for the leaching experiment with exposure to uv light a beaker was placed in the center of a closed cabinet with six 8 w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl as the light source the reactor temperature was maintained at 25 3 c by circulating cooling air with fans phong and hur 2015 the top of the beaker was covered with aluminum foil to prevent the volatilization of the solution a stirrer was placed at the bottom of each beaker for continuous mixing throughout the leaching period at the end of leaching the mixing solutions were filtered through pre ashed whatman gf f filters to obtain the mp dom samples a glass vacuum filtration device was used to avoid unnecessary contact with any extraneous plastic material the final dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of the mp dom samples were 0 63 to 0 68 mg c l for the dark condition and 1 14 to 3 99 mg c l for the uv irradiation setup for end member mixing experiment only uv irradiated mp dom samples were used in which eps dom pvc dom and pet dom were arbitrarily denoted as mp1 mp2 and mp3 respectively table s1 for another experiment to mimic the real leaching situation in natural and engineered systems section 3 4 the artificial freshwater solution was replaced with pre filtered lake water from lake paldang in south korea l2 or treated effluent from an industrial wastewater treatment facility e2 as background solutions at a fixed doc concentration of 1 mg c l eps a buoyant plastic was selected as a representative plastic type for this study the leaching process lasted for a shorter time period i e 7 days but under the same conditions as the previous experiment both dark and uv irradiation conditions for the designated leaching time the reported residence time 7 days of lake paldang as a background solution was taken into account to determine the leaching period kim et al 2002 the added eps plastic dose 500 and 1000 pieces eps l was set at a similar level to those previously reported in mp polluted aquatic environments which were 0 01 to 519 mp l in rivers and 338 to 1473 mp l in wastewater effluents pivokonsky et al 2018 the details of the research method are presented in figure s1 2 2 preparation of end member dom and the mixtures eight water samples from different sources and locations river r1 and r2 lake reservoir l1 and l2 stream s1 and s2 and treated effluent e1 and e2 were selected as an aquatic nom source group in contrast to mp dom suwanee river fulvic acid srfa r1 and poly lake fulvic acid plfa l1 purchased from the international humic substances society ihss http ihss humicsubstances org were also included in the nom end member group table s1 powdered ihss nom materials 5 mg were dissolved in 1 l of deionized water to prepare the nom solutions the other aquatic nom samples were collected from several sources including the han river r2 lake paldang l2 toypeong stream s1 nakhwaam stream s2 and municipal e1 and industrial e2 wastewater treatment facilities from june 2020 to march 2021 details of the sampling sites are presented in table s1 all samples were acidified using sulfuric acid in the field to minimize deterioration before they were transported to the laboratory for filtration through a pre ashed whatman gf f filter the ph was then adjusted to 7 0 to recover the field ph condition the initial doc concentrations of the samples ranged from 1 0 to 10 8 mg c l table s1 uv irradiated mp dom and aquatic nom were diluted to a constant concentration of 1 0 mg c l and adjusted to ph 7 the two end members were mixed with ten different volume ratios of 0 100 1 99 3 97 5 95 10 90 20 80 30 70 50 50 75 25 and 100 0 in which a ratio of 0 100 represents 100 aquatic nom while a ratio of 100 0 represents pure mp dom the mp1 solution irradiated eps dom was mixed with all types of aquatic nom solutions whereas mp2 and mp3 irradiated pvc dom and pet dom were mixed with the ihss nom solutions or srfa r1 and plfa l1 thus a total twelve different solutions of dom mixtures i e mp1 r1 mp1 r2 mp1 l1 mp1 l2 mp1 s1 mp1 s2 mp1 e1 mp1 e2 mp2 r1 mp2 l1 mp3 r1 and mp3 l1 were considered for end member mixing experiment 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 dissolved organic carbon doc and uv vis spectroscopy doc concentrations were measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu l series tocchp japan absorption spectra from 200 to 800 nm were scanned at 1 nm intervals using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan the absorption coefficients of chromophoric dom cdom were measured at 254 nm and 355 nm a254 and a355 aλ 2 303 aλ pathlength where aλ is the optical density hu et al 2002 the absorption ratios at 254 to 436 nm and 300 to 400 nm e2 e4 and e3 e4 and the spectral slope s275 295 which is the slope of a linear regression for the log transformed absorption spectrum between 275 and 295 nm were calculated following the definitions in previous literature battin 1998 claret et al 2003 helms et al 2008 2 3 2 fluorescence eem measurements and parallel factor analysis parafac modeling fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were obtained using a luminescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan the eems were scanned at emission wavelengths em of 280 550 nm in 1 nm increments over an excitation wavelength ex range of 220 500 nm with a stepwise increase of 5 nm the excitation and emission slits were adjusted to 10 nm the fluorescence responses to distilled water were subtracted from the measured spectra to obtain the final eem data of the dom samples the fluorescence intensities were normalized to raman units r u using the fluorescence intensity of an integrated raman peak at 350 nm em lawaetz and stedmon 2009 three commonly used fluorescence indicators for source discrimination were estimated from the eem spectra the fluorescence index fi mcknight et al 2001 humification index hix ohno 2002 and biological index bix huguet et al 2009 the fi is the ratio of the emission intensity at 450 nm to that at 500 nm with an ex fixed at 370 nm which has a value of 1 9 for microbially derived dom and 1 4 for terrestrially derived dom mcknight et al 2001 the hix was utilized to indicate the degree of humification in dom which was calculated using the emission intensity area from 435 to 480 nm divided by the sum of two intensity areas from 300 to 345 nm and from 435 to 480 nm at 254 nm ex ohno 2002 bix is a rough descriptor for probing the presence of autochthonous dom which is associated with the presence of freshly produced dom from planktonic or microbial sources it was calculated using the intensity ratio at 310 nm 380 nm ex em to 310 nm 430 nm ex em huguet et al 2009 parallel factor analysis parafac modeling was performed using matlab 7 0 mathworks natick ma with the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 the number of independent fluorescent dom fdom components was determined using split half validation of the eem results from the end member mixtures n 275 and the percentage of the explained variance 98 7 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of the peak of the identified components was used to represent the relative quantities of the individual fdom components 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of spectroscopic features between mp dom and aquatic nom 3 1 1 uv absorption properties the uv absorption spectra of aquatic nom and mp dom under different leaching conditions i e dark and uv irradiation are shown in fig s2 and five typical absorption based parameters two absorption coefficients two absorption ratios and spectral slope were compared table s1 the spectra of pvc dom and pet dom showed a shoulder between 220 and 260 nm which was not observed in aquatic nom samples or eps dom a similar observation of a shoulder at 280 nm in the absorption spectra was previously reported for photo aged plastic derived dom samples shi et al 2021 after exposure to uv light both mp types released more cdom resulting in a higher uv absorption coefficient as compared to the cases without uv irradiation for example pvc dom exhibited 0 88 0 05 l m 1 mg c 1 for dark treated samples at 254 nm and 1 74 0 28 l m 1 mg c 1 for uv irradiated samples the a254 and a355 values of aquatic nom samples were higher than those of mp dom per the same doc concentration a254 0 88 2 03 m 1 mg c 1 for mp dom versus 1 99 8 47 m 1 mg c 1 for aquatic nom a355 0 03 0 98 m 1 mg c 1 for mp dom versus 0 78 5 07 m 1 mg c 1 for aquatic nom moreover the s275 295 values of mp dom 0 015 0 045 exhibited the opposite trend which were generally higher than those of aquatic nom 0 013 0 018 our results suggest that the aromatic content and average molecular weight of mp dom may be lower than those of typical aquatic nom galgani et al 2018 lee et al 2020b in contrast the difference in the two absorption ratios i e e2 e4 and e3 e4 between the two dom end members was nearly negligible student s test p 0 2015 and 0 4431 respectively probably because of the poor signals in the longer wavelength range from 350 to 500 nm fig s1 3 1 2 fluorescence properties and eem parafac modeling a prominent peak appeared in the protein phenol like fluorescence region of mp dom irrespective of the leaching conditions and the plastic types figs 1 a 1b and s3a s3d which was similar to peak b 225 280 305 nm defined by coble 1996 this peak was also observed in other plastic leachates containing bisphenol a which is a phenol like fluorescent substance spagnuolo et al 2017 as well as in wastewater samples comprising lignin phenols and polyaromatic hydrocarbons huang et al 2012 navalon et al 2011 the dominant peak was assigned to peak p in the present study the fluorescence intensity of peak p was much more pronounced in mp dom samples obtained under uv light than in the dark 0 113 to 0 139 r u for dark treated samples versus 0 173 to 0 197 r u for irradiated samples furthermore the doc normalized peak p intensities of all mp dom samples were more than six fold higher than those of aquatic nom figs 1e and 1f for example the peak p intensities of mp dom ranged from 0 113 to 0 196 r u whereas those of aquatic nom ranged from 0 031 to 0 108 r u the predominance of protein phenol like fluorescence features in this study was consistent with previous observations of other mp doms lee et al 2020a luo et al 2019 regardless of plastic types a notable difference in the eems between the dark and the uv treated mp dom was the occurrence of additional peaks in the humic like region at ex em of 230 405 nm and 290 405 nm for the latter figs 1b and s2b which were also reported in other mp dom studies lee et al 2021 2020a in this study the humic like peaks at 290 nm ex and 230 nm ex were designated as peaks h and l respectively two peaks were also observed in the aquatic nom samples figs 1c 1d and s3e to s3j however we observed a clear difference in the peaks between mp dom and the aquatic nom samples peak l was more pronounced than peak h in the aquatic nom samples while the higher intensity of peak l relative to peak h was not observed for mp dom meanwhile peak h exhibited a much higher intensity than peak l for the irradiated mp dom samples the dark treated mp dom samples showed similar levels of the two peak intensities figs 1g and 1h for example the intensities of peaks h and l were 0 103 r u and 0 064 r u respectively for the uv irradiated pvc dom fig 1e these distinctive features between mp dom and aquatic nom can produce a source discrimination index consisting of peaks h p and l in a way that maximizes the discrimination between the two dom end member groups the ratio of h l can distinguish between irradiated mp dom and aquatic nom furthermore the extremely high intensity of peak p in dark treated mp dom can also be effectively used to discriminate mp dom from aquatic nom in the absence of uv light i e no humic like fluorescence peak however the exact location of the peaks might vary slightly depending the type of samples or the conditions of the instrument for example the position of the highest peak of un irradiated pvc dom i e ex em of 250 305 nm did not coincide with that of peak p i e ex em of 270 305 nm fig s3a to compensate for this variation an excitation wavelength region with 40 nm interval at a fixed emission wavelength was considered to define the peaks p h and l as shown in figs 1e 1h in other words ex em of 250 290 305 nm 270 310 305 nm and 220 260 405 nm were designated as the integrated ranges of peaks p h and l respectively in previous literature several fluorescence indicators have been derived from the intensity ratios of different wavelength ranges rather than ratios of individual peaks heo et al 2016 ohno 2002 in the present study we proposed a relative ratio of the integrated regions of the three peak ranges namely h p l as a source discrimination index for mp dom the suggested index h p l showed significant differences between mp dom and aquatic nom compared to the simple ratio of h l i e h l fig 2 a significant difference was observed in the h p l ratios between the two groups irrespective of the leaching conditions i e dark versus uv irradiation student s t test p 0 001 while the difference in the simple h l peak ratio was negligible p 0 165 moreover the fluorescence proxies that have been widely used for nom source discrimination such as bix and fi exhibited insignificant differences between the two groups p 0 729 and 0 083 respectively fig s3 hix values which represent the relative degree of humification were higher in the aquatic nom group 0 706 0 918 than in the mp dom samples 0 078 to 0 337 p 0 001 this result was consistent with the previous observation of the absorption properties which indicated relatively higher aromatic contents in aquatic nom than in mp dom three different fdom components were identified via eem parafac modeling which included two humic like components components 1 and 2 and one protein phenol like component component 3 fig s6 their peak locations were compared with those previously reported in the literature on aquatic nom and mp dom table s2 components 1 c1 and 2 c2 exhibited maxima at 260 330 452 nm and 240 285 385 nm ex em respectively component 3 c3 exhibited its maximum intensity at 270 307 nm ex em the two humic like components c1 and c2 were analogous to those typically reported in natural aquatic systems kowalczuk et al 2013 lee et al 2018 li et al 2016 although the feature of c2 partially overlapped with peaks h and l in the previous eem spectra of the mp dom samples however the peak location of c3 matched with peak p in the eems of the mp dom samples similar results have been reported for leached solutions from plastic materials lee et al 2020a spagnuolo et al 2017 the mp dom group was characterized by the abundant presence of c3 at 74 1 84 0 while aquatic nom was dominated by the other two components i e c1 c2 at 65 2 60 2 table s2 the relatively higher distribution of the protein phenol like component c3 in the mp dom versus aquatic nom groups was in line with a previous report demonstrating the higher bio labile properties of mp dom compared with aquatic nom romera castillo et al 2018 in this regard c3 can be considered an indicator of the presence of mp dom whereas c1 appears to be highly linked to aquatic nom in typical aquatic systems although c2 was more abundant in aquatic nom than in mp dom 23 1 50 1 for aquatic nom vs 11 4 18 4 for mp dom the component was present as a common fluorescence feature of both dom groups hampering the clear discrimination between the two groups taken together in this study c1 and c3 were assigned as nom dominating humic like and mp dominating protein phenol like components and c2 as a typical humic like component table s3 3 2 changes in optical indices with varying abundances of mp dom in the mixtures with nom the changes in the selected spectroscopic indices with increasing mp dom carbon content in the mixtures with aquatic nom are shown in fig 3 except for some indices e2 e4 e3 e4 bix and fi most measured optical indices showed significant relationships with increasing mp dom fraction p 0 001 notably the mixing experiments were conducted with the same doc concentration i e 1 mg c l so the investigated indices should be dependent only on the physical mixing ratios of the two end members the observed changes in the indices with increasing mp dom abundance presented one of the following four patterns 1 a linear decreasing trend which was shown by the humic like fluorescence related indices i e peaks h and l hix c1 and c2 2 a linear increasing trend which was led by s275 295 peak p c3 and the ratio of peak h to l h l 3 a nonlinear decreasing trend which was revealed by the absorption coefficients at 254 nm and 355 nm and 4 a nonlinear increasing trend exhibited by the h p l ratio fig 3 the optical indices showing decreasing trends were all related to the dom aromatic carbon structure which included humic like fluorescence and hix in contrast the protein phenol like fluorescence properties presented an increasing trend with higher mp dom fractions which was well matched with our previous observation as well as other prior reports on the release of predominant protein like fluorophores from commercial plastics in contact with water lee et al 2020a the dominance of protein phenol like fluorescence features can be attributed in part to the release of plastic additives from commercial plastics which are often detected by fluorescence spectroscopy in the wavelength ranges related to protein or phenol like fluorescence spagnuolo et al 2017 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 except for the h l ratio we observed a common trend in which these spectral ratios showed better capabilities for mp dom detection in the mixtures than those directly obtained from a particular wavelength as shown by their higher r2 values r2 0 6169 0 8566 versus 0 1706 0 8213 among the regressions with p values of 0 001 fig 3 3 3 evaluation of source discrimination indices for mp dom the source discrimination capability of the selected optical indices was evaluated by comparing 1 the p values of the student s t test between 0 and 100 mp dom samples 2 the r2 values of the linear regressions between the optical indices and mp dom fraction in which nonlinear relationships were log transformed to make them comparable with linear indices and 3 the minimum distinguishable mp dom value which was defined by the minimum mp dom value with a p value of 0 05 based on the student s t test with 0 mp dom samples or pure aquatic nom samples lee et al 2018 yang and hur 2014 table 1 the first evaluation criterion refers to the minimum requirement for the source discrimination indicator between the two end members i e mp dom vs aquatic nom while the second one can serve as a measure of the index s accuracy to estimate the relative abundance of mp dom in the mixture with aquatic nom thus the index revealing a statistically significant difference between two end member groups with a relatively higher r2 value can be regarded as a better surrogate for detecting plastic derived dom in environmental samples containing aquatic nom for example although c2 exhibited a significant difference between the two end member groups it inaccurately distinguish mp dom from typical nom solutions because of the relatively low r2 value 0 2854 among the tested optical indices three optical indices satisfied the first two criteria peak p hix and the h p l ratio finally the minimum distinguishable mp dom was compared for the three indices which helped to choose the best source discrimination index with a high accuracy for mp dom detection in environmental samples among the three candidates the newly suggested eem peak ratio h p l presented the lowest mp dom i e 3 which suggests that it is the most robust and reliable indicator for discriminating plastic derived carbon sources in aquatic systems romera castillo et al 2018 have demonstrated that up to 10 of doc in sea surface microlayer could originate from wasted floating plastics in the polluted aquatic environment although the estimate was extrapolated from the results of laboratory experiments the study implies that the discrimination level of our proposed index is sufficient to detect mp dom in any water body suffering from severe plastic pollution 3 4 applicability of mp dom discrimination indices for environmental samples although the h p l ratio performs the best as a source discriminator for mp dom among the three candidate indices it is still necessary to further evaluate its feasibility for environmental samples containing mp particles to this end additional leaching tests were conducted using commercial eps plastics 500 and 1000 eps per liter for 7 days under dark and uv irradiation conditions in artificial freshwater as well as in two different nom solutions i e paldang reservoir l2 treated effluent e2 table 2 and fig s7 for all the prepared solutions significant changes in the three indices occurred as a result of the production of mp dom or leaching student s t test p 0 05 which was in contrast to the insignificant difference in the doc concentrations before versus after leaching p 0 061 for 500 pieces of eps l p 0 052 for 1000 pieces of eps l table 2 the leaching driven changes were more pronounced for the samples under uv irradiation than for those in the dark for example the intensity of peak p increased by 1 86 to 2 94 times in the dark treated samples after leaching while the increase reached 2 36 to 3 69 times in the irradiated counterparts when 1000 pieces per liter were added to the solutions irrespective of the added amount of plastics and the leaching conditions the new fluorescence indicator h p l showed the most significant difference in the background solutions with and without mps p 0 01 for all cases these findings are noteworthy because the amount of added plastics falls within the ranges previously reported in freshwater 0 01 to 519 pieces per liter and wastewater effluent samples 338 to 1473 pieces per liter pivokonsky et al 2018 furthermore the h p l ratio showed relatively small variations 2 0 to 5 5 fold across the different background nom solutions i e artificial freshwater reservoir and effluents when compared with the other indices doc 0 96 to 17 3 fold hix 0 93 to 7 0 fold and peak p 1 6 to 53 5 fold the intensity of peak p increased by 48 times in artificial freshwater containing 1000 eps per liter under uv irradiation which changed from 0 002 0 000 r u in the control samples i e no mp to 0 096 0 001 r u while it increased by only six folds in the effluent samples i e e2 varying from 0 017 0 001 r u to 0 104 0 006 r u in contrast the h p l ratio showed relatively stable incremental changes against the three nom background solutions showing 5 0 to 5 5 fold changes across the three nom solutions containing 1000 pieces of eps per liter compared to the control samples in the light condition the results suggest that the new index is not significantly affected by the sources of nom as the background therefore it can be effectively used to track mp dom in environmental samples the incorporation of peaks h and l in the new index seems to partially resolve the overlapping problem of peak p in mp dom with the protein phenol like fluorescence in the nom samples another benefit is that the h p l ratio as a source discriminator is not dependent upon the concentrations of samples in this work the excellent discrimination capability of the h p l ratio for mp dom and the minimal interference from nom background solutions suggest that the ratio is a robust indicator for detecting the presence of plastic derived dom in mp polluted aquatic systems that are affected by various nom sources 3 5 limitations and environmental implications for future studies our results identified unique fluorescence features of mp dom that can be distinguished from aquatic nom from various sources based on a careful comparison of the eem features between mp dom and aquatic nom groups a new source discrimination indicator was proposed we demonstrate that the new indicator h p l has higher sensitivity and accuracy in detecting mp dom presence in environmental samples relative to other commonly used optical descriptors for nom as well as to other fluorescence features uniquely observed in mp dom the new index was a robust source discriminator because the value showed little variability with background nom sources however a limitation of this study was that the new index was only evaluated for mp dom leached from a few plastic types furthermore the effect of background nom concentrations on the relationships between optical indices and mp dom abundance was not fully considered in the end member mixing analysis therefore further comparative experiments are required to confirm whether the new index is applicable to other plastic materials and or other background nom solutions with varying doc concentrations in the same vein complementary studies need to be conducted to extend its applicability to a wider range of environmental samples including those presenting an extremely high peak p e g petroleum industry wastewater which might lower the discrimination capability of the h p l ratio tracking the potential alternation in the suggested index during natural transformation processes of dom such as microbial photo degradation or interactions with other media is another interesting topic for future investigations which can help strengthen the feasibility of source discrimination in the field in particular considering the dominant presence of protein phenol like fluorescence in mp dom and the strong association between the peak intensity and the liability of dom which is well documented in the literature the effect of biodegradation on the change in the new index h p l should be further explored in the future various leaching conditions using different ph ionic strengths and sizes of plastic pieces should also be tested to enhance the robustness of the new source discriminator finally encouraged by the finding that the distinctive fluorescence signal of plastic derived dom is enhanced by uv irradiation on mps future studies should focus on optimizing conditions to produce a closed detection system equipped with an artificial uv irradiation to maximize the plastic related signal in environmental samples the system could be further developed into a cost effective and fast screening tool to complement the conventional time consuming detection methods for mp contamination such as particle counting ft ir and mass spectroscopy 4 conclusions given that plastic waste is a global fast growing environmental issue and non negligible amount of dom could be leached from the plastic in aquatic environment the quantitative tracking of mp dom in the presence of aquatic nom is important for fully understand the fate and the dynamics of dom in aquatic systems suffering from plastic pollution this study took advantage of the unique spectroscopic properties of plastic derived dom generated under dark and uv irradiation conditions to propose an optical source discrimination index for the presence of mp dom in environmental samples two distinct changing patterns were identified for the tested optical indices during the mixing of two contrasting dom end members i e mp dom and typical aquatic nom samples after careful examination a new optical descriptor the ratio of h p l was proposed to track the plastic originated carbon in the presence of nom solutions based on the results the following key conclusions were determined 1 three prominent peaks were commonly observed in the eem spectra of mp dom particularly uv irradiated peaks which included one phenol protein like fluorescence peak p and two humic like fluorescence peaks peaks h and l distinctive features between mp dom and aquatic nom led to the establishment of a source discrimination index consisting of the three peaks which was defined as h p l 2 the source tracking index showed a clear change during end member mixing compared with other well known optical indices the ratio of h p l served as a good surrogate for discriminating the mp c source fraction which was corroborated by the highest positive correlation and the minimum detectable mp c r2 0 8767 3 of mp fraction among the tested indices for two mp dom and eight aquatic nom solutions 3 irrespective of the added amount of mps and the leaching conditions the new fluorescence index presented the highest distinction between nom solutions with and without the plastic the index was relatively invariable between the sources of nom background solutions suggesting that the h p l ratio can serve as a robust indicator of plastic derived dom in the presence of aquatic nom declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16521,vanadium has been classified as a potentially toxic metal and has been given limited attention in comparison to similar trace metals similarly worldwide and continental vanadium pollution and risks remain contested here we synthesized the worldwide concentration of vanadium in marine ecosystems with the relevant ecological and human health risks we found that vanadium in biota and seawater collected from asia shows significant increases over the temporal analysis with rates similar to those reported for vanadium consumption and production furthermore invertebrates have a higher concentration of vanadium than fishes similarly we demonstrate that sediments classified as polluted have concentrations that are not directly correlated with the highest concentrations across continents finally ecological risks were higher from seawater with potential impacts to 55 of aquatic species in asia estimated from chronic species sensitivity distribution ssd the concentration endangering only 5 of seawater species hc5 was estimated as 1 13 0 05 21 19 μg l 1 estimated daily intakes revealed that overall there are none to low health risks from aquatic product consumption yet high risks are plausible to children with consumption patterns in the 95th percentile graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trace metals sediments seawater marine organisms diffuse pollution risk assessment 1 introduction vanadium is a ubiquitous trace metal on earth the second most abundant transition metal in seawater butler 1998 and the 20th most abundant element in the continental crust hans wedepohl 1995 in recent years vanadium has been classified as a potentially toxic element in the same category as lead arsenic and mercury according to the united states environment protection agency usepa naeem et al 2007 nonetheless there is still a debate regarding the needs and fundamental roles of vanadium in biological organisms researchers consider vanadium an essential element wang et al 2020a 2021 supported by nontoxic bioaccumulation in three groups of species rehder 2015 and biological processes such as the bacterial vanadium dependent nitrogenases or haloperoxidases lee et al 2018 mclauchlan et al 2018 or respiration shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 on the other hand whether vanadium is essential in evolutionary younger organisms remains questionable its overall concentration within organisms is small and its direct roles are species specific thus lacking total support for fundamental vanadium needs different concerns have been raised in the literature mainly regarding the creation of reactive oxygen species after vanadium exposure ehrlich et al 2008 fatola et al 2019 and the activation of mitogen activated protein kinase mapk leading to neuroinflammation jaiswal and kale 2020 causing oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in brain cells caito and aschner 2015 several toxicological reports with mild and acute exposure to vanadium have reported gastrointestinal problems skin and eye irritation pain emphysema pneumonia olopade and connor 2011 cardiovascular diseases soares et al 2008 and cognitive abilities in humans folarin et al 2016 likewise vanadium plays a vital role in our rapidly developing world it is present in different industrial systems and products such as catalysts pigments phosphorous fertilizers batteries high pressure lamps and oil fired power plants hartung et al 2015 iarc international agency for research on cancer 2006 the large majority of vanadium related industries are located in coastal ecosystems where high anthropogenic pressure exists due to agricultural urban or industrial development ivanov et al 2019 at the same time aquatic ecosystems encountering high pollution states are driven by exchanging elements such as vanadium based compounds ajeya et al 2020 hope 2008 similarly vanadium production around the world reached over 75 000 tons in 2020 united states geological survey 2021 fig s1 likewise vanadium consumption doubled between 2002 and 2013 moving from 40 000 tons to approximately 80 000 tons imtiaz et al 2015 reaching 109 700 in 2020 vanitec 2021 fig s2 this study aims to review the worldwide occurrence of vanadium in marine ecosystems across sediment water and biota by screening the existing literature over the last 20 years that directly quantifies vanadium similarly we addressed hazardous concentrations and pollution problems in aquatic environments that could directly and indirectly affect species and humans as the top consumers to our knowledge there have not been similar studies for heavy metals nor vanadium investigating risks pollution and links between marine ecosystems across regions nor the world we present evidence from 260 studies e g 144 sediment studies 40 seawater sample studies 99 marine biota articles 46 fish studies 33 invertebrate studies and 35 multiple group studies across 63 countries and 23 seas hence the main aims of the present study were to carry out a major overview of vanadium changes in marine ecosystems anthropogenic contributions towards vanadium pollution and the assessment of ecological and health risks for each continent to identify potential threats to species and consumers 2 methodology 2 1 selection criteria the present study aimed to provide an analysis of studies on vanadium concentration in marine ecosystems in different media e g sediment seawater fish and invertebrates including mollusks crustaceans and echinoderms worldwide the literature cited in the present study was extracted from the web of science citation index and search service https webofknowledge com using the following keywords vanadium and fish vanadium and fish and continent e g asia america europe africa oceania vanadium and invertebrates vanadium and invertebrates and continent e g asia america europe africa oceania vanadium and sediment and marine vanadium and seawater vanadium and water and continent in addition articles published in the last two decades from january 2000 until march 2021 were selected following the following criteria we reviewed a total of 2789 publications however the publications present in this review n 260 are selected results from this set last we checked the sampling time from the selected articles which was used as the predictor variable in the temporal analysis across media sampling period range 1993 2019 articles with multiple sampling locations reporting only the mean for each area were recorded and used only for the worldwide distribution plots fig 1 a and risks fig 8 articles with means and ranges reported for multiple sampling areas were included and used during the analysis and continental distribution figs 3 7 s3 the concentrations in seasonal studies or multiple sampling points within a small area were averaged and added as one sample point to the data set vanadium values reported only in figures were obtained by using webplotdigitizer https apps automeris io wpd finally the geographical positions were obtained within the manuscript or following the maps provided by the authors 2 2 data treatment the data presented in this article were collected from values reported for seawater sediment and tissue samples and converted to a uniform unit μg l 1 μg g 1 dry weight dw and μg g 1 wet weight ww assuming a moisture content of 80 for dried weight samples sediment pollution was classified following pollution indices while pollution sources were collected from the site description or throughout the conclusions values in tables were rounded while plots and analysis used total values for further precision the mean standard deviation and range minimum maximum were reported for each study and multiple locations in the analysis and in the tables supplementary materials wherever available 2 3 vanadium transfer between ecosystems to build relationships between the ecological transfer of vanadium in marine ecosystems we used bioconcentration factors bcf the bioconcentration factor has been widely used to analyze pollution from different media to marine organisms arnot and gobas 2006 and was calculated as follows 1 b c f w a t e r s e d c v c e where c v μg kg 1 wet weight represents the country s average concentration of vanadium in aquatic organisms fish and invertebrates and c e represents the country s average concentration in seawater μg l 1 and sediments μg kg 1 dry weight for countries with missing environmental data we used the average continental concentration for the corresponding media 2 4 ecological and health risk assessment 2 4 1 risk quotient the risk quotient rq approach has been widely used to assess the environmental risk of pollutants for aquatic organisms under the long term impact the rq is an advantageous method including a concentration addition effect and is expressed as eq 2 2 r q m e c p n e c s s d where mec is the average measured environmental concentration of vanadium in seawater samples and pnecssd is the predicted no effect concentration to protect most of the species in the aquatic ecosystem european commission 2003 eq 3 was used to calculate the pnecssd 3 pnec hc 5 a f where hc5 is the 5th percentile hazardous concentration a standard threshold associated with toxic endpoints and species risks hc5 was obtained from a species sensitivity distribution ssd with a monte carlo simulation and bootstrap approach an ssd is a cumulative density function cdf of toxic points for a target toxicant the ssd curve was created by fitting a log normal distribution of toxic benchmarks e g lc50 50 of lethal concentration loec lowest observed effect concentration and noec no observed effect concentration kooijman 1987 li et al 2021 with the aim to homogenize toxic endpoints and predict chronic noec lc50 with a minimum study duration of 4 days lc50 4 and loecs were divided by an uncertainty factor of 5 and 2 5 respectively warne et al 2018 lc50 values with study duration other than 96 h were converted to 4 day lc50 using the following equation wu et al 2011 l c 50 4 l c 50 t t 4 0 8175 where t represents the exposure duration of lc50 days a total of 68 toxicity data records for vanadium was obtained from the usepa ecotoxicity database ecotox http cfpub epa gov ecotox european chemicals agency echa https www echa europa eu and information system ecotoxicology and environmental quality targets http webetox uba de webetox a pre selection of one value for each species when multiple data was available was conducted according to echa 2008 leaving a final dataset of 15 marine species with different toxicity endpoints and effects table s2 the resulting datasets were ranked at hc5 and the values of 2 5 and 97 5 were adopted as the lower and upper 95 confidence limits respectively this study calculated the pnec by dividing the hc5 with an assessment factor derived from an empirical survey by usepa 1985 af 2 afs account for uncertainty based on potential differences in interspecies and intraspecies variability laboratory to field variability and extrapolation of acute to chronic effects echa 2008 according to generally used ranking criteria the risk levels were high for an rq of 1 medium at 1 rq 0 1 and low at an rq of 0 1 2 4 2 potential ecological risks the potential ecological risk er was applied to assess further the environmental risks posed by vanadium in marine sediments the er was first proposed by håkanson 1980 and has become one of the most widely used and reliable indicators for ecological risks in sediments the index assesses the characteristics and environmental behavior of heavy metals similarly the method is suitable for single elements it comprises the contamination coefficient the toxic response factor for heavy metals a comprehensive contamination measure and a reference value potential ecological risk index is expressed as 4 er tr x cf where tr is the toxic response factor for vanadium tr 2 reflecting its toxicity and the sensitivity of biological pollution to heavy metals and cf is the contamination coefficient eq 5 was used to calculate the cf 5 c f c v c n where cv is the average concentration of vanadium in sediments in a study area and cn is the reference value cn was calculated for each continent from the average concentration of vanadium in sediments classified by researchers as nonpolluted table s3 due to studying a single regulator we used the following degrees of contamination and the evaluation criteria for risks assessment er 40 low 40 er 80 moderate 80 er 160 considerable 160 er 320 high er 320 very high 2 4 3 human risk assessment seafood consumption is thought to be one of the major routes of exposure to chemicals and vanadium is no exception uptake of vanadyl vanadium pentoxide and other compounds can interfere with phosphate producing ros rehder 2018 as a consequence it is essential to follow reference guides and determine risks the target hazard quotient thq has been widely used to estimate the non carcinogenic effects of contaminants through seafood ingestion tulcan et al 2021 which uses the ratio between the estimated daily intake edi ug kg 1 d 1 and the reference risk dose for vanadium rfd ug kg 1 d 1 the thq is calculated as follows 6 t h q e d i r f d where rfd is 7 ug kg 1 d 1 where kg refers to body weight usepa 2021 the edi values were calculated using 7 e d i m c d i e f e d b w t a where mc is the average vanadium concentration μg g 1 ww for each group and location di is the daily aquatic product

plots were used to determine the normality of the data log transformation was implemented when required linear model and one way analysis of variance anova assumptions were tested before comparing trends and differences between sediment pollution taxonomic and continental concentrations kolmogorov smirnov test was used to assess normality and ssd was performed with the packages mass as stats 3 results and discussion 3 1 the overall distribution of field studies vanadium was reported in different media across all continents with worldwide concentrations of 63 91 54 95 0 1 2114 μg g 1 9 05 23 42 0 001 120 μg l 1 0 73 1 41 8e 04 17 58 μg g 1 and 0 37 0 73 1e 04 15 μg g 1 in sediments seawater invertebrates and fishes respectively the continental concentration for each group the number of study locations and the number of studies are summarized in table 1 the results presented in fig 1 are a combination of worldwide vanadium concentrations 3 1 1 vanadium in aquatic medium on average vanadium concentrations in seawater were reported to be approximately 1 8 2 5 μg l 1 huang et al 2015 reimann and de caritat 2005 however in this study we found that the average concentrations of vanadium are higher in coastal ecosystems from africa and the americas table 1 nonetheless the reported vanadium concentrations are generally smaller than the reference value 100 μg l 1 established by the australia new zealand guidelines anzecc 2000 seawater samples despite limited reports show two patterns fig 2 first studies conducted in the americas had the earliest data 1995 2005 and reports from asia had a higher incidence in recent years 2011 2017 second there was a steep reduction in vanadium concentration in the americas 0 46 μg l 1year 1 highly likely to be linked and biased with the sampling site and time the highest concentrations were collected near oil extraction fields while in late years smaller concentrations were studied from less industrialized sites fig 3 similar studies were not conducted in the americas after 2005 the research direction and topic popularity could explain the higher number of studies in asia in recent years within those reports vanadium in seawater samples show that there has been an increase of 0 213 μg l 1year 1 worldwide the average vanadium concentration in sediments has been reported to be around 97 130 μg g 1 rudnick and gao 2003 turekian and wedepohl 1961 our study suggested that across field surveys the average concentrations are slightly lower across continents table 1 with no significant differences among them p 0 05 heavy metal pollution in sediments has been widely assessed with the use of pollution indices e g enrichment factors efs geoaccumulation index igeo or contamination factor cf nonetheless in our analysis only 57 of the studies reported such indicators in those studies vanadium pollution had an incidence of 41 5 with pollution sources attributed to industries and oil related activities e g exploitation refineries transportation wars in the study area fig 1b in contrast vanadium concentrations similar to natural levels hence unpolluted environments had contaminating inputs near the study area related to industries and oil yet oil related activities were less frequent different studies have mentioned agriculture natural and anthropogenic factors e g wastewater and urban development as the primary sources of contamination these sources of pollution alone do not appear to be substantial factors affecting vanadium pollution in sediments as sites were classified as unpolluted conversely vanadium pollution across sediments was not entirely correlated with higher concentrations of vanadium fig 2 polluted and unpolluted ecosystems had similar trends relatively stable over the years and nonsignificant differences in vanadium concentration among them f 1 97 1 2 p 0 5 for most of the continents there were high variations in sediment concentrations r2 0 07 except for africa r2 0 52 sediments collected from coastal areas in africa showed an annual increase in vanadium concentration of 16 65 fig 2 this value is relatively comparable to the 17 increase in worldwide vanadium consumption within the same period fig s2 3 1 2 vanadium in aquatic organisms predominantly as shown in fig 2 there were significant increases in vanadium among fishes 0 0129 μg g 1 6 9 year 1 and invertebrates 0 0208 μg g 1 26 26 year 1 collected from asia p 0 05 the increase in biota studied in asia correlates with the increases in seawater 23 48 year 1 which in turn follow similar increasing rates in vanadium consumption production and mining figs s1 s2 although within continents there was a high variation in vanadium concentrations in aquatic organisms r2 0 13 most of the fitted models show positive trends fig 2 furthermore vanadium concentrations in invertebrates were significantly higher than that in fishes f 1 235 6 64 p 0 02 similar patterns have been reported among these taxonomic groups in foodweb studies the uptake of materials in invertebrates has been suggested to result from digestion processes and endocytosis chiarelli and roccheri 2014 extracellular digestion dominates fishes and other vertebrates metal uptake tiago et al 2011 while invertebrates have two major functions extracellular and intracellular digestion davies et al 1997 external organs e g gills or intestines can phagocytose particles from the environment and transport them to the basolateral membrane for further distribution similarly metal complexes are broken down into simpler structures in the intestinal lumen before uptake deb and fukushima 1999 the movement and uptake of metals by endocytosis are of higher significance in certain species metals will be broken down in external organs and cells and redistributed to other intracellular ligands contributing to their accumulation o brien et al 1990 3 2 continental characteristics of vanadium 3 2 1 the americas the americas including north central and south america had the second highest vanadium concentration in seawater and fishes by continent table 1 yet the concentrations of all the samples were below the guidelines across the continent average seawater concentrations of vanadium resulted in rqs indicating high 90 91 andmedium 9 09 for aquatic species fig 8a table s5 these risks were not maintained with sediment risk analysis and er suggested low potential risks fig 8b nonetheless among sediments 30 of the samples indicated pollution with a higher average concentration 86 97 28 26 μg g 1 than in unpolluted sediments 76 71 14 17 μg g 1 with non significantly different means f1 23 0 13 p 0 7 vanadium has shown some potential for bioaccumulation in marine organisms bioaccumulation factors 26 220 l kg 1 smit 2012 hence we used bcfs to analyze vanadium transfer between ecosystems and biota bcfwater indicated that vanadium from seawater to fishes and invertebrates having the second highest transfer among continents b c f w a t e r 95 67 l k g 1 and b c f w a t e r 126 9 l k g 1 respectively except for africa bcfs across continents are significantly higher approximately three to five times greater than the ranges 0 45 34 l kg 1 reported in similar studies influenced by the grouped analysis and data availability hence we set our focus on the transfer trend and intensity level across continents and media rather than the actual value 3 2 2 asia a significantly greater number of publications studied vanadium in different marine ecosystems across asia table 1 the highest worldwide concentrations of seawater and sediment were reported on this continent with industries mining and harbors as driving factors likewise the potential impacts of vanadium across ecosystems were higher and frequent in the aquatic media of this continent and risks were high and medium in 65 63 and 34 38 of the study areas respectively fig 8a sediment analysis indicated that there were no significant differences f 1 41 0 84 p 0 4 in vanadium concentration among polluted 61 47 42 06 μg g 1 and unpolluted 50 43 35 02 μg g 1 sediments yet both were higher than the continental mean fig 4 however after excluding china and iran only four sites 16 67 were classified as polluted last bcfs showed that the transfer of vanadium from sediments to biota was in accordance with the percentage of polluted areas across continents both have the smallest values fish b c f s e d 0 004 invertebrates b c f s e d 0 007 polluted sediments 33 33 3 2 3 europe generally seawater in europe had the second smallest average concentrations of vanadium worldwide table 1 nonetheless reported concentration resulted in risks to aquatic species in the high 83 33 and medium risk areas 16 67 fig 8a contaminated sediments 41 67 62 68 51 41 μg g 1 had concentrations statistically identical f1 7 0 01 p 0 9 to polluted sediments both slightly higher than the continental average fig 5 ers had equal distribution than those reported in the americas representing low potential ecological risks to organisms fig 8b overall the environmental contribution of vanadium to invertebrates was the highest in europe seawater from coastal areas represents the second highest environmental source of vanadium by continents on invertebrates b c f w a t e r 60 4 l k g 1 and fishes b c f w a t e r 50 29 l k g 1 having a twofold difference in comparison to the reference bcfs 3 2 4 africa africa had the second smallest number of articles and study locations across all mediums however the vanadium averages in seawater and marine sediments in africa were the highest among the continents table 1 likewise rqs were present only in the high risk category fig 8a samples collected from africa had the largest number of polluted areas and 66 67 of the sites were classified as polluted fig 6 nonetheless the average vanadium concentrations in unpolluted sediments were higher than those in polluted sediments with undistinguishable differences f1 9 0 87 p 0 38 potential ecological risks were slightly smaller than the rest of the continents yet all the sites indicating low risks to biota fig 8b sediment pollution in the region was partially correlated with biota interactions reflected by the world s highest bcfs in fishes b c f s e d 0 017 nonetheless invertebrate bcfs b c f s e d 0 007 were the second smallest across continents hence not fully supporting this pattern despite the high environmental concentration of vanadium in the aquatic ecosystems vanadium absorption from seawater by organisms was the smallest across continents with invertebrates sharing similar trends to other regions having bcfs almost three times higher b c f w a t e r 17 67 l k g 1 than fishes b c f w a t e r 6 11 l k g 1 although the calculated bcfs from africa had the smallest values they could represent significant ideas as they were within the ranges reported across the literature bcfs 0 45 34 l kg 1 smit 2012 vanadium bioaccumulation is not the highest across heavy metals but is essential due to vanadium s increased use and trade across ecosystems 3 3 potential impacts of vanadium 3 3 1 ecological risks of vanadium limited studies have reported vanadium in seawater likewise environmental risks the boxplots in fig 8 show that certain aquatic species could face adverse effects in all continents under an ssd and hc5 analysis across the study areas rqs are high and medium in 75 47 and 24 53 of the study areas respectively commonly seawater concentrations of vanadium over the last two decades were below the australian new zealand guidelines nevertheless the ssd and hc5 reflected that such guidelines could represent long term hazards to aquatic species principally those taxonomic groups with small resilience aemig et al 2021 hc5s for vanadium have mainly focus on freshwater organisms smit 2012 suggested ecological limits for the netherlands between 1 2 and 3 μg l 1 while schiffer and liber 2017 estimated an hc5 of 50 μg l 1 for canadian species nonetheless the present hc5 1 13 ci 0 05 21 19 μg l 1 is a value closer to the one reported by smit 2012 the toxicity endpoints suggested that the reported concentrations could impact around 55 of marine species fig 7 this value is a worst case scenario whereby we assumed the highest concentration reported worldwide asia 33 91 ci 14 06 55 19 africa 32 04 ci 12 39 52 30 and the americas 29 27 ci 10 82 49 83 were the continents where the probabilistic distribution method suggested the highest risks table s6 invertebrates e g crustaceans echinoderms mollusks showed the highest sensitivity to vanadium among groups and they were the taxonomic groups with higher vanadium concentrations in contrast to other elements algae showed toxic responses at the highest concentrations therefore the present analysis suggests the need for reevaluating of the standards as the current guidelines may not entirely protect all marine species last these results further emphasize the necessity for additional toxicological studies in a broader range of species gustafsson 2019 smit 2012 only 15 seawater species were available across databases while common invertebrates with high resilience to pollutants did not have toxicity reports therefore with the available data we could overestimate the impacts and risks on aquatic organisms er considers heavy metal toxicity transfer and transformation within study areas across continents it was commonly observed that ers for vanadium are 40 presenting low ecological risk worldwide fig 8 b generally similar trends have been found for vanadium and most metals except cd and hg which have the highest toxicity factors whereby higher risks on the ecosystems huang et al 2021 yi et al 2016 around the world several polluted areas driven by anthropogenic sources have been reported nonetheless sediments alone are not likely to be the primary source of ecological risks even with the analysis of the maximum concentrations fig s4 in both potential ecological risks for vanadium are 40 with no significant changes over the study period p 0 05 therefore ers are highly impacted by the small tr of vanadium nonetheless changes in the environmental conditions e g ph organic matter modify pollutants interactions whereby its exposure and toxicity to living organisms miranda et al 2021 similarly coastal ecosystems involve multiple media ers in association with rqs could intensify the overall vanadium risks in marine ecosystems 3 3 2 health risks currently vanadium regulations in aquatic products have not been established compared to different systems e g drinking water milk and air for most of the study locations 95 55 the edis in this study were some order of magnitude smaller than the daily rfd 7 μg kg 1 d 1 established for vanadium by the usepa 2021 we selected p95 to target a population sector with higher consumption patterns while including a significant number of residents table s moderate and low risks were found in two continents invertebrate samples collected from tenerife in a study by lozano et al 2010 resulted in edis greater than the rfd edi 80 21 μg kg 1 d 1 for children population of 15 02 356 209 and adults edi 16 89 μg kg 1 d 1 population of 66 5 1 577 089 higher values in this location are directly linked with the elevated consumption of aquatic products in spain p95 135 g d 1 high and medium risks were also calculated for children and adults in china where p95s for some major coastal cities could reach 318 92 and 407 3 g d 1 respectively the overall results of thqs are shown in fig 7 with higher risks for children than adults f1 438 49 13 p 0 01 and significant differences among continents in invertebrates f4 97 2 49 p 0 048 fishes f4 113 1 29 p 0 05 yet undistinguishable health risks differences among continents under tukey s hsd p 0 05 health risks are also calculated under a worst case scenario as we assumed that all the seafood intake to have the average concentration of vanadium in a study area 3 4 ecological implications vanadium is a common trace metal with high importance in current and future industrial systems different compounds such as fossil fuels alloys and batteries use vanadium products thus significantly increasing and impacting its circulation use and production over the last decade higher consumption means higher potential sources for vanadium release into marine ecosystems the efficiency of these industries has been commonly estimated by assuming life cycle losses of 20 zhang et al 2019 therefore the environmental release of vanadium from an annual consumption of 109 700 mtv would be around 21 940 mtv per year 21 109 gv per year crude oil and coal are responsible for being among the central source of vanadium in the environment likewise they represent 56 and 26 of human vanadium emissions respectively schlesinger et al 2017 despite the environmental problems and release of greenhouse gasses coal and oil consumption for energy requirements are still increasing in many regions jakob et al 2020 vanadium has tide links with many sources thus it is a growing research field as mining oil exploitation urban development and vanadium related products are ongoing sectors of our society this study demonstrates that among continents the highest concentrations of vanadium in seawater sediments fishes and invertebrates were found in africa africa asia and america respectively vanadium concentrations in sediments are the dominant ecosystem but around 60 37 03 study locations have not included pollution indices notwithstanding those reports using pollution indices revealed that oil related activities industries and harbors account for 73 of the sources in polluted sediments vanadium concentrations in africa possess the highest risks to species similarly pollution problems from poor pollution control measurements e g insufficiently protective standards untreated wastewater outdated industrial capacities have occurred in the continent maachia et al 2005 utembe et al 2015 in sediments general guidelines for vanadium are complex as values highly depend on background levels e g limestone shales phosphate ultrabasic rocks huang et al 2015 core analysis or nearby natural sites can be used as background levels to complement pollution indices vital to constant monitoring and controlling diffused pollution across aquatic ecosystems reported concentrations to have risks for species principally in africa and asia in asia china and iran are leaders in vanadium related industries e g petrochemical industries oil extraction and transport steel and other industries that have plausible effects on pollution and changes in vanadium concentrations across ecosystems based on the available toxicity data a primary step is to set guidelines for marine species across regions while including more toxicity studies in a broader range of taxonomic groups for better estimates australia and new zealand had set a value of 100 μgv l 1 nonetheless even this estimation is likely to cause some chronic impacts to aquatic species 32 34 ci 12 67 52 82 likewise it is a significantly higher value than other metals classified in a similar category like cadmium mercury lead and arsenic which have chronic guidelines of 7 9 0 94 8 1 36 μg l 1 respectively us epa 2015 nonetheless different site specific variables e g biochemical and hydrological need further consideration as they influence the bioavailability of vanadium whereby the risks nedrich et al 2018 heavy metals have an extensive research field numerous analyses have been reported for many metals among which vanadium has been a background element marine ecosystems and vanadium pollution are closely linked to anthropogenic activities moreover vanadium related activities are general and common pollution problems across continents huang et al 2015 nevertheless many potential regions have not addressed vanadium levels in any ecosystem therefore there is a need to further intensify our attention towards vanadium and ecological and global public health concerns as done with other metals tchounwou et al 2012 environmental monitoring projects should extend over similar and related habitats and include pollution indicators thresholds and hazardous concentrations reported in the literature lacking in different studies as tools for adequately assessing anthropogenic or natural contributions slowing down consumption is not a solution because vanadium is an element with high market significance european commission 2020 therefore strategies to improve the life cycle and reuse of produces and the industry to reduce emissions will help towards sustainability not only in marine ecosystems likewise reduce the pressure on coastal ecosystems as they hold a large number of pollutants this pressure needs to be considered as different studies have highlighted the synergistic effects of vanadium and other contaminants kim et al 2019 kim and lee 2021 furthermore more robust environmental policies need effective enforcements and monitoring projects that evaluate current levels and pollution sources vanadium remediation in point source pollution can integrate with promising research like bioreduction practices already implemented in some areas chen et al 2021 4 conclusions vanadium is a major element of common and novel products of our society which to their large majority are manufactured in industries along coastal ecosystems nonetheless there is limited attention towards vanadium occurrence and contamination heavy metals including vanadium are non biodegradable and persistent in the environment thus prone to ecological and human risks our ecological risk analysis indicated medium and high hazards to aquatic species principally from seawater health risks to consumers are low nonetheless the population sector with higher consumption patterns p95 have some low to moderate potential risks principally for children with high consumption rates risks can intensify if the increasing trend and correlation between vanadium consumption and concentration in biota found in the study prevail over time one of the primary actions is the need for general environmental quality and safety guidelines across ecosystems as in different media e g air milk or similar trace metals e g mercury arsenic similarly in conjunction with guidelines a significant number of environmental monitoring studies in areas with vanadium related industries are needed in multiple parts of the world such studies directly and indirectly identify pollution sources which should be the prime target for pollution control and mitigation as remediation of vanadium in coastal ecosystems is complex if not impossible due to its circulation and persistence credit authorship contribution statement roberto xavier supe tulcan

16521,vanadium has been classified as a potentially toxic metal and has been given limited attention in comparison to similar trace metals similarly worldwide and continental vanadium pollution and risks remain contested here we synthesized the worldwide concentration of vanadium in marine ecosystems with the relevant ecological and human health risks we found that vanadium in biota and seawater collected from asia shows significant increases over the temporal analysis with rates similar to those reported for vanadium consumption and production furthermore invertebrates have a higher concentration of vanadium than fishes similarly we demonstrate that sediments classified as polluted have concentrations that are not directly correlated with the highest concentrations across continents finally ecological risks were higher from seawater with potential impacts to 55 of aquatic species in asia estimated from chronic species sensitivity distribution ssd the concentration endangering only 5 of seawater species hc5 was estimated as 1 13 0 05 21 19 μg l 1 estimated daily intakes revealed that overall there are none to low health risks from aquatic product consumption yet high risks are plausible to children with consumption patterns in the 95th percentile graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords trace metals sediments seawater marine organisms diffuse pollution risk assessment 1 introduction vanadium is a ubiquitous trace metal on earth the second most abundant transition metal in seawater butler 1998 and the 20th most abundant element in the continental crust hans wedepohl 1995 in recent years vanadium has been classified as a potentially toxic element in the same category as lead arsenic and mercury according to the united states environment protection agency usepa naeem et al 2007 nonetheless there is still a debate regarding the needs and fundamental roles of vanadium in biological organisms researchers consider vanadium an essential element wang et al 2020a 2021 supported by nontoxic bioaccumulation in three groups of species rehder 2015 and biological processes such as the bacterial vanadium dependent nitrogenases or haloperoxidases lee et al 2018 mclauchlan et al 2018 or respiration shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 on the other hand whether vanadium is essential in evolutionary younger organisms remains questionable its overall concentration within organisms is small and its direct roles are species specific thus lacking total support for fundamental vanadium needs different concerns have been raised in the literature mainly regarding the creation of reactive oxygen species after vanadium exposure ehrlich et al 2008 fatola et al 2019 and the activation of mitogen activated protein kinase mapk leading to neuroinflammation jaiswal and kale 2020 causing oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in brain cells caito and aschner 2015 several toxicological reports with mild and acute exposure to vanadium have reported gastrointestinal problems skin and eye irritation pain emphysema pneumonia olopade and connor 2011 cardiovascular diseases soares et al 2008 and cognitive abilities in humans folarin et al 2016 likewise vanadium plays a vital role in our rapidly developing world it is present in different industrial systems and products such as catalysts pigments phosphorous fertilizers batteries high pressure lamps and oil fired power plants hartung et al 2015 iarc international agency for research on cancer 2006 the large majority of vanadium related industries are located in coastal ecosystems where high anthropogenic pressure exists due to agricultural urban or industrial development ivanov et al 2019 at the same time aquatic ecosystems encountering high pollution states are driven by exchanging elements such as vanadium based compounds ajeya et al 2020 hope 2008 similarly vanadium production around the world reached over 75 000 tons in 2020 united states geological survey 2021 fig s1 likewise vanadium consumption doubled between 2002 and 2013 moving from 40 000 tons to approximately 80 000 tons imtiaz et al 2015 reaching 109 700 in 2020 vanitec 2021 fig s2 this study aims to review the worldwide occurrence of vanadium in marine ecosystems across sediment water and biota by screening the existing literature over the last 20 years that directly quantifies vanadium similarly we addressed hazardous concentrations and pollution problems in aquatic environments that could directly and indirectly affect species and humans as the top consumers to our knowledge there have not been similar studies for heavy metals nor vanadium investigating risks pollution and links between marine ecosystems across regions nor the world we present evidence from 260 studies e g 144 sediment studies 40 seawater sample studies 99 marine biota articles 46 fish studies 33 invertebrate studies and 35 multiple group studies across 63 countries and 23 seas hence the main aims of the present study were to carry out a major overview of vanadium changes in marine ecosystems anthropogenic contributions towards vanadium pollution and the assessment of ecological and health risks for each continent to identify potential threats to species and consumers 2 methodology 2 1 selection criteria the present study aimed to provide an analysis of studies on vanadium concentration in marine ecosystems in different media e g sediment seawater fish and invertebrates including mollusks crustaceans and echinoderms worldwide the literature cited in the present study was extracted from the web of science citation index and search service https webofknowledge com using the following keywords vanadium and fish vanadium and fish and continent e g asia america europe africa oceania vanadium and invertebrates vanadium and invertebrates and continent e g asia america europe africa oceania vanadium and sediment and marine vanadium and seawater vanadium and water and continent in addition articles published in the last two decades from january 2000 until march 2021 were selected following the following criteria we reviewed a total of 2789 publications however the publications present in this review n 260 are selected results from this set last we checked the sampling time from the selected articles which was used as the predictor variable in the temporal analysis across media sampling period range 1993 2019 articles with multiple sampling locations reporting only the mean for each area were recorded and used only for the worldwide distribution plots fig 1 a and risks fig 8 articles with means and ranges reported for multiple sampling areas were included and used during the analysis and continental distribution figs 3 7 s3 the concentrations in seasonal studies or multiple sampling points within a small area were averaged and added as one sample point to the data set vanadium values reported only in figures were obtained by using webplotdigitizer https apps automeris io wpd finally the geographical positions were obtained within the manuscript or following the maps provided by the authors 2 2 data treatment the data presented in this article were collected from values reported for seawater sediment and tissue samples and converted to a uniform unit μg l 1 μg g 1 dry weight dw and μg g 1 wet weight ww assuming a moisture content of 80 for dried weight samples sediment pollution was classified following pollution indices while pollution sources were collected from the site description or throughout the conclusions values in tables were rounded while plots and analysis used total values for further precision the mean standard deviation and range minimum maximum were reported for each study and multiple locations in the analysis and in the tables supplementary materials wherever available 2 3 vanadium transfer between ecosystems to build relationships between the ecological transfer of vanadium in marine ecosystems we used bioconcentration factors bcf the bioconcentration factor has been widely used to analyze pollution from different media to marine organisms arnot and gobas 2006 and was calculated as follows 1 b c f w a t e r s e d c v c e where c v μg kg 1 wet weight represents the country s average concentration of vanadium in aquatic organisms fish and invertebrates and c e represents the country s average concentration in seawater μg l 1 and sediments μg kg 1 dry weight for countries with missing environmental data we used the average continental concentration for the corresponding media 2 4 ecological and health risk assessment 2 4 1 risk quotient the risk quotient rq approach has been widely used to assess the environmental risk of pollutants for aquatic organisms under the long term impact the rq is an advantageous method including a concentration addition effect and is expressed as eq 2 2 r q m e c p n e c s s d where mec is the average measured environmental concentration of vanadium in seawater samples and pnecssd is the predicted no effect concentration to protect most of the species in the aquatic ecosystem european commission 2003 eq 3 was used to calculate the pnecssd 3 pnec hc 5 a f where hc5 is the 5th percentile hazardous concentration a standard threshold associated with toxic endpoints and species risks hc5 was obtained from a species sensitivity distribution ssd with a monte carlo simulation and bootstrap approach an ssd is a cumulative density function cdf of toxic points for a target toxicant the ssd curve was created by fitting a log normal distribution of toxic benchmarks e g lc50 50 of lethal concentration loec lowest observed effect concentration and noec no observed effect concentration kooijman 1987 li et al 2021 with the aim to homogenize toxic endpoints and predict chronic noec lc50 with a minimum study duration of 4 days lc50 4 and loecs were divided by an uncertainty factor of 5 and 2 5 respectively warne et al 2018 lc50 values with study duration other than 96 h were converted to 4 day lc50 using the following equation wu et al 2011 l c 50 4 l c 50 t t 4 0 8175 where t represents the exposure duration of lc50 days a total of 68 toxicity data records for vanadium was obtained from the usepa ecotoxicity database ecotox http cfpub epa gov ecotox european chemicals agency echa https www echa europa eu and information system ecotoxicology and environmental quality targets http webetox uba de webetox a pre selection of one value for each species when multiple data was available was conducted according to echa 2008 leaving a final dataset of 15 marine species with different toxicity endpoints and effects table s2 the resulting datasets were ranked at hc5 and the values of 2 5 and 97 5 were adopted as the lower and upper 95 confidence limits respectively this study calculated the pnec by dividing the hc5 with an assessment factor derived from an empirical survey by usepa 1985 af 2 afs account for uncertainty based on potential differences in interspecies and intraspecies variability laboratory to field variability and extrapolation of acute to chronic effects echa 2008 according to generally used ranking criteria the risk levels were high for an rq of 1 medium at 1 rq 0 1 and low at an rq of 0 1 2 4 2 potential ecological risks the potential ecological risk er was applied to assess further the environmental risks posed by vanadium in marine sediments the er was first proposed by håkanson 1980 and has become one of the most widely used and reliable indicators for ecological risks in sediments the index assesses the characteristics and environmental behavior of heavy metals similarly the method is suitable for single elements it comprises the contamination coefficient the toxic response factor for heavy metals a comprehensive contamination measure and a reference value potential ecological risk index is expressed as 4 er tr x cf where tr is the toxic response factor for vanadium tr 2 reflecting its toxicity and the sensitivity of biological pollution to heavy metals and cf is the contamination coefficient eq 5 was used to calculate the cf 5 c f c v c n where cv is the average concentration of vanadium in sediments in a study area and cn is the reference value cn was calculated for each continent from the average concentration of vanadium in sediments classified by researchers as nonpolluted table s3 due to studying a single regulator we used the following degrees of contamination and the evaluation criteria for risks assessment er 40 low 40 er 80 moderate 80 er 160 considerable 160 er 320 high er 320 very high 2 4 3 human risk assessment seafood consumption is thought to be one of the major routes of exposure to chemicals and vanadium is no exception uptake of vanadyl vanadium pentoxide and other compounds can interfere with phosphate producing ros rehder 2018 as a consequence it is essential to follow reference guides and determine risks the target hazard quotient thq has been widely used to estimate the non carcinogenic effects of contaminants through seafood ingestion tulcan et al 2021 which uses the ratio between the estimated daily intake edi ug kg 1 d 1 and the reference risk dose for vanadium rfd ug kg 1 d 1 the thq is calculated as follows 6 t h q e d i r f d where rfd is 7 ug kg 1 d 1 where kg refers to body weight usepa 2021 the edi values were calculated using 7 e d i m c d i e f e d b w t a where mc is the average vanadium concentration μg g 1 ww for each group and location di is the daily aquatic product

plots were used to determine the normality of the data log transformation was implemented when required linear model and one way analysis of variance anova assumptions were tested before comparing trends and differences between sediment pollution taxonomic and continental concentrations kolmogorov smirnov test was used to assess normality and ssd was performed with the packages mass as stats 3 results and discussion 3 1 the overall distribution of field studies vanadium was reported in different media across all continents with worldwide concentrations of 63 91 54 95 0 1 2114 μg g 1 9 05 23 42 0 001 120 μg l 1 0 73 1 41 8e 04 17 58 μg g 1 and 0 37 0 73 1e 04 15 μg g 1 in sediments seawater invertebrates and fishes respectively the continental concentration for each group the number of study locations and the number of studies are summarized in table 1 the results presented in fig 1 are a combination of worldwide vanadium concentrations 3 1 1 vanadium in aquatic medium on average vanadium concentrations in seawater were reported to be approximately 1 8 2 5 μg l 1 huang et al 2015 reimann and de caritat 2005 however in this study we found that the average concentrations of vanadium are higher in coastal ecosystems from africa and the americas table 1 nonetheless the reported vanadium concentrations are generally smaller than the reference value 100 μg l 1 established by the australia new zealand guidelines anzecc 2000 seawater samples despite limited reports show two patterns fig 2 first studies conducted in the americas had the earliest data 1995 2005 and reports from asia had a higher incidence in recent years 2011 2017 second there was a steep reduction in vanadium concentration in the americas 0 46 μg l 1year 1 highly likely to be linked and biased with the sampling site and time the highest concentrations were collected near oil extraction fields while in late years smaller concentrations were studied from less industrialized sites fig 3 similar studies were not conducted in the americas after 2005 the research direction and topic popularity could explain the higher number of studies in asia in recent years within those reports vanadium in seawater samples show that there has been an increase of 0 213 μg l 1year 1 worldwide the average vanadium concentration in sediments has been reported to be around 97 130 μg g 1 rudnick and gao 2003 turekian and wedepohl 1961 our study suggested that across field surveys the average concentrations are slightly lower across continents table 1 with no significant differences among them p 0 05 heavy metal pollution in sediments has been widely assessed with the use of pollution indices e g enrichment factors efs geoaccumulation index igeo or contamination factor cf nonetheless in our analysis only 57 of the studies reported such indicators in those studies vanadium pollution had an incidence of 41 5 with pollution sources attributed to industries and oil related activities e g exploitation refineries transportation wars in the study area fig 1b in contrast vanadium concentrations similar to natural levels hence unpolluted environments had contaminating inputs near the study area related to industries and oil yet oil related activities were less frequent different studies have mentioned agriculture natural and anthropogenic factors e g wastewater and urban development as the primary sources of contamination these sources of pollution alone do not appear to be substantial factors affecting vanadium pollution in sediments as sites were classified as unpolluted conversely vanadium pollution across sediments was not entirely correlated with higher concentrations of vanadium fig 2 polluted and unpolluted ecosystems had similar trends relatively stable over the years and nonsignificant differences in vanadium concentration among them f 1 97 1 2 p 0 5 for most of the continents there were high variations in sediment concentrations r2 0 07 except for africa r2 0 52 sediments collected from coastal areas in africa showed an annual increase in vanadium concentration of 16 65 fig 2 this value is relatively comparable to the 17 increase in worldwide vanadium consumption within the same period fig s2 3 1 2 vanadium in aquatic organisms predominantly as shown in fig 2 there were significant increases in vanadium among fishes 0 0129 μg g 1 6 9 year 1 and invertebrates 0 0208 μg g 1 26 26 year 1 collected from asia p 0 05 the increase in biota studied in asia correlates with the increases in seawater 23 48 year 1 which in turn follow similar increasing rates in vanadium consumption production and mining figs s1 s2 although within continents there was a high variation in vanadium concentrations in aquatic organisms r2 0 13 most of the fitted models show positive trends fig 2 furthermore vanadium concentrations in invertebrates were significantly higher than that in fishes f 1 235 6 64 p 0 02 similar patterns have been reported among these taxonomic groups in foodweb studies the uptake of materials in invertebrates has been suggested to result from digestion processes and endocytosis chiarelli and roccheri 2014 extracellular digestion dominates fishes and other vertebrates metal uptake tiago et al 2011 while invertebrates have two major functions extracellular and intracellular digestion davies et al 1997 external organs e g gills or intestines can phagocytose particles from the environment and transport them to the basolateral membrane for further distribution similarly metal complexes are broken down into simpler structures in the intestinal lumen before uptake deb and fukushima 1999 the movement and uptake of metals by endocytosis are of higher significance in certain species metals will be broken down in external organs and cells and redistributed to other intracellular ligands contributing to their accumulation o brien et al 1990 3 2 continental characteristics of vanadium 3 2 1 the americas the americas including north central and south america had the second highest vanadium concentration in seawater and fishes by continent table 1 yet the concentrations of all the samples were below the guidelines across the continent average seawater concentrations of vanadium resulted in rqs indicating high 90 91 andmedium 9 09 for aquatic species fig 8a table s5 these risks were not maintained with sediment risk analysis and er suggested low potential risks fig 8b nonetheless among sediments 30 of the samples indicated pollution with a higher average concentration 86 97 28 26 μg g 1 than in unpolluted sediments 76 71 14 17 μg g 1 with non significantly different means f1 23 0 13 p 0 7 vanadium has shown some potential for bioaccumulation in marine organisms bioaccumulation factors 26 220 l kg 1 smit 2012 hence we used bcfs to analyze vanadium transfer between ecosystems and biota bcfwater indicated that vanadium from seawater to fishes and invertebrates having the second highest transfer among continents b c f w a t e r 95 67 l k g 1 and b c f w a t e r 126 9 l k g 1 respectively except for africa bcfs across continents are significantly higher approximately three to five times greater than the ranges 0 45 34 l kg 1 reported in similar studies influenced by the grouped analysis and data availability hence we set our focus on the transfer trend and intensity level across continents and media rather than the actual value 3 2 2 asia a significantly greater number of publications studied vanadium in different marine ecosystems across asia table 1 the highest worldwide concentrations of seawater and sediment were reported on this continent with industries mining and harbors as driving factors likewise the potential impacts of vanadium across ecosystems were higher and frequent in the aquatic media of this continent and risks were high and medium in 65 63 and 34 38 of the study areas respectively fig 8a sediment analysis indicated that there were no significant differences f 1 41 0 84 p 0 4 in vanadium concentration among polluted 61 47 42 06 μg g 1 and unpolluted 50 43 35 02 μg g 1 sediments yet both were higher than the continental mean fig 4 however after excluding china and iran only four sites 16 67 were classified as polluted last bcfs showed that the transfer of vanadium from sediments to biota was in accordance with the percentage of polluted areas across continents both have the smallest values fish b c f s e d 0 004 invertebrates b c f s e d 0 007 polluted sediments 33 33 3 2 3 europe generally seawater in europe had the second smallest average concentrations of vanadium worldwide table 1 nonetheless reported concentration resulted in risks to aquatic species in the high 83 33 and medium risk areas 16 67 fig 8a contaminated sediments 41 67 62 68 51 41 μg g 1 had concentrations statistically identical f1 7 0 01 p 0 9 to polluted sediments both slightly higher than the continental average fig 5 ers had equal distribution than those reported in the americas representing low potential ecological risks to organisms fig 8b overall the environmental contribution of vanadium to invertebrates was the highest in europe seawater from coastal areas represents the second highest environmental source of vanadium by continents on invertebrates b c f w a t e r 60 4 l k g 1 and fishes b c f w a t e r 50 29 l k g 1 having a twofold difference in comparison to the reference bcfs 3 2 4 africa africa had the second smallest number of articles and study locations across all mediums however the vanadium averages in seawater and marine sediments in africa were the highest among the continents table 1 likewise rqs were present only in the high risk category fig 8a samples collected from africa had the largest number of polluted areas and 66 67 of the sites were classified as polluted fig 6 nonetheless the average vanadium concentrations in unpolluted sediments were higher than those in polluted sediments with undistinguishable differences f1 9 0 87 p 0 38 potential ecological risks were slightly smaller than the rest of the continents yet all the sites indicating low risks to biota fig 8b sediment pollution in the region was partially correlated with biota interactions reflected by the world s highest bcfs in fishes b c f s e d 0 017 nonetheless invertebrate bcfs b c f s e d 0 007 were the second smallest across continents hence not fully supporting this pattern despite the high environmental concentration of vanadium in the aquatic ecosystems vanadium absorption from seawater by organisms was the smallest across continents with invertebrates sharing similar trends to other regions having bcfs almost three times higher b c f w a t e r 17 67 l k g 1 than fishes b c f w a t e r 6 11 l k g 1 although the calculated bcfs from africa had the smallest values they could represent significant ideas as they were within the ranges reported across the literature bcfs 0 45 34 l kg 1 smit 2012 vanadium bioaccumulation is not the highest across heavy metals but is essential due to vanadium s increased use and trade across ecosystems 3 3 potential impacts of vanadium 3 3 1 ecological risks of vanadium limited studies have reported vanadium in seawater likewise environmental risks the boxplots in fig 8 show that certain aquatic species could face adverse effects in all continents under an ssd and hc5 analysis across the study areas rqs are high and medium in 75 47 and 24 53 of the study areas respectively commonly seawater concentrations of vanadium over the last two decades were below the australian new zealand guidelines nevertheless the ssd and hc5 reflected that such guidelines could represent long term hazards to aquatic species principally those taxonomic groups with small resilience aemig et al 2021 hc5s for vanadium have mainly focus on freshwater organisms smit 2012 suggested ecological limits for the netherlands between 1 2 and 3 μg l 1 while schiffer and liber 2017 estimated an hc5 of 50 μg l 1 for canadian species nonetheless the present hc5 1 13 ci 0 05 21 19 μg l 1 is a value closer to the one reported by smit 2012 the toxicity endpoints suggested that the reported concentrations could impact around 55 of marine species fig 7 this value is a worst case scenario whereby we assumed the highest concentration reported worldwide asia 33 91 ci 14 06 55 19 africa 32 04 ci 12 39 52 30 and the americas 29 27 ci 10 82 49 83 were the continents where the probabilistic distribution method suggested the highest risks table s6 invertebrates e g crustaceans echinoderms mollusks showed the highest sensitivity to vanadium among groups and they were the taxonomic groups with higher vanadium concentrations in contrast to other elements algae showed toxic responses at the highest concentrations therefore the present analysis suggests the need for reevaluating of the standards as the current guidelines may not entirely protect all marine species last these results further emphasize the necessity for additional toxicological studies in a broader range of species gustafsson 2019 smit 2012 only 15 seawater species were available across databases while common invertebrates with high resilience to pollutants did not have toxicity reports therefore with the available data we could overestimate the impacts and risks on aquatic organisms er considers heavy metal toxicity transfer and transformation within study areas across continents it was commonly observed that ers for vanadium are 40 presenting low ecological risk worldwide fig 8 b generally similar trends have been found for vanadium and most metals except cd and hg which have the highest toxicity factors whereby higher risks on the ecosystems huang et al 2021 yi et al 2016 around the world several polluted areas driven by anthropogenic sources have been reported nonetheless sediments alone are not likely to be the primary source of ecological risks even with the analysis of the maximum concentrations fig s4 in both potential ecological risks for vanadium are 40 with no significant changes over the study period p 0 05 therefore ers are highly impacted by the small tr of vanadium nonetheless changes in the environmental conditions e g ph organic matter modify pollutants interactions whereby its exposure and toxicity to living organisms miranda et al 2021 similarly coastal ecosystems involve multiple media ers in association with rqs could intensify the overall vanadium risks in marine ecosystems 3 3 2 health risks currently vanadium regulations in aquatic products have not been established compared to different systems e g drinking water milk and air for most of the study locations 95 55 the edis in this study were some order of magnitude smaller than the daily rfd 7 μg kg 1 d 1 established for vanadium by the usepa 2021 we selected p95 to target a population sector with higher consumption patterns while including a significant number of residents table s moderate and low risks were found in two continents invertebrate samples collected from tenerife in a study by lozano et al 2010 resulted in edis greater than the rfd edi 80 21 μg kg 1 d 1 for children population of 15 02 356 209 and adults edi 16 89 μg kg 1 d 1 population of 66 5 1 577 089 higher values in this location are directly linked with the elevated consumption of aquatic products in spain p95 135 g d 1 high and medium risks were also calculated for children and adults in china where p95s for some major coastal cities could reach 318 92 and 407 3 g d 1 respectively the overall results of thqs are shown in fig 7 with higher risks for children than adults f1 438 49 13 p 0 01 and significant differences among continents in invertebrates

assumed that all the seafood intake to have the average concentration of vanadium in a study area 3 4 ecological implications vanadium is a common trace metal with high importance in current and future industrial systems different compounds such as fossil fuels alloys and batteries use vanadium products thus significantly increasing and impacting its circulation use and production over the last decade higher consumption means higher potential sources for vanadium release into marine ecosystems the efficiency of these industries has been commonly estimated by assuming life cycle losses of 20 zhang et al 2019 therefore the environmental release of vanadium from an annual consumption of 109 700 mtv would be around 21 940 mtv per year 21 109 gv per year crude oil and coal are responsible for being among the central source of vanadium in the environment likewise they represent 56 and 26 of human vanadium emissions respectively schlesinger et al 2017 despite the environmental problems and release of greenhouse gasses coal and oil consumption for energy requirements are still increasing in many regions jakob et al 2020 vanadium has tide links with many sources thus it is a growing research field as mining oil exploitation urban development and vanadium related products are ongoing sectors of our society this study demonstrates that among continents the highest concentrations of vanadium in seawater sediments fishes and invertebrates were found in africa africa asia and america respectively vanadium concentrations in sediments are the dominant ecosystem but around 60 37 03 study locations have not included pollution indices notwithstanding those reports using pollution indices revealed that oil related activities industries and harbors account for 73 of the sources in polluted sediments vanadium concentrations in africa possess the highest risks to species similarly pollution problems from poor pollution control measurements e g insufficiently protective standards untreated wastewater outdated industrial capacities have occurred in the continent maachia et al 2005 utembe et al 2015 in sediments general guidelines for vanadium are complex as values highly depend on background levels e g limestone shales phosphate ultrabasic rocks huang et al 2015 core analysis or nearby natural sites can be used as background levels to complement pollution indices vital to constant monitoring and controlling diffused pollution across aquatic ecosystems reported concentrations to have risks for species principally in africa and asia in asia china and iran are leaders in vanadium related industries e g petrochemical industries oil extraction and transport steel and other industries that have plausible effects on pollution and changes in vanadium concentrations across ecosystems based on the available toxicity data a primary step is to set guidelines for marine species across regions while including more toxicity studies in a broader range of taxonomic groups for better estimates australia and new zealand had set a value of 100 μgv l 1 nonetheless even this estimation is likely to cause some chronic impacts to aquatic species 32 34 ci 12 67 52 82 likewise it is a significantly higher value than other metals classified in a similar category like cadmium mercury lead and arsenic which have chronic guidelines of 7 9 0 94 8 1 36 μg l 1 respectively us epa 2015 nonetheless different site specific variables e g biochemical and hydrological need further consideration as they influence the bioavailability of vanadium whereby the risks nedrich et al 2018 heavy metals have an extensive research field numerous analyses have been reported for many metals among which vanadium has been a background element marine ecosystems and vanadium pollution are closely linked to anthropogenic activities moreover vanadium related activities are general and common pollution problems across continents huang et al 2015 nevertheless many potential regions have not addressed vanadium levels in any ecosystem therefore there is a need to further intensify our attention towards vanadium and ecological and global public health concerns as done with other metals tchounwou et al 2012 environmental monitoring projects should extend over similar and related habitats and include pollution indicators thresholds and hazardous concentrations reported in the literature lacking in different studies as tools for adequately assessing anthropogenic or natural contributions slowing down consumption is not a solution because vanadium is an element with high market significance european commission 2020 therefore strategies to improve the life cycle and reuse of produces and the industry to reduce emissions will help towards sustainability not only in marine ecosystems likewise reduce the pressure on coastal ecosystems as they hold a large number of pollutants this pressure needs to be considered as different studies have highlighted the synergistic effects of vanadium and other contaminants kim et al 2019 kim and lee 2021 furthermore more robust environmental policies need effective enforcements and monitoring projects that evaluate current levels and pollution sources vanadium remediation in point source pollution can integrate with promising research like bioreduction practices already implemented in some areas chen et al 2021 4 conclusions vanadium is a major element of common and novel products of our society which to their large majority are manufactured in industries along coastal ecosystems nonetheless there is limited attention towards vanadium occurrence and contamination heavy metals including vanadium are non biodegradable and persistent in the environment thus prone to ecological and human risks our ecological risk analysis indicated medium and high hazards to aquatic species principally from seawater health risks to consumers are low nonetheless the population sector with higher consumption patterns p95 have some low to moderate potential risks principally for children with high consumption rates risks can intensify if the increasing trend and correlation between vanadium consumption and concentration in biota found in the study prevail over time one of the primary actions is the need for general environmental quality and safety guidelines across ecosystems as in different media e g air milk or similar trace metals e g mercury arsenic similarly in conjunction with guidelines a significant number of environmental monitoring studies in areas with vanadium related industries are needed in multiple parts of the world such studies directly and indirectly identify pollution sources which should be the prime target for pollution control and mitigation as remediation of vanadium in coastal ecosystems is complex if not impossible due to its circulation and persistence credit authorship contribution statement roberto xavier supe tulcan

16522,bacterial alginate like exopolymers ale gels have been used in this work as a model for the extracellular polymeric matrix of biofilms aim was to relate the mechanical properties and strength of this matrix that make biofilms as persistent to cleaning as they are to the complex cohesive molecular interactions involved mechanical properties of the gels as a function of caco3 concentration were investigated using dynamic and static rheology gels with relatively low caco3 concentrations between 100 μmol and 300 μmol per g ale were found to exhibit similar viscoelastic behaviour as real biofilms with elastic moduli between 50 pa and 100 pa and dissipation factors between 0 2 and 0 3 increasing caco3 concentrations resulted in an increase of the elastic modulus up to 250 pa accompanied by an increase in brittleness at a caco3 concentration of 1250 μmol per g ale this trend stopped probably due to disturbance of the continuous ale network by precipitation of salts therefore overdosing of ca salts can be an adequate approach for the removal of biofouling all gels exhibited permanent strain hardening under medium strain and their mechanical properties showed dependency on their strain history even after application of an oscillatory strain with 200 amplitude that caused the gel structure to collapse the gels recovered 65 to 90 of their original shear modulus for the major part within the first 20 s recovery was slightly less for gels with high caco3 concentration in creep tests fitted with a burgers model with multiple kelvin elements at least three different interactions in the ale gels could be distinguished with characteristic retardation times in the range of 10 100 and 1000 s further identification of the mechanisms underlying the gel mechanics will allow the development of targeted strategies to undermine the mechanical strength of biofouling and aid the cleaning process graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction the complete chemical composition of biofilms is as diverse as the bacterial communities that inhabit them and in most cases not easy to determine common practice is a distinction between two main components the bacteria and the matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps geesey 1982 polysaccharides proteins lipids nucleic acids and complex macromolecules with mixed functionalities have been identified in eps seviour et al 2019 these molecules form a physically crosslinked 3d molecular network with the ability to bind high amounts of water therefore biofilms can be considered as complex hydrogels the eps matrix which can provide up to 90 of the biofilms organic matter acts as a protective shield for the bacteria against biological chemical and mechanical influences it also prevents desiccation the eps matrix has been shown to considerably reduce the effectiveness of biocides last but not least the eps matrix is responsible for the mechanical strength and integrity of biofilms the mechanical properties of biofilms have been found to stay mostly intact even if the bacterial cells are killed flemming 2020 therefore the eps matrix and its mechanical strength are essential in removing biofouling considering the biofilms ability to resist physical forces like the shear stress from flowing water two aspects of the mechanical strength should be distinguished the adhesion to the surface and the internal cohesion the cohesion is reflected in the biofilms viscoelasticity biofilms show the typical viscoelastic behaviour of crosslinked polymer networks safari et al 2015 in contrast to covalently bound networks the crosslinks in biofilms have for the most part been identified as physical interactions such as vanderwaals forces hydrogen bonds electrostatic interactions including ion bridges and entanglements seviour et al 2019 cohesion and adhesion are closely related both follow from the molecular interactions within the eps and with the environment especially for thin films like many biofilms are both properties can hardly be separated safari et al 2015 therefore the influence of sample collection and treatment stays a relevant question in biofouling research how does mechanical removal of biofilms from their substrates alter their physical characteristics and how can the knowledge about such behaviour help to prevent and combat biofouling these questions were the motivation for the current work goal is to relate the mechanical properties and strength of the eps matrix to the molecular interactions involved in the dynamic crosslinks alginate like exopolymers ales have been found to provide structural integrity to granular sludge and biofilms ghafoor et al 2011 lin et al 2013 therefore we have chosen them as a model for the eps matrix to investigate the mechanical properties of biofilms like the well characterised algal alginate this mixture of exopolymers forms gels with ca2 ions felz et al 2016 which is important for adhesion and strength of biofilms containing ale goode and allen 2011 therefore ale provides an interim model between algal alginate and the complex real world biofilm eps in previous work pfaff et al 2021 we have found that ca2 accumulates in thin ale layers and influences their density the current work focuses on the resulting cohesive strength of ale gels as a function of ca2 content the molecular interactions are probed by measuring the gels time dependant viscoelastic properties with a rheometer the cohesion has been chosen over the adhesion to address the molecular interactions within the gels to minimise the impact of adhesion thick gel structures were produced and maximum adhesion no slip between the samples and the rheometer was ensured the swelling state of hydrogels has been found to impact mechanical strength adhesion permeability and degradation davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 inversely the viscoelastic properties in combination with gel size and permeability have been found responsible for synaeresis scherer 1989 spontaneous synaeresis as a reaction to increasing salt concentrations in the supernatant has been described as a possibly important mechanism of biofilm survival during desiccation decho 2016 occurrence and peculiarity of synaeresis and its correlation with other characteristics was therefore a side focus of this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 ale extraction because of the high ale content of granular sludge the material was extracted from nereda sludge collected from the wastewater treatment plant in garmerwolde the netherlands the extraction was done in alkaline conditions followed by acid precipitation based on a protocol by felz et al 2016 the granules were collected by decantation in 1 l demineralised water purified with a milliq ic 7003 system ca 150 g of the wet granules 20 g dry weight were mixed with 10 g na2co3 vwr the netherlands and homogenised by pulsed sonication branson sonifier 250 5 min at 70 max output 200 w during sonication the mixture was cooled in an ice bath to prevent overheating subsequently the alkaline extraction step was performed by heating the mixture to 80 c for 30 min under vigorous stirring the pellet was discarded after centrifugation allegra x 12r centrifuge beckman coulter 20 min 3750 rpm the supernatant was dialysed in 4 6 steps using a spectra por dialysis membrane with a cut off of 3 5 kda each against 20 l demineralised water until the conductivity in the dialysis solution was below 50 µs cm the extract was acidified with 1 m hcl merck millipore germany to ph 2 2 5 after another centrifugation the pellet was collected lyophilised alpha 2 4 ldplus christ germany and stored at room temperature until further use it is henceforth referred to as ale for further information we refer the reader to supplementary material c 2 2 gel preparation gels were prepared by internal gelation draget et al 1989 davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 using caco3 as a calcium source ca2 ions were slowly released by hydrolysis of glucono δ lactone gdl enabling uniform gelling of the ale based on the concentration ranges in which ale films were found to be successfully formed on membranes pfaff et al 2021 the concentrations were chosen as 40 g l ale and 5 12 5 25 50 and 100 mm caco3 an overview of the gels composition is shown in table 1 a molar ratio of 2 1 was applied between gdl and caco3 stock solutions of ale 50 g l caco3 10 the target concentration shown in table 1 and gdl 10 target concentration were prepared the lyophilised ale was dissolved in 1 m naoh merck millipore germany and diluted with demineralised water the solution was neutralised using more naoh caco3 anhydrous reagent grade vwr the netherlands was suspended in demineralised water and dispersed in an ultrasonic bath bandelin sonorex technik for 10 min gdl solutions were always freshly prepared by dissolving the necessary amount of glucono δ lactone sigma aldrich france in demineralised water the three stock solutions were mixed in a volume ratio of 8 1 1 portions of 1 5 ml were immediately pipetted into sandpaper grit size p180 waterproof sencys the netherlands lined disposable rheometer dishes anton paar 56 mm the gel dimensions were determined by stencils of 30 mm diameter see fig 1 a the samples were left for crosslinking at room temperature in a sealed plastic box partly filled with water providing 100 humidity for 36 h preliminary experiments showed that gelling was complete within this time frame before starting the mechanical measurements the stencils were removed and the surfaces and heights of the gels were equalised by cutting them to 1 mm height using a 1 mm frame and a razor blade 2 3 gel sample analysis 2 3 1 chemical characterisation crosslinked ale gel samples were scratched and weighed into dry porcelain crucibles m sample after heating to 105 c for 24 h the dry mass total suspended solids tss was determined the contained water m water was calculated as the difference between m sample and tss the dried samples were then burnt at 550 c for 2 h to remove the organic matter volatile suspended solids vss the remaining ash was interpreted as the inorganic content of the material while the vss was interpreted as ale eventually the vss density ρvss was calculated as vss per m water 2 3 2 rheological measurements rheological characterisation of the samples was performed using an mcr 102 rheometer anton paar austria with a 25 mm plate plate geometry and disposable dishes 56 mm anton paar austria cf fig 1 the working principle of this apparatus is that samples are sheared between the upper rotating and the lower fixed plate while monitoring the displacement of the upper plate and the torque a 3d printed cover petg printed with an ultimaker s5 ultimaker b v the netherlands of which the bottom part could be filled with water was used to reduce evaporation of water during the measurements before the start of every measurement the upper plate was covered with clean sandpaper the zero height and measurement system inertia were recalibrated the sample surface was detected by lowering the upper plate until a normal force of 0 15 n was reached corresponding to ca 300 pa this is in the range of the expected moduli already to make sure it was really the sample surface detected subsequently the samples were trimmed and left equilibrating until the normal force remained below 0 05 n tests in the linear viscoelastic region lver applying several of these approaching procedures with the sequence of slight compression and equilibration resulted in identical measurements the approaching procedure had no apparent impact on the results amplitude sweeps oscillating measurements were performed in triplicates at 10 rad s with exponentially increasing amplitudes between 0 01 and 250 shear strain ε the strain deformation was defined as the displacement in relation to the sample thickness measuring the resulting torque τ the corresponding average shear stress σ on the sample was determined the ratio between shear stress σ and shear strain ε is defined as the complex modulus g utilising the phase shift between σ and ε the complex modulus g was split into the real component g representing the storage modulus and the imaginary component g representing the loss modulus for a given strain these moduli signify how much of the applied stress is stored elastically and how much is lost by dissipation the ratio between storage modulus g and loss modulus g is also referred to as the dissipation factor tan δ the so called crossover point g g can be used as a practical indicator for the dominance of viscous over elastic behaviour it indicates that above the corresponding strain the network structure of a sample is broken the strains and stresses at the crossover points were determined as a function of the caco3 concentration frequency sweeps frequency sweeps were performed with an amplitude of 0 3 strain which was found to be inside the lver in amplitude sweeps with angular frequencies ω between 100 and 1 rad s more explanation and results can be found in the supplementary material b recovery after oscillatory strain the recovery capacity of the gels was investigated by observing the storage and loss moduli during application of different oscillatory strains at 10 rad s again all experiments were performed in triplicate as reference and baseline a strain amplitude of 0 3 was used which was well within the lver strain amplitudes of 10 30 and 200 were applied for 120 s each followed by 400 s recovery at 0 3 strain creep recovery tests creep recovery tests were performed in triplicate a constant shear stress σ of 10 pa found to be inside the lver for all samples was applied for 300 s and the strain ε was monitored subsequently the stress was removed and the strain was monitored for another 600 s the creep was interpreted using the burgers model which has been successfully applied to describe the viscoelastic behaviour of biofilms vinogradov et al 2004 because of creep ringing the initial overshooting visible in fig 2 at the first application of the stress resulting from the coupling of instrument inertia and sample elasticity ewoldt and mckinley 2007 the first 5 s of each step were not included in the analysis in the current case an indefinite number of kelvin elements was allowed the ale gels are described as a series of a maxwell element consisting of a spring describing the elastic jump at the beginning of the curve and a dashpot describing the viscous response represented by the linear increase at the end of the creep curve and an indefinite number of kelvin elements consisting of a parallel spring dashpot pairs see fig 2 this results in the following equation 1 ɛ creep t σ g 0 n σ g k n 1 exp t g k n η k n σ η 0 t εcreep is the shear strain measured over time t under application of a constant shear stress σ g0 is the initial elastic modulus η0 the viscosity and gk n and ηk n the elastic moduli and viscosities of each kelvin element n the retardation time τ is a measure for the delay in the material s full elastic response to an applied stress caused by its viscous elements the characteristic retardation time τ of each kelvin element is represented by the ratio between the viscosity and the elastic modulus it depicts the time after which 63 of the maximum strain of the element is reached 2 τ k n η k n g k n similarly for a simple maxwell liquid the characteristic relaxation time is given by 3 τ m η 0 g 0 also for materials with a stress relaxation that is more complicated like the investigated case this equation is a reasonable estimate with τm representing the longest retardation time in the system 3 results and discussion 3 1 swelling and synaeresis over gelation the ale gels were prepared with equal amounts of ale but different amounts of caco3 and glucono δ lactone gdl gdl hydrolyses in water forming gluconic acid which adds to the final vss table 1 shows the composition of the samples at the beginning of the gelling process the ale gels were left for gelling in a 100 humidity environment to avoid evaporation it can be observed in fig 3 that the final gel composition differed from the original sample composition salts have been neglected in this observation because they provide only 0 5 wt cf table 1 only at 5 mm caco3 the original composition was almost maintained with increasing ca2 ale ratio the vss density and thus the ratio of vvs to water increased cf also fig a1 in the supplementary material a apparently during gelation water was expelled from the samples this phenomenon is known as synaeresis and has been described for several hydrogel systems including ca alginate kuo and ma 2001 synaeresis is essentially a contraction of the hydrogel network resulting from molecular interactions within the ale network is getting compacter with increasing caco3 concentration ale densities of the gels were found between 45 and 70 g l in good agreement with those found for ale gel layers produced in dead end filtration with cacl2 pfaff et al 2021 the common explanation for the observed compaction up to a maximum at 50 mm caco3 is a higher number of crosslinks however the amount of negative charges in the ale has previously been estimated around 1 mmol g vss pfaff et al 2021 corresponding to 40 mmol l in the gels assuming that two negative charges are necessary for neutralisation of each ca2 ion this means that the maximum amount of bound ca2 would be 20 mm therefore other explanations considering internal restructuring processes like lateral association of the present crosslinks hermansson et al 2016 seem worthwhile to consider concerning the influence of the gluconic acid it can be assumed that the monomeric sugar does not form a network by itself but rather dissolves in the water phase of the gels possible direct interactions with the ale network are beyond the scope of this work the solubility of calcium gluconate is 35 g l at 25 c international labour organization 2009 defining a solubility product of 2 15 103 mol3 l3 this value is only reached for the ale gels with 50 mm and 100 mm caco3 at 100 mm caco3 gluconic acid represented almost 50 of the vss and is available for recombination with calcium for caco3 the solubility is only 14 mg l at 25 c international labour organization 2012 corresponding to a solubility product of 1 96 10 2 mmol2 l2 this is already exceeded for ale gels with 25 mm caco3 at 50 mm caco3 already more than half of the added calcium is probably present as precipitate it is considered probable that the precipitation of calcium salts affects the structural homogeneity of the ale gels this may explain the decreasing density of the ale network at very high concentrations as shown in fig 3 the standard deviation in vvs density of the 100 mm caco3 gels was too large to draw definite conclusions also for the following discussions the results on the 100 mm caco3 gels were therefore not used for drawing conclusions on the behaviour of ale gels as a model for biofilms nonetheless we present these results since they have the potential to illustrate the effect of salt precipitation on the observed trends 3 2 viscoelastic behaviour a representative example of an amplitude sweep is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that at lower shear strains ε up to ca 10 the moduli were independent of the applied strain and stress this region is referred to as the linear viscoelastic region lver where no permanent damage is done to the structure of the sample it was defined as the region where the modulus values did not differ more than 5 from the average in contrast the crossover point was used as an indication for the destruction of the gel s network structure the storage modulus was the predominant factor in the lver for all analysed samples in fig 5 the storage moduli and dissipation factors in the linear elastic region are plotted as a function of the calcium concentration the course of the storage modulus g a was fairly similar to that of the vss density cf fig 3 it increased with the calcium concentration up to 50 mm ca2 corresponding to a ratio of 1 25 mmol ca2 per g ale above this concentration a further increase in calcium did not result in a further increase of g the observed positive correlation of the elastic modulus with calcium concentration corresponds with expectations and with observations on biofilms körstgens et al 2001 the apparent upper limit of this correlation could be a sign for oversaturation of caco3 as discussed above for ca alginate gels oversaturation of calcium has been found resulting in the formation of calcium precipitates that were correlated with a slight weakening of the gels kuo and ma 2001 the maximum storage modulus for 40 mg l ale gels was found to be around 250 pa fig 5a the dissipation factor was found to be between 0 3 and 0 15 fig 5b with increasing calcium content the domination of the elastic energy storage increased this trend flattened out above 50 mm caco3 apparently at lower ca2 levels the same interactions that caused an increase of the elastic modulus e g an increasing number of crosslinks also resulted in contraction of the network causing liquid to be pressed out in the current work synaeresis is less pronounced at low 5 10 mm ca2 concentrations with dissipation factors above 0 2 the viscoelastic data obtained for these gels correspond well with results from the few available rheological experiments on intact biofilms vinogradov et al 2004 patsios et al 2015 3 2 1 response to constant shear stress frequency sweeps showed that if left alone the ale gels keep their elastic characteristic at least in the time frame of minutes see also supplementary material b in most applications however biofilms are exposed to continuous forces an example is the shear force exerted by the water flow over a membrane the effect of such forces was investigated with creep tests all recorded creep curves followed the concave shape presented in fig 2 indicating viscoelasticity and the absence of ruptures the creep strain data over time was fitted according to eq 1 the use of two kelvin elements n 2 was found to be sufficient to fit all measurements this choice was based on the magnitude and even distribution no visible trends of the residuals cf inset of fig 6 in fig 6a representative creep experiment with the corresponding burgers fit is shown while all data points are plotted only those above 5 s were considered for the fit to avoid disturbance by creep ringing datasets containing the maxwell elastic modulus g 0 and viscosity η 0 as well as the elastic moduli g k 1 g k 2 and viscosities η k 1 η k 2 of the kelvin elements were derived cf eq 1 the latter ones were combined into the characteristic retardation times according to eqs 2 and 3 the maxwell elastic moduli supplementary material fig a2 a were in good agreement with the storage moduli from the amplitude sweeps fig 5 the viscosity was found following the same trend increasing with calcium concentration supplementary material fig a2 b in table 2 the characteristic retardation times extracted for the two kelvin elements are shown as well as the estimated maxwell retardation time they were found all to be rather unaffected by changes in the ca2 concentration and in the order of 10 100 and 1000 s respectively rather than depending on the ca2 concentration or strain these characteristic times are only dependant on the type of interactions involved ehret and böl 2013 they are interpreted as a lifetime of those interactions grindy et al 2015 in fig 7 the change in strain over time is compared for the creep and recovery steps of ale gels with 5 mm ca2 a and with 25 mm ca2 b it can be clearly observed that with the same stress a much larger strain is obtained in the gels with lower ca2 content illustrating the different storage moduli cf fig 5 also differences in the recovery of the strain are visible while in the 5 mm experiment the recovery strain graph obviously differs from the creep graph from the beginning in case of the 25 mm experiment they appear identical up to ca 30 s the final recovery of the strain was found between 80 and 90 see table a1 in supplementary material this is in line with the results of the burgers fits of the creep data showing that the viscous contribution to the deformation i e the non recoverable part is between 13 and 18 the molecular interpretation of these findings is based on considering the gels as a polymeric network reversibly crosslinked via physical interactions in particular vanderwaals forces hydrogen bonds electrostatic interactions and entanglements the property of behaving like a liquid on a longer time scale has been attributed to a limited life span of all of these interactions in a network exposed to stress or strain ehret and böl 2013 this means that a particular bond in the gel may stay intact during a short exposure to stress but breaks and potentially rearranges in another place when the exposure continues over a longer period in the case of the ale gels tested in this work four different regimes have been distinguished the immediate in the case of this experiment defined up to 5 s jump as soon as stress is applied fig 2 i two different cushioned increases with retardation times of 12 and 80 s table 2 fig 2 ii a further viscous increase of strain fig 2 iii it is hypothesised that the initial immediate jump in strain involves stretching of the chain fragments of the ale polymers between crosslinks such as entanglements and ion ca2 bonds since the elastic modulus of polymer networks is proportional to the number density of crosslinks the increase of the initial modulus with ca2 concentration fig 5 shows that this ion plays an important role in the network formation the viscous behaviour in the end of the experiment can be interpreted as a balance between breaking and making of bonds the whole gel slowly flows the flow is slower when more ca2 is available comparing the slopes of the creep curves in fig 7 since the density is higher and more crosslinks need to be broken with increasing strain the retardation time estimated for those bonds is in the range of 1000 s in correspondence with earlier findings for biofilm eps networks with ca2 crosslink lifespans of 20 30 min have been found ehret and böl 2013 it could be related to disentanglement of the ale eps polymers which occurs over time scales longer than breaking single crosslink bonds like ca2 bridges the two kelvin elements describe interactions with a lifespan of around 12 s and 80 s respectively an assignment to specific interactions is complicated because of the not yet full characterisation of ale possible candidates are the interactions between ca2 and the guluronic acid resp mannuronic acid in ale lin et al 2013 or between ca2 and sulphated groups in ale felz et al 2020 understanding these interactions on a molecular basis and what effect they have on the mechanical removability would allow for a more rational search for optimal cleaning agents and doses in our previous paper pfaff et al 2021 it was noted that maturing of ale films leads to a filamentous network with voids that grow over time this process probably starts already at the microscale in freshly prepared ale gels which causes local inhomogeneity presumably it also changes the rheological behaviour details on the microscopic structure of the gels can however not be derived from macroscopic rheology measurements so this aspect was not followed up on in the current work 3 3 structure breakdown and recovery most cleaning strategies against biofouling involve the application of external stress to remove the biofilms in the following section the behaviour of the ale gels towards stresses beyond the breaking point will be discussed the crossover point cf fig 5 shifted towards higher stresses and lower strains with increasing calcium concentration see also fig a3 supplementary material gels with less ca2 can deform up to 200 before the structure breaks while the gels with higher ca2 content already break at 100 strain a special feature was visible at the upper limit of the lver for the different ca2 concentrations fig 8 a slight strain stiffening occurred before the breakdown of the structure indicated by the presence of a maximum in storage modulus in other words the structure became harder less elastic just before it yielded this effect became more prominent with increasing ca2 concentrations strain stiffening is a property commonly found in soft biological tissue storm et al 2005 and has been occasionally reported for biofilms böl et al 2013 at this moment it is not possible to differentiate between stiffening due to strain or due to strain rate the latter could partly be explained by an increase of the contribution of short lifetime bonds e g hydrogen bonds in this case extra power is necessary to break bonds which at lower strain rates would break by themselves the decrease of the phenomenon with decreasing ca2 concentration is probably related to the decreasing ale density cf fig 3 the simplest explanation for real strain stiffening would be an accumulation of stretching but not breaking junctions when the structure eventually breaks the slope is steeper the more caco3 is contained in the samples fig 8 steeper slopes are associated with higher brittleness those materials are likely to break into inhomogeneous chunks that are expected to heal poorly therefore recovery from stress might be imperfect the slighter slope at low caco3 concentrations describes a rather ductile deformation cf error reference source not found such ductile deformation can be expected to allow for better recovery he et al 2018 for a better understanding of the observed strain hardening breaking and potential recovery of the gels structure strain steps were performed here 10 30 and 200 strain were applied for 120 s each while in between these steps the relaxing behaviour at 0 3 strain was observed for 400 s in fig 9 the storage modulus g loss modulus g and dissipation factor tan δ throughout a representative oscillation recovery experiment are presented a comparison of the behaviour of the storage moduli of the gels with different caco3 concentrations is shown in fig 10 the response of the storage modulus g to the application of the different strains was very similar for all caco3 concentrations at 10 strain only a small decrease compared to the baseline was observed followed by full recovery at 30 strain the storage modulus decreased a bit more than during the 10 strain still all gels kept their predominantly solid behaviour a remarkable observation is that the storage moduli during the recovery phase after 30 strain increased to about 120 of their original values well visible in fig 10 this suggests that the strain hardening also observed above fig 8 is caused by changes in the gel s structure that are irreversible on the time scale of the measurements a possible molecular explanation for this behaviour is that the originally randomly coiled ale molecules get stretched and aligned under shear while at the same time crosslinks with lower life times break and bind again fixing to some extent the new alignment erk et al 2010 when subsequently a lower shear force is applied the ale molecules are already stretched somewhat and breaking of the weaker bonds does not allow as much stretching as initially so that the ale gel appears stiffer than originally whether or not this explanation of the strain hardening applies it is clear that the elastic modulus of the gels depends on the strain history this memory effect is an important factor considering the common practice of scratching biofilms for investigation at 200 strain eventually the loss modulus passes the storage modulus and the gels predominantly behave like liquids figs 9 and 10 as apparent in fig 9 the typically solid behaviour was restored quickly when the strain was reduced again within the observation time of 400 s between 60 and 90 of the original storage moduli were recovered this distinctive self healing effect is probably a consequence of the undirected covalent crosslinks once one bond is broken another one can be quick and easily formed stabilizing the new conformation the full original storage modulus could not be reached though which hints at a permanent destruction of parts of the network a possible explanation is that ale molecules were broken during the treatment the average binding enthalpy of a co bond as it is found in the glycosidic linkages of guluronic and mannuronic acid in alginate is 360 kj mol atkins and paula 2006 the maximum shear stress applied during 200 strain was between 50 pa for ale gels with 5 mm caco3 and towards 200 pa for 50 and 100 mm caco3 with the sample area defined by the plate radius of 125 mm and the maximum strain of 200 of 1 mm the corresponding average transmitted energy on the gels as a whole can be roughly estimated between 50 μj and 200 μj it is not possible to determine which part of this energy is actually available to break the bonds however the energy is in a range where breaking of co bonds is possible considering the abovementioned binding enthalpy in principle about 0 3 nmol of co bonds could be broken a slight trend is observed that the gels with high caco3 recover less than those with less caco3 fig 10 this is in agreement with the higher brittleness of the gels with high caco3 the chunks produced upon breaking are more inhomogeneous and therefore recombine less strong than the more flexible structure of the gels with less caco3 the course of the recovery after 200 oscillatory strain is very similar for all tested caco3 concentrations after an initial jump to around 60 recovery there is a fast increase within the first 15 20 s to ca 80 followed by a slower further recovery we hypothesise that the rather quick recovery in the beginning depicts the elastic response of what is still intact of the network and the rebuilding of the physical interactions like electrostatic bonds that are built after slight rearrangement e g by moving of ca2 ions the subsequent slow further recovery of the original modulus can have several mechanisms including further synaeresis which were not further investigated in this work the fast and thorough recovery even after complete break down of the crosslinks emphasises one of the big challenges in biofouling removal it has been proposed before that mechanical removal of biofilms should be preceded by weakening of the chemical structure flemming 2020 this is supported by our work as well as mere chemical treatment cannot remove biofouling neither can simple force even if it is strong enough to initially overcome the cohesion of the films a promising approach for the future may even include a series of alternating chemical and physical treatments 3 4 outlook the mechanical properties of gels with relatively low caco3 concentrations are in good correspondence with those of real biofilms which makes the ca ale system a suitable starting model to study biofilm properties in relation to the development of biofouling cleaning methods a full chemical characterisation of ale will be useful for assignment of molecular interactions to observed behaviour such work could further support the existence of at least two distinguishable interactions with ca2 involved in the cohesion of ca ale gels a potential candidate are sulphated groups as they have been identified in ale felz et al 2020 the ale gel model can be extended by adding more ingredients encountered in real biofilms such as proteins dna and nano particles this work provides a first approach to identify the significant interactions so that in future applications they can be specifically attacked to facilitate subsequent mechanical removal of biofouling while this work has focused on understanding the cohesion of ale gels as a model for biofilms an additional important field for research for cleaning purposes is the adhesion of biofilms to surfaces 4 conclusions gels made from bacterial ale exhibit synaeresis as a function of the calcium content the more calcium is contained in the gels the more water is expelled correlating with stiffer and more brittle gels there is an optimum calcium concentration for gelation of ale providing suitable mechanical strength without overdosing the upper limit found in this work is between 1 25 and 2 5 mol g vss overdosing beyond this limit can promote weakening of the gel structure by precipitation of calcium compounds making the ale network more brittle at the same time and therefore less likely to reconnect can be used as a cleaning approach at least three different kinds of crosslinks appear to be present in the investigated calcium ale system with retardation times in the order of 10 100 and 1000 s ale gels exhibit strain hardening at mid level strain illustrating a dependency of the mechanical properties of biofilm samples on their strain history therefore it is questionable how much the analysis of scratched biofilms still can tell about the properties of natural biofilms ale gels show fast and under many conditions quite complete recovery after shear this emphasises the undirected physical and thus easily recoverable nature of the crosslinks for successful mechanical cleaning therefore the applied force may not be stopped too soon declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16522,bacterial alginate like exopolymers ale gels have been used in this work as a model for the extracellular polymeric matrix of biofilms aim was to relate the mechanical properties and strength of this matrix that make biofilms as persistent to cleaning as they are to the complex cohesive molecular interactions involved mechanical properties of the gels as a function of caco3 concentration were investigated using dynamic and static rheology gels with relatively low caco3 concentrations between 100 μmol and 300 μmol per g ale were found to exhibit similar viscoelastic behaviour as real biofilms with elastic moduli between 50 pa and 100 pa and dissipation factors between 0 2 and 0 3 increasing caco3 concentrations resulted in an increase of the elastic modulus up to 250 pa accompanied by an increase in brittleness at a caco3 concentration of 1250 μmol per g ale this trend stopped probably due to disturbance of the continuous ale network by precipitation of salts therefore overdosing of ca salts can be an adequate approach for the removal of biofouling all gels exhibited permanent strain hardening under medium strain and their mechanical properties showed dependency on their strain history even after application of an oscillatory strain with 200 amplitude that caused the gel structure to collapse the gels recovered 65 to 90 of their original shear modulus for the major part within the first 20 s recovery was slightly less for gels with high caco3 concentration in creep tests fitted with a burgers model with multiple kelvin elements at least three different interactions in the ale gels could be distinguished with characteristic retardation times in the range of 10 100 and 1000 s further identification of the mechanisms underlying the gel mechanics will allow the development of targeted strategies to undermine the mechanical strength of biofouling and aid the cleaning process graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction the complete chemical composition of biofilms is as diverse as the bacterial communities that inhabit them and in most cases not easy to determine common practice is a distinction between two main components the bacteria and the matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps geesey 1982 polysaccharides proteins lipids nucleic acids and complex macromolecules with mixed functionalities have been identified in eps seviour et al 2019 these molecules form a physically crosslinked 3d molecular network with the ability to bind high amounts of water therefore biofilms can be considered as complex hydrogels the eps matrix which can provide up to 90 of the biofilms organic matter acts as a protective shield for the bacteria against biological chemical and mechanical influences it also prevents desiccation the eps matrix has been shown to considerably reduce the effectiveness of biocides last but not least the eps matrix is responsible for the mechanical strength and integrity of biofilms the mechanical properties of biofilms have been found to stay mostly intact even if the bacterial cells are killed flemming 2020 therefore the eps matrix and its mechanical strength are essential in removing biofouling considering the biofilms ability to resist physical forces like the shear stress from flowing water two aspects of the mechanical strength should be distinguished the adhesion to the surface and the internal cohesion the cohesion is reflected in the biofilms viscoelasticity biofilms show the typical viscoelastic behaviour of crosslinked polymer networks safari et al 2015 in contrast to covalently bound networks the crosslinks in biofilms have for the most part been identified as physical interactions such as vanderwaals forces hydrogen bonds electrostatic interactions including ion bridges and entanglements seviour et al 2019 cohesion and adhesion are closely related both follow from the molecular interactions within the eps and with the environment especially for thin films like many biofilms are both properties can hardly be separated safari et al 2015 therefore the influence of sample collection and treatment stays a relevant question in biofouling research how does mechanical removal of biofilms from their substrates alter their physical characteristics and how can the knowledge about such behaviour help to prevent and combat biofouling these questions were the motivation for the current work goal is to relate the mechanical properties and strength of the eps matrix to the molecular interactions involved in the dynamic crosslinks alginate like exopolymers ales have been found to provide structural integrity to granular sludge and biofilms ghafoor et al 2011 lin et al 2013 therefore we have chosen them as a model for the eps matrix to investigate the mechanical properties of biofilms like the well characterised algal alginate this mixture of exopolymers forms gels with ca2 ions felz et al 2016 which is important for adhesion and strength of biofilms containing ale goode and allen 2011 therefore ale provides an interim model between algal alginate and the complex real world biofilm eps in previous work pfaff et al 2021 we have found that ca2 accumulates in thin ale layers and influences their density the current work focuses on the resulting cohesive strength of ale gels as a function of ca2 content the molecular interactions are probed by measuring the gels time dependant viscoelastic properties with a rheometer the cohesion has been chosen over the adhesion to address the molecular interactions within the gels to minimise the impact of adhesion thick gel structures were produced and maximum adhesion no slip between the samples and the rheometer was ensured the swelling state of hydrogels has been found to impact mechanical strength adhesion permeability and degradation davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 inversely the viscoelastic properties in combination with gel size and permeability have been found responsible for synaeresis scherer 1989 spontaneous synaeresis as a reaction to increasing salt concentrations in the supernatant has been described as a possibly important mechanism of biofilm survival during desiccation decho 2016 occurrence and peculiarity of synaeresis and its correlation with other characteristics was therefore a side focus of this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 ale extraction because of the high ale content of granular sludge the material was extracted from nereda sludge collected from the wastewater treatment plant in garmerwolde the netherlands the extraction was done in alkaline conditions followed by acid precipitation based on a protocol by felz et al 2016 the granules were collected by decantation in 1 l demineralised water purified with a milliq ic 7003 system ca 150 g of the wet granules 20 g dry weight were mixed with 10 g na2co3 vwr the netherlands and homogenised by pulsed sonication branson sonifier 250 5 min at 70 max output 200 w during sonication the mixture was cooled in an ice bath to prevent overheating subsequently the alkaline extraction step was performed by heating the mixture to 80 c for 30 min under vigorous stirring the pellet was discarded after centrifugation allegra x 12r centrifuge beckman coulter 20 min 3750 rpm the supernatant was dialysed in 4 6 steps using a spectra por dialysis membrane with a cut off of 3 5 kda each against 20 l demineralised water until the conductivity in the dialysis solution was below 50 µs cm the extract was acidified with 1 m hcl merck millipore germany to ph 2 2 5 after another centrifugation the pellet was collected lyophilised alpha 2 4 ldplus christ germany and stored at room temperature until further use it is henceforth referred to as ale for further information we refer the reader to supplementary material c 2 2 gel preparation gels were prepared by internal gelation draget et al 1989 davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 using caco3 as a calcium source ca2 ions were slowly released by hydrolysis of glucono δ lactone gdl enabling uniform gelling of the ale based on the concentration ranges in which ale films were found to be successfully formed on membranes pfaff et al 2021 the concentrations were chosen as 40 g l ale and 5 12 5 25 50 and 100 mm caco3 an overview of the gels composition is shown in table 1 a molar ratio of 2 1 was applied between gdl and caco3 stock solutions of ale 50 g l caco3 10 the target concentration shown in table 1 and gdl 10 target concentration were prepared the lyophilised ale was dissolved in 1 m naoh merck millipore germany and diluted with demineralised water the solution was neutralised using more naoh caco3 anhydrous reagent grade vwr the netherlands was suspended in demineralised water and dispersed in an ultrasonic bath bandelin sonorex technik for 10 min gdl solutions were always freshly prepared by dissolving the necessary amount of glucono δ lactone sigma aldrich france in demineralised water the three stock solutions were mixed in a volume ratio of 8 1 1 portions of 1 5 ml were immediately pipetted into sandpaper grit size p180 waterproof sencys the netherlands lined disposable rheometer dishes anton paar 56 mm the gel dimensions were determined by stencils of 30 mm diameter see fig 1 a the samples were left for crosslinking at room temperature in a sealed plastic box partly filled with water providing 100 humidity for 36 h preliminary experiments showed that gelling was complete within this time frame before starting the mechanical measurements the stencils were removed and the surfaces and heights of the gels were equalised by cutting them to 1 mm height using a 1 mm frame and a razor blade 2 3 gel sample analysis 2 3 1 chemical characterisation crosslinked ale gel samples were scratched and weighed into dry porcelain crucibles m sample after heating to 105 c for 24 h the dry mass total suspended solids tss was determined the contained water m water was calculated as the difference between m sample and tss the dried samples were then burnt at 550 c for 2 h to remove the organic matter volatile suspended solids vss the remaining ash was interpreted as the inorganic content of the material while the vss was interpreted as ale eventually the vss density ρvss was calculated as vss per m water 2 3 2 rheological measurements rheological characterisation of the samples was performed using an mcr 102 rheometer anton paar austria with a 25 mm plate plate geometry and disposable dishes 56 mm anton paar austria cf fig 1 the working principle of this apparatus is that samples are sheared between the upper rotating and the lower fixed plate while monitoring the displacement of the upper plate and the torque a 3d printed cover petg printed with an ultimaker s5 ultimaker b v the netherlands of which the bottom part could be filled with water was used to reduce evaporation of water during the measurements before the start of every measurement the upper plate was covered with clean sandpaper the zero height and measurement system inertia were recalibrated the sample surface was detected by lowering the upper plate until a normal force of 0 15 n was reached corresponding to ca 300 pa this is in the range of the expected moduli already to make sure it was really the sample surface detected subsequently the samples were trimmed and left equilibrating until the normal force remained below 0 05 n tests in the linear viscoelastic region lver applying several of these approaching procedures with the sequence of slight compression and equilibration resulted in identical measurements the approaching procedure had no apparent impact on the results amplitude sweeps oscillating measurements were performed in triplicates at 10 rad s with exponentially increasing amplitudes between 0 01 and 250 shear strain ε the strain deformation was defined as the displacement in relation to the sample thickness measuring the resulting torque τ the corresponding average shear stress σ on the sample was determined the ratio between shear stress σ and shear strain ε is defined as the complex modulus g utilising the phase shift between σ and ε the complex modulus g was split into the real component g representing the storage modulus and the imaginary component g representing the loss modulus for a given strain these moduli signify how much of the applied stress is stored elastically and how much is lost by dissipation the ratio between storage modulus g and loss modulus g is also referred to as the dissipation factor tan δ the so called crossover point g g can be used as a practical indicator for the dominance of viscous over elastic behaviour it indicates that above the corresponding strain the network structure of a sample is broken the strains and stresses at the crossover points were determined as a function of the caco3 concentration frequency sweeps frequency sweeps were performed with an amplitude of 0 3 strain which was found to be inside the lver in amplitude sweeps with angular frequencies ω between 100 and 1 rad s more explanation and results can be found in the supplementary material b recovery after oscillatory strain the recovery capacity of the gels was investigated by observing the storage and loss moduli during application of different oscillatory strains at 10 rad s again all experiments were performed in triplicate as reference and baseline a strain amplitude of 0 3 was used which was well within the lver strain amplitudes of 10 30 and 200 were applied for 120 s each followed by 400 s recovery at 0 3 strain creep recovery tests creep recovery tests were performed in triplicate a constant shear stress σ of 10 pa found to be inside the lver for all samples was applied for 300 s and the strain ε was monitored subsequently the stress was removed and the strain was monitored for another 600 s the creep was interpreted using the burgers model which has been successfully applied to describe the viscoelastic behaviour of biofilms vinogradov et al 2004 because of creep ringing the initial overshooting visible in fig 2 at the first application of the stress resulting from the coupling of instrument inertia and sample elasticity ewoldt and mckinley 2007 the first 5 s of each step were not included in the analysis in the current case an indefinite number of kelvin elements was allowed the ale gels are described as a series of a maxwell element consisting of a spring describing the elastic jump at the beginning of the curve and a dashpot describing the viscous response represented by the linear increase at the end of the creep curve and an indefinite number of kelvin elements consisting of a parallel spring dashpot pairs see fig 2 this results in the following equation 1 ɛ creep t σ g 0 n σ g k n 1 exp t g k n η k n σ η 0 t εcreep is the shear strain measured over time t under application of a constant shear stress σ g0 is the initial elastic modulus η0 the viscosity and gk n and ηk n the elastic moduli and viscosities of each kelvin element n the retardation time τ is a measure for the delay in the material s full elastic response to an applied stress caused by its viscous elements the characteristic retardation time τ of each kelvin element is represented by the ratio between the viscosity and the elastic modulus it depicts the time after which 63 of the maximum strain of the element is reached 2 τ k n η k n g k n similarly for a simple maxwell liquid the characteristic relaxation time is given by 3 τ m η 0 g 0 also for materials with a stress relaxation that is more complicated like the investigated case this equation is a reasonable estimate with τm representing the longest retardation time in the system 3 results and discussion 3 1 swelling and synaeresis over gelation the ale gels were prepared with equal amounts of ale but different amounts of caco3 and glucono δ lactone gdl gdl hydrolyses in water forming gluconic acid which adds to the final vss table 1 shows the composition of the samples at the beginning of the gelling process the ale gels were left for gelling in a 100 humidity environment to avoid evaporation it can be observed in fig 3 that the final gel composition differed from the original sample composition salts have been neglected in this observation because they provide only 0 5 wt cf table 1 only at 5 mm caco3 the original composition was almost maintained with increasing ca2 ale ratio the vss density and thus the ratio of vvs to water increased cf also fig a1 in the supplementary material a apparently during gelation water was expelled from the samples this phenomenon is known as synaeresis and has been described for several hydrogel systems including ca alginate kuo and ma 2001 synaeresis is essentially a contraction of the hydrogel network resulting from molecular interactions within the ale network is getting compacter with increasing caco3 concentration ale densities of the gels were found between 45 and 70 g l in good agreement with those found for ale gel layers produced in dead end filtration with cacl2 pfaff et al 2021 the common explanation for the observed compaction up to a maximum at 50 mm caco3 is a higher number of crosslinks however the amount of negative charges in the ale has previously been estimated around 1 mmol g vss pfaff et al 2021 corresponding to 40 mmol l in the gels assuming that two negative charges are necessary for neutralisation of each ca2 ion this means that the maximum amount of bound ca2 would be 20 mm therefore other explanations considering internal restructuring processes like lateral association of the present crosslinks hermansson et al 2016 seem worthwhile to consider concerning the influence of the gluconic acid it can be assumed that the monomeric sugar does not form a network by itself but rather dissolves in the water phase of the gels possible direct interactions with the ale network are beyond the scope of this work the solubility of calcium gluconate is 35 g l at 25 c international labour organization 2009 defining a solubility product of 2 15 103 mol3 l3 this value is only reached for the ale gels with 50 mm and 100 mm caco3 at 100 mm caco3 gluconic acid represented almost 50 of the vss and is available for recombination with calcium for caco3 the solubility is only 14 mg l at 25 c international labour organization 2012 corresponding to a solubility product of 1 96 10 2 mmol2 l2 this is already exceeded for ale gels with 25 mm caco3 at 50 mm caco3 already more than half of the added calcium is probably present as precipitate it is considered probable that the precipitation of calcium salts affects the structural homogeneity of the ale gels this may explain the decreasing density of the ale network at very high concentrations as shown in fig 3 the standard deviation in vvs density of the 100 mm caco3 gels was too large to draw definite conclusions also for the following discussions the results on the 100 mm caco3 gels were therefore not used for drawing conclusions on the behaviour of ale gels as a model for biofilms nonetheless we present these results since they have the potential to illustrate the effect of salt precipitation on the observed trends 3 2 viscoelastic behaviour a representative example of an amplitude sweep is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that at lower shear strains ε up to ca 10 the moduli were independent of the applied strain and stress this region is referred to as the linear viscoelastic region lver where no permanent damage is done to the structure of the sample it was defined as the region where the modulus values did not differ more than 5 from the average in contrast the crossover point was used as an indication for the destruction of the gel s network structure the storage modulus was the predominant factor in the lver for all analysed samples in fig 5 the storage moduli and dissipation factors in the linear elastic region are plotted as a function of the calcium concentration the course of the storage modulus g a was fairly similar to that of the vss density cf fig 3 it increased with the calcium concentration up to 50 mm ca2 corresponding to a ratio of 1 25 mmol ca2 per g ale above this concentration a further increase in calcium did not result in a further increase of g the observed positive correlation of the elastic modulus with calcium concentration corresponds with expectations and with observations on biofilms körstgens et al 2001 the apparent upper limit of this correlation could be a sign for oversaturation of caco3 as discussed above for ca alginate gels oversaturation of calcium has been found resulting in the formation of calcium precipitates that were correlated with a slight weakening of the gels kuo and ma 2001 the maximum storage modulus for 40 mg l ale gels was found to be around 250 pa fig 5a the dissipation factor was found to be between 0 3 and 0 15 fig 5b with increasing calcium content the domination of the elastic energy storage increased this trend flattened out above 50 mm caco3 apparently at lower ca2 levels the same interactions that caused an increase of the elastic modulus e g an increasing number of crosslinks also resulted in contraction of the network causing liquid to be pressed out in the current work synaeresis is less pronounced at low 5 10 mm ca2 concentrations with dissipation factors above 0 2 the viscoelastic data obtained for these gels correspond well with results from the few available rheological experiments on intact biofilms vinogradov et al 2004 patsios et al 2015 3 2 1 response to constant shear stress frequency sweeps showed that if left alone the ale gels keep their elastic characteristic at least in the time frame of minutes see also supplementary material b in most applications however biofilms are exposed to continuous forces an example is the shear force exerted by the water flow over a membrane the effect of such forces was investigated with creep tests all recorded creep curves followed the concave shape presented in fig 2 indicating viscoelasticity and the absence of ruptures the creep strain data over time was fitted according to eq 1 the use of two kelvin elements n 2 was found to be sufficient to fit all measurements this choice was based on the magnitude and even distribution no visible trends of the residuals cf inset of fig 6 in fig 6a representative creep experiment with the corresponding burgers fit is shown while all data points are plotted only those above 5 s were considered for the fit to avoid disturbance by creep ringing datasets containing the maxwell elastic modulus g 0 and viscosity η 0 as well as the elastic moduli g k 1 g k 2 and viscosities η k 1 η k 2 of the kelvin elements were derived cf eq 1 the latter ones were combined into the characteristic retardation times according to eqs 2 and 3 the maxwell elastic moduli supplementary material fig a2 a were in good agreement with the storage moduli from the amplitude sweeps fig 5 the viscosity was found following the same trend increasing with calcium concentration supplementary material fig a2 b in table 2 the characteristic retardation times extracted for the two kelvin elements are shown as well as the estimated maxwell retardation time they were found all to be rather unaffected by changes in the ca2 concentration and in the order of 10 100 and 1000 s respectively rather than depending on the ca2 concentration or strain these characteristic times are only dependant on the type of interactions involved ehret and böl 2013 they are interpreted as a lifetime of those interactions grindy et al 2015 in fig 7 the change in strain over time is compared for the creep and recovery steps of ale gels with 5 mm ca2 a and with 25 mm ca2 b it can be clearly observed that with the same stress a much larger strain is obtained in the gels with lower ca2 content illustrating the different storage moduli cf fig 5 also differences in the recovery of the strain are visible while in the 5 mm experiment the recovery strain graph obviously differs from the creep graph from the beginning in case of the 25 mm experiment they appear identical up to ca 30 s the final recovery of the strain was found between 80 and 90 see table a1 in supplementary material this is in line with the results of the burgers fits of the creep data showing that the viscous contribution to the deformation i e the non recoverable part is between 13 and 18 the molecular interpretation of these findings is based on considering the gels as a polymeric network reversibly crosslinked via physical interactions in particular vanderwaals forces hydrogen bonds electrostatic interactions and entanglements the property of behaving like a liquid on a longer time scale has been attributed to a limited life span of all of these interactions in a network exposed to stress or strain ehret and böl 2013 this means that a particular bond in the gel may stay intact during a short exposure to stress but breaks and potentially rearranges in another place when the exposure continues over a longer period in the case of the ale gels tested in this work four different regimes have been distinguished the immediate in the case of this experiment defined up to 5 s jump as soon as stress is applied fig 2 i two different cushioned increases with retardation times of 12 and 80 s table 2 fig 2 ii a further viscous increase of strain fig 2 iii it is hypothesised that the initial immediate jump in strain involves stretching of the chain fragments of the ale polymers between crosslinks such as entanglements and ion ca2 bonds since the elastic modulus of polymer networks is proportional to the number density of crosslinks the increase of the initial modulus with ca2 concentration fig 5 shows that this ion plays an important role in the network formation the viscous behaviour in the end of the experiment can be interpreted as a balance between breaking and making of bonds the whole gel slowly flows the flow is slower when more ca2 is available comparing the slopes of the creep curves in fig 7 since the density is higher and more crosslinks need to be broken with increasing strain the retardation time estimated for those bonds is in the range of 1000 s in correspondence with earlier findings for biofilm eps networks with ca2 crosslink lifespans of 20 30 min have been found ehret and böl 2013 it could be related to disentanglement of the ale eps polymers which occurs over time scales longer than breaking single crosslink bonds like ca2 bridges the two kelvin elements describe interactions with a lifespan of around 12 s and 80 s respectively an assignment to specific interactions is complicated because of the not yet full characterisation of ale possible candidates are the interactions between ca2 and the guluronic acid resp mannuronic acid in ale lin et al 2013 or between ca2 and sulphated groups in ale felz et al 2020 understanding these interactions on a molecular basis and what effect they have on the mechanical removability would allow for a more rational search for optimal cleaning agents and doses in our previous paper pfaff et al 2021 it was noted that maturing of ale films leads to a filamentous network with voids that grow over time this process probably starts already at the microscale in freshly prepared ale gels which causes local inhomogeneity presumably it also changes the rheological behaviour details on the microscopic structure of the gels can however not be derived from macroscopic rheology measurements so this aspect was not followed up on in the current work 3 3 structure breakdown and recovery most cleaning strategies against biofouling involve the application of external stress to remove the biofilms in the following section the behaviour of the ale gels towards stresses beyond the breaking point will be discussed the crossover point cf fig 5 shifted towards higher stresses and lower strains with increasing calcium concentration see also fig a3 supplementary material gels with less ca2 can deform up to 200 before the structure breaks while the gels with higher ca2 content already break at 100 strain a special feature was visible at the upper limit of the lver for the different ca2 concentrations fig 8 a slight strain stiffening occurred before the breakdown of the structure indicated by the presence of a maximum in storage modulus in other words the structure became harder less elastic just before it yielded this effect became more prominent with increasing ca2 concentrations strain stiffening is a property commonly found in soft biological tissue storm et al 2005 and has been occasionally reported for biofilms böl et al 2013 at this moment it is not possible to differentiate between stiffening due to strain or due to strain rate the latter could partly be explained by an increase of the contribution of short lifetime bonds e g hydrogen bonds in this case extra power is necessary to break bonds which at lower strain rates would break by themselves the decrease of the phenomenon with decreasing ca2 concentration is probably related to the decreasing ale density cf fig 3 the simplest explanation for real strain stiffening would be an accumulation of stretching but not breaking junctions when the structure eventually breaks the slope is steeper the more caco3 is contained in the samples fig 8 steeper slopes are associated with higher brittleness those materials are likely to break into inhomogeneous chunks that are expected to heal poorly therefore recovery from stress might be imperfect the slighter slope at low caco3 concentrations describes a rather ductile deformation cf error reference source not found such ductile deformation can be expected to allow for better recovery he et al 2018 for a better understanding of the observed strain hardening breaking and potential recovery of the gels structure strain steps were performed here 10 30 and 200 strain were applied for 120 s each while in between these steps the relaxing behaviour at 0 3 strain was observed for 400 s in fig 9 the storage modulus g loss modulus g and dissipation factor tan δ throughout a representative oscillation recovery experiment are presented a comparison of the behaviour of the storage moduli of the gels with different caco3 concentrations is shown in fig 10 the response of the storage modulus g to the application of the different strains was very similar for all caco3 concentrations at 10 strain only a small decrease compared to the baseline was observed followed by full recovery at 30 strain the storage modulus decreased a bit more than during the 10 strain still all gels kept their predominantly solid behaviour a remarkable observation is that the storage moduli during the recovery phase after 30 strain increased to about 120 of their original values well visible in fig 10 this suggests that the strain hardening also observed above fig 8 is caused by changes in the gel s structure that are irreversible on the time scale of the measurements a possible molecular explanation for this behaviour is that the originally randomly coiled ale molecules get stretched and aligned under shear while at the same time crosslinks with lower life times break and bind again fixing to some extent the new alignment erk et al 2010 when subsequently a lower shear force is applied the ale molecules are already stretched somewhat and breaking of the weaker bonds does not allow as much stretching as initially so that the ale gel appears stiffer than originally whether or not this explanation of the strain hardening applies it is clear that the elastic modulus of the gels depends on the strain history this memory effect is an important factor considering the common practice of scratching biofilms for investigation at 200 strain eventually the loss modulus passes the storage modulus and the gels predominantly behave like liquids figs 9 and 10 as apparent in fig 9 the typically solid behaviour was restored quickly when the strain was reduced again within the observation time of 400 s between 60 and 90 of the original storage moduli were recovered this distinctive self healing effect is probably a consequence of the undirected covalent crosslinks once one bond is broken another one can be quick and easily formed stabilizing the new conformation the full original storage modulus could not be reached though which hints at a permanent destruction of parts of the network a possible explanation is that ale molecules were broken during the treatment the average binding enthalpy of a co bond as it is found in the glycosidic linkages of guluronic and mannuronic acid in alginate is 360 kj mol atkins and paula 2006 the maximum shear stress applied during 200 strain was between 50 pa for ale gels with 5 mm caco3 and towards 200 pa for 50 and 100 mm caco3 with the sample area defined by the plate radius of 125 mm and the maximum strain of 200 of 1 mm the corresponding average transmitted energy on the gels as a whole can be roughly estimated between 50 μj and 200 μj it is not possible to determine which part of this energy is actually available to break the bonds however the energy is in a range where breaking of co bonds is possible considering the abovementioned binding enthalpy in principle about 0 3 nmol of co bonds could be broken a slight trend is observed that the gels with high caco3 recover less than those with less caco3 fig 10 this is in agreement with the higher brittleness of the gels with high caco3 the chunks produced upon breaking are more inhomogeneous and therefore recombine less strong than the more flexible structure of the gels with less caco3 the course of the recovery after 200 oscillatory strain is very similar for all tested caco3 concentrations after an initial jump to around 60 recovery there is a fast increase within the first 15 20 s to ca 80 followed by a slower further recovery we hypothesise that the rather quick recovery in the beginning depicts the elastic response of what is still intact of the network and the rebuilding of the physical interactions like electrostatic bonds that are built after slight rearrangement e g by moving of ca2 ions the subsequent slow further recovery of the original modulus can have several mechanisms including further synaeresis which were not further investigated in this work the fast and thorough recovery even after complete break down of the crosslinks emphasises one of the big challenges in biofouling removal it has been proposed before that mechanical removal of biofilms should be preceded by weakening of the chemical structure flemming 2020 this is supported by our work as well as mere chemical treatment cannot remove biofouling neither can simple force even if it is strong enough to initially overcome the cohesion of the films a promising approach for the future may even include a series of alternating chemical and physical treatments 3 4 outlook the mechanical properties of gels with relatively low caco3 concentrations are in good correspondence with those of real biofilms which makes the ca ale system a suitable starting model to study biofilm properties in relation to the development of biofouling cleaning methods a full chemical characterisation of ale will be useful for assignment of molecular interactions to observed behaviour such work could further support the existence of at least two distinguishable interactions with ca2 involved in the cohesion of ca ale gels a potential candidate are sulphated groups as they have been identified in ale felz et al 2020 the ale gel model can be extended by adding more ingredients encountered in real biofilms such as proteins dna and nano particles this work provides a first approach to identify the significant interactions so that in future applications they can be specifically attacked to facilitate subsequent mechanical removal of biofouling while this work has focused on understanding the cohesion of ale gels as a model for biofilms an additional important field for research for cleaning purposes is the adhesion of biofilms to surfaces 4 conclusions gels made from bacterial ale exhibit synaeresis as a function of the calcium content the more calcium is contained in the gels the more water is expelled correlating with stiffer and more brittle gels there is an optimum calcium concentration for gelation of ale providing suitable mechanical strength without overdosing the upper limit found in this work is between 1 25 and 2 5 mol g vss overdosing beyond this limit can promote weakening of the gel structure by precipitation of calcium compounds making the ale network more brittle at the same time and therefore less likely to reconnect can be used as a cleaning approach at least three different kinds of crosslinks appear to be present in the investigated calcium ale system with retardation times in the order of 10 100 and 1000 s ale gels exhibit strain hardening at mid level strain illustrating a dependency of the mechanical properties of biofilm samples on their strain history therefore it is questionable how much the analysis of scratched biofilms still can tell about the properties of natural biofilms ale gels show fast and under many conditions quite complete recovery after shear this emphasises the undirected physical and thus easily recoverable nature of the crosslinks for successful mechanical cleaning therefore the applied force may not be stopped too soon declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16523,wastewater with high salinity is one of the major challenges for conventional wastewater treatment although nitrogen management is vital for wastewater treatment efficient strategies for nitrogen recovery and removal from saline wastewater remain challenging here we propose microbial ammonium assimilation to achieve efficient nitrogen removal and recovery into biomass from saline wastewater without gaseous nitrogen release opposite to the conventional wastewater treatment we find one marine bacterium psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 with the ability to form sedimentary granular biofilms that can be engineered to construct an efficient ammonium assimilating microbiome followed the bottom up design we demonstrate that the microbiome removes ammonium through assimilation without reactive nitrogen intermediates and gaseous nitrogen emission according to the functional gene abundance and nitrogen balance more than 80 of ammonium total nitrogen and total phosphorus are removed and recovered into biomass with more than 98 of cod removed from saline wastewater as one prototypic microbe to form ammonium assimilating biofilms psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 plays key role in nutrient metabolism and microbiome construction we stress that ammonium assimilation with a clear and short pathway is a promising method in future saline wastewater treatment and sustainable

it is estimated approximately that 150 185 teragram nitrogen per year tg n year 1 bodirsky et al 2014 steffen et al 2015 of nr has entered the global environment and 125 tg n year 1 is produced by the energy intensive process of haber bosch kuypers et al 2018 the excessive nr input into agriculture inevitably results in the nr waste in soils and the eutrophication of water bodies approximately 20 tg n year 1 of ammonium ends up in wastewater bodirsky et al 2014 winkler and straka 2019 and more than 5 of the global wastewater was accompanied by high salinity he et al 2017 saline wastewater such as seawater flushing seafood processing tannery leaching from saline alkali soils etc usually contains high content of nitrogen corsino et al 2019 the discharge of saline wastewater poses a great threat to the biological wastewater treatment systems resulting in nutrient accumulation in the effluents the excessive nitrogen discharge leads to eutrophication in water bodies and finally threatens coastal ecosystems howarth et al 2011 finding effective nitrogen removal approaches in saline wastewater treatment is still a topic to attenuate the stresses of environmental pollution and water scarcity to achieve a satisfying biological nitrogen removal bnr there is a pressing need to understand the basic mechanisms that underlie microbial nitrogen transformations fundamentally there are two directions of biological nitrogen conversion oxidizing ammonia further into dinitrogen gas and or assimilating ammonium into biomass winkler and straka 2019 processes of nitrification denitrification based on ammonia oxidation is the mainstream strategy for bnr in current wastewater treatment plants winkler and straka 2019 but it becomes vulnerable in severe environments particularly nitrogen removal performance is greatly inhibited under saline conditions with notorious nitrite and nitrate accumulated corsino et al 2019 moussa et al 2006 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is another alternative pathway to achieve nitrogen removal in saline wastewater under low c n ratios li et al 2015 yet the wide application of anammox is challenged for the long doubling time of anammox bacteria and its sensitivity to fluctuations of environmental and water quality such as temperature and high organic carbon loading li et al 2018b yu et al 2019b furthermore either nitrification denitrification or anammox inevitably leads to nitrogen loss and greenhouse effects as to ammonium assimilation ammonium is incorporated into 2 oxoglutarate to produce glutamine catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase gdh or by glutamine synthetase glutamate synthase gs gogat without nitrogen loss this ammonium uptake by heterotrophic bacteria is implied a valuable strategy for nitrogen recovery cruz et al 2019 it has been estimated that the interconversion of ammonium and organic nitrogen quantitatively dominates the biogeochemical nitrogen cycling especially in marine environments kuypers et al 2018 fluxes associated with ammonium assimilation approximately 8800 tg n year 1 are much larger than that associated with nitrogen loss approximately 400 tg n year 1 kuypers et al 2018 in the ocean it can be inferred that the ocean is an abundant pool of bacterial resources for ammonium assimilation and ammonium assimilation by marine bacteria can shed a light on developing a desirable approach to synchronous removal and recovery of nitrogen for refractory saline wastewater treatment although microbial ammonium assimilation has been well studied at the cellular and genetic levels burkovski 2003 van heeswijk et al 2013 ecological and environmental functions are usually performed by microbiomes lawson et al 2019 instead of single cells in the level of microbial community ammonium assimilation has been reported to contribute to partial nitrogen removal but the nr intermediates and nitrogen loss can hardly be avoided and the improvement of ammonium assimilation is hard with the existence of nitrification denitrification pan et al 2020 the construction of ammonium assimilating microbiomes for nitrogen recovery is rarely reported in complex microbiomes the varying affinities for substrates and sensitivity to environmental constraints among different microbial consortia increase the difficulty of targeted artificial manipulation lawson et al 2019 fortunately rational synthesis of microbiomes following bottom up design eng and borenstein 2019 lawson et al 2019 provides a practicable approach to building microbiomes with desired systematic functions starting from a functional microbe as a metabolic basis could be promising in building an ammonium assimilating microbiome for environmental engineering applications but the major challenge of synthetic microbiomes is to maintain functional stability in open systems since the functional microbes are susceptible to invasion by naturally occurring microorganisms and dynamic heterogeneous environments lawson et al 2019 certain spatiotemporal organizations of microbiomes such as biofilms have been considered beneficial to overcoming environmental constraints lawson et al 2019 in wastewater treatment biofilms flocs granules and attached biofilms improve the ability of functional microbes to resist or reconcile the microbial invasion and environmental fluctuations flemming and wuertz 2019 lawson et al 2019 in marine plankton communities attached heterotrophic bacteria show higher single cell nitrogen assimilation rates than free living cells klawonn et al 2019 moreover glutamine and ammonium concentrations are reported to be involved in the development of biofilms liu et al 2015 therefore ammonium assimilating microbes with biofilm forming capability are likely candidates for the construction of microbiomes which could be beneficial for alleviating the salt constrain on nitrogen metabolism marine bacterium psychrobacter has been reported to form granular biofilms which are potential for nutrient removal in our previous study huang et al 2018 however related nitrogen metabolism is unknown and the gap in the application of the pure culture to an engineering microbiome needs to be bridged the aims of this study were to i construct and operate an ammonium assimilating microbiome from a marine bacterium with biofilm forming capability ii reveal the performance and metabolism of nitrogen removal of this microbiome and prove the feasibility of its application in saline wastewater treatment iii investigate the microbial interactions in functional microbes and identify the roles of functional microbes in the stability of this microbiome 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism and media during an open cruise of r v dong fang hong 2 from march 28 to april 14 2017 as previously reported jiang et al 2019 we isolated several strains belonging to psychrobacter from onboard seawater filter membranes as well as in situ sediments from the station a4 122 48 e 35 59 n in the yellow sea china the collected samples were stored in a clean sampling bag and refrigerated at 80 c in the laboratory before incubated into luria bertani lb

c for 24 h in lb medium with a salinity of 3 3 before that 10 v v inoculums were inoculated into different media the strain was further cultivated in ammonium medium nitrite medium nitrate medium and urea medium to investigate its nitrogen utilization mechanism ammonium medium am contained per liter 1000 mg sodium acetate 400 mg kh2po4 33 g seawater crystal 230 mg nh4cl while nh4cl was replaced by 295 mg nano2 430 mg nano3 or 130 mg urea in nitrite medium nitrate medium and urea medium respectively in batch tests to exclude the nitrifying capability 30 mg l 1 allylthiourea atu xu et al 2018 was added into am as the inhibitor of ammonia monooxygenase which could inhibit the activity of both ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonium oxidizing archaea zheng et al 2020 considering the inhibitory effect of aerobic and heterotrophic experimental conditions on anammox bacteria the contribution of anammox bacteria to assimilation was not taken into account concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and total nitrogen tn were monitored to investigate the fate of different nitrogen sources via utilization nitrogen balance was calculated to testify the pathway of ammonium utilization samples with suspended biomass were used for the detection of total nitrogen in systems tn1 while samples after centrifugal were used to detect the total nitrogen in the supernatant tn2 total nitrogen in biomass was obtained via the subtraction calculation of tn1 and tn2 2 2 synthesis and operation of ammonium assimilating microbiomes sequential batch reactors sbrs with unsterilized synthetic wastewater were used to develop ammonium assimilating microbiomes synthetic seawater flushing wastewater was used as a proxy which was typical saline wastewater with a high concentration of

column type sbrs with a working volume of 3 2 l 42 cm in height and 10 cm in diameter were used in this study each sbr was operated with 8 h per cycle that consisted of 5 min feeding 450 min aeration 15 min settling and 10 min decanting the volumetric exchange ratio of each reactor was set at 62 5 corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 8 h the mean sludge retention time srt was 21 d air was introduced through an air diffuser at the bottom of sbr and controlled by a mass flow controller with the dissolved oxygen do at 2 3 mg l 1 mlss was controlled at 10 g l 1 by sludge discharge to ensured high and stable performance the detailed constructing process of microbiomes was shown in supplementary information activated sludge used as the representation of nitrifying microbiome nm was obtained from an aeration tank of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant everbright water co ltd jinan shandong china in the domestication process the activated sludge was acclimated in synthetic saline wastewater named as nm 0 in the bioaugmentation process the strain a4n01 was added into activated sludge with a ratio of 25 50 and 75 w w named as nm a nm b and nm c respectively 2 3 batch activity tests of microbiomes batch activity tests were conducted to distinguish nitrogen utilizing the capability of microbiomes the comprehensive nitrogen utilizing capability of microbiomes was examined in am see above the ammonium assimilating capability was examined in am with atu see above the autotrophic nitrifying capability was tested in nitrification medium containing per liter

the test sludge samples of aam for batch activity tests were taken immediately after 90 days of incubation while the seed activated sludge sample was tested 2 4 analytical methods the ammonium nitrite nitrate tn cod tp mixed liquor suspended solid mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss were calculated based on the standard methods federation and association 2005 while the sludge volume index svi was measured with some modifications as described in standard methods federation and association 2005 namely a settling duration of 5 min was applied to replace 30 min turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter 2100 turbidimeter hach sludge was sampled according to previous work li et al 2018a to observe the microstructure and morphology by sem eds jeol jsm 7600f japan elemental analysis was carried out using an elemental analyzer vario el cube elementar germany to analyze the carbon and nitrogen contents of dried samples 2 5 dna extraction and community analysis the genome

alignment tool for functional annotation high throughput sequencing was applied to reveal the compositions of microbial community structures sludge samples were obtained from both aam and nms after 10

to identify different nitrogen removal pathways in sbrs nitrogen functional genes were quantified from genomic dna using qpcr qtower3 g analytic jena ag germany the detailed methods were shown in supplementary information the abundances of nitrogen functional genes were quantified and normalized to copies of the amount of extracted dna copies per ng dna and copies of the volume of the system copies per liter and the mean values were used for charting standard curves were prepared according to the previous study sun et al 2017 2 7 microbial co occurrence network analysis network analysis was conducted to explore the coexistence of bacterial taxa and to reflect similarities and differences in different microbiomes a spearman s rank correlation coefficient matrix was calculated based on the relative abundance of bacterial genera using r v4 0 0 genera with the average relative abundance of 0 1 were selected for spearman s correlation analysis p 0 01 the occurrence networks were

version 20 0 ibm usa principle component analysis pca was conducted with canoco 5 0 microcomputer power usa to examine the relationships between concentrations of nitrogen species and the abundances of nitrogen functional genes 3 results 3 1 isolation and identification of target bacteria the strain hereafter called a4n01 showed granular biofilm formation fig s1 and stable ammonium removal fig 1 a based on the phylogenetic inference of 16s rrna gene sequences fig s2a a4n01 belongs to psychrobacter aquimaris a species that removed nitrogen and formed sedimentary granular biofilms in our previous study huang et al 2018 the genome of a4n01 fig 1b contained genes coding for glutamine synthetase glna glutamine 2 oxoglutarate amidotransferase gltbd and glutamate dehydrogenase gdha which are key enzymes in the gs gogat and the gdh pathways of ammonium assimilation genes coding for urease nitrate reductase and assimilatory nitrite reductase were also detected interestingly representative nitrification genes amoa and nxra coding for ammonia monooxygenase subunit alpha and nitrite oxidoreductase subunit alpha respectively as well as denitrification genes were absent in its genome the strain was predicted to have complete pathways for nitrogen assimilation while ammonia oxidization metabolism was absent in phenotypic analysis 81 1 of ammonium was removed without the detection of nitrite or nitrate production fig 1a ammonium utilization was impervious to the addition of the ammonia oxidation inhibitor allylthiourea atu the results revealed the exclusion of ammonia oxidation from the nitrogen metabolic pathways of a4n01 total nitrogen tn was stable at 59 58 3 04 mg l s d in the experimental system fig 1a the balanced tn between the supernatant and the biomass demonstrated that no gaseous nitrogen was produced in the system furthermore the 15n abundance in cells showed an increase while neither 15n2 or 15n2o was detected in the 15n isotope labeling test table s2 nitrite and urea can also be transformed into intracellular ammonium and further assimilated by this strain fig s2b c although an assimilatory nitrate reductase nasa was encoded in the genome nitrate utilization was not verified in phenotypic analysis fig s2d probably due to the absence of other genes for complete nitrate assimilation moreno vivián et al 1999 ogawa et al 1995 in addition the strain a4n01 was unable to utilize any species of nitrogen under anaerobic or autotrophic conditions fig s2b d as depicted in fig 1c the strain was proven to utilize nitrogen through aerobic heterotrophic ammonium assimilation pathways 3 2 construction of ammonium assimilating microbiomes the construction of ammonium assimilating microbiomes aams was approached following top down design and bottom up design lawson et al 2019 separately fig 5a in the top down design activated sludge as a representative nitrifying microbiome nm was acclimated in synthetic wastewater with high salinity so called domestication in the bottom up design microbiomes were developed using two methods either a4n01 was introduced into activated sludge in different proportions so called bioaugmentation or axenic a4n01 was inoculated alone into synthetic wastewater defined as bottom up assembly and allowed to acclimate surprisingly microbiomes built through bioaugmentation irrespective of initial inoculation dosages of a4n01 showed very similar nitrogen transformation performances with microbiomes built through domestication that exhibited features of ammonia oxidation fig s3 therefore the corresponding microbiomes of both domestication and bioaugmentation were classified as nms and the microbiome constructed by domestication denoted as nm 0 was used as the representative nm for subsequent analyses fortunately an aam was successfully built through a bottom up assembly method 3 3 nitrogen metabolic mechanism of microbiomes in the aam ammonium and tn were synchronously removed without the accumulation of nitrite or nitrate during the 120 days of operation fig 2 a the dominance of ammonium assimilation in nitrogen utilization of the microbiome similar to the case for the pure cultured strain was also verified by batch tests of ammonium oxidation inhibition and tn balancing as well as the 15n isotope labeling test shown in fig 2b and table s2 the abundances of nitrogen functional genes distinctly revealed different fates of ammonium for the assimilation in the aam and the oxidation in nm 0 fig 2c glna was selected to demonstrate the ammonium assimilating pathway in microbiomes hurt et al 2001 the abundances of glna in the aam were relatively high at an average of 3 91 105 0 46 105 s d copies per ng dna 1 80 fold higher than that in nm 0 remarkably the gene abundances of both amoa and nxra representing ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation remained extremely low proving that nitrification is negligible in the aam the decreased abundances of amoa and nxra in nm 0 fig 2c demonstrated the inhibition of ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation by salt stress consistent with the acute salt stress on freshwater derived nitrifiers gonzalez silva et al 2016 however the slight increase in glna abundances in nm 0 suggested that ammonium assimilation was also slightly enhanced by enriched heterotrophic microorganisms during domestication 3 4 microbiome performance the performance of nutrient removal including cod and tp removal fig 2d in the aam was stable throughout the operation the average removal efficiencies of ammonium tn cod and total phosphorus tp were 88 4 6 7 s d 82 6 7 5 s d 98 7 0 9 s d and 84 5 7 9 s d respectively fig 2e after 60 days the average efficiencies of ammonium tn cod and tp were stable at levels as high as 88 9 3 3 s d 89 3 2 8 s d 98 0 0 9 s d and 90 1 2 1 s d respectively the effluent ammonium and tn after 60 days remained as low as 11 03 3 14 mg l s d and 13 17 3 43 mg l s d respectively demonstrating a stable and efficient nitrogen treatment performance in aam furthermore the sludge remained robust as indicated by several indexes of settleability and biomass fig s4 the sludge volume index svi was 24 3 ml g which was comparable to the value for the settling of aerobic granular sludge 25 5 ml g in saline wastewater li et al 2017 the ratio of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss to mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was maintained at 0 68 0 75 indicating that the activity of biomass in the aam remained relatively high corsino et al 2019 the favorable properties of sludge ensured the high settlement performance and biomass retention of functional microbes and were beneficial for the gravity based separation of sludge moreover the elemental analysis revealed that the atomic c n ratio of dried sludge samples was 100 16 2 in the aam energy dispersive spectrometry eds results demonstrated that aam sludge samples contained considerable phosphorus fig s5 these findings suggested that the aam could achieve efficient nutrient removal and recovery in wastewater treatment in contrast nms encountered significant obstacles to nutrient transformation which were divided into two phases in phase i the first 60 days remarkable inhibition of nitrite oxidation was observed with the accumulation of nitrite at 1 2 mm fig s3b this phenomenon was similar to that reported in activated sludge systems gonzalez silva et al 2016 she et al 2016 in phase ii after 60 days the average removal efficiencies of ammonium tn and cod dramatically dropped by 90 6 4 5 s d 66 3 6 3 s d and 97 8 1 1 s d to 60 6 16 4 s d 52 4 12 7 s d and 72 2 14 2 s d respectively which were significantly lower than those of the aam p 0 001 the average removal efficiency of tp remained low at approximately 52 5 6 3 s d in both phases fig 2e the deterioration of nms corresponded to the combined effects of biomass loss fig s4c d caused by the salinity change on microbial communities and the salinity inhibition on nitrogen functional microbes amin et al 2014 he et al 2017 considering the biomass loss in nms the numbers of genes in microbiomes copies per liter were calculated to reveal the relationships between actual performances and nitrogen metabolic pathways and were used in the principal component analysis pca correlations between the nitrogen functional genes and reactive nitrogen concentrations were visually shown by pca of the aam and nms fig 3 a the clear distinction between samples from the aam and nms indicated different ammonium removal mechanisms a negative correlation p 0 05 between the effluent tn concentration and the abundance of glna suggested that ammonium assimilation was directly involved in nitrogen removal in both the aam and nms a positive correlation p 0 05 between the abundances of glna and denitrification genes narg and nirk indicated that the detected glna was partly contributed by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria fig 3b 3 5 microbial structure and interactions time series of microbial structures were analyzed to investigate interactions between the applied strain and environmental microbes in the microbiome the results showed that the species richness and bacterial diversity increased in the aam but decreased in nms confirmed by the chao shannon and simpson indexes fig 4 a fig s6f the increasing diversity in the aam indicated the development of a stable community xun et al 2021 the abundance of psychrobacter rapidly decreased from 100 at the beginning to 53 9 at 10 days and to 0 32 at 40 days and finally stabilized at approximately 0 02 after 60 days fig 4a nevertheless the increasing diversity of microbes in the aam and decreasing abundance of psychrobacter did not significantly affect the nutrient removal performances of the aam fig s7 in addition the increasing diversity of the aam and the slight decrease in glna abundance with time fig 2c demonstrated the involvement of environmental microorganisms without ammonium assimilating ability representative ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob such as nitrosomonas and nitrospira were not detected in the aam echoing former results of extremely low amoa and nxra abundances and nitrification absence bacterial co occurrence networks based on genera were constructed for both the aam fig s8 and nm 0 fig s6c the aam with a higher modularity index 0 687 than nm 0 0 544 indicated a better modular structure in the aam the aam network exhibited a lower proportion of positive associations accounting for 72 1 than nm 0 network accounting for 95 2 suggesting stronger bacterial competition in the aam than in nm 0 most microorganisms detected in the aam are widely classified as heterotrophs genera in module 3 were closely related to psychrobacter which were likely to assimilate ammonium or to form biofilms including bizionia glutamicibacter pseudomonas and pseudoalteromonas however these genera in module 3 did not quantitively dominate the microbial community of the aam genera in module 1 and module 5 including candidatus kaiserbacteria membranicola and gelidibacter presented distribution rates higher than 1 in the aam but extremely low rates in nms fig s6b most bacteria in the above modules have been reported to be closely related to marine environments and sludge from seawater treatment systems deng et al 2021 jiang et al 2019 kim et al 2017 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2015b implying their halophilic metabolism ability most microorganisms detected in the aam are widely classified as heterotrophs these heterotrophs in the aam could compete for substrates with independent metabolism and subsequently contribute to the efficient utilization of nitrogen and other nutrients in the aam natural connectivity analysis is used to reflect the robustness of microbial networks kumar et al 2019 the natural connectivity values of the aam and the bioaugmented activated sludge with the highest proportion of strain a4n01 nm a were higher than the values of other nms it suggested that strain a4n01 played an important role in enhancing the robustness of communities the higher robustness in the aam and nm a could be contributed to the stronger competition of ammonium caused by the introduction of a4n01 since competition among microbes can reinforce the robustness of networks coyte et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of microbiome construction taking advantage of ammonium assimilation is a promising strategy for saline wastewater treatment we develop a methodology for the construction of aam from a functional microbe first we screen a biofilm forming strain belonging to psychrobacter a ubiquitous marine genus bozal et al 2003 koh et al 2017 wang et al 2017a and demonstrate its ability to assimilate ammonium and the corresponding pathway then we build a stable halophilic ammonium assimilating microbiome from this isolate through self assembly with environmental microbes intracellular conversion of assimilated nutrients might contribute to the production of proteins and polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances eps which has been reported to improve cell surface hydrophobicity and help the formation of biofilms huang et al 2018 depicted in fig 5 biofilms in return could provide stabilized and organized habitats for functional microbial consortia to maintain biomass and nutrients flemming and wuertz 2019 benefiting the functional stability of the microbiome in addition polysaccharides and proteins produced by bacteria in biofilms promote soil aggregate stability rashid et al 2016 which may provide a feasible way for the future application of this microbiome in saline soils the self assembly strategy from the ammonium assimilating strain guarantees the directed construction of the desired aam the initial dominance of ammonium assimilation in biofilms depresses ammonia oxidation high salinity and organic loading also exert stress on autotrophic aob ali et al 2020 consequently heterotrophic halophilic bacteria with ammonium assimilating capability stand out from competitors for nitrogen sources during the development of aam confirming our speculation that salinity is a favorable parameter for the establishment of aam interestingly the nitrogen transformation flux in the aam is insusceptible to the decreasing abundances of psychrobacter fig s7 it can be explained by the theory of keystone taxa that keystone taxa can drive the function of microbioal community irrespective of their abundance banerjee et al 2018 that is psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 serving as a keystone taxon selectively enriches accessory microbes with ammonium assimilation capability and or halophilic metabolism moreover biofilms formed by the strain provide a potential for the synthesis of stable and multifunctional microbiomes biofilms which represent the main form of active bacterial organization flemming and wuertz 2019 can offer independent nutrient acquisition and desired environmental adaptability for microbes briefly we provided a method for microbiome construction that microorganisms with capabilities of ammonium assimilation and biofilm formation could be used to build communities with similar functions the domestication and bioaugmentation of nms can hardly construct ammonium assimilating microbiomes mainly due to substrate competition between assimilation and nitrification and the disaggregation of sludge caused by salinity although the strain enhances the robustness of microbiomes the direction of nitrogen metabolism in bioaugmented nms can hardly be reversed to assimilation due to the specific ammonium oxidation rate saor being higher than the specific ammonium assimilation rate saar in nms fig s9 moreover salinity changes microbial community fig s6b and the proliferation of filamentous bacteria wang et al 2016 yu et al 2018 probably resulted in the disaggregation of sludge in nms 4 2 significance of ammonium assimilation in saline environments the successful construction of aam proves the feasibility of realizing nutrient removal and recovery from saline wastewater through microbial ammonium assimilation to date using redox reactions beginning from ammonia oxidation is still the main strategy of bnr in wastewater treatment plants and nitrogen management in agricultural soil beeckman et al 2018 winkler and straka 2019 multiple steps are required in this mainstream bnr van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 to convert nr into gaseous nitrogen which has drawbacks such as nitrogen loss complexity in manipulation and sensitivity to adverse conditions for instance high salinity corsino et al 2019 moussa et al 2006 furthermore greenhouse gases duan et al 2017 such as nitrous oxide and ch4 are usually generated under anaerobic conditions in mainstream bnr in contrast ammonium assimilation as a one or two step metabolic process to assimilate nutrients into biomass under aerobic conditions can be more easily manipulated and optimized therefore ammonium assimilation is the alternative metabolic solution for saline wastewater treatment the microbial ammonium assimilation could also potentially be applied to soils i g microbial fertilizers to alleviate the nitrogen loss from agricultural lands including the leaching of nitrate from nitrification and emission of gaseous nitrogen during denitrification the removal and recovery of nitrogen into biomass can synchronously attenuate the input of nr into ecosystems and the emission of gaseous nitrogen ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2015a nevertheless the role of ammonium assimilation seems to have long been underestimated in previous studies of bnr more than 80 of the nitrogen in wastewater is converted into unreactive n2 and wasted in the atmosphere bodirsky et al 2014 cruz et al 2019 while ammonium assimilation is considered to account for as little as 10 30 of the removed nr in the activated sludge process harms et al 2003 winkler and straka 2019 this estimate should not be empirically applied to saline conditions specialized nitrifiers in mainstream bnr are usually considered obligate chemolithotrophs which are particularly vulnerable in saline environments corsino et al 2019 moussa et al 2006 the nitrogen removal performance of nitrifiers in activated sludge has been reported to be enhanced by an additional carbon source and a high concentration of dissolved oxygen under saline stress corsino et al 2019 however this might contradict the characteristics of nitrifiers as autotrophs and the improved nitrogen removal is more likely to be credited to nitrogen assimilating heterotrophic bacteria our results reveal that activated sludge can also possess a relatively high nitrogen assimilating capability fig s9g therefore ammonium assimilation is likely to be considerable in current bnr systems especially in saline environments as a new strategy for wastewater treatment ammonium assimilation deserves further studies for real application firstly the biomass growth yield is 0 48 0 2 g vss volatile suspended solids g cod in aam similar to the value in the conventional bnr pathway jimenez et al 2015 khursheed and kazmi 2011 the nutrient recovery and reuse of aam sludge may improve the sustainability of this strategy secondly the energy consumption generated by aeration needs to be optimized although the efficient removal of nutrients in aam has been achieved at moderate do concentration corsino et al 2019 pronk et al 2014 wan et al 2014 wang et al 2017b furthermore we speculated that aam shared the similar phosphorus removal mechanism investigated in our previous study in which phosphorus was removed through the metabolic growth of cells and accumulation in eps under aerobic conditions jiang et al 2018 the detailed mechanism is worthy to be investigated in future research in summary we provide a promising route to achieve the recovery of nitrogen from saline wastewater based on microbial ammonium assimilation benefiting from the clear regulation of short chain processes nitrogen management based on ammonium assimilation has great potential for engineering applications thus the environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment can be improved by shifting from the present paradigm of contaminant removal to a paradigm of nutrient recovery we also anticipate that this nature based ecological process can be applied in other fields of artificial nitrogen management including terrestrial saline wastewater treatment control of coastal water pollution and biological remediation of saline soils 5 conclusions an ammonium assimilating microbiome was successfully constructed to reveal the feasibility of ammonium assimilation pathway in saline wastewater treatment we screened a marine bacterium psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 with the biofilm forming capability and constructed an ammonium assimilating microbiome through self assembly of this strain with environmental microorganisms results of nitrogen functional gene abundances and the total nitrogen balance revealed that the microbiome maintained functional stability in ammonium assimilation furthermore this ammonium assimilating microbiome achieved efficient nutrient removal performance that more than 80 of ammonium total nitrogen and total phosphorus were removed and restored into biomass and higher than 98 cod was removed from synthetic saline wastewater the analysis of microbial community demonstrated that the bacterium psychrobater played an important role in maintaining the functional stability of microbiome by enriching heterotrophs and enhancing the robustness of the microbiome declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16523,wastewater with high salinity is one of the major challenges for conventional wastewater treatment although nitrogen management is vital for wastewater treatment efficient strategies for nitrogen recovery and removal from saline wastewater remain challenging here we propose microbial ammonium assimilation to achieve efficient nitrogen removal and recovery into biomass from saline wastewater without gaseous nitrogen release opposite to the conventional wastewater treatment we find one marine bacterium psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 with the ability to form sedimentary granular biofilms that can be engineered to construct an efficient ammonium assimilating microbiome followed the bottom up design we demonstrate that the microbiome removes ammonium through assimilation without reactive nitrogen intermediates and gaseous nitrogen emission according to the functional gene abundance and nitrogen balance more than 80 of ammonium total nitrogen and total phosphorus are removed and recovered into biomass with more than 98 of cod removed from saline wastewater as one prototypic microbe to form ammonium assimilating biofilms psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 plays key role in nutrient metabolism and microbiome construction we stress that ammonium assimilation with a clear and short pathway is a promising method in future saline wastewater treatment and sustainable

it is estimated approximately that 150 185 teragram nitrogen per year tg n year 1 bodirsky et al 2014 steffen et al 2015 of nr has entered the global environment and 125 tg n year 1 is produced by the energy intensive process of haber bosch kuypers et al 2018 the excessive nr input into agriculture inevitably results in the nr waste in soils and the eutrophication of water bodies approximately 20 tg n year 1 of ammonium ends up in wastewater bodirsky et al 2014 winkler and straka 2019 and more than 5 of the global wastewater was accompanied by high salinity he et al 2017 saline wastewater such as seawater flushing seafood processing tannery leaching from saline alkali soils etc usually contains high content of nitrogen corsino et al 2019 the discharge of saline wastewater poses a great threat to the biological wastewater treatment systems resulting in nutrient accumulation in the effluents the excessive nitrogen discharge leads to eutrophication in water bodies and finally threatens coastal ecosystems howarth et al 2011 finding effective nitrogen removal approaches in saline wastewater treatment is still a topic to attenuate the stresses of environmental pollution and water scarcity to achieve a satisfying biological nitrogen removal bnr there is a pressing need to understand the basic mechanisms that underlie microbial nitrogen transformations fundamentally there are two directions of biological nitrogen conversion oxidizing ammonia further into dinitrogen gas and or assimilating ammonium into biomass winkler and straka 2019 processes of nitrification denitrification based on ammonia oxidation is the mainstream strategy for bnr in current wastewater treatment plants winkler and straka 2019 but it becomes vulnerable in severe environments particularly nitrogen removal performance is greatly inhibited under saline conditions with notorious nitrite and nitrate accumulated corsino et al 2019 moussa et al 2006 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is another alternative pathway to achieve nitrogen removal in saline wastewater under low c n ratios li et al 2015 yet the wide application of anammox is challenged for the long doubling time of anammox bacteria and its sensitivity to fluctuations of environmental and water quality such as temperature and high organic carbon loading li et al 2018b yu et al 2019b furthermore either nitrification denitrification or anammox inevitably leads to nitrogen loss and greenhouse effects as to ammonium assimilation ammonium is incorporated into 2 oxoglutarate to produce glutamine catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase gdh or by glutamine synthetase glutamate synthase gs gogat without nitrogen loss this ammonium uptake by heterotrophic bacteria is implied a valuable strategy for nitrogen recovery cruz et al 2019 it has been estimated that the interconversion of ammonium and organic nitrogen quantitatively dominates the biogeochemical nitrogen cycling especially in marine environments kuypers et al 2018 fluxes associated with ammonium assimilation approximately 8800 tg n year 1 are much larger than that associated with nitrogen loss approximately 400 tg n year 1 kuypers et al 2018 in the ocean it can be inferred that the ocean is an abundant pool of bacterial resources for ammonium assimilation and ammonium assimilation by marine bacteria can shed a light on developing a desirable approach to synchronous removal and recovery of nitrogen for refractory saline wastewater treatment although microbial ammonium assimilation has been well studied at the cellular and genetic levels burkovski 2003 van heeswijk et al 2013 ecological and environmental functions are usually performed by microbiomes lawson et al 2019 instead of single cells in the level of microbial community ammonium assimilation has been reported to contribute to partial nitrogen removal but the nr intermediates and nitrogen loss can hardly be avoided and the improvement of ammonium assimilation is hard with the existence of nitrification denitrification pan et al 2020 the construction of ammonium assimilating microbiomes for nitrogen recovery is rarely reported in complex microbiomes the varying affinities for substrates and sensitivity to environmental constraints among different microbial consortia increase the difficulty of targeted artificial manipulation lawson et al 2019 fortunately rational synthesis of microbiomes following bottom up design eng and borenstein 2019 lawson et al 2019 provides a practicable approach to building microbiomes with desired systematic functions starting from a functional microbe as a metabolic basis could be promising in building an ammonium assimilating microbiome for environmental engineering applications but the major challenge of synthetic microbiomes is to maintain functional stability in open systems since the functional microbes are susceptible to invasion by naturally occurring microorganisms and dynamic heterogeneous environments lawson et al 2019 certain spatiotemporal organizations of microbiomes such as biofilms have been considered beneficial to overcoming environmental constraints lawson et al 2019 in wastewater treatment biofilms flocs granules and attached biofilms improve the ability of functional microbes to resist or reconcile the microbial invasion and environmental fluctuations flemming and wuertz 2019 lawson et al 2019 in marine plankton communities attached heterotrophic bacteria show higher single cell nitrogen assimilation rates than free living cells klawonn et al 2019 moreover glutamine and ammonium concentrations are reported to be involved in the development of biofilms liu et al 2015 therefore ammonium assimilating microbes with biofilm forming capability are likely candidates for the construction of microbiomes which could be beneficial for alleviating the salt constrain on nitrogen metabolism marine bacterium psychrobacter has been reported to form granular biofilms which are potential for nutrient removal in our previous study huang et al 2018 however related nitrogen metabolism is unknown and the gap in the application of the pure culture to an engineering microbiome needs to be bridged the aims of this study were to i construct and operate an ammonium assimilating microbiome from a marine bacterium with biofilm forming capability ii reveal the performance and metabolism of nitrogen removal of this microbiome and prove the feasibility of its application in saline wastewater treatment iii investigate the microbial interactions in functional microbes and identify the roles of functional microbes in the stability of this microbiome 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism and media during an open cruise of r v dong fang hong 2 from march 28 to april 14 2017 as previously reported jiang et al 2019 we isolated several strains belonging to psychrobacter from onboard seawater filter membranes as well as in situ sediments from the station a4 122 48 e 35 59 n in the yellow sea china the collected samples were stored in a clean sampling bag and refrigerated at 80 c in the laboratory before incubated into luria bertani lb

c for 24 h in lb medium with a salinity of 3 3 before that 10 v v inoculums were inoculated into different media the strain was further cultivated in ammonium medium nitrite medium nitrate medium and urea medium to investigate its nitrogen utilization mechanism ammonium medium am contained per liter 1000 mg sodium acetate 400 mg kh2po4 33 g seawater crystal 230 mg nh4cl while nh4cl was replaced by 295 mg nano2 430 mg nano3 or 130 mg urea in nitrite medium nitrate medium and urea medium respectively in batch tests to exclude the nitrifying capability 30 mg l 1 allylthiourea atu xu et al 2018 was added into am as the inhibitor of ammonia monooxygenase which could inhibit the activity of both ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonium oxidizing archaea zheng et al 2020 considering the inhibitory effect of aerobic and heterotrophic experimental conditions on anammox bacteria the contribution of anammox bacteria to assimilation was not taken into account concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and total nitrogen tn were monitored to investigate the fate of different nitrogen sources via utilization nitrogen balance was calculated to testify the pathway of ammonium utilization samples with suspended biomass were used for the detection of total nitrogen in systems tn1 while samples after centrifugal were used to detect the total nitrogen in the supernatant tn2 total nitrogen in biomass was obtained via the subtraction calculation of tn1 and tn2 2 2 synthesis and operation of ammonium assimilating microbiomes sequential batch reactors sbrs with unsterilized synthetic wastewater were used to develop ammonium assimilating microbiomes synthetic seawater flushing wastewater was used as a proxy which was typical saline wastewater with a high concentration of

column type sbrs with a working volume of 3 2 l 42 cm in height and 10 cm in diameter were used in this study each sbr was operated with 8 h per cycle that consisted of 5 min feeding 450 min aeration 15 min settling and 10 min decanting the volumetric exchange ratio of each reactor was set at 62 5 corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 8 h the mean sludge retention time srt was 21 d air was introduced through an air diffuser at the bottom of sbr and controlled by a mass flow controller with the dissolved oxygen do at 2 3 mg l 1 mlss was controlled at 10 g l 1 by sludge discharge to ensured high and stable performance the detailed constructing process of microbiomes was shown in supplementary information activated sludge used as the representation of nitrifying microbiome nm was obtained from an aeration tank of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant everbright water co ltd jinan shandong china in the domestication process the activated sludge was acclimated in synthetic saline wastewater named as nm 0 in the bioaugmentation process the strain a4n01 was added into activated sludge with a ratio of 25 50 and 75 w w named as nm a nm b and nm c respectively 2 3 batch activity tests of microbiomes batch activity tests were conducted to distinguish nitrogen utilizing the capability of microbiomes the comprehensive nitrogen utilizing capability of microbiomes was examined in am see above the ammonium assimilating capability was examined in am with atu see above the autotrophic nitrifying capability was tested in nitrification medium containing per liter

the test sludge samples of aam for batch activity tests were taken immediately after 90 days of incubation while the seed activated sludge sample was tested 2 4 analytical methods the ammonium nitrite nitrate tn cod tp mixed liquor suspended solid mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss were calculated based on the standard methods federation and association 2005 while the sludge volume index svi was measured with some modifications as described in standard methods federation and association 2005 namely a settling duration of 5 min was applied to replace 30 min turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter 2100 turbidimeter hach sludge was sampled according to previous work li et al 2018a to observe the microstructure and morphology by sem eds jeol jsm 7600f japan elemental analysis was carried out using an elemental analyzer vario el cube elementar germany to analyze the carbon and nitrogen contents of dried samples 2 5 dna extraction and community analysis the genome

alignment tool for functional annotation high throughput sequencing was applied to reveal the compositions of microbial community structures sludge samples were obtained from both aam and nms after 10 40 60 and 90 days of incubation samples were labeled with the name of microbiomes and sampling times for each sample genomic dna was extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega usa genomic dna

gene sequences of psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 have been deposited at genbank under the accession number mw559216 nitrogen functional genes of psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 have been deposited under

to identify different nitrogen removal pathways in sbrs nitrogen functional genes were quantified from genomic dna using qpcr qtower3 g analytic jena ag germany the detailed methods were shown in supplementary information the abundances of nitrogen functional genes were quantified and normalized to copies of the amount of extracted dna copies per ng dna and copies of the volume of the system copies per liter and the mean values were used for charting standard curves were prepared according to the previous study sun et al 2017 2 7 microbial co occurrence network analysis network analysis was conducted to explore the coexistence of bacterial taxa and to reflect similarities and differences in different microbiomes a spearman s rank correlation coefficient matrix was calculated based on the relative abundance of bacterial genera using r v4 0 0 genera with the average relative abundance of 0 1 were selected for spearman s correlation analysis p 0 01 the occurrence networks were

version 20 0 ibm usa principle component analysis pca was conducted with canoco 5 0 microcomputer power usa to examine the relationships between concentrations of nitrogen species and the abundances of nitrogen functional genes 3 results 3 1 isolation and identification of target bacteria the strain hereafter called a4n01 showed granular biofilm formation fig s1 and stable ammonium removal fig 1 a based on the phylogenetic inference of 16s rrna gene sequences fig s2a a4n01 belongs to psychrobacter aquimaris a species that removed nitrogen and formed sedimentary granular biofilms in our previous study huang et al 2018 the genome of a4n01 fig 1b contained genes coding for glutamine synthetase glna glutamine 2 oxoglutarate amidotransferase gltbd and glutamate dehydrogenase gdha which are key enzymes in the gs gogat and the gdh pathways of ammonium assimilation genes coding for urease nitrate reductase and assimilatory nitrite reductase were also detected interestingly representative nitrification genes amoa and nxra coding for ammonia monooxygenase subunit alpha and nitrite oxidoreductase subunit alpha respectively as well as denitrification genes were absent in its genome the strain was predicted to have complete pathways for nitrogen assimilation while ammonia oxidization metabolism was absent in phenotypic analysis 81 1 of ammonium was removed without the detection of nitrite or nitrate production fig 1a ammonium utilization was impervious to the addition of the ammonia oxidation inhibitor allylthiourea atu the results revealed the exclusion of ammonia oxidation from the nitrogen metabolic pathways of a4n01 total nitrogen tn was stable at 59 58 3 04 mg l s d in the experimental system fig 1a the balanced tn between the supernatant and the biomass demonstrated that no gaseous nitrogen was produced in the system furthermore the 15n abundance in cells showed an increase while neither 15n2 or 15n2o was detected in the 15n isotope labeling test table s2 nitrite and urea can also be transformed into intracellular ammonium and further assimilated by this strain fig s2b c although an assimilatory nitrate reductase nasa was encoded in the genome nitrate utilization was not verified in phenotypic analysis fig s2d probably due to the absence of other genes for complete nitrate assimilation moreno vivián et al 1999 ogawa et al 1995 in addition the strain a4n01 was unable to utilize any species of nitrogen under anaerobic or autotrophic conditions fig s2b d as depicted in fig 1c the strain was proven to utilize nitrogen through aerobic heterotrophic ammonium assimilation pathways 3 2 construction of ammonium assimilating microbiomes the construction of ammonium assimilating microbiomes aams was approached following top down design and bottom up design lawson et al 2019 separately fig 5a in the top down design activated sludge as a representative nitrifying microbiome nm was acclimated in synthetic wastewater with high salinity so called domestication in the bottom up design microbiomes were developed using two methods either a4n01 was introduced into activated sludge in different proportions so called bioaugmentation or axenic a4n01 was inoculated alone into synthetic wastewater defined as bottom up assembly and allowed to acclimate surprisingly microbiomes built through bioaugmentation irrespective of initial inoculation dosages of a4n01 showed very similar nitrogen transformation performances with microbiomes built through domestication that exhibited features of ammonia oxidation fig s3 therefore the corresponding microbiomes of both domestication and bioaugmentation were classified as nms and the microbiome constructed by domestication denoted as nm 0 was used as the representative nm for subsequent analyses fortunately an aam was successfully built through a bottom up assembly method 3 3 nitrogen metabolic mechanism of microbiomes in the aam ammonium and tn were synchronously removed without the accumulation of nitrite or nitrate during the 120 days of operation fig 2 a the dominance of ammonium assimilation in nitrogen utilization of the microbiome similar to the case for the pure cultured strain was also verified by batch tests of ammonium oxidation inhibition and tn balancing as well as the 15n isotope labeling test shown in fig 2b and table s2 the abundances of nitrogen functional genes distinctly revealed different fates of ammonium for the assimilation in the aam and the oxidation in nm 0 fig 2c glna was selected to demonstrate the ammonium assimilating pathway in microbiomes hurt et al 2001 the abundances of glna in the aam were relatively high at an average of 3 91 105 0 46 105 s d copies per ng dna 1 80 fold higher than that in nm 0 remarkably the gene abundances of both amoa and nxra representing ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation remained extremely low proving that nitrification is negligible in the aam the decreased abundances of amoa and nxra in nm 0 fig 2c demonstrated the inhibition of ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation by salt stress consistent with the acute salt stress on freshwater derived nitrifiers gonzalez silva et al 2016 however the slight increase in glna abundances in nm 0 suggested that ammonium assimilation was also slightly enhanced by enriched heterotrophic microorganisms during domestication 3 4 microbiome performance the performance of nutrient removal including cod and tp removal fig 2d in the aam was stable throughout the operation the average removal efficiencies of ammonium tn cod and total phosphorus tp were 88 4 6 7 s d 82 6 7 5 s d 98 7 0 9 s d and 84 5 7 9 s d respectively fig 2e after 60 days the average efficiencies of ammonium tn cod and tp were stable at levels as high as 88 9 3 3 s d 89 3 2 8 s d 98 0 0 9 s d and 90 1 2 1 s d respectively the effluent ammonium and tn after 60 days remained as low as 11 03 3 14 mg l s d and 13 17 3 43 mg l s d respectively demonstrating a stable and efficient nitrogen treatment performance in aam furthermore the sludge remained robust as indicated by several indexes of settleability and biomass fig s4 the sludge volume index svi was 24 3 ml g which was comparable to the value for the settling of aerobic granular sludge 25 5 ml g in saline wastewater li et al 2017 the ratio of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss to mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was maintained at 0 68 0 75 indicating that the activity of biomass in the aam remained relatively high corsino et al 2019 the favorable properties of sludge ensured the high settlement performance and biomass retention of functional microbes and were beneficial for the gravity based separation of sludge moreover the elemental analysis revealed that the atomic c n ratio of dried sludge samples was 100 16 2 in the aam energy dispersive spectrometry eds results demonstrated that aam sludge samples contained considerable phosphorus fig s5 these findings suggested that the aam could achieve efficient nutrient removal and recovery in wastewater treatment in contrast nms encountered significant obstacles to nutrient transformation which were divided into two phases in phase i the first 60 days remarkable inhibition of nitrite oxidation was observed with the accumulation of nitrite at 1 2 mm fig s3b this phenomenon was similar to that reported in activated sludge systems gonzalez silva et al 2016 she et al 2016 in phase ii after 60 days the average removal efficiencies of ammonium tn and cod dramatically dropped by 90 6 4 5 s d 66 3 6 3 s d and 97 8 1 1 s d to 60 6 16 4 s d 52 4 12 7 s d and 72 2 14 2 s d respectively which were significantly lower than those of the aam p 0 001 the average removal efficiency of tp remained low at approximately 52 5 6 3 s d in both phases fig 2e the deterioration of nms corresponded to the combined effects of biomass loss fig s4c d caused by the salinity change on microbial communities and the salinity inhibition on nitrogen functional microbes amin et al 2014 he et al 2017 considering the biomass loss in nms the numbers of genes in microbiomes copies per liter were calculated to reveal the relationships between actual performances and nitrogen metabolic pathways and were used in the principal component analysis pca correlations between the nitrogen functional genes and reactive nitrogen concentrations were visually shown by pca of the aam and nms fig 3 a the clear distinction between samples from the aam and nms indicated different ammonium removal mechanisms a negative correlation p 0 05 between the effluent tn concentration and the abundance of glna suggested that ammonium assimilation was directly involved in nitrogen removal in both the aam and nms a positive correlation p 0 05 between the abundances of glna and denitrification genes narg and nirk indicated that the detected glna was partly contributed by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria fig 3b 3 5 microbial structure and interactions time series of microbial structures were analyzed to investigate interactions between the applied strain and environmental microbes in the microbiome the results showed that the species richness and bacterial diversity increased in the aam but decreased in nms confirmed by the chao shannon and simpson indexes fig 4 a fig s6f the increasing diversity in the aam indicated the development of a stable community xun et al 2021 the abundance of psychrobacter rapidly decreased from 100 at the beginning to 53 9 at 10 days and to 0 32 at 40 days and finally stabilized at approximately 0 02 after 60 days fig 4a nevertheless the increasing diversity of microbes in the aam and decreasing abundance of psychrobacter did not significantly affect the nutrient removal performances of the aam fig s7 in addition the increasing diversity of the aam and the slight decrease in glna abundance with time fig 2c demonstrated the involvement of environmental microorganisms without ammonium assimilating ability representative ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob such as nitrosomonas and nitrospira were not detected in the aam echoing former results of extremely low amoa and nxra abundances and nitrification absence bacterial co occurrence networks based on genera were constructed for both the aam fig s8 and nm 0 fig s6c the aam with a higher modularity index 0 687 than nm 0 0 544 indicated a better modular structure in the aam the aam network exhibited a lower proportion of positive associations accounting for 72 1 than nm 0 network accounting for 95 2 suggesting stronger bacterial competition in the aam than in nm 0 most microorganisms detected in the aam are widely classified as heterotrophs genera in module 3 were closely related to psychrobacter which were likely to assimilate ammonium or to form biofilms including bizionia glutamicibacter pseudomonas and pseudoalteromonas however these genera in module 3 did not quantitively dominate the microbial community of the aam genera in module 1 and module 5 including candidatus kaiserbacteria membranicola and gelidibacter presented distribution rates higher than 1 in the aam but extremely low rates in nms fig s6b most bacteria in the above modules have been reported to be closely related to marine environments and sludge from seawater treatment systems deng et al 2021 jiang et al 2019 kim et al 2017 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2015b implying their halophilic metabolism ability most microorganisms detected in the aam are widely classified as heterotrophs these heterotrophs in the aam could compete for substrates with independent metabolism and subsequently contribute to the efficient utilization of nitrogen and other nutrients in the aam natural connectivity analysis is used to reflect the robustness of microbial networks kumar et al 2019 the natural connectivity values of the aam and the bioaugmented activated sludge with the highest proportion of strain a4n01 nm a were higher than the values of other nms it suggested that strain a4n01 played an important role in enhancing the robustness of communities the higher robustness in the aam and nm a could be contributed to the stronger competition of ammonium caused by the introduction of a4n01 since competition among microbes can reinforce the robustness of networks coyte et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of microbiome construction taking advantage of ammonium assimilation is a promising strategy for saline wastewater treatment we develop a methodology for the construction of aam from a functional microbe first we screen a biofilm forming strain belonging to psychrobacter a ubiquitous marine genus bozal et al 2003 koh et al 2017 wang et al 2017a and demonstrate its ability to assimilate ammonium and the corresponding pathway then we build a stable halophilic ammonium assimilating microbiome from this isolate through self assembly with environmental microbes intracellular conversion of assimilated nutrients might contribute to the production of proteins and polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances eps which has been reported to improve cell surface hydrophobicity and help the formation of biofilms huang et al 2018 depicted in fig 5 biofilms in return could provide stabilized and organized habitats for functional microbial consortia to maintain biomass and nutrients flemming and wuertz 2019 benefiting the functional stability of the microbiome in addition polysaccharides and proteins produced by bacteria in biofilms promote soil aggregate stability rashid et al 2016 which may provide a feasible way for the future application of this microbiome in saline soils the self assembly strategy from the ammonium assimilating strain guarantees the directed construction of the desired aam the initial dominance of ammonium assimilation in biofilms depresses ammonia oxidation high salinity and organic loading also exert stress on autotrophic aob ali et al 2020 consequently heterotrophic halophilic bacteria with ammonium assimilating capability stand out from competitors for nitrogen sources during the development of aam confirming our speculation that salinity is a favorable parameter for the establishment of aam interestingly the nitrogen transformation flux in the aam is insusceptible to the decreasing abundances of psychrobacter fig s7 it can be explained by the theory of keystone taxa that keystone taxa can drive the function of microbioal community irrespective of their abundance banerjee et al 2018 that is psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 serving as a keystone taxon selectively enriches accessory microbes with ammonium assimilation capability and or halophilic metabolism moreover biofilms formed by the strain provide a potential for the synthesis of stable and multifunctional microbiomes biofilms which represent the main form of active bacterial organization flemming and wuertz 2019 can offer independent nutrient acquisition and desired environmental adaptability for microbes briefly we provided a method for microbiome construction that microorganisms with capabilities of ammonium assimilation and biofilm formation could be used to build communities with similar functions the domestication and bioaugmentation of nms can hardly construct ammonium assimilating microbiomes mainly due to substrate competition between assimilation and nitrification and the disaggregation of sludge caused by salinity although the strain enhances the robustness of microbiomes the direction of nitrogen metabolism in bioaugmented nms can hardly be reversed to assimilation due to the specific ammonium oxidation rate saor being higher than the specific ammonium assimilation rate saar in nms fig s9 moreover salinity changes microbial community fig s6b and the proliferation of filamentous bacteria wang et al 2016 yu et al 2018 probably resulted in the disaggregation of sludge in nms 4 2 significance of ammonium assimilation in saline environments the successful construction of aam proves the feasibility of realizing nutrient removal and recovery from saline wastewater through microbial ammonium assimilation to date using redox reactions beginning from ammonia oxidation is still the main strategy of bnr in wastewater treatment plants and nitrogen management in agricultural soil beeckman et al 2018 winkler and straka 2019 multiple steps are required in this mainstream bnr van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 to convert nr into gaseous nitrogen which has drawbacks such as nitrogen loss complexity in manipulation and sensitivity to adverse conditions for instance high salinity corsino et al 2019 moussa et al 2006 furthermore greenhouse gases duan et al 2017 such as nitrous oxide and ch4 are usually generated under anaerobic conditions in mainstream bnr in contrast ammonium assimilation as a one or two step metabolic process to assimilate nutrients into biomass under aerobic conditions can be more easily manipulated and optimized therefore ammonium assimilation is the alternative metabolic solution for saline wastewater treatment the microbial ammonium assimilation could also potentially be applied to soils i g microbial fertilizers to alleviate the nitrogen loss from agricultural lands including the leaching of nitrate from nitrification and emission of gaseous nitrogen during denitrification the removal and recovery of nitrogen into biomass can synchronously attenuate the input of nr into ecosystems and the emission of gaseous nitrogen ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2015a nevertheless the role of ammonium assimilation seems to have long been underestimated in previous studies of bnr more than 80 of the nitrogen in wastewater is converted into unreactive n2 and wasted in the atmosphere bodirsky et al 2014 cruz et al 2019 while ammonium assimilation is considered to account for as little as 10 30 of the removed nr in the activated sludge process harms et al 2003 winkler and straka 2019 this estimate should not be empirically applied to saline conditions specialized nitrifiers in mainstream bnr are usually considered obligate chemolithotrophs which are particularly vulnerable in saline environments corsino et al 2019 moussa et al 2006 the nitrogen removal performance of nitrifiers in activated sludge has been reported to be enhanced by an additional carbon source and a high concentration of dissolved oxygen under saline stress corsino et al 2019 however this might contradict the characteristics of nitrifiers as autotrophs and the improved nitrogen removal is more likely to be credited to nitrogen assimilating heterotrophic bacteria our results reveal that activated sludge can also possess a relatively high nitrogen assimilating capability fig s9g therefore ammonium assimilation is likely to be considerable in current bnr systems especially in saline environments as a new strategy for wastewater treatment ammonium assimilation deserves further studies for real application firstly the biomass growth yield is 0 48 0 2 g vss volatile suspended solids g cod in aam similar to the value in the conventional bnr pathway jimenez et al 2015 khursheed and kazmi 2011 the nutrient recovery and reuse of aam sludge may improve the sustainability of this strategy secondly the energy consumption generated by aeration needs to be optimized although the efficient removal of nutrients in aam has been achieved at moderate do concentration corsino et al 2019 pronk et al 2014 wan et al 2014 wang et al 2017b furthermore we speculated that aam shared the similar phosphorus removal mechanism investigated in our previous study in which phosphorus was removed through the metabolic growth of cells and accumulation in eps under aerobic conditions jiang et al 2018 the detailed mechanism is worthy to be investigated in future research in summary we provide a promising route to achieve the recovery of nitrogen from saline wastewater based on microbial ammonium assimilation benefiting from the clear regulation of short chain processes nitrogen management based on ammonium assimilation has great potential for engineering applications thus the environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment can be improved by shifting from the present paradigm of contaminant removal to a paradigm of nutrient recovery we also anticipate that this nature based ecological process can be applied in other fields of artificial nitrogen management including terrestrial saline wastewater treatment control of coastal water pollution and biological remediation of saline soils 5 conclusions an ammonium assimilating microbiome was successfully constructed to reveal the feasibility of ammonium assimilation pathway in saline wastewater treatment we screened a marine bacterium psychrobacter aquimaris a4n01 with the biofilm forming capability and constructed an ammonium assimilating microbiome through self assembly of this strain with environmental microorganisms results of nitrogen functional gene abundances and the total nitrogen balance revealed that the microbiome maintained functional stability in ammonium assimilation furthermore this ammonium assimilating microbiome achieved efficient nutrient removal performance that more than 80 of ammonium total nitrogen and total phosphorus were removed and restored into biomass and higher than 98 cod was removed from synthetic saline wastewater the analysis of microbial community demonstrated that the bacterium psychrobater played an important role in maintaining the functional stability of microbiome by enriching heterotrophs and enhancing the robustness of the microbiome declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16524,many countries have attempted to monitor and predict harmful algal blooms to mitigate related problems and establish management practices the current alert system based sampling of cell density is used to intimate the bloom status and to inform rapid and adequate response from water associated organizations the objective of this study was to develop an early warning system for cyanobacterial blooms to allow for efficient decision making prior to the occurrence of algal blooms and to guide preemptive actions regarding management practices in this study two machine learning models artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm were constructed for the timely prediction of alert levels of algal bloom using eight years worth of meteorological hydrodynamic and water quality data in a reservoir where harmful cyanobacterial blooms frequently occur during summer however the proportion imbalance on all alert level data as the output variable leads to biased training of the data driven model and degradation of model prediction performance therefore the synthetic data generated by an adaptive synthetic adasyn sampling method were used to resolve the imbalance of minority class data in the original data and to improve the prediction performance of the models the results showed that the overall prediction performance yielded by the caution level l1 and warning level l2 in the models constructed using a combination of original and synthetic data was higher than the models constructed using original data only in particular the optimal ann and svm constructed using a combination of original and synthetic data during both training including validation and test generated distinctively improved recall and precision values of l1 which is a very critical alert level as it indicates a transition status from normalcy to bloom formation in addition both optimal models constructed using synthetic added data exhibited improvement in recall and precision by more than 33 7 while predicting l 1 and l 2 during the test therefore the application of synthetic data can improve detection performance of machine learning models by solving the imbalance of observed data reliable prediction by the improved models can be used to aid the design of management practices to mitigate algal blooms within a reservoir graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal blooms alert level adasyn machine learning early warning 1 introduction algal growth is a common phenomenon in water bodies but excessive algal growth has numerous negative effects on the aquatic ecosystem and public health including massive fish deaths contamination of drinking water e g odor esthetic problems disinfection by products destruction of aquatic habitats and human illness caused by toxins anderson et al 2002 baek et al 2020 barsanti and gualtieri 2014 pyo et al 2018 scheffer et al 1997 zhou et al 2014 the occurrence of harmful algal blooms habs is increased by the rise in water temperature in the reservoir caused by climate change and the increase in anthropogenic nutrient input generated by human activities this is a globally significant concern with respect to water quality management o neil et al 2012 paerl and otten 2013 in north america habs in lake erie have been identified as an environmental problem over the long haul in the public health field harke et al 2016 kane et al 2014 in 1996 acute liver failure was observed in 100 patients in caruaru city brazil additionally 52 patients died from a syndrome caused by cyanobacterial hepatotoxin now called caruaru syndrome azevedo et al 2002 these occurrences suggested that toxic cyanobacteria can be a potential threat to public health by contaminating drinking water furthermore other countries such as france italy u k and china have suffered the social and environmental issues caused by habs in coastal and inland regions hellio et al 2004 liu et al 2010 perrot et al 2014 scanlan et al 2007 viaroli et al 2005 zubia et al 2009 in south korea habs pose the risk of contaminating drinking water owing to an increase in the frequency and intensity of blooms following weir construction on four major rivers in 2012 cha et al 2014 park et al 2017 shin and park 2018 to address water quality problems caused by algal bloom and to allow for rapid response in the event of high level algal bloom including the introduction of toxic substances the algal alert system is used worldwide as proactive management cha et al 2014 newcombe et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2016 in addition in terms of algal bloom monitoring and water quality management this system plays an important role as an indicator that provides monitoring and management action sequence to government officers water quality managers and treatment plant operators izydorczyk et al 2009 the alert level of algal bloom is determined based on cyanobacteria cell density and chlorophyll a chl a concentration numerous studies aimed at predicting this alert level using the cyanobacteria cell density or chl a concentration have been performed using numerical and data driven modeling pyo et al 2019 predicted cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in inland water using the soil and water assessment tool debele et al 2008 simulated chl a using the lagrangian model and scharfe et al 2009 estimated chl a by combining a hydrodynamic and water quality model park et al 2015 predicted chl a concentration for the development of an early warning protocol using machine learning modeling in freshwater park et al 2021 evaluated the availability of the machine learning model to predict the alert level of algal bloom by considering environmental variables such as nutrient and meteorological factors in a freshwater reservoir numerical models can correctly identify causal relationships between algal bloom and water quality parameters but usually require considerable computational resources demeritt and wainwrite 2009 in contrast data driven statistical model can assist in searching specific patterns within a large data set explaining identified patterns identifying correlative relationships between algal blooms and environmental factors and elucidating the effects of those factors on the blooms in addition the data driven model is easier to construct than numerical models demeritt and wainwrite 2009 shiffrin 2016 the data driven model provides a method for addressing the limitations of numerical models and has recently been used to predict chl a concentration and cyanobacteria cell density as well as the algal alert levels of algal bloom park et al 2021 young et al 2018 xiao 2017 however the results of the data driven model particularly a supervised model such as machine learning depends on the quality and quantity of data in the training phase the imbalance of classes in the classification model reduces its capacity to predict the minority class this model predicts instances of the majority class more accurately owing to the machine learning algorithm designed to improve overall model performance chawla et al 2004 guo et al 2008 sun et al 2009 in south korea algal bloom occurrence has been increasing since the construction of multifunctional weirs in four major rivers cha et al 2014 park et al 2017 shin and park 2018 accordingly the korean government operates the algal bloom alert system and reports the algal bloom level estimated using cell density in freshwater jeong et al 2011 however the distribution of four alert levels of algal bloom categorized by cell density is imbalanced because the amount of high cell density data is relatively insufficient that is high cell events occur relatively less frequently shin et al 2021 documented the distribution of alert levels at 13 water quality monitoring stations at the reservoir and reported that the distribution of classes was imbalanced at 9 monitoring stations excluding 4 stations in downstream machine learning models trained using imbalance data can accurately predict the dominant amount of level data whereas the result of prediction for the minimal amount of level data may be inaccurate in water quality management perspectives an increase in the prediction accuracy of high concentration events that occur infrequently can provide more important information than that of low concentration event prediction avila et al 2018 therefore in this study we generated synthetic data for minority classes based on measured data to improve model accuracy and in turn solve the problem of the decreasing predictive accuracy caused by imbalance in data at specific levels in the machine learning model the specific objectives of this study were as follows 1 to collect the water quality hydrodynamic and meteorological data as the input variable and perform statistical analysis to select appropriate input variables 2 to resolve data imbalance by applying synthetic data generated based on monitoring data 3 to develop the algal bloom alert system focusing on cyanobacteria cell density using the machine learning models including artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm 2 methods 2 1 site description gangjeong goryeong reservoir ggr 35 50 24 85 n and 128 27 37 56 e located in nackdong river ndr in south korea fig 1 was established by the four major rivers restoration project to prevent flooding and secure water resources three water intake stations are located 4 km 7 km and 9 km upstream of the dam gate in ggr respectively further two water intake stations supply approximately 530 000 m3 water per day to drinking water treatment plants and one station supplies approximately 86 000 m3 water per day to an industrial water treatment plant fig 1 approximately 1 6 million people 67 in daegu metropolitan city use the treated water thus water quality deterioration in the ggr may be a critical issue for the use of drinking water and for maintaining the public health in surrounding cities ggr consists of two rising sector gates each gate 120 m wide and 11 6 m high one overflow weir 833 5 m wide and 11 5 m high a small scale hydropower plant and two fishways mywater the watershed area and total storage capacity are 11 667 km2 and 92 3 million m3 respectively the range of permissible water level to manage water storage ranges from 20 00 to 14 90 m mywater the river morphology and flow regime were changed after construction of the weir thereby widening the cross sectional area increasing water depth and increasing flow retention time cha et al 2011 jun and kim 2011 molit 2009 moreover habs were induced more frequently yi et al 2018 and the bloom outbreak was expended to midstream and upstream kang et al 2016 2 2 data acquisition the concentration of chl a cell density of cyanobacteria and water quality data in ggr were collected by the korea ministry of environment the monitoring station is located 500 m upstream of the dam gate in ggr and general weekly monitoring events were conducted for eight years from 2013 to 2020 the sampling interval ranged from 4 to 29 days owing to irregular sampling by the management office and average sampling interval was 7 4 days the water quality data consisted of conductivity dissolved total nitrogen dtn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n dissolved total phosphorus dtp and phosphate phosphorus po4 p data table 1 the daily meteorological data such as air temperature precipitation and wind speed were monitored at the nearest 15 3 km weather station from ggr by the korea meteorological administration the daily hydrodynamic data including water level inflow rate total discharge rate and discharge rate by hydropower plant were measured by the korea water resource corporation daily hydrodynamic and meteorological data were averaged or accumulated between the water quality monitoring events in terms of the variable characteristics table 1 for example inflow represented the averaged flow rate to the reservoir between the different water quality monitoring events in addition the interval in days between water quality monitoring events was used as an input variable to consider the time lag effect in this study we predicted alert levels of algal bloom using two machine learning models the alert levels as a response variable were divided into three levels based on cyanobacteria cell density as follows normal level 1000 cells ml 1 l 0 caution level 1000 cells ml 1 and 10 000 cells ml 1 l 1 and warning level 10 000 cells ml 1 and 1000 000 cells ml 1 l 2 this classification standard is similar to the algal bloom alert system in south korea nier 2017 all these data present the data acquisition process fig 2 a 2 3 generation of synthetic data the prediction accuracy depends on the amount and quality of the dataset in the data driven model such as machine learning particularly imbalanced distribution leads to biased learning in the machine learning model and adversely affects prediction performance in the model xu et al 2020 because the model focuses more on the prevalent class than on rare events japkowicz and stephen 2002 in this study a total of 390 cyanobacterial cell data were obtained in ggr and the number of alert levels was set to 210 for l 0 53 8 87 for l 1 22 4 and 93 for l 2 23 8 respectively the level data were imbalanced this imbalance was maintained continuously after randomly separating the data into training validation and test datasets hence the adaptive synthetic sampling adasyn method was used to solve the imbalance in these data during training and validation the adasyn method is based on adaptively generating minority data l 1 and l 2 in this study according to their distribution he et al 2008 the original and generated synthetic data for l 1 and l 2 by adasyn was balanced and was used to improve model performance fig 2 e the synthetic data generation process is as follows 1 calculation of the number of synthetic data using eqn 1 1 g m l m s β where g is the total number of synthetic data for the minority class m s is the number of minority data l 1 and l 2 in this study m l is the number of majority data l 0 and β is a parameter used to generate the synthetic data in this study β 1 indicating the generation of a fully balanced data set 2 for each minority sample x i k nearest neighbors are identified using the euclidean distance in 12 dimensional number of factors space and the r i ratio is calculated using eqn 2 2 r i δ i k i 1 m s where δ i is the number of minority samples in the generated cluster from x i by k number of nearest neighbors k 5 and k is the total number of samples in a cluster 3 r i is normalized using eqn 3 3 r i r i i 1 m s r i 4 the number of synthetic data samples that need to be generated for each cyanobacteria cell density data x i is calculated using eqn 4 4 g i r i g 5 synthetic data for each minority class data from 1 to g i are generated using eqn 5 5 s i x i x z i x i α where x z i is a randomly selected minority data from the k nearest neighbors for data x i and α is a random number ranging from 0 to 1 2 4 construction of machine learning models ann and svm were used to predict the alert level of algal bloom these models have been used to forecast specific phenomenon and interpret complex relationships in the environment and boast powerful computational techniques chatterjee et al 2017 mirzaei et al 2020 the structure of the two models is described in appendix a in the supplementary material fig 2 shows the flowchart of the overall process including data preparation and construction of two machine learning models in this study first we collected water quality hydrodynamic and meteorological data fig 2 a and determined the input variables using the statistical dependence test that can identify the relationship between the input and output variables fig 2 b simple linear regression was used to test the statistical dependence between variables croxton and cowden 1939 the positive or negative dependence was distinguished via statistical significance 0 05 table 1 shows the 14 input variables selected to predict the alert level of algal bloom using two machine learning models the average values of daily temperature wind speed water level and discharge of hydropower were applied during the interval time of water quality sampling and the accumulation value was applied in daily precipitation second to predict alert levels in future using the current measured input variable we modified input and output values fig 2 c in other words the measured output value was matched with the measured input values at the previous sampling event the time interval was approximately seven days because water quality was generally monitored once a week in south korea therefore the output value was shifted to the input values before the average period of one week this preprocessing of the dataset allows for the training of the two machine learning models to predict the future output value using current input values third as a preliminary phase for constructing two models all datasets were randomly classified into training 60 validation 20 and test datasets 20 fig 2 d we generated the dataset comprising a combination of the original training and validation data and synthetic training and validation data fig 2 e we added the synthetic data only to the data used for the training and validation steps and excluded the data for the test step the original and synthetic added datasets including training and validation data were used to train the ann and svm models and to optimize their hyperparameters fig 2 f the test datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the two models that were constructed using original and synthetic added datasets fig 2 g the ann and svm models for predicting the algal bloom alert levels used on an average 509 datasets 313 monitoring data sets and 196 average synthetic data sets for eight years the two machine learning models were optimized using five hyper parameters fig 2 f the activation function of a hidden layer in ann and the kernel function in svm were optimized experimentally the number of hidden neurons in ann box constraint and kernel scale in svm were optimized using a pattern search algorithm the activation function of the output layer was softmax function finally we compared the performance of the two models based on the application of original and synthetic added data using a confusion matrix fig 2 g the analysis of statistics construction of two machine learning models and optimization of models were performed using matlab mathworks inc 2 5 evaluation of overall model accuracy we selected the optimized model in 200 iterations model run and calculated the average accuracy of all models to evaluate the overall performance of the two machine learning models to verify the necessity of non linear models a logistic regression model lrm which is a representative linear classification algorithm was constructed using the same input variables as the variables used in the two machine learning models subsequently the performance of the three models were compared the classification performance of models with respect to the predicted and observed alert levels of algal bloom was evaluated using the confusion matrix see appendix b and fig s1 in the supplementary material the accuracy recall and precision of the model were calculated as class statistics the accuracy is commonly used to measure the performance of the model and is defined as a ratio between the correct prediction and the total number of data the recall represents the positive class detecting degree of the model for total instances by the classifier the precision is obtained by determining the proportion of the positive instances that were correctly predicted to the total number of positive prediction data sokolova and lapalme 2009 hossin and sulaiman 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive analysis of cyanobacterial and total nutrient variables the tn and tp ranged from 1 129 to 4 1 mg l and 0 01 to 0 253 mg l respectively table 2 the total nitrogen tn to total phosphorus tp mass ratio ranged from 15 08 to 867 05 based on the nutrient limit criteria nitrogen limited to tn tp 29 1 by mass and phosphorus limited to tn tp 29 1 by mass by the mass ratio smith 1983 ggr was observed to be a phosphorus limited reservoir most mass ratio values were more than 29 except for two events the trophic state index which was used to classify biological productivity in receiving water bodies using chl a and tp showed that ggr maintained eutrophic conditions chl a 7 2 mg l tp 0 024 mg l the criteria of eutrophic conditions ranged from 7 2 to 55 mg l for chl a to 0 024 0 096 mg l for tp average and median values of tp concentration were 0 053 mg l and 0 045 mg l from may to november which are productive periods average and median values of chl a concentration during the same period were 15 31 mg l and 11 15 mg l in these conditions algal blooms occur frequently and cyanobacteria is the dominant taxa joung et al 2011 srivastava et al 2015 park et al 2017 moreover the excess nutrients can accelerate the cyanobacteria bloom when the water temperature increases park et al 2017 in ggr the caution and warning levels yielded by the algal bloom alert system were usually announced during may to november and amounted to 164 91 events table 2 the formation of cyanobacteria bloom is most actively generated in the reservoir during the summer from june to september in south korea which is in east asia and exhibits monsoon climate characteristics cha et al 2014 microcystis and dolichospermum were dominant cyanobacterial genera during the same period kim et al 2005 3 2 selection of input variables and generation of synthetic data the statistical dependence test was applied to identify linear dependence between the cyanobacteria cell density and each input variable except the interval variable table 1 and fig s2 show the results of the dependence test 12 variables had statistically important linear dependences with the cell density of cyanobacteria the cell density was positively correlated with 7 variables such as nh4 n tdp po4 p inflow discharge atemp and precip and negatively correlated with 5 variables such as tdn no3 n cond wlevel and dhydro various variable selection strategies using linear and non linear methods can be applied to determine suitable input variables may et al 2011 in the future comparison studies between the methods can assist in constructing robust machine learning models finally 13 variables including the water quality monitoring interval were selected as input variables to predict the alert level of algal bloom using statistical models in ggr the data imbalance was improved using the adasyn fig s3 a shows the distribution of the algal bloom alert level in the original data during training and validation the skewed distribution of class influences the estimation for the object of interest using the classification model in addition model accuracy is inappropriate because scarcity of data translates to poor estimation of the model accuracy menardi and torelli 2014 fig s3 b shows the distribution of the synthetic added dataset during the training phase 87 and 85 synthetic data were added to the original data of l 1 and l 2 respectively this approach mitigates the loss of useful information and overfitting problems caused by duplicated oversampling via the artificial generation of synthetic data xu et al 2020 besides the adasyn there are various resampling methods that use undersampling and oversampling techniques comparison of the adasyn with other approaches may be helpful to validate the effectiveness of the methods for handling dataset imbalances this can be considered as a future research topic 3 3 optimization of two machine learning models to predict alert levels of algal bloom we selected individually optimized ann and svm models that most accurately predict alert levels of algal bloom via 200 iterative simulations that is 200 differently optimized ann and svm models were constructed table 3 presents the descriptive results of the optimized parameters of the ann and svm models under 200 randomly selected data and the optimal parameter for the optimal ann and svm models in the ann the optimized activation function for the model using original data and for the model using the synthetic added data was log sigmoid the sigmoidal type functions including tangent sigmoid were most commonly used as an activation function of the ann model maier and dandy 2000 zadeh et al 2010 in addition the log and tangent sigmoid functions were mostly employed to consider the nonlinear relationship between input and output variables haykin 1999 the number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer was optimized to 20 for the ann model constructed using original dataset and to 13 for the ann model constructed using the synthetic added dataset the hidden neurons were determined to range between 1 and 23 this range was calculated using input variables the maximum number of hidden neurons is 2n 1 and n is the number of variables hecht nielsen 1987 in addition the range of the number of hidden neurons was similar to that of previous studies kişi 2008 nourani et al 2009 in the svm model the kernel function of the optimal models using both original data and synthetic added data was selected as gaussian radial basis generally the accuracy of the svm model for class prediction can be improved by applying the polynomial kernel function compared with other kernel functions such as the linear and gaussian kernel functions savas and dovis 2019 however the kernel function must be determined via comparison of data patle and chouhan 2013 our results showed that the gaussian radial basis function was selected by the optimal model using original data and synthetic added data after 200 iterations the gaussian radial basis function resulted in the highest percentage of 88 and 62 for original data and synthetic added data respectively 3 4 comparison of model performance the lrm results were compared for the two machine learning models to discuss the needs of non linear learning algorithms in the case of l 1 the lrm showed higher predictive performance than the svm when the original data was used whereas it showed lower performance than ann during training including validation and the test however the lrm showed the lowest performance among the three models when synthetic added data was used in both overall and optimal model results figs s4 a and b whereas the overall performance of the lrm for l 2 was relatively stable in terms of data types and learning steps the lrm had the lowest predictive performance for l 2 in both models using original and synthetic added data during the test figs s4 c and d therefore non linear machine learning may be needed to construct the accurate classification model in this study overall ann showed optimum and stable performance and the machine learning models showed better performance than lrm when synthetic added data were applied figs 3 and 4 show 4 general confusion matrices obtained from 200 iterations according to the type of model and data training including validation results present recall and precision values for training and validation datasets the row and column in the confusion matrix depict the averaged instances in the prediction and observation of the alert level of algal blooms in the ann model using original data two upper panels in fig 3 the trained and tested model showed distinct differences for both overall recall and precision values the model constructed using original dataset showed poor performance values in the test whereas the model constructed with the synthetic added dataset showed higher test performance values and was more optimized in terms of precision and recall than the model constructed using the original dataset bottom two panels in fig 3 the average recall and precision values for both l 1 and l 2 in the model with the original dataset were 48 1 and 48 2 during the test respectively whereas that of the model with the synthetic added dataset were 79 1 and 77 1 during the test respectively conversely the average recall and precision values of the overall svm model during the training and test did not differ considerably between original and synthetic added data except for the recall value for l 1 fig 4 improvement of recall performance for l 1 between the original and synthetic added data was higher than that in the ann model the recall values of svm were increased from 5 0 to 67 6 in the training and 2 4 to 61 0 in the test due to the use of synthetic added data but the average recall performance for l 0 in the training and test decreased from 94 4 to 66 2 fig 4 the application of synthetic added data led to remarkable improvement of test performance for l 1 and l 2 in the ann model and l 1 in the svm figs 5 and 6 show confusion matrices for the result of the optimal ann and svm models with the original and synthetic added datasets the training including validation results present recall and precision values for training and validation datasets similar to overall results the ann model performance was considerably improved by the synthetic added data compared to the original data especially in recall and precision values for l 1 and l 2 in the test fig 5 the optimized model showed recall improvements of 35 3 for l 1 and 33 3 for l 2 and precision improvements of 36 6 for l 1 and 29 7 for l 2 in the test average improvement for recall and precision was 13 5 for l 0 in the optimized svm model fig 6 recall and precision values for l 1 in the test were distinctively higher in the synthetic added data than in the original data whereas recall value for l 0 decreased from 90 5 to 71 4 based on the comparison of misclassification of l 1 caution level as l 0 normal level between original and synthetic added data in the test the ann decreased from 50 0 to 13 3 in iterative runs fig 3 and from 16 7 to 0 in the optimized run fig 5 the svm model decreased in the misclassification from 100 to 16 7 in iterative runs fig 4 and from 100 to 7 14 in the optimized run fig 6 both models constructed using the synthetic added data yielded higher classification performance than those using the original data figs 3 6 and table 4 according to the comparison between the performances of the ann and svm models all performance indexes in the training including validation and test were higher in the ann than in the svm for both overall runs and the best run table 4 therefore the ann model is suitable for predicting the alert level of algal bloom accurate prediction of l 1 1000 cells ml 1 is critical because this level may be an initial phase in the formation of algal blooms l 1 may be a very important transition status from normalcy to bloom formation maier and dandy 1997 reported that the density above 1000 cells ml 1 greatly increased the probability of algal blooms moreover they reported that the excess density caused discoloration and an unpleasant odor thereby leading to esthetic problems in the water they used the cell number 1000 cells ml 1 to determine the significance of the annual growth of cyanobacteria the performance discrepancy between l 0 and l 1 was higher in the model using the original dataset than in that using the synthetic added dataset this difference resulting from the model s focus on l 0 rather than l 1 can cause low statistical reliability of the model in terms of accuracy evaluation menardi and torelli 2014 the selection of data and model type may be crucial factors in the prediction of issues and improvement of model accuracy beigi et al 2014 cawley and talbot 2010 moreover probability of misclassifying l 1 as l 0 in test was significantly higher when original data were used compared to when synthetic added data were used this underestimation may be severe with respect to conducting management tasks because the normal level l 0 cannot reveal and transfer danger in the alert system in terms of algal bloom monitoring and water quality management improvement in caution l 1 and warning l 2 level prediction is more efficiently applicable than accurate prediction of the normal level l 0 in the alert level of algal bloom in this study we provided a series of processes for forecasting the alert level of algal blooms after one week and improving the prediction of each alert level from imbalanced data in south korea the algal bloom alert system has been geared toward protecting the drinking water resource in streams since 1998 jeong et al 2011 shin et al 2016 the algal bloom alert system is operated by the ministry of environment in south korea to protect public health from cyanotoxin and to supply fresh water to water intake and purification plants moe 2011 as the alert level raised to l 1 or l 2 the management and government offices applied measures such as controlling nearby pollutants prohibiting water activities and installing barriers against algal bloom to reduce it moe 2011 the collection of water and identification of cyanobacteria cell density are essential to identifying the alert level of algal bloom however these activities are limited by high costs and the need for extensive labor therefore early warning by the machine learning may a useful alternative for rapid response and effective management plans with respect to algal blooms for example past studies reported that the current chl a concentration was influenced by chl a concentration before one week and the prediction of chl a concentration yielded the highest accuracy in the short term within 7 day lee et al 2003 2005 park et al 2015 the results of this study can be utilized as a precommitment strategy to secure safe drinking water in treatment plants to control pollutants in terms of watershed management and to prepare water treatment processes in purification steps 4 conclusions this study describes a series of processes for predicting the alert level of algal blooms using cyanobacteria cell density in ggr the synthetic added dataset by the adaptive synthetic sampling adasyn based on observed data were used to construct two machine learning models because the distribution of observed data was essential from this study the following major conclusions were drawn the selection of appropriate variables may improve the accuracy of a machine learning model because the selection may reduce the model complexity caused by an increase in the number of input variables weights and bias in a learning process however various linear and non linear variable selection methods may be useful to construct the robust machine learning models for addressing classification problems and can be considered for conducting future research synthetic added data considerably improved the prediction of alert levels of algal bloom using the two machine learning models the synthetic data by adasyn can effectively avoid biased learning in training networks and solve the problem of data imbalance moreover selecting a proper resampling method as a future study may be helpful to validate the effectiveness of the adasyn for handling imbalanced datasets balanced data by the adasyn increased the performance of the two machine learning models but the performance of the logistic regression model was not definitely changed therefore it is necessary to evaluate the availability of synthetic data in terms of different model types such as linear and non linear models for prediction this study provided a prediction model for the alert level of algal bloom using the machine learning method and the data from a national monitoring station which are relatively easy to collect in a reservoir in terms of establishing strategies and regulations the proposed model is expected to be readily useful for construction and

16524,many countries have attempted to monitor and predict harmful algal blooms to mitigate related problems and establish management practices the current alert system based sampling of cell density is used to intimate the bloom status and to inform rapid and adequate response from water associated organizations the objective of this study was to develop an early warning system for cyanobacterial blooms to allow for efficient decision making prior to the occurrence of algal blooms and to guide preemptive actions regarding management practices in this study two machine learning models artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm were constructed for the timely prediction of alert levels of algal bloom using eight years worth of meteorological hydrodynamic and water quality data in a reservoir where harmful cyanobacterial blooms frequently occur during summer however the proportion imbalance on all alert level data as the output variable leads to biased training of the data driven model and degradation of model prediction performance therefore the synthetic data generated by an adaptive synthetic adasyn sampling method were used to resolve the imbalance of minority class data in the original data and to improve the prediction performance of the models the results showed that the overall prediction performance yielded by the caution level l1 and warning level l2 in the models constructed using a combination of original and synthetic data was higher than the models constructed using original data only in particular the optimal ann and svm constructed using a combination of original and synthetic data during both training including validation and test generated distinctively improved recall and precision values of l1 which is a very critical alert level as it indicates a transition status from normalcy to bloom formation in addition both optimal models constructed using synthetic added data exhibited improvement in recall and precision by more than 33 7 while predicting l 1 and l 2 during the test therefore the application of synthetic data can improve detection performance of machine learning models by solving the imbalance of observed data reliable prediction by the improved models can be used to aid the design of management practices to mitigate algal blooms within a reservoir graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal blooms alert level adasyn machine learning early warning 1 introduction algal growth is a common phenomenon in water bodies but excessive algal growth has numerous negative effects on the aquatic ecosystem and public health including massive fish deaths contamination of drinking water e g odor esthetic problems disinfection by products destruction of aquatic habitats and human illness caused by toxins anderson et al 2002 baek et al 2020 barsanti and gualtieri 2014 pyo et al 2018 scheffer et al 1997 zhou et al 2014 the occurrence of harmful algal blooms habs is increased by the rise in water temperature in the reservoir caused by climate change and the increase in anthropogenic nutrient input generated by human activities this is a globally significant concern with respect to water quality management o neil et al 2012 paerl and otten 2013 in north america habs in lake erie have been identified as an environmental problem over the long haul in the public health field harke et al 2016 kane et al 2014 in 1996 acute liver failure was observed in 100 patients in caruaru city brazil additionally 52 patients died from a syndrome caused by cyanobacterial hepatotoxin now called caruaru syndrome azevedo et al 2002 these occurrences suggested that toxic cyanobacteria can be a potential threat to public health by contaminating drinking water furthermore other countries such as france italy u k and china have suffered the social and environmental issues caused by habs in coastal and inland regions hellio et al 2004 liu et al 2010 perrot et al 2014 scanlan et al 2007 viaroli et al 2005 zubia et al 2009 in south korea habs pose the risk of contaminating drinking water owing to an increase in the frequency and intensity of blooms following weir construction on four major rivers in 2012 cha et al 2014 park et al 2017 shin and park 2018 to address water quality problems caused by algal bloom and to allow for rapid response in the event of high level algal bloom including the introduction of toxic substances the algal alert system is used worldwide as proactive management cha et al 2014 newcombe et al 2010 zamyadi et al 2016 in addition in terms of algal bloom monitoring and water quality management this system plays an important role as an indicator that provides monitoring and management action sequence to government officers water quality managers and treatment plant operators izydorczyk et al 2009 the alert level of algal bloom is determined based on cyanobacteria cell density and chlorophyll a chl a concentration numerous studies aimed at predicting this alert level using the cyanobacteria cell density or chl a concentration have been performed using numerical and data driven modeling pyo et al 2019 predicted cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in inland water using the soil and water assessment tool debele et al 2008 simulated chl a using the lagrangian model and scharfe et al 2009 estimated chl a by combining a hydrodynamic and water quality model park et al 2015 predicted chl a concentration for the development of an early warning protocol using machine learning modeling in freshwater park et al 2021 evaluated the availability of the machine learning model to predict the alert level of algal bloom by considering environmental variables such as nutrient and meteorological factors in a freshwater reservoir numerical models can correctly identify causal relationships between algal bloom and water quality parameters but usually require considerable computational resources demeritt and wainwrite 2009 in contrast data driven statistical model can assist in searching specific patterns within a large data set explaining identified patterns identifying correlative relationships between algal blooms and environmental factors and elucidating the effects of those factors on the blooms in addition the data driven model is easier to construct than numerical models demeritt and wainwrite 2009 shiffrin 2016 the data driven model provides a method for addressing the limitations of numerical models and has recently been used to predict chl a concentration and cyanobacteria cell density as well as the algal alert levels of algal bloom park et al 2021 young et al 2018 xiao 2017 however the results of the data driven model particularly a supervised model such as machine learning depends on the quality and quantity of data in the training phase the imbalance of classes in the classification model reduces its capacity to predict the minority class this model predicts instances of the majority class more accurately owing to the machine learning algorithm designed to improve overall model performance chawla et al 2004 guo et al 2008 sun et al 2009 in south korea algal bloom occurrence has been increasing since the construction of multifunctional weirs in four major rivers cha et al 2014 park et al 2017 shin and park 2018 accordingly the korean government operates the algal bloom alert system and reports the algal bloom level estimated using cell density in freshwater jeong et al 2011 however the distribution of four alert levels of algal bloom categorized by cell density is imbalanced because the amount of high cell density data is relatively insufficient that is high cell events occur relatively less frequently shin et al 2021 documented the distribution of alert levels at 13 water quality monitoring stations at the reservoir and reported that the distribution of classes was imbalanced at 9 monitoring stations excluding 4 stations in downstream machine learning models trained using imbalance data can accurately predict the dominant amount of level data whereas the result of prediction for the minimal amount of level data may be inaccurate in water quality management perspectives an increase in the prediction accuracy of high concentration events that occur infrequently can provide more important information than that of low concentration event prediction avila et al 2018 therefore in this study we generated synthetic data for minority classes based on measured data to improve model accuracy and in turn solve the problem of the decreasing predictive accuracy caused by imbalance in data at specific levels in the machine learning model the specific objectives of this study were as follows 1 to collect the water quality hydrodynamic and meteorological data as the input variable and perform statistical analysis to select appropriate input variables 2 to resolve data imbalance by applying synthetic data generated based on monitoring data 3 to develop the algal bloom alert system focusing on cyanobacteria cell density using the machine learning models including artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm 2 methods 2 1 site description gangjeong goryeong reservoir ggr 35 50 24 85 n and 128 27 37 56 e located in nackdong river ndr in south korea fig 1 was established by the four major rivers restoration project to prevent flooding and secure water resources three water intake stations are located 4 km 7 km and 9 km upstream of the dam gate in ggr respectively further two water intake stations supply approximately 530 000 m3 water per day to drinking water treatment plants and one station supplies approximately 86 000 m3 water per day to an industrial water treatment plant fig 1 approximately 1 6 million people 67 in daegu metropolitan city use the treated water thus water quality deterioration in the ggr may be a critical issue for the use of drinking water and for maintaining the public health in surrounding cities ggr consists of two rising sector gates each gate 120 m wide and 11 6 m high one overflow weir 833 5 m wide and 11 5 m high a small scale hydropower plant and two fishways mywater the watershed area and total storage capacity are 11 667 km2 and 92 3 million m3 respectively the range of permissible water level to manage water storage ranges from 20 00 to 14 90 m mywater the river morphology and flow regime were changed after construction of the weir thereby widening the cross sectional area increasing water depth and increasing flow retention time cha et al 2011 jun and kim 2011 molit 2009 moreover habs were induced more frequently yi et al 2018 and the bloom outbreak was expended to midstream and upstream kang et al 2016 2 2 data acquisition the concentration of chl a cell density of cyanobacteria and water quality data in ggr were collected by the korea ministry of environment the monitoring station is located 500 m upstream of the dam gate in ggr and general weekly monitoring events were conducted for eight years from 2013 to 2020 the sampling interval ranged from 4 to 29 days owing to irregular sampling by the management office and average sampling interval was 7 4 days the water quality data consisted of conductivity dissolved total nitrogen dtn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n dissolved total phosphorus dtp and phosphate phosphorus po4 p data table 1 the daily meteorological data such as air temperature precipitation and wind speed were monitored at the nearest 15 3 km weather station from ggr by the korea meteorological administration the daily hydrodynamic data including water level inflow rate total discharge rate and discharge rate by hydropower plant were measured by the korea water resource corporation daily hydrodynamic and meteorological data were averaged or accumulated between the water quality monitoring events in terms of the variable characteristics table 1 for example inflow represented the averaged flow rate to the reservoir between the different water quality monitoring events in addition the interval in days between water quality monitoring events was used as an input variable to consider the time lag effect in this study we predicted alert levels of algal bloom using two machine learning models the alert levels as a response variable were divided into three levels based on cyanobacteria cell density as follows normal level 1000 cells ml 1 l 0 caution level 1000 cells ml 1 and 10 000 cells ml 1 l 1 and warning level 10 000 cells ml 1 and 1000 000 cells ml 1 l 2 this classification standard is similar to the algal bloom alert system in south korea nier 2017 all these data present the data acquisition process fig 2 a 2 3 generation of synthetic data the prediction accuracy depends on the amount and quality of the dataset in the data driven model such as machine learning particularly imbalanced distribution leads to biased learning in the machine learning model and adversely affects prediction performance in the model xu et al 2020 because the model focuses more on the prevalent class than on rare events japkowicz and stephen 2002 in this study a total of 390 cyanobacterial cell data were obtained in ggr and the number of alert levels was set to 210 for l 0 53 8 87 for l 1 22 4 and 93 for l 2 23 8 respectively the level data were imbalanced this imbalance was maintained continuously after randomly separating the data into training validation and test datasets hence the adaptive synthetic sampling adasyn method was used to solve the imbalance in these data during training and validation the adasyn method is based on adaptively generating minority data l 1 and l 2 in this study according to their distribution he et al 2008 the original and generated synthetic data for l 1 and l 2 by adasyn was balanced and was used to improve model performance fig 2 e the synthetic data generation process is as follows 1 calculation of the number of synthetic data using eqn 1 1 g m l m s β where g is the total number of synthetic data for the minority class m s is the number of minority data l 1 and l 2 in this study m l is the number of majority data l 0 and β is a parameter used to generate the synthetic data in this study β 1 indicating the generation of a fully balanced data set 2 for each minority sample x i k nearest neighbors are identified using the euclidean distance in 12 dimensional number of factors space and the r i ratio is calculated using eqn 2 2 r i δ i k i 1 m s where δ i is the number of minority samples in the generated cluster from x i by k number of nearest neighbors k 5 and k is the total number of samples in a cluster 3 r i is normalized using eqn 3 3 r i r i i 1 m s r i 4 the number of synthetic data samples that need to be generated for each cyanobacteria cell density data x i is calculated using eqn 4 4 g i r i g 5 synthetic data for each minority class data from 1 to g i are generated using eqn 5 5 s i x i x z i x i α where x z i is a randomly selected minority data from the k nearest neighbors for data x i and α is a random number ranging from 0 to 1 2 4 construction of machine learning models ann and svm were used to predict the alert level of algal bloom these models have been used to forecast specific phenomenon and interpret complex relationships in the environment and boast powerful computational techniques chatterjee et al 2017 mirzaei et al 2020 the structure of the two models is described in appendix a in the supplementary material fig 2 shows the flowchart of the overall process including data preparation and construction of two machine learning models in this study first we collected water quality hydrodynamic and meteorological data fig 2 a and determined the input variables using the statistical dependence test that can identify the relationship between the input and output variables fig 2 b simple linear regression was used to test the statistical dependence between variables croxton and cowden 1939 the positive or negative dependence was distinguished via statistical significance 0 05 table 1 shows the 14 input variables selected to predict the alert level of algal bloom using two machine learning models the average values of daily temperature wind speed water level and discharge of hydropower were applied during the interval time of water quality sampling and the accumulation value was applied in daily precipitation second to predict alert levels in future using the current measured input variable we modified input and output values fig 2 c in other words the measured output value was matched with the measured input values at the previous sampling event the time interval was approximately seven days because water quality was generally monitored once a week in south korea therefore the output value was shifted to the input values before the average period of one week this preprocessing of the dataset allows for the training of the two machine learning models to predict the future output value using current input values third as a preliminary phase for constructing two models all datasets were randomly classified into training 60 validation 20 and test datasets 20 fig 2 d we generated the dataset comprising a combination of the original training and validation data and synthetic training and validation data fig 2 e we added the synthetic data only to the data used for the training and validation steps and excluded the data for the test step the original and synthetic added datasets including training and validation data were used to train the ann and svm models and to optimize their hyperparameters fig 2 f the test datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the two models that were constructed using original and synthetic added datasets fig 2 g the ann and svm models for predicting the algal bloom alert levels used on an average 509 datasets 313 monitoring data sets and 196 average synthetic data sets for eight years the two machine learning models were optimized using five hyper parameters fig 2 f the activation function of a hidden layer in ann and the kernel function in svm were optimized experimentally the number of hidden neurons in ann box constraint and kernel scale in svm were optimized using a pattern search algorithm the activation function of the output layer was softmax function finally we compared the performance of the two models based on the application of original and synthetic added data using a confusion matrix fig 2 g the analysis of statistics construction of two machine learning models and optimization of models were performed using matlab mathworks inc 2 5 evaluation of overall model accuracy we selected the optimized model in 200 iterations model run and calculated the average accuracy of all models to evaluate the overall performance of the two machine learning models to verify the necessity of non linear models a logistic regression model lrm which is a representative linear classification algorithm was constructed using the same input variables as the variables used in the two machine learning models subsequently the performance of the three models were compared the classification performance of models with respect to the predicted and observed alert levels of algal bloom was evaluated using the confusion matrix see appendix b and fig s1 in the supplementary material the accuracy recall and precision of the model were calculated as class statistics the accuracy is commonly used to measure the performance of the model and is defined as a ratio between the correct prediction and the total number of data the recall represents the positive class detecting degree of the model for total instances by the classifier the precision is obtained by determining the proportion of the positive instances that were correctly predicted to the total number of positive prediction data sokolova and lapalme 2009 hossin and sulaiman 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive analysis of cyanobacterial and total nutrient variables the tn and tp ranged from 1 129 to 4 1 mg l and 0 01 to 0 253 mg l respectively table 2 the total nitrogen tn to total phosphorus tp mass ratio ranged from 15 08 to 867 05 based on the nutrient limit criteria nitrogen limited to tn tp 29 1 by mass and phosphorus limited to tn tp 29 1 by mass by the mass ratio smith 1983 ggr was observed to be a phosphorus limited reservoir most mass ratio values were more than 29 except for two events the trophic state index which was used to classify biological productivity in receiving water bodies using chl a and tp showed that ggr maintained eutrophic conditions chl a 7 2 mg l tp 0 024 mg l the criteria of eutrophic conditions ranged from 7 2 to 55 mg l for chl a to 0 024 0 096 mg l for tp average and median values of tp concentration were 0 053 mg l and 0 045 mg l from may to november which are productive periods average and median values of chl a concentration during the same period were 15 31 mg l and 11 15 mg l in these conditions algal blooms occur frequently and cyanobacteria is the dominant taxa joung et al 2011 srivastava et al 2015 park et al 2017 moreover the excess nutrients can accelerate the cyanobacteria bloom when the water temperature increases park et al 2017 in ggr the caution and warning levels yielded by the algal bloom alert system were usually announced during may to november and amounted to 164 91 events table 2 the formation of cyanobacteria bloom is most actively generated in the reservoir during the summer from june to september in south korea which is in east asia and exhibits monsoon climate characteristics cha et al 2014 microcystis and dolichospermum were dominant cyanobacterial genera during the same period kim et al 2005 3 2 selection of input variables and generation of synthetic data the statistical dependence test was applied to identify linear dependence between the cyanobacteria cell density and each input variable except the interval variable table 1 and fig s2 show the results of the dependence test 12 variables had statistically important linear dependences with the cell density of cyanobacteria the cell density was positively correlated with 7 variables such as nh4 n tdp po4 p inflow discharge atemp and precip and negatively correlated with 5 variables such as tdn no3 n cond wlevel and dhydro various variable selection strategies using linear and non linear methods can be applied to determine suitable input variables may et al 2011 in the future comparison studies between the methods can assist in constructing robust machine learning models finally 13 variables including the water quality monitoring interval were selected as input variables to predict the alert level of algal bloom using statistical models in ggr the data imbalance was improved using the adasyn fig s3 a shows the distribution of the algal bloom alert level in the original data during training and validation the skewed distribution of class influences the estimation for the object of interest using the classification model in addition model accuracy is inappropriate because scarcity of data translates to poor estimation of the model accuracy menardi and torelli 2014 fig s3 b shows the distribution of the synthetic added dataset during the training phase 87 and 85 synthetic data were added to the original data of l 1 and l 2 respectively this approach mitigates the loss of useful information and overfitting problems caused by duplicated oversampling via the artificial generation of synthetic data xu et al 2020 besides the adasyn there are various resampling methods that use undersampling and oversampling techniques comparison of the adasyn with other approaches may be helpful to validate the effectiveness of the methods for handling dataset imbalances this can be considered as a future research topic 3 3 optimization of two machine learning models to predict alert levels of algal bloom we selected individually optimized ann and svm models that most accurately predict alert levels of algal bloom via 200 iterative simulations that is 200 differently optimized ann and svm models were constructed table 3 presents the descriptive results of the optimized parameters of the ann and svm models under 200 randomly selected data and the optimal parameter for the optimal ann and svm models in the ann the optimized activation function for the model using original data and for the model using the synthetic added data was log sigmoid the sigmoidal type functions including tangent sigmoid were most commonly used as an activation function of the ann model maier and dandy 2000 zadeh et al 2010 in addition the log and tangent sigmoid functions were mostly employed to consider the nonlinear relationship between input and output variables haykin 1999 the number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer was optimized to 20 for the ann model constructed using original dataset and to 13 for the ann model constructed using the synthetic added dataset the hidden neurons were determined to range between 1 and 23 this range was calculated using input variables the maximum number of hidden neurons is 2n 1 and n is the number of variables hecht nielsen 1987 in addition the range of the number of hidden neurons was similar to that of previous studies kişi 2008 nourani et al 2009 in the svm model the kernel function of the optimal models using both original data and synthetic added data was selected as gaussian radial basis generally the accuracy of the svm model for class prediction can be improved by applying the polynomial kernel function compared with other kernel functions such as the linear and gaussian kernel functions savas and dovis 2019 however the kernel function must be determined via comparison of data patle and chouhan 2013 our results showed that the gaussian radial basis function was selected by the optimal model using original data and synthetic added data after 200 iterations the gaussian radial basis function resulted in the highest percentage of 88 and 62 for original data and synthetic added data respectively 3 4 comparison of model performance the lrm results were compared for the two machine learning models to discuss the needs of non linear learning algorithms in the case of l 1 the lrm showed higher predictive performance than the svm when the original data was used whereas it showed lower performance than ann during training including validation and the test however the lrm showed the lowest performance among the three models when synthetic added data was used in both overall and optimal model results figs s4 a and b whereas the overall performance of the lrm for l 2 was relatively stable in terms of data types and learning steps the lrm had the lowest predictive performance for l 2 in both models using original and synthetic added data during the test figs s4 c and d therefore non linear machine learning may be needed to construct the accurate classification model in this study overall ann showed optimum and stable performance and the machine learning models showed better performance than lrm when synthetic added data were applied figs 3 and 4 show 4 general confusion matrices obtained from 200 iterations according to the type of model and data training including validation results present recall and precision values for training and validation datasets the row and column in the confusion matrix depict the averaged instances in the prediction and observation of the alert level of algal blooms in the ann model using original data two upper panels in fig 3 the trained and tested model showed distinct differences for both overall recall and precision values the model constructed using original dataset showed poor performance values in the test whereas the model constructed with the synthetic added dataset showed higher test performance values and was more optimized in terms of precision and recall than the model constructed using the original dataset bottom two panels in fig 3 the average recall and precision values for both l 1 and l 2 in the model with the original dataset were 48 1 and 48 2 during the test respectively whereas that of the model with the synthetic added dataset were 79 1 and 77 1 during the test respectively conversely the average recall and precision values of the overall svm model during the training and test did not differ considerably between original and synthetic added data except for the recall value for l 1 fig 4 improvement of recall performance for l 1 between the original and synthetic added data was higher than that in the ann model the recall values of svm were increased from 5 0 to 67 6 in the training and 2 4 to 61 0 in the test due to the use of synthetic added data but the average recall performance for l 0 in the training and test decreased from 94 4 to 66 2 fig 4 the application of synthetic added data led to remarkable improvement of test performance for l 1 and l 2 in the ann model and l 1 in the svm figs 5 and 6 show confusion matrices for the result of the optimal ann and svm models with the original and synthetic added datasets the training including validation results present recall and precision values for training and validation datasets similar to overall results the ann model performance was considerably improved by the synthetic added data compared to the original data especially in recall and precision values for l 1 and l 2 in the test fig 5 the optimized model showed recall improvements of 35 3 for l 1 and 33 3 for l 2 and precision improvements of 36 6 for l 1 and 29 7 for l 2 in the test average improvement for recall and precision was 13 5 for l 0 in the optimized svm model fig 6 recall and precision values for l 1 in the test were distinctively higher in the synthetic added data than in the original data whereas recall value for l 0 decreased from 90 5 to 71 4 based on the comparison of misclassification of l 1 caution level as l 0 normal level between original and synthetic added data in the test the ann decreased from 50 0 to 13 3 in iterative runs fig 3 and from 16 7 to 0 in the optimized run fig 5 the svm model decreased in the misclassification from 100 to 16 7 in iterative runs fig 4 and from 100 to 7 14 in the optimized run fig 6 both models constructed using the synthetic added data yielded higher classification performance than those using the original data figs 3 6 and table 4 according to the comparison between the performances of the ann and svm models all performance indexes in the training including validation and test were higher in the ann than in the svm for both overall runs and the best run table 4 therefore the ann model is suitable for predicting the alert level of algal bloom accurate prediction of l 1 1000 cells ml 1 is critical because this level may be an initial phase in the formation of algal blooms l 1 may be a very important transition status from normalcy to bloom formation maier and dandy 1997 reported that the density above 1000 cells ml 1 greatly increased the probability of algal blooms moreover they reported that the excess density caused discoloration and an unpleasant odor thereby leading to esthetic problems in the water they used the cell number 1000 cells ml 1 to determine the significance of the annual growth of cyanobacteria the performance discrepancy between l 0 and l 1 was higher in the model using the original dataset than in that using the synthetic added dataset this difference resulting from the model s focus on l 0 rather than l 1 can cause low statistical reliability of the model in terms of accuracy evaluation menardi and torelli 2014 the selection of data and model type may be crucial factors in the prediction of issues and improvement of model accuracy beigi et al 2014 cawley and talbot 2010 moreover probability of misclassifying l 1 as l 0 in test was significantly higher when original data were used compared to when synthetic added data were used this underestimation may be severe with respect to conducting management tasks because the normal level l 0 cannot reveal and transfer danger in the alert system in terms of algal bloom monitoring and water quality management improvement in caution l 1 and warning l 2 level prediction is more efficiently applicable than accurate prediction of the normal level l 0 in the alert level of algal bloom in this study we provided a series of processes for forecasting the alert level of algal blooms after one week and improving the prediction of each alert level from imbalanced data in south korea the algal bloom alert system has been geared toward protecting the drinking water resource in streams since 1998 jeong et al 2011 shin et al 2016 the algal bloom alert system is operated by the ministry of environment in south korea to protect public health from cyanotoxin and to supply fresh water to water intake and purification plants moe 2011 as the alert level raised to l 1 or l 2 the management and government offices applied measures such as controlling nearby pollutants prohibiting water activities and installing barriers against algal bloom to reduce it moe 2011 the collection of water and identification of cyanobacteria cell density are essential to identifying the alert level of algal bloom however these activities are limited by high costs and the need for extensive labor therefore early warning by the machine learning may a useful alternative for rapid response and effective management plans with respect to algal blooms for example past studies reported that the current chl a concentration was influenced by chl a concentration before one week and the prediction of chl a concentration yielded the highest accuracy in the short term within 7 day lee et al 2003 2005 park et al 2015 the results of this study can be utilized as a precommitment strategy to secure safe drinking water in treatment plants to control pollutants in terms of watershed management and to prepare water treatment processes in purification steps 4 conclusions this study describes a series of processes for predicting the alert level of algal blooms using cyanobacteria cell density in ggr the synthetic added dataset by the adaptive synthetic sampling adasyn based on observed data were used to construct two machine learning models because the distribution of observed data was essential from this study the following major conclusions were drawn the selection of appropriate variables may improve the accuracy of a machine learning model because the selection may reduce the model complexity caused by an increase in the number of input variables weights and bias in a learning process however various linear and non linear variable selection methods may be useful to construct the robust machine learning models for addressing classification problems and can be considered for conducting future research synthetic added data considerably improved the prediction of alert levels of algal bloom using the two machine learning models the synthetic data by adasyn can effectively avoid biased learning in training networks and solve the problem of data imbalance moreover selecting a proper resampling method as a future study may be helpful to validate the effectiveness of the adasyn for handling imbalanced datasets balanced data by the adasyn increased the performance of the two machine learning models but the performance of the logistic regression model was not definitely changed therefore it is necessary to evaluate the availability of synthetic data in terms of different model types such as linear and non linear models for prediction this study provided a prediction model for the alert level of algal bloom using the machine learning method and the data from a national monitoring station which are relatively easy to collect in a reservoir in terms of establishing strategies and regulations the proposed model is expected to be readily useful for construction and operation by engineers and decision makers managing algal bloom in watershed including inland weirs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
