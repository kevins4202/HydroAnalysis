15765,iron in the form of oxyhydr oxides plays a profound role in the im mobilization of heavy metals in environmental geochemical processes occurring in the soil groundwater system here the influence of saltwater intrusion on fe oxyhydr oxide mediated im mobilization of ni ii and zn ii in redox fluctuating shallow aquifers was evaluated by chemical extraction μ xrf xanes analysis and 16s rrna high throughput sequencing in phreatic water the ferrihydrite bound ni zn fh ni zn in soils contributed to a 12 17 increase in carbonate bound ni zn cb ni zn due to its own reductive dissolution whereas the illite adsorbed ni zn illite ni zn only contributed 6 7 the relative abundance of non salt tolerant anaerobic herbaspirillum and iron reducing associated ralstonia in soils accounted for nearly 50 during the oxidation stage the dissolved ferrihydrite reprecipitated to bind free ni zn however saltwater invasion strongly weakened the dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite by inhibiting the growth of non salt tolerant anaerobes and iron reducing bacteria and highlighted the contribution of illite ni zn under brackish water intrusion illite zn contributed to a 12 increase in cb zn thereby surpassing the contribution of fh zn 8 under seawater invasion the dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite hardly occurred and the anaerobic salt tolerant bacillus 95 prevailed therefore the increase of cb ni zn 7 15 in the reduction stages was contributed by illite ni zn however in the oxidation stages the carbonate replaced the original role of reprecipitated ferrihydrite to bind the free ni zn in solutions these newly recognized mechanisms may be the key to predicting the mobility of toxic elements and developing appropriate remediation techniques of permeable reactive barriers

intrusion weakens fe oxyhydr oxide mediated im mobilization of ni and zn in redox fluctuating soil groundwater system original data figshare 1 introduction saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers is a global concern it is triggered by complex factors such as sea level rise tidal variability and groundwater over exploitation werner et al 2013 the yangtze river estuary yre in china is one of the world s largest river tidal systems yu et al 2020 salinity intrusion in yre is controlled by river discharge and tidal fluctuations li et al 2010 the intrusion distances from the coastline in the northern and southern parts of yangtze river delta reached 1 7 21 3 and 0 8 14 4 km respectively han and currell 2022 as a result the shallow groundwater depth of 1 29 13 41 m of chongming island in yre contains a cl na brine with a total dissolved solid concentration of 5 2 7 0 g l liu et al 2015 estuarine deltas are usually associated with convenient transportation and developed manufacturing historically some of the industry sectors involved in zn ni plating were concentrated along the coasts and estuaries as these regions could provide a series of convenient logistics and supply chains with the recent adjustment of industrial structures many enterprises are moving out of the estuary and leaving behind a large number of heavy metal hm polluted sites for remediation pan and wang 2012 in the coastal regions of the red sea the mediterranean sea the indian ocean the bohai sea and the hangzhou bay ni zn pollution exists in soil groundwater systems of major coastal industrial zones table s1 the range of phreatic salinity fluctuations in coastal plains and delta regions could exceed 3 g l because of low elevation luo et al 2015 redox processes under salinity stress may alter the speciation and distribution of hms in soil aquifer systems gonzález alcaraz and van gestel 2017 the increase of salinity can promote the mobility of hms in aquifers by changing chemical interactions e g cation exchange metal sulfate association and metal chloride complexation zhao et al 2013 and can inhibit the activity and abundance of bacterial communities in soil groundwater systems microbially mediated fe redox cycling is the process by which the redox state strongly affects the reactivity and abundance of ferric oxides in aquifers winkler et al 2018 poorly crystalline fe hydroxides or oxyhydroxide precipitates namely short range ordered sro fe iii oxyhydr oxides are initially formed by the oxidization of dissolved fe ii under near neutral ph conditions zhang and furman 2021 they have a large surface area and high reactivity shi et al 2021 and may potentially influence hms fate parsons et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the sro fe phases are thermodynamically unstable and pose the risk of re releasing hms e g as cd ni and zn mediated by microbial reductive dissolution ponting et al 2021 simmler et al 2017 in the next fe redox cycling the fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitates may re generate and re immobilize hms through co precipitation or sorption han et al 2019 in floodplain soils a significant mathematical correlation between the released ni zn from soil pore water and the reductively dissolved fe was observed shaheen et al 2014 under the oxidation condition the dissolved ni content was significantly reduced which was presumably due to the re immobilization of ni by the newly generated iron manganese oxides rinklebe et al 2016 however these results were only based on chemical sequential extraction analyses and lacked of direct evidences from soil water micro interfaces in the present study we focused on the fe oxyhydr oxide mediated im mobilization of hm contaminants nickel and zinc in the redox fluctuating phreatic aquifer of a historical industrial site near yre the site has been used for the production of nickel zinc alloy lamp holder for decades and has a high concentration of nickel zinc contaminant residues the depth and area of the phreatic zone may change periodically because of seasonal rainfall and saltwater intrusion three salinity gradients were designed and the distilled water was used as the blank seawater sw is artificially prepared with a mixture of dissolved mineral salts brackish water bw is less salty than sw thus phreatic water pw was used to simulate fresh water chemically sequential extraction and synchrotron µ xrf xanes analysis were used to reveal the attenuating effect of saltwater invasion on the hm species transformation driven by fe oxyhydr oxide in estuarine soil groundwater system and the underlying mechanisms of this geobiochemical process 2 materials and methods 2 1 incubation experiment the contaminated site was a factory used for lamp holder manufacturing it is adjacent to the yangtze river estuary text s1 fig s1 the high phreatic level leads to a potential risk of saltwater intrusion zhao et al 2013 the characteristic features of rust streak and iron manganese nodules from the collected soil samples indicated the presence of the alternating redox conditions fig s2 the selected physicochemical properties of contaminated soils are described in tables s2 and s3 and fig s3 in an incubation experiment pw represented the shallow groundwater without saltwater intrusion the ion composition and concentration of pw were in accordance with those in the shanghai geological environment bulletin 2009 2014 shanghai geological environment bulletin 2021 as follows 6 5 mmol l na 2 4 mmol l ca2 1 6 mmol l mg2 5 5 mmol l cl 1 0 mmol l so4 2 6 5 mmol l hco3 and 0 5 mmol l no3 bw and sw were prepared to simulate the intrusion of low salinity saltwater and extreme high salinity seawater deionized water dw was used as the control dw is cold water that has been boiled and aerated with nitrogen 99 99 in the glove box for 30 min all solutions were initially prepared with dw in a glove box filled with n2 except for the addition of sodium chloride 409 41 mmol l dong et al 2019 sw had the same ionic composition and concentration as pw a 1 10 dilution of sw namely bw was generated by adding one part of the sw solution to nine parts of the dw solution dong et al 2018 glucose at 2 78 mmol l was added to mimic the natural bioavailable dissolution of organic matter which occurred during the experiment the ion composition of each solution is shown in table s4 the experimental operations were performed in the glove box a vial with a butyl rubber stopper tightened with aluminum crimps contained a 1 2 mass ratio of the contaminated soil 2 mm to saltwater a blank soil supernatant 2 ml containing a natural microbial community was added to the vial as the inoculum fulda et al 2013 the supernatant was obtained by extracting fresh blank soil 20 g after equilibration with 40 ml of deionized water for 2 days then the soil groundwater system with saltwater intrusion was simulated by anaerobically incubating the mixture of the contaminated soil and saline groundwater in a shaking incubator at 25 c for 30 days denoted as reduction phase red in n2 atmosphere 99 99 subsequently the aerobic process was conducted within 28 days after opening the butyl rubber bottle stopper for air exposure denoted as re oxidation phase reox fulda et al 2013 to avoid disturbance by sampling and handling two repetitions were performed for each mud sample at different incubation times and the obtained samples were placed in separate vials all sampling operations under anaerobic incubation were conducted in the glove box in n2 atmosphere 99 99 2 2 sampling and analysis time series redox potential eh and ph level of the simulated soil groundwater system in the red phase days 1 5 10 15 20 and 30 and the reox phase days 2 7 14 and 28 were determined using platinum and saturated calomel electrodes after sufficient redox equilibrium 15 min after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min the supernatants were separated from the mixture and passed through 0 22 μm nylon filters the metal ion concentration of the filtrate was measured by icp oes agilent 5110 usa the dissolved organic carbon doc and inorganic carbon ic content of the filtrate were determined by toc vcpn shimadzu japan the centrifuged bulk soil was vacuum dried and then ground in the glove box with an agate mortar in n2 atmosphere to analyze the hm speciation and iron oxide component 0 15 mm the poorly crystalline iron oxide feo to crystalline iron oxide fed ratio feo fed was calculated the chemical speciation of hms in the bulk soil was determined by the modified european community bureau of reference bcr sequential extraction method to characterize the indigenous microbial communities 16s rrna high throughput sequencing was performed a detailed description is shown in text s2 the accuracy of total ni and zn analysis was evaluated by analyzing a certified reference sample of soil gss 1a gbw074011a a good agreement of the measured zn 472 15 mg kg and ni 15 99 mg kg contents was achieved with the certified zn 475 30 0 mg kg acceptable and ni 16 9 1 5 mg kg acceptable contents of gss 1a the standard ni and zn recovery rates were 95 42 and 92 44 respectively 2 3 micro xrf xanes analysis the synchrotron based micro x ray fluorescence and x ray absorption near edge structure μ xrf xanes were determined at the very sensitive elemental and structural probe employing radiation from a synchrotron beamline vespers 07b2 1 of canadian light source the sample preparation method for μ xrf xanes is shown in text s3 the bulk soil samples on the 20th day of red and the 28th day of reox were collected and used for μ xrf xanes analysis ni and zn k edge xanes spectra were obtained from the ni and zn hotspots according to μ xrf mapping data processing was performed by using the athena 0 9 26 and sixpack software text s4 ravel and newville 2005 webb 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 saltwater intrusion changes the hydrochemical properties of groundwater and soil microbial communities in the red and reox stages of pw without saltwater intrusion bw with saltwater intrusion and sw with extreme saltwater intrusion the following hydrochemical properties were determined redox potential eh mv ph dissolved in organic carbon and the release of ni ii zn ii fe ii and mn ii figs 1 and s4 in the red stage all eh values gradually decreased with time up to a stable level the soil in pw abbreviated as pws showed the fastest eh decline to 36 5 mv on red 5 5th day of red and reached the lowest eh 53 5 mv on red 15 by contrast the soils in bw and sw abbreviated as bws and sws respectively presented a gentler decrease in eh and reached the lowest values on the red 10 with intensifying salinity invasion the decrease in eh was inhibited the eh of sws only dropped to 43 mv on reox 28 these eh values quickly rebounded and recovered their original state due to an air ingress the ph of the soil groundwater system was sensitive to the changes in redox fluctuation the initial ph of the soil in groundwater rapidly decreased with increasing salinity fig s4a sws showed a steeper and lower descent than bws and pws because of the more exchangeable h in higher salinity groundwater wong et al 2010 when the ph level reached the lowest values on the 5th day the ph increased slowly until the end of the incubation whether in the red or reox fig s4a because the dissolved ic consisting of carbonate fig s4b could consume the h produced by the exchange of na ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater matrix wong et al 2013 in the red stage the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc continued to decrease fig s4c because of the anaerobic consumption of organic substrates by soil microorganisms during the reduction of fe iii bearing minerals chen et al 2020 after 20 days of anaerobic incubation the doc in the system maintained a slow change at low concentration resulting in a slight rebound of the eh in the various saltwater invaded soils fig 1a frohne et al 2014 high throughput sequencing was used to study the effects of saline intrusion on the diversity and structure of soil microbial communities the total amplicon sequence variants asvs of pws bws and sws in red 20 were 213 208 and 157 respectively table s5 which indicated that the richness of soil microbial species decreased with increasing salinity hartman et al 2020 shannon and simpson indexes were in the following order pws dws bws sws table s5 this order showed that proper salinity in pw can increase the diversity of microorganisms whereas high salinity bw and sw can reduce the diversity of soil microorganisms navarro et al 2015 principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used to explore and to visualize similarities or dissimilarities of bacterial communities in soils invaded by saltwater with different salinities fig 2 a a closer plotting of two samples generally indicates a more similar composition pei et al 2017 the plots of pws were close to those of bws and far from those of dws and sws thereby indicating that the bacterial community composition of pws was similar to that of bws and different from those of dws and sws the results were consistent with the eh changes fig 1a bacterial classification at the genus level is shown in fig 2b the main genera included bacillus herbaspirillum ralstonia cellulomonas and cupriavidus upgma clustering results also showed significant differences in dominant bacteria genus under different saltwater invasion conditions fig s5 under anaerobic conditions in pws and bws the development of anaerobic bacteria and iron reducing associated bacteria was induced to form different degrees of soil reduction conditions herbaspirillum is a nitrogen fixing facultative anaerobe that shows higher activity in denitrification and organic matter degradation under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions yuan et al 2012 compared with the abundance of herbaspirillum in dws that in pws increased by 30 5 and that in bws only increased by 4 8 fig 2b thus high salinity bw and no salinity dw soils were not suitable for the development of facultative anaerobes ralstonia is related to soil contaminated by hms and is the dominant genus in the process of reducing and enriching iron citrate source fe iii in paddy soils under anaerobic conditions wang et al 2009 compared with the relative abundance of ralstonia in dws those in pws and bws increased by 5 6 and 8 1 respectively fig 2b whereas that in sws was close to zero this finding clearly suggested that the invasion of sw with extreme salinity inhibited the activity of the iron reduction associated bacteria which agreed with the previous results i e pws and bws could reduce and dissolve fe more than sws in the red stage fig 1d aerobic bacteria are inhibited under anaerobic conditions cellulomonas in dws is aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacterium related to cellulose degradation in soil hatayama et al 2013 cupriavidus is a strict aerobe that is widely found in hm contaminated soils li et al 2018 the relative abundance of these two bacteria in pws and bws dropped to less than 1 fig 2b bacillus is an anaerobic or facultative anaerobic salt tolerant bacterium with strong stress resistance it is the dominant bacteria in the delta saline wetlands li et al 2014 therefore in sws with extremely high salinity bacillus became the main dominant genus and the relative abundance of the remaining genera was less than 5 fig 2b 3 2 ni zn im mobilization in pw is controlled by the dissolution and precipitation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides 3 2 1 redox driven mobilization and immobilization of ni zn in the red stage the zn release was higher than the ni release due to the higher content of zn than ni in soils fig 1b and c table s2 the ni zn released from pws included the exchangeable ni zn on soil minerals and the ni zn released from the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxide fig 1d ponting et al 2021 zhao et al 2013 the dissolution amounts of ni zn gradually decreased and reached equilibrium on red 20 which might be related to the reprecipitation of ni zn with soluble ic e g carbonate in pw ottosen et al 2008 this result was consistent with the continuous decline in the concentration of dissolved ic in the red fig s4b finally the dissolution precipitation of ni zn reached equilibrium within 20 30 days and ni zn release no longer increased fig 1b and c in the reox stage the free ni zn in pws continued to decrease which might be related to the formation of insoluble ni zn carbonate precipitate and the reprecipitation of fe oxyhydr oxide ni zn could be re immobilized by the latter at near neutral ph fig 1b d han et al 2019 rinklebe et al 2016 the released manganese in red did not reprecipitate in reox fig s4d because the formation of mn hydr oxide requires very strong oxidation conditions approximately 900 1000 mv at ph 5 frohne et al 2014 therefore the re immobilization of ni zn with mn hydr oxide in reox was nearly impossible 3 2 2 ni zn species transformation in pws the im mobilization of ni zn was determined by the transformation of ni zn species in redox fluctuating pws pw system without saltwater intrusion the boxplots in figs 3 a d and s6 summarized the differences in ni zn species between the red and reox in pws the transformation dynamics of ni and zn species are shown in figs s7 s10 and the detailed analysis was shown in text s5 dws served as a control and its eh did not fluctuate significantly fig 1a whereas pws showed significant eh changes in the red stage of pws pws red the content of reducible ni and zn f2 ni zn and weak acid extractable zn f1 zn decreased significantly compared with dws red fig 3a d in addition f2 ni zn and f1 zn in the reox stage of pws pws reox significantly increased compared with pws red fig 3a d moreover f1 ni increased by 27 6 but did not reach a significant level fig 3a ni and zn contents in the oxidizable f3 ni zn and residual f4 ni zn fractions did not change significantly fig s6 the f1 included exchangeable ni zn and carbonate bound ni zn whereas the f2 included iron manganese oxide bound ni zn pueyo et al 2008 in anaerobic derivatized reduction the ni zn bounded fe oxyhydr oxide was dissolved with decreasing eh thereby resulting in the release of ni zn into pw ponting et al 2021 the exchanged ni zn and the released ni zn from fe oxyhydr oxide were readily subjected to precipitation with carbonates in pw when the aerobic derived oxidation condition was recovered ni and zn in pw would recombine with the reprecipitated fe oxyhydr oxide han et al 2019 zhang and furman 2021 3 2 3 response of ni zn species to feo fed ratio to further clarify the relationship between the dissolution precipitation of fe oxyhydr oxide and the im mobilization of ni zn in the redox horizon the feo fed ratio was used to describe the degree of conversion of crystalline fe oxides to poorly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide in the soil groundwater system owliaie 2013 the increase decrease of feo fed ratio value corresponded to the increase decrease of the proportion of poorly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide owliaie 2013 the redox driven dynamics of feo fed ratio are shown in fig 4 a in the red the feo fed ratio in pws decreased significantly compared with that in dws fig 4b the continuous decrease of feo fed ratio showed that the weakly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide continued to dissolve with the ni zn release on the contrary the feo fed ratio rebounded rapidly in the reox fig 4a and the values of pws were significantly higher than those in the red fig 4b thereby implying that the dissolved iron reprecipitates as weakly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide under oxidation conditions in the redox fluctuation the feo fed ratios in pws were significantly and positively correlated with eh and f2 ni zn contents respectively r 0 9346 0 9743 p 0 001 fig s11a c suggesting that the change of f2 ni zn under redox fluctuation was highly related to the dissolution and reprecipitation of weakly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide 3 2 4 identification of ni zn species on pws based on μ xrf xanes analysis the μ xrf xanes was used to accurately obtain key micro interfacial evidences of ni zn species transformation in the pws pw system thereby laying a foundation for the further elucidation of the role of fe oxyhydr oxide in the ni zn im mobilization process at first the synchrotron radiation based μ xrf was used to map the metal element localization in red 20 and reox 28 on the soil micro interface of dws and pws as shown in fig s12a d either in the red or the reox the distribution of ni and zn in pws had a very significant spatial correlation r 0 813 and 0 871 p 0 001 fig s13c d which indicated that they might have the same combination in the soil moreover both ni and zn were distributed in the overlap area of fe mn k and ca fig s12c d fe and mn distribution are usually associated with the iron manganese oxides the distribution of k and ca is closely related to clay minerals containing potassium and calcium fan et al 2016 the spatial distribution correlation coefficient between ni zn and fe r 0 563 0 729 p 0 001 was higher than that of mn r 0 429 0 573 p 0 001 fig s13c d indicating that the distribution of ni zn is highly consistent with that of fe oxyhydr oxide mamindy pajany et al 2014 moreover the correlation coefficient between ni zn and fe was higher than that between ni zn and k ca r 0 162 0 583 p 0 001 fig s13c d because the exchange of ni zn in the clay mineral surface was accompanied by the departure of k ca gu and evans 2007 by contrast iron oxide was directly bound to ni zn thus no ion exchange occurred ponthieu et al 2006 based on the 2d element distribution of the red 20 and reox 28 soil from μ xrf analysis the hotspots in the distribution of both fe mn k ca and ni zn complexes for each experimental treatment were selected for μ xanes analysis fig s12 a d the normalized ni and zn k edge xanes spectra of each hotspot and the references are shown in fig s14 and the detailed description and analysis of xanes spectra are presented in text s6 according to principal component analysis pca results tables s6 and s7 target transformation tables s8 and s9 and soil medium composition table s3 illite ni zn illite adsorbed nickel and zinc fh ni zn ferrihydrite bound ni zn ha ni zn humic acid adsorbed nickel and zinc and cb ni zn nickel carbonate basic hydrate and zinc carbonate basic were the key species of ni zn in the soil these were selected as reference materials for the lcf analysis of ni and zn xanes spectra 3 2 5 the key role of ferrihydrite in ni zn species transformation the lcf results of the ni and zn k edge xanes spectra of pws and dws at each spot are shown in figs s15 and s16 and tables s10 and s11 the combinations of these four references provided statistically acceptable fits r factor 0 0031 0 0164 χ2 0 2098 0 8125 yang et al 2020 the distribution of each ni and zn species is summarized in fig 5 the ni zn species transformation in dws was weak fig 5a b and the details are shown in text s7 when pws was in an anaerobic state the reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite dominated the transformation of ni and zn in the redox horizon the fh ni 12 and fh zn 5 in the 20th day of red pws red pws 20 were significantly decreased by 17 and 12 respectively compared with those of red dws 20 fig 5a b the illite ni 53 and illite zn 60 of red pws 20 were slightly reduced by 7 and 6 respectively the dissolved fh ni zn content was higher than that of the exchanged content of illite ni zn thereby indicating that the primary cause of cb ni zn increase was the reductively dissolved fh ni zn accordingly the cb ni 32 and cb zn 32 showed 24 and 19 increase in red pws 20 respectively compared with red dws 20 fig 5a b when pws was under oxidation conditions the illite ni zn maintained a continuous ion exchange capacity and the ferrihydrite was precipitated simultaneously fig 5a b thereby resulting in the re immobilization of the dissolved ni zn at that time the binding ability between carbonate and free ni zn was weak because the dissolved carbonate was almost exhausted in the reox fig s4b compared with red pws 20 the 28th day of reox pws reox pw 28 showed the 11 and 4 decrease of illite ni and illite zn respectively fig 5a b by contrast the fh ni 19 and fh zn 14 in reox pw 28 increased by 7 and 9 respectively fig 5a b 3 3 saltwater intrusion weakens the role of fe oxyhydr oxide in ni zn im mobilization 3 3 1 saltwater intrusion affects the release of ni zn from bws and sws higher salinity is associated with more exchangeable cations wong et al 2010 when saltwater invades the shallow aquifer more base ions na ca2 and mg2 from saltwater bring more opportunities to exchange the exchangeable ni zn in soil clay minerals zhao et al 2013 therefore the amount of ni and zn released in groundwater was in the following order sws bws pws fig 1b and c however the dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxide for sws and bws did not occur during the initial 1 5 days of the red stage because eh had not yet been significantly reduced at that time fig 1d and a simmler et al 2017 fig 1d shows that the release of fe from bws was significantly higher than that from sws during the following 5 30 days of red and this finding was consistent with the result that the high salinity of sw inhibited the development of anaerobic non halotolerant and iron reducing related bacteria fig 2b morrissey and franklin 2015 during the reox stage the ni zn released from bws and sws showed a continuous decreasing trend fig 1b and c which indicated that the re immobilization of free ni zn still occurred in the saltwater invaded system however the re immobilization mode of free ni zn may be regulated by salinity change the im mobilization of ni zn in the reox stage of bws reox bws was similar to that in the reox pws the reductively dissolved fe was reprecipitated fig 1d and the free ic content also decreased fig s4b indicating that the free ni zn in the bws may be re immobilized by binding with free carbonate or reprecipitated fe oxyhydr oxide when the invading saltwater reached seawater salinity the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxide was inhibited and the reprecipitation ability of reductively dissolved fe in the reox stage of sws reox sws was very weak fig 1d meanwhile the free ic content was greatly reduced fig s4b this finding indicated that after seawater intrusion free ni zn in reox sws may be immobilized by carbonate rather than reprecipitated by fe oxyhydr oxide 3 3 2 ni zn species transformation under high and low salinity stress the apparent release of ni zn from redox fluctuating soils under saltwater invasion suggested the salinity dependent im mobilization of ni zn associated with ion exchange and fe oxyhydr oxide dissolution precipitation based on bcr sequential extraction the transformation of chemically extractable ni zn species in saltwater invaded soil groundwater system with redox fluctuation was analyzed both f1 ni zn and f2 ni zn in the red stage of bws bws red were significantly reduced compared with those in the dws red and the changes in f1 ni zn and f2 ni zn between bws red and bws reox reached a significant level fig 3a d in response to saltwater intrusion the f1 ni and f1 zn contents in bws at red 20 increased by 39 5 mg kg 28 6 and 130 3 mg kg 21 2 respectively compared with red 1 moreover these levels maintained equilibrium in the reox stage figs s8c and s10c however the f2 ni and f2 zn contents in red 20 decreased by 61 0 mg kg 15 4 and 50 1 mg kg 12 1 compared with those in red 1 and increased by 82 9 mg kg 24 5 and 95 8 mg kg 27 2 in reox 58 figs s8c and s10c the change trend of ni zn species in redox fluctuating bws was similar to that in pws the content of exchangeable ni zn and the carbonate bound ni zn involved in f1 ni zn showed a steady upward trend during the entire redox process and the content of iron manganese oxide bound ni zn involved in f2 ni zn showed a downward trend in red and an upward trend in reox figs s8c and s10c pueyo et al 2008 when bw intruded into the shallow aquifer the iron manganese oxide bound ni zn was transformed to exchangeable ni zn or carbonate bound ni zn in bws red and the re immobilization of free ni zn by reprecipitated fe oxyhydr oxide occurred in bws reox however the increase in salinity of the intruding saltwater might inhibit the dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxide bound ni zn in the red stage in which the f2 ni zn contents in bws 15 4 and 12 1 showed a lower reduction rate than those in pws 19 7 and 20 5 by contrast in the reox the growth rates of f2 ni zn in bws 24 5 and 27 2 were similar to those in pws 26 5 and 23 9 figs s8b c and s10b c when sw intruded into the shallow aquifer the f1 ni and f1 zn contents in sws increased by 76 2 mg kg 68 2 and 195 6 mg kg 32 6 during the entire redox process from red 1 to reox 58 figs s8d and s10d and these levels were higher than those in bws the change of f1 ni zn between red and reox reached a significant level fig 3a and c however the f2 ni zn content in sws did not change significantly during the whole redox process fig 3b and d the growth rate of f1 ni zn in soil redox horizon was in the following order sws 68 2 and 32 6 bws 28 6 and 21 2 pws 27 6 and 19 8 figs s8b d and s10b d this finding indicated that increasing salinity promoted the formation of carbonate bound or exchangeable ni and zn and the intrusion of seawater into the redox horizon may inhibit the im mobilization of ni and zn mediated by the dissolution precipitation of fe oxyhydr oxide 3 3 3 saltwater invasion inhibits fe oxyhydr oxide dissolution precipitation the feo fed ratio of bsw also had a significant positive correlation with eh r 8604 p 0 01 fig s11a in the red the feo fed ratio of bws was lower than that of dws and higher than that of pws fig 4a this result was due to the higher eh of bws than that of pws which was unfavorable for the dissolution of sro fe oxyhydr oxide owliaie 2013 on the contrary the feo fed ratio of bws rebounded rapidly in the reox fig 4a and reached a significant level compared with bws red fig 4b indicating that the dissolved iron was reprecipitated in the form of a weakly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide under saltwater invasion owliaie 2013 however the linear fitting slope of feo fed ratio vs eh in bws 9 33 10 5 was greatly lower than that in pws 2 15 10 4 fig s11a indicating that saltwater invasion markedly suppressed sro fe oxyhydr oxide dissolution precipitation due to the relatively small fluctuations in eh in bws the feo fed ratio was significantly positively correlated with f2 ni r 0 7564 p 0 05 and f2 zn r 0 8546 p 0 01 but their linear fitting slopes 2 44 10 4 and 2 78 10 4 respectively were lower than those in pws 6 87 10 4 and 6 70 10 4 respectively fig s11b and c saltwater invasion would regulate the release of ni zn by inhibiting the dissolution precipitation of sro fe oxyhydr oxide bound ni zn resulting in the lower release of ni zn in bws than that in pws for sws the feo fed ratio did not change significantly during the entire redox process fig 4 in addition no significant correlation was found between feo fed ratio and eh and between feo fed ratio and f2 ni zn in sws fig s11d f indicating that the sro fe oxyhydr oxide mediated dissolution of ni zn was inhibited such inhibition was due to the strong anti microbial activity of an extremely high salinity environment table s5 and fig 2b morrissey and franklin 2015 accordingly the ni zn re immobilization mediated by the regenerated sro fe oxyhydr oxide was suppressed 3 3 4 saltwater invasion enhances illite mediated im mobilization of ni zn according to μ xrf results saltwater intrusion did not change the distribution of ni zn on the soil micro interface fig s12e h in red 20 and reox 28 the spatial distribution of ni zn and fe mn in bws and sws showed a significant positive spatial correlation r 0 340 0 685 p 0 001 fig s13e h the correlation between ni zn and k ca of bws and sws in red 20 r 0 140 0 383 p 0 001 and reox 28 r 0 058 0 117 p 0 01 was lower than that of red pws r 0 279 0 583 p 0 001 and reox pws r 0 162 0 213 p 0 001 fig s13c h indicating that saltwater intrusion enhanced the ni zn and k ca exchange which decreased the correlation between ni zn and k ca gu and evans 2007 the lcf analysis provided statistically acceptable fits r factor 0 0042 0 1290 χ2 0 2379 0 9872 yang et al 2020 figs s15 and s16 tables s10 and s11 the transformation pathway of the ni zn species in bws was similar to that in pws but the dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite was weakened compared with red dws 20 the ferrihydrite on the 20th day of red bws red bws 20 could also dissolve and release ni zn the contribution of dissolved fh ni to the increase in cb ni in the red bws 20 12 was less than that in red pws 20 17 fig 5a this finding indicated that the role of fh ni gradually weakened with increasing salinity but the contribution of dissolved fh ni to the increase of cb ni was still higher than that of illite ni 5 in red bws 20 fig 5a however the contribution of dissolved fh zn to the increase in cb zn 8 was lower than that of ion exchangeable illite zn 12 in the red bws 20 fig 5b indicating that illite zn replaced fh zn to contribute to the release of zn ii during the reox ferrihydrite was reprecipitated and the free ni zn was converted to fh ni zn fh ni 22 and fh zn 14 increased by 5 on the 28th day of reox bws reox bws 28 compared with red bws 20 fig 5a b fh ni still played a dominant role in the conversion of ni species in red stage under bw intrusion however the dominant role of fh zn in red was replaced by illite zn and the reprecipitated fh ni zn was still the main fate of re immobilized ni zn in reox seawater salinity could further inhibit the function of ferrihydrite and alter the immobilized pathway of ni zn fig 5d in sws the fh ni and fh zn levels on the 20th day of red sws red sws 20 were only reduced by 6 and 2 respectively compared with those of red dws 20 the contribution of dissolved fh ni zn 2 6 to the increase of cb ni zn was lower than that of the ion exchangeable illite ni zn 7 15 fig 5a b indicating that illite ni zn substituted fh ni zn to contribute to the increase of cb ni zn in addition the fh ni zn of reox sws on the 28th day reox sws 28 remained unchanged compared with that of red sws 20 and the free ni zn was converted to cb ni zn compared with red sws 20 the contents of carbonate bound ni and zn increased by 9 and 8 respectively fig 5a b the analysis of ni zn species at the soil micro interface showed that seawater intrusion into the redox fluctuating soil resulted in the complete loss of the role of fh ni zn in ni zn im mobilization in pw and bw the im mobilization of ni zn in redox fluctuating soil groundwater system proceeded in the following pathway the ni zn released in the red stage came from the reductively dissolved ferrihydrite bound ni zn and the ion exchangeable illite ni zn and the part of the released ni zn was immobilized by carbonate to form cb ni zn the remaining free ni zn in the reox stage was immobilized by reprecipitated ferrihydrite figs 5c and s17 by contrast the im mobilization of ni zn in sw followed a new pathway the ni zn released by the ion exchangeable illite ni zn directly combined with carbonate to form cb ni zn because of the absence of the reprecipitation and immobilization of ferrihydrite under seawater intrusion conditions fig 5d 4 conclusion saltwater intrusion changed the ni zn im mobilization mechanism driven by fe oxyhydr oxide in redox fluctuating soil groundwater system in pw the ferrihydrite bound ni zn played a key role in the increase of cb ni zn in red pws and the reprecipitation of fh ni zn in reox pws which was regulated by the dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite under redox fluctuation conditions the increase in the salinity of the invading saltwater gradually inhibited the development of non salt tolerant anaerobes and iron reducing associated bacteria thereby resulting in the suppression of dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite which changed the dominant species and pathway of ni zn im mobilization when bw invaded the ion exchangeable illite zn replaced reductively dissolved fh zn to control the release of zn ii whereas the reductively dissolved fh ni still played a dominant role in cb ni increment in the red in reox bws the reprecipitated fh ni zn was still the main fate of re immobilized ni zn under sw invasion conditions the ferrihydrite dissolution precipitation hardly occurred in the red stage the ion exchangeable illite ni zn replaced the reductively dissolved fh ni zn as the main source to release ni zn however in the reox stage cb ni zn replaced the reprecipitated fh ni zn as the main phase to re immobilize free ni zn the cb ni zn became the main fate of the re immobilized ni zn under sw invasion whether in the red stage or the reox stage permeable reactive barrier prb is one of the most promising passive treatment technologies for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater obiri nyarko et al 2014 it has been applied for the removal of heavy metals e g ni and zn from tide influenced aquifers in coastal regions ludwig et al 2002 navarro et al 2006 approximately 60 of prbs employed iron based materials as reactive media henderson and demond 2007 li et al 2022 however our study reveals the adverse effect of seawater intrusion on the immobilization of ni zn by iron based materials ferrihydrite bound ni zn is easily transformed into carbonate bound ni zn precipitates therefore non ferrous reaction media such as activated carbon and zeolite may be more suitable for remediation of metal contaminated soil groundwater under seawater intrusion and redox fluctuation conditions which cannot only maintain the remediation performance of prb but also prevent the decrease of hydraulic conductivity of prb

15765,iron in the form of oxyhydr oxides plays a profound role in the im mobilization of heavy metals in environmental geochemical processes occurring in the soil groundwater system here the influence of saltwater intrusion on fe oxyhydr oxide mediated im mobilization of ni ii and zn ii in redox fluctuating shallow aquifers was evaluated by chemical extraction μ xrf xanes analysis and 16s rrna high throughput sequencing in phreatic water the ferrihydrite bound ni zn fh ni zn in soils contributed to a 12 17 increase in carbonate bound ni zn cb ni zn due to its own reductive dissolution whereas the illite adsorbed ni zn illite ni zn only contributed 6 7 the relative abundance of non salt tolerant anaerobic herbaspirillum and iron reducing associated ralstonia in soils accounted for nearly 50 during the oxidation stage the dissolved ferrihydrite reprecipitated to bind free ni zn however saltwater invasion strongly weakened the dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite by inhibiting the growth of non salt tolerant anaerobes and iron reducing bacteria and highlighted the contribution of illite ni zn under brackish water intrusion illite zn contributed to a 12 increase in cb zn thereby surpassing the contribution of fh zn 8 under seawater invasion the dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite hardly occurred and the anaerobic salt tolerant bacillus 95 prevailed therefore the increase of cb ni zn 7 15 in the reduction stages was contributed by illite ni zn however in the oxidation stages the carbonate replaced the original role of reprecipitated ferrihydrite to bind the free ni zn in solutions these newly recognized mechanisms may be the key to predicting the mobility of toxic elements and developing appropriate remediation techniques of permeable reactive barriers

intrusion weakens fe oxyhydr oxide mediated im mobilization of ni and zn in redox fluctuating soil groundwater system original data figshare 1 introduction saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers is a global concern it is triggered by complex factors such as sea level rise tidal variability and groundwater over exploitation werner et al 2013 the yangtze river estuary yre in china is one of the world s largest river tidal systems yu et al 2020 salinity intrusion in yre is controlled by river discharge and tidal fluctuations li et al 2010 the intrusion distances from the coastline in the northern and southern parts of yangtze river delta reached 1 7 21 3 and 0 8 14 4 km respectively han and currell 2022 as a result the shallow groundwater depth of 1 29 13 41 m of chongming island in yre contains a cl na brine with a total dissolved solid concentration of 5 2 7 0 g l liu et al 2015 estuarine deltas are usually associated with convenient transportation and developed manufacturing historically some of the industry sectors involved in zn ni plating were concentrated along the coasts and estuaries as these regions could provide a series of convenient logistics and supply chains with the recent adjustment of industrial structures many enterprises are moving out of the estuary and leaving behind a large number of heavy metal hm polluted sites for remediation pan and wang 2012 in the coastal regions of the red sea the mediterranean sea the indian ocean the bohai sea and the hangzhou bay ni zn pollution exists in soil groundwater systems of major coastal industrial zones table s1 the range of phreatic salinity fluctuations in coastal plains and delta regions could exceed 3 g l because of low elevation luo et al 2015 redox processes under salinity stress may alter the speciation and distribution of hms in soil aquifer systems gonzález alcaraz and van gestel 2017 the increase of salinity can promote the mobility of hms in aquifers by changing chemical interactions e g cation exchange metal sulfate association and metal chloride complexation zhao et al 2013 and can inhibit the activity and abundance of bacterial communities in soil groundwater systems microbially mediated fe redox cycling is the process by which the redox state strongly affects the reactivity and abundance of ferric oxides in aquifers winkler et al 2018 poorly crystalline fe hydroxides or oxyhydroxide precipitates namely short range ordered sro fe iii oxyhydr oxides are initially formed by the oxidization of dissolved fe ii under near neutral ph conditions zhang and furman 2021 they have a large surface area and high reactivity shi et al 2021 and may potentially influence hms fate parsons et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the sro fe phases are thermodynamically unstable and pose the risk of re releasing hms e g as cd ni and zn mediated by microbial reductive dissolution ponting et al 2021 simmler et al 2017 in the next fe redox cycling the fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitates may re generate and re immobilize hms through co precipitation or sorption han et al 2019 in floodplain soils a significant mathematical correlation between the released ni zn from soil pore water and the reductively dissolved fe was observed shaheen et al 2014 under the oxidation condition the dissolved ni content was significantly reduced which was presumably due to the re immobilization of ni by the newly generated iron manganese oxides rinklebe et al 2016 however these results were only based on chemical sequential extraction analyses and lacked of direct evidences from soil water micro interfaces in the present study we focused on the fe oxyhydr oxide mediated im mobilization of hm contaminants nickel and zinc in the redox fluctuating phreatic aquifer of a historical industrial site near yre the site has been used for the production of nickel zinc alloy lamp holder for decades and has a high concentration of nickel zinc contaminant residues the depth and area of the phreatic zone may change periodically because of seasonal rainfall and saltwater intrusion three salinity gradients were designed and the distilled water was used as the blank seawater sw is artificially prepared with a mixture of dissolved mineral salts brackish water bw is less salty than sw thus phreatic water pw was used to simulate fresh water chemically sequential extraction and synchrotron µ xrf xanes analysis were used to reveal the attenuating effect of saltwater invasion on the hm species transformation driven by fe oxyhydr oxide in estuarine soil groundwater system and the underlying mechanisms of this geobiochemical process 2 materials and methods 2 1 incubation experiment the contaminated site was a factory used for lamp holder manufacturing it is adjacent to the yangtze river estuary text s1 fig s1 the high phreatic level leads to a potential risk of saltwater intrusion zhao et al 2013 the characteristic features of rust streak and iron manganese nodules from the collected soil samples indicated the presence of the alternating redox conditions fig s2 the selected physicochemical properties of contaminated soils are described in tables s2 and s3 and fig s3 in an incubation experiment pw represented the shallow groundwater without saltwater intrusion the ion composition and concentration of pw were in accordance with those in the shanghai geological environment bulletin 2009 2014 shanghai geological environment bulletin 2021 as follows 6 5 mmol l na 2 4 mmol l ca2 1 6 mmol l mg2 5 5 mmol l cl 1 0 mmol l so4 2 6 5 mmol l hco3 and 0 5 mmol l no3 bw and sw were prepared to simulate the intrusion of low salinity saltwater and extreme high salinity seawater deionized water dw was used as the control dw is cold water that has been boiled and aerated with nitrogen 99 99 in the glove box for 30 min all solutions were initially prepared with dw in a glove box filled with n2 except for the addition of sodium chloride 409 41 mmol l dong et al 2019 sw had the same ionic composition and concentration as pw a 1 10 dilution of sw namely bw was generated by adding one part of the sw solution to nine parts of the dw solution dong et al 2018 glucose at 2 78 mmol l was added to mimic the natural bioavailable dissolution of organic matter which occurred during the experiment the ion composition of each solution is shown in table s4 the experimental operations were performed in the glove box a vial with a butyl rubber stopper tightened with aluminum crimps contained a 1 2 mass ratio of the contaminated soil 2 mm to saltwater a blank soil supernatant 2 ml containing a natural microbial community was added to the vial as the inoculum fulda et al 2013 the supernatant was obtained by extracting fresh blank soil 20 g after equilibration with 40 ml of deionized water for 2 days then the soil groundwater system with saltwater intrusion was simulated by anaerobically incubating the mixture of the contaminated soil and saline groundwater in a shaking incubator at 25 c for 30 days denoted as reduction phase red in n2 atmosphere 99 99 subsequently the aerobic process was conducted within 28 days after opening the butyl rubber bottle stopper for air exposure denoted as re oxidation phase reox fulda et al 2013 to avoid disturbance by sampling and handling two repetitions were performed for each mud sample at different incubation times and the obtained samples were placed in separate vials all sampling operations under anaerobic incubation were conducted in the glove box in n2 atmosphere 99 99 2 2 sampling and analysis time series redox potential eh and ph level of the simulated soil groundwater system in the red phase days 1 5 10 15 20 and 30 and the reox phase days 2 7 14 and 28 were determined using platinum and saturated calomel electrodes after sufficient redox equilibrium 15 min after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min the supernatants were separated from the mixture and passed through 0 22 μm nylon filters the metal ion concentration of the filtrate was measured by icp oes agilent 5110 usa the dissolved organic carbon doc and inorganic carbon ic content of the filtrate were determined by toc vcpn shimadzu japan the centrifuged bulk soil was vacuum dried and then ground in the glove box with an agate mortar in n2 atmosphere to analyze the hm speciation and iron oxide component 0 15 mm the poorly crystalline iron oxide feo to crystalline iron oxide fed ratio feo fed was calculated the chemical speciation of hms in the bulk soil was determined by the modified european community bureau of reference bcr sequential extraction method to characterize the indigenous microbial communities 16s rrna high throughput sequencing was performed a detailed description is shown in text s2 the accuracy of total ni and zn analysis was evaluated by analyzing a certified reference sample of soil gss 1a gbw074011a a good agreement of the measured zn 472 15 mg kg and ni 15 99 mg kg contents was achieved with the certified zn 475 30 0 mg kg acceptable and ni 16 9 1 5 mg kg acceptable contents of gss 1a the standard ni and zn recovery rates were 95 42 and 92 44 respectively 2 3 micro xrf xanes analysis the synchrotron based micro x ray fluorescence and x ray absorption near edge structure μ xrf xanes were determined at the very sensitive elemental and structural probe employing radiation from a synchrotron beamline vespers 07b2 1 of canadian light source the sample preparation method for μ xrf xanes is shown in text s3 the bulk soil samples on the 20th day of red and the 28th day of reox were collected and used for μ xrf xanes analysis ni and zn k edge xanes spectra were obtained from the ni and zn hotspots according to μ xrf mapping data processing was performed by using the athena 0 9 26 and sixpack software text s4 ravel and newville 2005 webb 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 saltwater intrusion changes the hydrochemical properties of groundwater and soil microbial communities in the red and reox stages of pw without saltwater intrusion bw with saltwater intrusion and sw with extreme saltwater intrusion the following hydrochemical properties were determined redox potential eh mv ph dissolved in organic carbon and the release of ni ii zn ii fe ii and mn ii figs 1 and s4 in the red stage all eh values gradually decreased with time up to a stable level the soil in pw abbreviated as pws showed the fastest eh decline to 36 5 mv on red 5 5th day of red and reached the lowest eh 53 5 mv on red 15 by contrast the soils in bw and sw abbreviated as bws and sws respectively presented a gentler decrease in eh and reached the lowest values on the red 10 with intensifying salinity invasion the decrease in eh was inhibited the eh of sws only dropped to 43 mv on reox 28 these eh values quickly rebounded and recovered their original state due to an air ingress the ph of the soil groundwater system was sensitive to the changes in redox fluctuation the initial ph of the soil in groundwater rapidly decreased with increasing salinity fig s4a sws showed a steeper and lower descent than bws and pws because of the more exchangeable h in higher salinity groundwater wong et al 2010 when the ph level reached the lowest values on the 5th day the ph increased slowly until the end of the incubation whether in the red or reox fig s4a because the dissolved ic consisting of carbonate fig s4b could consume the h produced by the exchange of na ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater matrix wong et al 2013 in the red stage the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc continued to decrease fig s4c because of the anaerobic consumption of organic substrates by soil microorganisms during the reduction of fe iii bearing minerals chen et al 2020 after 20 days of anaerobic incubation the doc in the system maintained a slow change at low concentration resulting in a slight rebound of the eh in the various saltwater invaded soils fig 1a frohne et al 2014 high throughput sequencing was used to study the effects of saline intrusion on the diversity and structure of soil microbial communities the total amplicon sequence variants asvs of pws bws and sws in red 20 were 213 208 and 157 respectively table s5 which indicated that the richness of soil microbial species decreased with increasing salinity hartman et al 2020 shannon and simpson indexes were in the following order pws dws bws sws table s5 this order showed that proper salinity in pw can increase the diversity of microorganisms whereas high salinity bw and sw can reduce the diversity of soil microorganisms navarro et al 2015 principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used to explore and to visualize similarities or dissimilarities of bacterial communities in soils invaded by saltwater with different salinities fig 2 a a closer plotting of two samples generally indicates a more similar composition pei et al 2017 the plots of pws were close to those of bws and far from those of dws and sws thereby indicating that the bacterial community composition of pws was similar to that of bws and different from those of dws and sws the results were consistent with the eh changes fig 1a bacterial classification at the genus level is shown in fig 2b the main genera included bacillus herbaspirillum ralstonia cellulomonas and cupriavidus upgma clustering results also showed significant differences in dominant bacteria genus under different saltwater invasion conditions fig s5 under anaerobic conditions in pws and bws the development of anaerobic bacteria and iron reducing associated bacteria was induced to form different degrees of soil reduction conditions herbaspirillum is a nitrogen fixing facultative anaerobe that shows higher activity in denitrification and organic matter degradation under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions yuan et al 2012 compared with the abundance of herbaspirillum in dws that in pws increased by 30 5 and that in bws only increased by 4 8 fig 2b thus high salinity bw and no salinity dw soils were not suitable for the development of facultative anaerobes ralstonia is related to soil contaminated by hms and is the dominant genus in the process of reducing and enriching iron citrate source fe iii in paddy soils under anaerobic conditions wang et al 2009 compared with the relative abundance of ralstonia in dws those in pws and bws increased by 5 6 and 8 1 respectively fig 2b whereas that in sws was close to zero this finding clearly suggested that the invasion of sw with extreme salinity inhibited the activity of the iron reduction associated bacteria which agreed with the previous results i e pws and bws could reduce and dissolve fe more than sws in the red stage fig 1d aerobic bacteria are inhibited under anaerobic conditions cellulomonas in dws is aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacterium related to cellulose degradation in soil hatayama et al 2013 cupriavidus is a strict aerobe that is widely found in hm contaminated soils li et al 2018 the relative abundance of these two bacteria in pws and bws dropped to less than 1 fig 2b bacillus is an anaerobic or facultative anaerobic salt tolerant bacterium with strong stress resistance it is the dominant bacteria in the delta saline wetlands li et al 2014 therefore in sws with extremely high salinity bacillus became the main dominant genus and the relative abundance of the remaining genera was less than 5 fig 2b 3 2 ni zn im mobilization in pw is controlled by the dissolution and precipitation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides 3 2 1 redox driven mobilization and immobilization of ni zn in the red stage the zn release was higher than the ni release due to the higher content of zn than ni in soils fig 1b and c table s2 the ni zn released from pws included the exchangeable ni zn on soil minerals and the ni zn released from the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxide fig 1d ponting et al 2021 zhao et al 2013 the dissolution amounts of ni zn gradually decreased and reached equilibrium on red 20 which might be related to the reprecipitation of ni zn with soluble ic e g carbonate in pw ottosen et al 2008 this result was consistent with the continuous decline in the concentration of dissolved ic in the red fig s4b finally the dissolution precipitation of ni zn reached equilibrium within 20 30 days and ni zn release no longer increased fig 1b and c in the reox stage the free ni zn in pws continued to decrease which might be related to the formation of insoluble ni zn carbonate precipitate and the reprecipitation of fe oxyhydr oxide ni zn could be re immobilized by the latter at near neutral ph fig 1b d han et al 2019 rinklebe et al 2016 the released manganese in red did not reprecipitate in reox fig s4d because the formation of mn hydr oxide requires very strong oxidation conditions approximately 900 1000 mv at ph 5 frohne et al 2014 therefore the re immobilization of ni zn with mn hydr oxide in reox was nearly impossible 3 2 2 ni zn species transformation in pws the im mobilization of ni zn was determined by the transformation of ni zn species in redox fluctuating pws pw system without saltwater intrusion the boxplots in figs 3 a d and s6 summarized the differences in ni zn species between the red and reox in pws the transformation dynamics of ni and zn species are shown in figs s7 s10 and the detailed analysis was shown in text s5 dws served as a control and its eh did not fluctuate significantly fig 1a whereas pws showed significant eh changes in the red stage of pws pws red the content of reducible ni and zn f2 ni zn and weak acid extractable zn f1 zn decreased significantly compared with dws red fig 3a d in addition f2 ni zn and f1 zn in the reox stage of pws pws reox significantly increased compared with pws red fig 3a d moreover f1 ni increased by 27 6 but did not reach a significant level fig 3a ni and zn contents in the oxidizable f3 ni zn and residual f4 ni zn fractions did not change significantly fig s6 the f1 included exchangeable ni zn and carbonate bound ni zn whereas the f2 included iron manganese oxide bound ni zn pueyo et al 2008 in anaerobic derivatized reduction the ni zn bounded fe oxyhydr oxide was dissolved with decreasing eh thereby resulting in the release of ni zn into pw ponting et al 2021 the exchanged ni zn and the released ni zn from fe oxyhydr oxide were readily subjected to precipitation with carbonates in pw when the aerobic derived oxidation condition was recovered ni and zn in pw would recombine with the reprecipitated fe oxyhydr oxide han et al 2019 zhang and furman 2021 3 2 3 response of ni zn species to feo fed ratio to further clarify the relationship between the dissolution precipitation of fe oxyhydr oxide and the im mobilization of ni zn in the redox horizon the feo fed ratio was used to describe the degree of conversion of crystalline fe oxides to poorly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide in the soil groundwater system owliaie 2013 the increase decrease of feo fed ratio value corresponded to the increase decrease of the proportion of poorly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide owliaie 2013 the redox driven dynamics of feo fed ratio are shown in fig 4 a in the red the feo fed ratio in pws decreased significantly compared with that in dws fig 4b the continuous decrease of feo fed ratio showed that the weakly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide continued to dissolve with the ni zn release on the contrary the feo fed ratio rebounded rapidly in the reox fig 4a and the values of pws were significantly higher than those in the red fig 4b thereby implying that the dissolved iron reprecipitates as weakly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide under oxidation conditions in the redox fluctuation the feo fed ratios in pws were significantly and positively correlated with eh and f2 ni zn contents respectively r 0 9346 0 9743 p 0 001 fig s11a c suggesting that the change of f2 ni zn under redox fluctuation was highly related to the dissolution and reprecipitation of weakly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide 3 2 4 identification of ni zn species on pws based on μ xrf xanes analysis the μ xrf xanes was used to accurately obtain key micro interfacial evidences of ni zn species transformation in the pws pw system thereby laying a foundation for the further elucidation of the role of fe oxyhydr oxide in the ni zn im mobilization process at first the synchrotron radiation based μ xrf was used to map the metal element localization in red 20 and reox 28 on the soil micro interface of dws and pws as shown in fig s12a d either in the red or the reox the distribution of ni and zn in pws had a very significant spatial correlation r 0 813 and 0 871 p 0 001 fig s13c d which indicated that they might have the same combination in the soil moreover both ni and zn were distributed in the overlap area of fe mn k and ca fig s12c d fe and mn distribution are usually associated with the iron manganese oxides the distribution of k and ca is closely related to clay minerals containing potassium and calcium fan et al 2016 the spatial distribution correlation coefficient between ni zn and fe r 0 563 0 729 p 0 001 was higher than that of mn r 0 429 0 573 p 0 001 fig s13c d indicating that the distribution of ni zn is highly consistent with that of fe oxyhydr oxide mamindy pajany et al 2014 moreover the correlation coefficient between ni zn and fe was higher than that between ni zn and k ca r 0 162 0 583 p 0 001 fig s13c d because the exchange of ni zn in the clay mineral surface was accompanied by the departure of k ca gu and evans 2007 by contrast iron oxide was directly bound to ni zn thus no ion exchange occurred ponthieu et al 2006 based on the 2d element distribution of the red 20 and reox 28 soil from μ xrf analysis the hotspots in the distribution of both fe mn k ca and ni zn complexes for each experimental treatment were selected for μ xanes analysis fig s12 a d the normalized ni and zn k edge xanes spectra of each hotspot and the references are shown in fig s14 and the detailed description and analysis of xanes spectra are presented in text s6 according to principal component analysis pca results tables s6 and s7 target transformation tables s8 and s9 and soil medium composition table s3 illite ni zn illite adsorbed nickel and zinc fh ni zn ferrihydrite bound ni zn ha ni zn humic acid adsorbed nickel and zinc and cb ni zn nickel carbonate basic hydrate and zinc carbonate basic were the key species of ni zn in the soil these were selected as reference materials for the lcf analysis of ni and zn xanes spectra 3 2 5 the key role of ferrihydrite in ni zn species transformation the lcf results of the ni and zn k edge xanes spectra of pws and dws at each spot are shown in figs s15 and s16 and tables s10 and s11 the combinations of these four references provided statistically acceptable fits r factor 0 0031 0 0164 χ2 0 2098 0 8125 yang et al 2020 the distribution of each ni and zn species is summarized in fig 5 the ni zn species transformation in dws was weak fig 5a b and the details are shown in text s7 when pws was in an anaerobic state the reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite dominated the transformation of ni and zn in the redox horizon the fh ni 12 and fh zn 5 in the 20th day of red pws red pws 20 were significantly decreased by 17 and 12 respectively compared with those of red dws 20 fig 5a b the illite ni 53 and illite zn 60 of red pws 20 were slightly reduced by 7 and 6 respectively the dissolved fh ni zn content was higher than that of the exchanged content of illite ni zn thereby indicating that the primary cause of cb ni zn increase was the reductively dissolved fh ni zn accordingly the cb ni 32 and cb zn 32 showed 24 and 19 increase in red pws 20 respectively compared with red dws 20 fig 5a b when pws was under oxidation conditions the illite ni zn maintained a continuous ion exchange capacity and the ferrihydrite was precipitated simultaneously fig 5a b thereby resulting in the re immobilization of the dissolved ni zn at that time the binding ability between carbonate and free ni zn was weak because the dissolved carbonate was almost exhausted in the reox fig s4b compared with red pws 20 the 28th day of reox pws reox pw 28 showed the 11 and 4 decrease of illite ni and illite zn respectively fig 5a b by contrast the fh ni 19 and fh zn 14 in reox pw 28 increased by 7 and 9 respectively fig 5a b 3 3 saltwater intrusion weakens the role of fe oxyhydr oxide in ni zn im mobilization 3 3 1 saltwater intrusion affects the release of ni zn from bws and sws higher salinity is associated with more exchangeable cations wong et al 2010 when saltwater invades the shallow aquifer more base ions na ca2 and mg2 from saltwater bring more opportunities to exchange the exchangeable ni zn in soil clay minerals zhao et al 2013 therefore the amount of ni and zn released in groundwater was in the following order sws bws pws fig 1b and c however the dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxide for sws and bws did not occur during the initial 1 5 days of the red stage because eh had not yet been significantly reduced at that time fig 1d and a simmler et al 2017 fig 1d shows that the release of fe from bws was significantly higher than that from sws during the following 5 30 days of red and this finding was consistent with the result that the high salinity of sw inhibited the development of anaerobic non halotolerant and iron reducing related bacteria fig 2b morrissey and franklin 2015 during the reox stage the ni zn released from bws and sws showed a continuous decreasing trend fig 1b and c which indicated that the re immobilization of free ni zn still occurred in the saltwater invaded system however the re immobilization mode of free ni zn may be regulated by salinity change the im mobilization of ni zn in the reox stage of bws reox bws was similar to that in the reox pws the reductively dissolved fe was reprecipitated fig 1d and the free ic content also decreased fig s4b indicating that the free ni zn in the bws may be re immobilized by binding with free carbonate or reprecipitated fe oxyhydr oxide when the invading saltwater reached seawater salinity the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxide was inhibited and the reprecipitation ability of reductively dissolved fe in the reox stage of sws reox sws was very weak fig 1d meanwhile the free ic content was greatly reduced fig s4b this finding indicated that after seawater intrusion free ni zn in reox sws may be immobilized by carbonate rather than reprecipitated by fe oxyhydr oxide 3 3 2 ni zn species transformation under high and low salinity stress the apparent release of ni zn from redox fluctuating soils under saltwater invasion suggested the salinity dependent im mobilization of ni zn associated with ion exchange and fe oxyhydr oxide dissolution precipitation based on bcr sequential extraction the transformation of chemically extractable ni zn species in saltwater invaded soil groundwater system with redox fluctuation was analyzed both f1 ni zn and f2 ni zn in the red stage of bws bws red were significantly reduced compared with those in the dws red and the changes in f1 ni zn and f2 ni zn between bws red and bws reox reached a significant level fig 3a d in response to saltwater intrusion the f1 ni and f1 zn contents in bws at red 20 increased by 39 5 mg kg 28 6 and 130 3 mg kg 21 2 respectively compared with red 1 moreover these levels maintained equilibrium in the reox stage figs s8c and s10c however the f2 ni and f2 zn contents in red 20 decreased by 61 0 mg kg 15 4 and 50 1 mg kg 12 1 compared with those in red 1 and increased by 82 9 mg kg 24 5 and 95 8 mg kg 27 2 in reox 58 figs s8c and s10c the change trend of ni zn species in redox fluctuating bws was similar to that in pws the content of exchangeable ni zn and the carbonate bound ni zn involved in f1 ni zn showed a steady upward trend during the entire redox process and the content of iron manganese oxide bound ni zn involved in f2 ni zn showed a downward trend in red and an upward trend in reox figs s8c and s10c pueyo et al 2008 when bw intruded into the shallow aquifer the iron manganese oxide bound ni zn was transformed to exchangeable ni zn or carbonate bound ni zn in bws red and the re immobilization of free ni zn by reprecipitated fe oxyhydr oxide occurred in bws reox however the increase in salinity of the intruding saltwater might inhibit the dissolution of fe oxyhydr oxide bound ni zn in the red stage in which the f2 ni zn contents in bws 15 4 and 12 1 showed a lower reduction rate than those in pws 19 7 and 20 5 by contrast in the reox the growth rates of f2 ni zn in bws 24 5 and 27 2 were similar to those in pws 26 5 and 23 9 figs s8b c and s10b c when sw intruded into the shallow aquifer the f1 ni and f1 zn contents in sws increased by 76 2 mg kg 68 2 and 195 6 mg kg 32 6 during the entire redox process from red 1 to reox 58 figs s8d and s10d and these levels were higher than those in bws the change of f1 ni zn between red and reox reached a significant level fig 3a and c however the f2 ni zn content in sws did not change significantly during the whole redox process fig 3b and d the growth rate of f1 ni zn in soil redox horizon was in the following order sws 68 2 and 32 6 bws 28 6 and 21 2 pws 27 6 and 19 8 figs s8b d and s10b d this finding indicated that increasing salinity promoted the formation of carbonate bound or exchangeable ni and zn and the intrusion of seawater into the redox horizon may inhibit the im mobilization of ni and zn mediated by the dissolution precipitation of fe oxyhydr oxide 3 3 3 saltwater invasion inhibits fe oxyhydr oxide dissolution precipitation the feo fed ratio of bsw also had a significant positive correlation with eh r 8604 p 0 01 fig s11a in the red the feo fed ratio of bws was lower than that of dws and higher than that of pws fig 4a this result was due to the higher eh of bws than that of pws which was unfavorable for the dissolution of sro fe oxyhydr oxide owliaie 2013 on the contrary the feo fed ratio of bws rebounded rapidly in the reox fig 4a and reached a significant level compared with bws red fig 4b indicating that the dissolved iron was reprecipitated in the form of a weakly crystalline sro fe oxyhydr oxide under saltwater invasion owliaie 2013 however the linear fitting slope of feo fed ratio vs eh in bws 9 33 10 5 was greatly lower than that in pws 2 15 10 4 fig s11a indicating that saltwater invasion markedly suppressed sro fe oxyhydr oxide dissolution precipitation due to the relatively small fluctuations in eh in bws the feo fed ratio was significantly positively correlated with f2 ni r 0 7564 p 0 05 and f2 zn r 0 8546 p 0 01 but their linear fitting slopes 2 44 10 4 and 2 78 10 4 respectively were lower than those in pws 6 87 10 4 and 6 70 10 4 respectively fig s11b and c saltwater invasion would regulate the release of ni zn by inhibiting the dissolution precipitation of sro fe oxyhydr oxide bound ni zn resulting in the lower release of ni zn in bws than that in pws for sws the feo fed ratio did not change significantly during the entire redox process fig 4 in addition no significant correlation was found between feo fed ratio and eh and between feo fed ratio and f2 ni zn in sws fig s11d f indicating that the sro fe oxyhydr oxide mediated dissolution of ni zn was inhibited such inhibition was due to the strong anti microbial activity of an extremely high salinity environment table s5 and fig 2b morrissey and franklin 2015 accordingly the ni zn re immobilization mediated by the regenerated sro fe oxyhydr oxide was suppressed 3 3 4 saltwater invasion enhances illite mediated im mobilization of ni zn according to μ xrf results saltwater intrusion did not change the distribution of ni zn on the soil micro interface fig s12e h in red 20 and reox 28 the spatial distribution of ni zn and fe mn in bws and sws showed a significant positive spatial correlation r 0 340 0 685 p 0 001 fig s13e h the correlation between ni zn and k ca of bws and sws in red 20 r 0 140 0 383 p 0 001 and reox 28 r 0 058 0 117 p 0 01 was lower than that of red pws r 0 279 0 583 p 0 001 and reox pws r 0 162 0 213 p 0 001 fig s13c h indicating that saltwater intrusion enhanced the ni zn and k ca exchange which decreased the correlation between ni zn and k ca gu and evans 2007 the lcf analysis provided statistically acceptable fits r factor 0 0042 0 1290 χ2 0 2379 0 9872 yang et al 2020 figs s15 and s16 tables s10 and s11 the transformation pathway of the ni zn species in bws was similar to that in pws but the dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite was weakened compared with red dws 20 the ferrihydrite on the 20th day of red bws red bws 20 could also dissolve and release ni zn the contribution of dissolved fh ni to the increase in cb ni in the red bws 20 12 was less than that in red pws 20 17 fig 5a this finding indicated that the role of fh ni gradually weakened with increasing salinity but the contribution of dissolved fh ni to the increase of cb ni was still higher than that of illite ni 5 in red bws 20 fig 5a however the contribution of dissolved fh zn to the increase in cb zn 8 was lower than that of ion exchangeable illite zn 12 in the red bws 20 fig 5b indicating that illite zn replaced fh zn to contribute to the release of zn ii during the reox ferrihydrite was reprecipitated and the free ni zn was converted to fh ni zn fh ni 22 and fh zn 14 increased by 5 on the 28th day of reox bws reox bws 28 compared with red bws 20 fig 5a b fh ni still played a dominant role in the conversion of ni species in red stage under bw intrusion however the dominant role of fh zn in red was replaced by illite zn and the reprecipitated fh ni zn was still the main fate of re immobilized ni zn in reox seawater salinity could further inhibit the function of ferrihydrite and alter the immobilized pathway of ni zn fig 5d in sws the fh ni and fh zn levels on the 20th day of red sws red sws 20 were only reduced by 6 and 2 respectively compared with those of red dws 20 the contribution of dissolved fh ni zn 2 6 to the increase of cb ni zn was lower than that of the ion exchangeable illite ni zn 7 15 fig 5a b indicating that illite ni zn substituted fh ni zn to contribute to the increase of cb ni zn in addition the fh ni zn of reox sws on the 28th day reox sws 28 remained unchanged compared with that of red sws 20 and the free ni zn was converted to cb ni zn compared with red sws 20 the contents of carbonate bound ni and zn increased by 9 and 8 respectively fig 5a b the analysis of ni zn species at the soil micro interface showed that seawater intrusion into the redox fluctuating soil resulted in the complete loss of the role of fh ni zn in ni zn im mobilization in pw and bw the im mobilization of ni zn in redox fluctuating soil groundwater system proceeded in the following pathway the ni zn released in the red stage came from the reductively dissolved ferrihydrite bound ni zn and the ion exchangeable illite ni zn and the part of the released ni zn was immobilized by carbonate to form cb ni zn the remaining free ni zn in the reox stage was immobilized by reprecipitated ferrihydrite figs 5c and s17 by contrast the im mobilization of ni zn in sw followed a new pathway the ni zn released by the ion exchangeable illite ni zn directly combined with carbonate to form cb ni zn because of the absence of the reprecipitation and immobilization of ferrihydrite under seawater intrusion conditions fig 5d 4 conclusion saltwater intrusion changed the ni zn im mobilization mechanism driven by fe oxyhydr oxide in redox fluctuating soil groundwater system in pw the ferrihydrite bound ni zn played a key role in the increase of cb ni zn in red pws and the reprecipitation of fh ni zn in reox pws which was regulated by the dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite under redox fluctuation conditions the increase in the salinity of the invading saltwater gradually inhibited the development of non salt tolerant anaerobes and iron reducing associated bacteria thereby resulting in the suppression of dissolution precipitation of ferrihydrite which changed the dominant species and pathway of ni zn im mobilization when bw invaded the ion exchangeable illite zn replaced reductively dissolved fh zn to control the release of zn ii whereas the reductively dissolved fh ni still played a dominant role in cb ni increment in the red in reox bws the reprecipitated fh ni zn was still the main fate of re immobilized ni zn under sw invasion conditions the ferrihydrite dissolution precipitation hardly occurred in the red stage the ion exchangeable illite ni zn replaced the reductively dissolved fh ni zn as the main source to release ni zn however in the reox stage cb ni zn replaced the reprecipitated fh ni zn as the main phase to re immobilize free ni zn the cb ni zn became the main fate of the re immobilized ni zn under sw invasion whether in the red stage or the reox stage permeable reactive barrier prb is one of the most promising passive treatment technologies for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater obiri nyarko et al 2014 it has been applied for the removal of heavy metals e g ni and zn from tide influenced aquifers in coastal regions ludwig et al 2002 navarro et al 2006 approximately 60 of prbs employed iron based materials as reactive media henderson and demond 2007 li et al 2022 however our study reveals the adverse effect of seawater intrusion on the immobilization of ni zn by iron based materials ferrihydrite bound ni zn is easily transformed into carbonate bound ni zn precipitates therefore non ferrous reaction media such as activated carbon and zeolite may be more suitable for remediation of metal contaminated soil groundwater under seawater intrusion and redox fluctuation conditions which cannot only maintain the remediation performance of prb but also prevent the decrease of hydraulic conductivity of prb

15766,lead is a chemical contaminant that threatens public health and high levels of lead have been identified in drinking water at locations across the globe under served populations that use private systems for drinking water supplies may be at an elevated level of risk because utilities and governing agencies are not responsible for ensuring that lead levels meet the lead and copper rule at these systems predictive models that can be used by residents to assess water quality threats in their households can create awareness of water lead levels wlls this research explores and compares the use of statistical models i e bayesian belief classifiers and machine learning models i e ensemble of decision trees for predicting wlls models are developed using a dataset collected by the virginia household water quality program vahwqp at approximately 8000 households in virginia during 2012 2017 the dataset reports laboratory tested water quality parameters at households location information and household and plumbing characteristics including observations of water odor taste discoloration some water quality parameters such as ph iron and copper can be measured at low resolution by residents using at home water test kits and can be used to predict risk of wlls the use of at home water quality test kits was simulated through the discretization of water quality parameter measurements to match the resolution of at home water quality test kits and the introduction of error in water quality readings using this approach this research demonstrates that low resolution data collected by residents can be used as input for models to estimate wlls model predictability was explored for a set of at home water quality test kits that observe a variety of water quality parameters and report parameters at a range of resolutions the effects of the timing of water sampling e g first draw vs flushed samples and error in kits on model error were tested through

irreversible effects such as loss of academic performance decline in problem solving skills hyperactivity and increased risk of alzheimers disease later in life reuben 2018 wani et al 2015 as demonstrated by water crises in washington d c in 2004 flint michigan in 2014 and newark new jersey in 2018 drinking water is a potential pathway for lead exposure edwards et al 2009 hanna attisha et al 2016 lytle et al 2020 pieper et al 2018 lead pipes faucets and fixtures can serve as sources of lead in drinking water as lead bearing plumbing materials corrode due to high acidity or low mineral content in water for homes that draw water from community water systems lead service lines or lead pipes that connect homes to the water main are often the most significant source of lead in the water when they are present sandvig et al 2009 for homes that use private water systems such as wells brass faucets and fixtures galvanized iron pipes and plumbing with lead solder can contribute to high water lead levels wlls the world health organization identifies lead as one of the major chemical contaminants threatening public health world health organization 2016 and the u s environmental protection agency usepa developed the lead and copper rule lcr to regulate lead in public drinking water systems the maximum contaminant level goal mclg for lead in drinking water was set at zero because there is no known safe level of lead exposure vorvolakos et al 2016 world health organization 2016 mclgs however are non enforceable health goals and are developed based on potential health risks and not treatment technologies the lcr specifies an enforceable lead action level of 15 parts per billion ppb and if more than 10 of tap water samples exceed the lead action level in community water systems then additional actions to mitigate lead are required united states environmental protection agency 1991 while the lcr applies to public drinking water systems private drinking water systems are not regulated by the usepa or subject to the requirements of the lcr united states environmental protection agency 1993 2012 private water systems include private wells cisterns and springs which serve no more than 25 people at least 60 days of the year and have 15 or fewer service connections approximately 14 of u s households rely on private drinking water systems maupin et al 2014 and residents using these systems may be vulnerable to exposure to lead because they lack the equipment and training required to manage lead in water morris et al 2016 pieper et al 2015a swistock et al 2013 many residents do not participate in testing to measure lead levels in drinking water and lack information about the risk of lead due to barriers such as awareness about the issue or the cost and availability of testing cost and inconvenience also limit the adoption of sequential sampling which could be implemented to identify the source of lead in drinking water and to monitor the effects of available lead mitigation strategies jarvis and fawell 2021 laboratory methods are resource intensive inconvenient and difficult to implement widely as a result many private water supplies are not monitored and remain vulnerable especially in resource limited contexts including some private drinking water systems that serve low income households the goal of this research is to develop modeling methods that can be applied to assess the risk of lead at households served by private drinking water systems predictive models can act as an early warning system to alert households of a risk of high wlls motivating households to pursue further testing or treatment while some descriptive models have been developed to characterize lead in drinking water for municipal systems abokifa et al 2020 goovaerts 2017a 2017b other research developed geostatistical and machine learning models to predict risk of lead by classifying drinking water at households as contaminated or not

pipes based on water quality sampling blackhurst 2021 machine learning approaches develop models that can accurately capture and predict complex systems but the models have intricate structures are difficult to interpret and may not provide insight about the relationships among variables mittelstadt et al 2019 by contrast statistical methods can provide insight about a problem by focusing on the relationships among variables inference creates and fits a probability model for a specific problem bzdok et al 2018 a bayesian belief network bbn is a statistical modeling method that uses a data driven approach to develop a compact and intuitive graphical model for representing probabilistic relationships among variables heckerman and wellman 1995 korb and nicholson 2004 in previous research fasaee et al 2021 developed bbn models to classify wlls at households unlike prior studies for flint and pittsburgh abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 goovaerts 2018 2019 hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 the bbn models were developed to classify wlls for households that draw water from private drinking water systems features that are used as input variables include laboratory tested water quality parameters such as copper cu iron fe and ph household and plumbing characteristics observations of water odor taste and color location information the bbn models that were developed by fasaee et al 2021 have limited application in directly assessing the risk of lead at households due to the characteristics of the models first the most significant features in predicting lead are water quality parameters that are reported at high precision and accuracy through laboratory testing water quality parameters account for a substantial percentage of the predictability of models households however do not typically have access to laboratory water quality testing capability rendering these models unusable as early warning systems second at least two different samples of water are needed to accurately capture important dimensions of water lead risk the first draw sample requires at least six hours of stagnation and is typically collected in the morning the first draw sample represents the concentration of heavy metals including copper and lead as metals typically leach out of plumbing during stagnant periods a second flushed sample should be taken after the tap is open for at least one minute to measure ph fluoride f and nitrate no 3 n including both first draw and flushed samples or bottles improves the accurate representation of water quality but increases the complexity of collecting pertinent water quality parameters finally the models that were developed in previous research cannot be used at households in new regions because location data including county and physiographic province were important predictors this research describes and develops bbn models that can be used by households without the need for laboratory tested water quality parameters in this research we explore at home water quality testing as an alternative data source that households can use to improve the accuracy and precision of predicting wlls at home water quality test kits report discretized water quality parameters such as copper iron ph chlorine and hardness the use of at home water quality test kits is simulated in this research through the discretization of water quality parameter measurements to match the resolution of at home water quality test kits a range of kits are available and they differ in the number and set of parameters that are tested detection levels discretization and errors associated with readings this research investigates the effectiveness of using water quality data from different kits to predict wlls this research uses an existing dataset of laboratory tested water quality parameters and simulates that a set of water quality parameters were collected using at home kits by imposing artificial limits on detection levels and levels of data discretization for example laboratory tested data that reports a ph of 6 32 is changed to a level of 6 0 6 5 as reported by a water quality test kit we apply the bbn approach that was developed by fasaee et al 2021 to develop models that use simulated water quality data from at home test kits in addition to user reported household characteristics to classify wlls experiments test different water sampling times to simulate users who would test water quality using first draw or flushed samples the effect of different wll thresholds are assessed as they affect model predictability we simulate error in data collected by at home water quality test kits and assess model performance under increasing levels of error further bbns may not predict output as accurately as some machine learning approaches and this research develops and applies an ensemble of decision trees edts approach to compare with bbn approaches in developing new accessible and accurate models this research uses a comprehensive dataset of household characteristics and water quality at private water systems collected over a 5 year period including approximately 10 000 samples that were collected at different times at 8000 households the results of this research demonstrate that using at home water quality test kits can improve the predictive capability of models compared to only using variables such as household characteristics and location data these findings demonstrate the potential value of at home water quality test kits when used within a predictive modeling approach to serve as an early warning system that can alert households about the risk of high wlls the approach developed through this research can be used as a tool to identify households that are most at risk of high wlls and to prioritize households that should be tested for lead using more accurate laboratory based approaches 2 water quality testing and at home kits wlls can be measured using laboratory testing on site testing and at home testing kits measurement approaches vary in levels of accuracy reliability accessibility convenience and cost among the available options laboratory testing is the most expensive option and reports the highest accuracy and reliability on site testing can use spectrophotometric fluorescence based methods and anodic stripping voltammetry asv analysis which are portable fast relatively easy to use and relatively inexpensive cartier et al 2012 doré et al 2020 schock and george 1993 however these tests may be subject to interferences from other analytes in water and may not detect particulate lead leading to underestimates of wlls cartier et al 2012 doré et al 2020 schock and george 1993 while these technologies have lower capital costs than laboratory testing costs of portable instrumentation and disposable supplies can be significant cartier et al 2012 doré et al 2020 moreover on site testing requires technical expertise and cannot be reliably conducted by laypersons deshommes et al 2016 doré et al 2020 schock and george 1993 in contrast at home lead in water test kits that are low cost and commercially available may provide a good alternative for water consumers the efficacy accuracy and reliability of at home tests however are uncertain several organizations e g good housekeeping institute consumer reports have evaluated these commercially available at home kits but the testing was limited and failed to evaluate more complex problems associated with detecting particulate lead kriss et al 2021 sweigart marge 2021 the good housekeeping institute 2012 this research aims to integrate the power of statistical and machine learning with the convenience of at home water quality testing to predict risk of high wlls in this research the effect of error on the prediction capability of models is explored through sensitivity analysis and further research is recommended to fully characterize the error associated with at home testing in the field 3 materials and methods 3 1 virginia private water supply dataset the virginia household water quality program vahwqp collected 9723 water samples from 8172 unique private drinking water systems through collaboration with residents from 2012 to 2017 residents collected two bottles of water first draw and flushed samples the first draw sample was collected in the morning after at least six hours of stagnation a flushed sample was collected after at least one minute of flushing to measure ph fluoride f and nitrate no 3 n concentrations concentrations of fluoride and nitrate and ph levels are only assessed for the flushed sample samples were also analyzed for a variety of other water quality constituents including iron fe and copper cu hardness was calculated from magnesium mg and calcium ca concentrations vahwqp also collected data about household characteristics and the aesthetic properties of tap water through a resident completed questionnaire residents described their source of water well type well depth type of treatment device s if any water testing interval and other water characteristics such as taste color odor staining and the presence of floating particles in the tap water further details about sample collection and analysis were reported by pieper et al 2015b 3 1 1 database cleaning the dataset collected by vahwqp reports 159 features e g water quality system characteristics water observation and wlls for each sample sparse features were identified and removed using the following rule if the total number of missing values for one feature exceeded a threshold i e 5 of the total number of samples that feature was eliminated the dataset was subsequently cleaned to remove samples with missing values which resulted when respondents did not answer survey questions or water quality parameters were not measured the modified dataset included 9071 water samples from 7790 unique households including 111 features and one predictand variable pbx which was the presence of lead at a concentration above the threshold of 15 ppb as measured in the first draw samples 3 2 classifiers in this research two approaches were explored to predict the risk of exposure to lead a bbn framework was developed to focus on the probability of lead contamination and provide insight about the relationships among variables an edt approach was developed to explore how machine learning based models perform edt models can be difficult to interpret but may improve predictive capabilities the following sections provide more information about these approaches 3 2 1 bayesian belief network framework this research applied a bbn framework to construct models that classify water samples as contaminated or uncontaminated based on a pb threshold of 15 ppb a bbn is an elegant model that can be used to characterize the relationships among variables that predict the predictand node a bbn provides a principled approach to find explanations for observed evidence by modeling the quantitative strength of the relationship between variables and representing probabilistic beliefs about relationships these beliefs are updated based on observed data about the system pearl 2014 bbn models are commonly used in environmental assessment and management problems because they can handle diverse scales and uncertainty and they can effectively incorporate domain knowledge in the modeling process kelly et al 2013 bbn models have been used in water domains where data are scarce phan et al 2016 and they have been implemented to model and assess a range of environmental and water quality systems carvajal et al 2017 kabir et al 2015 reckhow 1999 troldborg et al 2013 the ability of bbns to update beliefs or probabilities using new information about a subset of the variables which is known as partial evidence provides a robust tool to predict in uncertain conditions yuan et al 2011 further because bbns use a structured modeling approach the relationships among features can be readily inspected and understood from the set of directed relationships that is generated through the modeling process a bbn model is constructed through the processes of discretization feature selection and bayes classification two classifiers were tested here a naïve bayes nb classifier is the simplest bbn classifier and is constructed with one parent node or predictand feature and all other feature nodes are considered children of the parent node the model is constructed with the assumption that children nodes are independent and connections between children nodes are not allowed we also test a tree augmented naïve bayes tan classifier which is similar to the nb model however there is no assumption that children nodes are independent and network structures are formed that allow connections between pairs of children nodes this research applied the forward selection method to find the best subset of features forward selection is initialized with an empty model that contains no features and features are added to the model individually until all features have been added models are evaluated through cross validation based on a set of metrics that evaluate model performance a brief description of the bbn framework is provided in the appendix a 1 and further details are provided by fasaee et al 2021 3 2 2 ensemble of decision trees machine learning methods including decision trees have been applied in the water quality domain to classify the risk of hazards such as pipe failure and water quality problems mounce et al 2017 winkler et al 2018 decision trees are used to graphically represent a classification or regression problem a single decision tree has three major components a root node internal nodes and leaf or terminal nodes see fig a 1 in a decision tree each leaf node is assigned a class label the non terminal nodes which include the root and other internal nodes contain feature test conditions to separate records that have different characteristics the root node has no incoming edges and can have multiple outgoing edges each internal node has exactly one incoming edge and two or more outgoing edges and each leaf node has exactly one incoming edge and no outgoing edges chakure 2019 mathematically a single decision tree has low bias and high variance therefore averaging the result of many decision trees reduces the variance while maintaining low bias russell 2017 an ensemble of decision trees edts can be used to improve model performance edts group individual decision trees as one model to predict or to fit numerical and categorical data while edts are more robust in terms of bias and variance with generally a better prediction performance it is more difficult to analyze and gain insight using an edt compared to individual decision trees rokach 2010 further information about the edt approach is provided in appendix a 2 3 3 discretization in this study we used four discretization approaches to simulate the different types of water quality collection protocols that can be used to collect water quality data discretization methods transform continuous variables to discrete variables by defining categories or bins to define discrete values in this study water quality variables were continuous and had to be discretized for use in classifiers this research used data driven methods and the discretization or resolution of at home kits to transform continuous variables to discrete variables data driven methods represent that laboratory tested water quality data are used to predict wlls and machine learning and statistical approaches are used in analyzing and discretizing data in other experiments we used the resolution that was used to report water quality from at home water quality testing kits to discretize water quality data by using the resolution and range for water quality parameters from at home test kits we simulated that water quality data were collected by households instead of collected and tested at laboratories finally for one set of experiments we did not use water quality parameters or discretization methods and this represented cases where households did not have any water quality information available 3 3 1 data driven discretization discretizing continuous variables can improve the performance accuracy and interpretation of bbns madhu et al 2014 tsai et al 2008 and discretization has been shown to effectively reduce the error of a nb classifier yang and webb 2002 2003 2009 for bbn models a data driven discretization algorithm that is separate from the classifier approach is used to pre process continuous data data driven discretization methods that can be used with bbn models include statistical and information based types previous work compared nine discretization methods for a subset of the data used in this research for nb classifiers the minimum description length principle mdlp performed best for improving model performance mdlp is an information based method that uses entropy to discretize variables fayyad and irani 1993 garcia et al 2013 for tan classifiers the best performance was found using chimerge kerber 1992 as a discretization method chimerge uses statistical evaluation or tests to measure the correlation between the values of a feature and the target class kotsiantis and kanellopoulos 2006 the discretization package in r kim 2012 was used to implement data driven discretization methods for edt models the data driven discretization is a part of the learning algorithm that develops new decision trees in applying edts variables can be provided as discrete or continuous for continuous variables discretization is determined within the rusboost algorithm and the threshold that is used for any feature at each node in the decision tree is determined through the learning process for features that are provided as discrete variables the decision tree is built through a simpler process that does not determine feature thresholds at nodes 3 3 2 discretization using at home water quality kits this research simulated that households used at home kits by discretizing water quality variables based on test strips provided in at home kits out of 11 kits reported by kriss et al 2021 two kits were used for simulation in this research kit 1 includes many of the water quality parameters that exist in the dataset and uses the highest resolution in measuring the water quality parameters specifically for copper iron and fluoride table 1 kit 2 is one of the simplest kits available and measures only ph and hardness table 2 both kits cover a similar range of ph values and kit 1 provides a slightly higher level of resolution both kits use a similar level of resolution in reporting hardness though kit 1 detects across a higher range of values to apply the discretization schemes shown in tables 1 and 2 each water quality parameter was converted to a unique discrete reading or category which could then be used as input for the edt and bbn predictive models 4 experiments a set of experiments was developed to test the effect of model settings on the predictive capabilities of models experiments tested the effects of household characteristics location and water sampling data location is reported as county and physiographic province which is a geographic region with a shared geomorphology in virginia the five geographic provinces are the coastal plain piedmont blue ridge valley and ridge and appalachian plateau geomorphology governs groundwater flows and water quality physiographic provinces are labeled as aquifers in the following sections that report results location data were included in models at four levels including 1 county 2 aquifer 3 county and aquifer and 4 no location information three types of discretization methods were used as described above in section 3 3 a data driven discretization method to discretize laboratory collected data kit 1 and kit 2 as described above nb models used mdlp and tan models used chimerge for data driven discretization and edt models used the ruboost algorithm for data driven discretization water sampling data includes two types of water samples first draw and flushed first draw sampling collects data for all water quality parameters except ph fluoride and nitrate and flushed sampling collects all water quality parameters for experiments that were labeled first draw ph fluoride and nitrate were not available or included in the analysis for each prediction algorithm i e nb tan and edt 52 experiments were defined four experiments tested the use of household characteristics with four different types of location information as input variables without water sampling data the remaining 48 experiments tested combinations of two water sampling procedures three discretization methods for water quality parameters and four types of location information and two settings with and without for household characteristics the time associated with developing predictive models was evaluated for the experiments the predictive models were implemented on a workstation configuration with a dual cpu intel xeon gold 6230 with 2 1 ghz and 128 gb memory the training time was affected most by the choice of classifier the edt model required a few seconds to train each model while the bbn model took several hours because it first found the best subset of features through feature selection for each experiment based on the number of features in the dataset n f n f n f 1 2 different bbn models were constructed and the performance of models were calculated based on 100 models of cross validation the simulation run time for bbn models was between 5 0 and 7 0 h for each model leading to approximately 26 days to simulate all 104 bbn models a main worker implementation in r was used to balance the load and used all the available processors to reduce the computational cost of the bbn construction a parallel simulation was used these models were simulated in parallel by a main worker method where each processor simulates a bbn model these models were distributed among 40 processors reducing the total run time of generating 104 models to 19 h 5 results experiments were run to create 156 bbn and edt models for each model 10 runs of 10 fold cross validation were executed to tune model hyperparameters the performance for classifiers and discretization methods over validation datasets is shown in fig 1 complete results are reported in supplementary information as the average recall precision accuracy f 1 and area under the curve auc over 100 validation datasets for nb models table s1 tan models table s2 and edt models table s3 the accuracy of all bbn models was similar at around 84 fig 1 this was expected because the dataset was imbalanced and approximately 86 of samples did not have high lead i e wll 15 ppb the accuracy of edt models varied in the range of 50 80 fig 1 recall is an important measure for imbalanced datasets because it highlights the performance of accurately identifying positive samples while penalizing models for misclassifying positive samples as negative edt performance for recall was in the range of 45 75 while the performance of bbn models varied within a larger range from slightly greater than 0 for kit 2 and up to around 80 for data driven discretization precision measures the ability of the model to classify positive samples but penalizes models for misclassifying negative samples as positive tan models reported the highest value for precision compared with nb and edt models models typically showed a trade off between recall and precision and because f 1 was based on both recall and precision it provided a comprehensive representation of model performance and was an alternative for accuracy in assessing performance for imbalanced datasets for this application the performance based on f 1 values for models was similar to performance for recall with a wide range across high and low values for bbn models and a tight range in mid level values for edt models auc was also reported in this research to provide a metric that can be used to evaluate this research across methods the nb and tan had similar f 1 values for data driven discretization outperforming edt models fig 1 for kit 1 kit 2 and no water quality data nb reported the highest f 1 values followed by edt with tan models reporting the lowest performance models are explored in further detail below 5 1 performance of at home kits in this study the discretization method implicitly represents the type of water quality data that was used laboratory tests measure water quality parameters at high accuracy and a high precision and provides 22 water quality parameters on the other hand kit 1 and kit 2 measured water quality parameters at low resolution kit 1 measured nine parameters and kit 2 measured two parameters as a result it was expected that the laboratory tested water quality data would lead to high performing models across all models laboratory tested water quality data reported as the data driven discretization approach led to models that perform better across all metrics fig 1 except accuracy which was similar across all discretization methods for the nb and tan models across recall precision f 1 and auc kit 1 outperforms kit 2 based on f 1 which was a comprehensive metric nb models built using kit 1 lose some performance with a reduction of the f 1 value by approximately 30 compared to models developed using laboratory data table s1 models that do not have any water quality data available shown as purple in fig 1 estimated the lower bound of performance metrics for example nb models built using kit 2 data performed worse than kit 1 models and showed a 50 60 reduction in f 1 compared with models developed using laboratory data table s1 kit 2 models reported marginally better performance than models that used no water quality data compared across all metrics while kit 1 models had significantly higher performance than models with no water quality data 5 2 sampling procedure water quality data can be collected at first draw or flushed samples fig 2 illustrates the performance of kit 1 and kit 2 based on first draw and flushed sampling kit 2 measured ph and hardness and models that were constructed using the flushed samples light green shapes in fig 2 have better performance in almost all metrics compared to kit 2 models that were constructed using first draw samples dark green shapes in fig 2 the gap in the performance i e the difference between the average value for recall f 1 and auc was relatively high between first draw and flushed samples on the other hand the relationships between sampling procedure and discretization methods for kit 1 were not as generalized as kit 2 for tan and edt the average recall value of first draw samples dark blue shapes in fig 2 were higher than flushed samples light blue shapes in fig 2 whereas the opposite case flushed samples out perform first draw samples was true for nb models the performance of kit 1 models with first draw samples dominated the performance of kit 1 models built using flushed samples when measured using precision and auc in general the differences between first draw and flushed are higher for kit 2 compared to kit 1 based on recall and f 1 first draw samples typically lead to better performance for kit 1 models kit 1 used a wider range of water quality parameters and heavy metals such as copper fig s1 that were more accurately captured through first draw samples which reflected the effect of stagnation and leaching of metals in the water matrix flushed samples led to better performance for kit 2 models kit 2 models relied on ph and hardness which were measured in the flushed sampling and were not measured in the first flush sampling the prediction range box height for flushed models was smaller than the first draw models indicating that flushed sampling led to less variance in model predictability the prediction range box height for flushed models was smaller than the first draw models indicating that flushed sampling leads to less variance in model predictability 5 3 nb models the performance of nb models was explored for f 1 and recall fig 3 the best performing models used laboratory tested water quality data as expected water quality collected using first draw samples perform better than flushed samples but there was little difference between models that include or exclude household characteristics shown as large red points in fig 3 the best performing nb model did not rely on location information and reported the highest value for f 1 of 60 0 and recall at 79 1 most nb models using laboratory collected water quality data had a similar model structure constructed with 26 predictors see table s1 for models that did not have any water quality data available purple points in fig 3 performance significantly dropped for these models information location and household characteristics contributed to improved prediction performance in these models location information raised the f 1 value from 16 8 recall value of 11 4 for a model without any location information to 26 8 recall value of 22 5 for a model with both county and aquifer information these models and data driven models red points in fig 3 provided the range of expected performance as the lower and upper bounds as shown above kit 1 models out performed kit 2 models the best kit 1 model had an f 1 value of 45 2 recall is 50 at a loss of almost 15 percentage points compared with the use of laboratory tested water quality data kit 2 models that use first draw data performed worse than models that use no water quality data household characteristics only marginally improved the performance of models that were constructed using the data driven discretion method however for kit 1 and kit 2 models the use of household characteristics improved model performance significantly when compared to models that do not use household characteristics in fig 3 the confusion matrix is shown for each type of water quality data none kit 1 kit 2 and data driven for models that included both county and aquifer data flushed data and household characteristics the confusion matrix can be used to interpret model performance for sharing with stakeholders for example the best nb model using laboratory collected water quality data led to predictions of wlls greater than 15 ppb that are accurate for 46 of true model predictions and predictions of wll less than 15 ppb that are accurate for 96 of false model predictions using this information households can assess the effect of model error on interpreting predictions about household risk of lead the same performance evaluation can be made for the kit 2 model a prediction of contaminated water was correct for 32 of positive model predictions a prediction of wlls less than the action level was correct for 91 of model predictions of uncontaminated drinking water 5 4 tan models tan models were compared across f 1 and recall values fig 4 trends for tan models were similar to the results shown for nb models however the gap between the models with and without household characteristics was greater for tan models when compared to nb models in contrast to the nb results tan kit 1 models did not show significantly better performance for flushed data compared to first draw models in addition the location information for kits models did not improve model predictability for tan models compared to nb models the highest performing tan models were constructed using data driven discretization methods and first draw samples with little difference between including or excluding the household characteristics and location information shown as large red points in fig 4 the best model included household characteristics with the highest value for f 1 at 62 4 and recall at 65 3 see table s1 for models that did not have any water quality data available purple points in fig 4 performance significantly dropped for these models information location in combination with household characteristics contributed to predictability of the model for tan models location information raised the f 1 value from 13 7 recall value of 8 5 for a model without any location information to 21 0 recall of 16 5 for a model with both county and aquifer these models and data driven models red points in fig 4 provided the range of performance as lower bound and upper bound respectively the best kit 1 model had an f 1 value of 45 2 and a recall value of 42 8 and the best kit 2 model had an f 1 value of 33 2 and recall value of 31 4 the drop in performance compared to laboratory tested water quality data was similar to results for the nb model kit 1 nb models had higher values for metrics across training validation and testing datasets in most categories when compared with kit 1 tan models tables s1 and s2 these results indicated that in developing models that could be used by households kit 1 performs better than kit 2 and nb models should be used rather than tan models 5 5 edt models the edt models reported a very different performance compared with bbn models fig 5 results showed a smaller loss of performance for water quality kit data and models were clustered closer together in the plot of f 1 vs recall based on f 1 values for the validation data set flushed water samples led to higher performing models than first draw samples when using laboratory tested water quality data data driven discretization f 1 values reached 50 recall of 71 3 when water quality and survey parameters were also included as predictors see table s1 the best nb model reported higher values for both f 1 and recall for data driven discretization the four most important predictors out of 111 predictors for the highest recall value were cadmium zinc copper and iron in the first draw the edt model that was constructed using only household information results in an f 1 value of 27 9 when aquifer information was included this value was slightly higher than f 1 values associated with bbn models constructed without water quality data nb f 1 26 8 tan f 1 21 0 edts as a machine learning approach can prove to be a powerful approach to develop models using low quality data for the edt model the number of predictors was 62 and the five most important predictors were source blue stain chemical treatment water taste and sulfur odor using kit 1 water quality data edt models performed almost as well as laboratory tested water quality data with a recall of 71 9 using first draw samples this recall value outperformed kit 1 models generated through the bbn approaches however the higher recall performance was at a loss of precision and the corresponding f 1 value of the model was 40 7 compared with f 1 values of 45 2 for the best tan kit 1 model and nb kit 1 model using kit 2 recall values reached 62 9 which exceeds the performance of bbn models the f 1 value for the edt model however was 30 3 compared with 33 2 for the best tan kit 2 model and 39 3 for the best nb kit 2 model 6 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of model predictions was explored based on detection limits and resolution of ph measurement lead detection levels and measurement error in at home testing kits the results reported in the first two sections 6 1 and 6 2 are based on the validation dataset while in the last section 6 3 results are reported for the test dataset 6 1 resolution and detection limits of ph several chemical parameters appeared in the models and some have a substantial effect on the predictive capabilities of models previous research reported that copper and ph are the top two most important chemical parameters for classifying lead in a bbn approach fasaee et al 2021 the best models for each type of classifier included copper in the first draw sample and ph in the flushed sample as important predictors removing copper and ph had a significant degrading effect on the performance of models in previous research where the average relative reduction in recall for copper and ph were reported as 37 9 and 25 7 respectively fasaee et al 2021 though accurately and precisely monitoring copper can be difficult for households ph may be more easily measured through readily available at home ph strips this analysis explored the effect of higher precision of ph measurements using high resolution strips on model prediction kit 1 and kit 2 measured the ph only in the range of 6 0 9 0 see tables 1 and 2 and 5 of samples in the database reside outside of the detection range this analysis explored the use of ph strips that cover the entire range of ph measurements 0 0 14 0 two additional ph strips were used in combination with kit 1 to replace ph measurements strip 1 measured ph from 0 0 14 0 in increments of 1 0 strip 2 provided higher resolution of ph reporting across the same range in increments of 0 5 ph was most accurately measured in flushed samples models were tested using strip 1 and strip 2 in combination with kit 1 water quality data for flushed samples these experiments trained eight nb models using forward selection and test water quality features with four settings for location information aquifer county aquifer and county and none results showed that the use of higher resolution and a full range of ph values do not improve model performance table 3 model performance for kit 1 with strip 1 and strip 2 showed a marginal improvement for aquifer data and county and aquifer data for no location data and county data model performance with strip 1 and strip 2 was marginally worse 6 2 water lead level thresholds for the results reported above the wll threshold was set at 15 ppb based on epa guidelines for the action level to signify a contaminated sample further analysis was conducted to explore the performance of models that classify samples as contaminated using lower wll thresholds no level of lead is considered safe and new models are developed to classify lead levels using alternative thresholds based on recommendations provided by the world health organization who world health organization 2008 the lead and cooper rule revision lcrr united states environmental protection agency 2021 and the food and drug administration fda cfr 000 for 5 ppb and 10 ppb models were developed using the nb classifier forward selection location information flushed water samples and kit 1 water quality data twelve new models were constructed and 10 fold cross validation was applied for 10 runs the average performance of models was calculated using training validation and testing data for 100 models performance for validation and testing data sets was reported for wll thresholds of 5 10 and 15 ppb for different sets of location data included as model features table 4 the model performance for validation data increased for recall precision and f 1 for lower wll thresholds though accuracy decreases and auc was similar across wll thresholds for example for models with county and aquifer data f 1 improved from 42 1 for 15 ppb to 50 5 and 60 0 for 10 and 5 ppb respectively for validation data new datasets that were created using lower wll thresholds for positive samples have a higher number of positive samples and generate a slightly more balanced data set leading to improved performance for recall precision and f 1 and a lower performance for accuracy for the lowest wll detection threshold 5 ppb the location information became less informative and the variation of performance for the different metrics becomes negligible table 4 as an example for models trained for 5 ppb the effect of location did not effect model performance significantly fig 4 for models trained for 5 ppb validation recall improved only 4 for new data recall was reported as 59 2 when no location data were used and as 61 7 when both county and aquifer data were used on the other hand for models trained to predict lead at 15 ppb validation recall improved 8 when new data were included recall was reported as 51 9 for no location data and as 55 8 for county and aquifer data though there were more positive samples available to train the models for lower wll thresholds classification of wll remained a difficult variable to predict and overall model performance improved only marginally for lower wll thresholds 6 3 measurement error in at home water quality test kits a monte carlo simulation approach was taken to assess how measurement error in kit 1 may affect model performance each simulation in the monte carlo approach randomly sampled a distribution around a data point and assessed model performance for that realization first distributions were created for each of the 9071 datapoints in the original dataset an error rate was used to create distributions for each of six water quality parameters the error is normally distributed on each water quality parameter measurement where a 10 error rate means that 10 of the samples are at least one category away from the true value five error rates were simulated 10 20 30 40 and 50 thirty five datasets were created to test the nb model that was developed using forward selection flushed water quality aquifer and county location data and survey data nb model is shown in fig s1 each of the 9071 datapoints in the original dataset was sampled 10 000 times to create each of the 35 datasets error distributions were applied to six individual water quality parameter measurements cu ph hardness f s o 4 and fe creating 30 new datasets the remaining five datasets were created by sampling from all six water quality parameters simultaneously at five error rates the distributions that were created for each of the six water quality parameters are shown in fig s2 results for f 1 and recall for are shown in fig 6 performance decreases most significantly for increasing error rates in ph and fluoride for example recall value decreased from 50 to 45 when an error rate of 50 was applied to fluoride the negative effect of error was amplified when error was included in all water quality parameters for an error rate of 50 in all parameters the f 1 value drops from 39 to 33 and the recall value dropped from 50 to 35 7 discussion this research explored the application of predictive tools for classifying lead at tap water in homes supplied by private systems this research explored how combinations of classifiers at home water quality testing kits and sets of predictors such as location information water sampling procedure and household characteristic affect the performance of models selection of a model for predicting lead in drinking water should be based on an appropriate performance metric this research focused on recall and f 1 because accurate detection of positive samples or contaminated water is of highest concern when protecting households from high levels of lead in water in addition the database was imbalanced with a low number of positive samples the goals of this research were to explore relationships among features of a rich dataset and develop models to predict lead in tap water at households for different sources of information the range of the predictive performance of models was bounded by the data types that were used to build and apply models the lower bound of performance corresponds to models that used only household characteristics and location information while the upper bound corresponds to the used of laboratory data that are discretized using data driven methods using at home kits to assess water quality parameters can improve model predictability compared to the lower bound of performance e g no water quality data the selection of at home kits drove the predictive capabilities of models in this research models that were based on a kit that reported more water quality parameters and reported at higher resolution lead to higher predictive performance an at home kit kit 1 that reported nine water quality parameters led to model performance that compares with laboratory tested data a second at home kit kit 2 was tested that reports only ph and hardness and model predictability suffered significantly the timing of collecting water samples was also tested in this research for using kit 1 first draw water samples led to better performance than flushed samples while for kit 2 flushed samples led to better model performance first draw sampling more accurately measured heavy metals such as copper which was an important water quality parameter and was typically correlated with lead kit 2 measured only ph and hardness and ph was captured in flushed water samples ph was an important feature that can be relatively easy to measure at home and other at home testing kits that were not directly simulated here can test a wider range of ph values at higher resolution through sensitivity analysis we explore improved testing of ph however improving the detection range and resolution of ph measurements beyond the capabilities of kit 1 did not improve model results the framework demonstrated here was applied to classify wlls that exceed the action level of 15 ppb further experiments tested the impact of the threshold on model predictive capabilities and it was found that using lower thresholds of wll led to improved model performance as noted above the mclg for lead is zero however and the models that are developed for 15 ppb may not serve well as early warning systems instead models that detected a lower concentration of lead can be used to warn households of the risk of lead in addition models that predicted concentration at 5 ppb and 10 ppb may be used with more confidence because these models have higher predictive capabilities than models that predict concentration at 15 ppb classifier approaches report some variation in performance and both bbn and edt models performed similarly across some experiments nb performed the best for data driven discretization based on recall and f 1 but this relies on laboratory tested water quality for kit 1 models edt models reported the highest recall values recall is important because this dataset was imbalanced however the precision of edt models suffered due to the emphasis on classifying positive samples the f 1 metric represents both precision and recall and is used in this research to evaluate models based on f 1 nb and tan models performed better than edt models for kit 1 data in summary results of this research recommend that bbn models can be used by households as an early warning system to generate the best performance models should predict samples with wlls above 5 ppb and kit 1 can be used to provide water quality data for flushed water samples in addition to household survey information and location data the requirement for water quality inputs to predict lead and the corresponding uncertainty in their measurements are a limitation for how the models developed in this research could be used at a household level this research tested the impact of uncertainty in at home water quality testing on model performance results demonstrate that uncertainty in fluoride and ph measurement reduce model performance substantially while other water parameters have smaller effects on the reduction of model performance future research can explore and quantify the error in water quality reported by at home tests and test models using datasets that are collected at homes using test kits location information is also an important set of predictors for many of the experiments that were identified here further work can explore how well models based on measurements of lead at neighboring private drinking water systems can predict lead models that are developed through this research are based on data collected from private water systems across virginia based on the performance for testing data it is expected that the level of performance of these models may remain high for new private water systems that are tested in virginia it is also expected that the models would perform similarly for geographic regions that have similar characteristics in source water and geophysical formations such as those states on the east coast that share geophysical provinces with virginia further testing is needed to explore the predictive capability of these models for well water across a range of locations direct measurement of lead in water risks is difficult lead in tap water of wells can vary with flushing time stagnation and seasonally lead release can also manifest as a stochastic process due to the random nature of the detachment of particles a large number of samples are needed to reasonably characterize lead in water risks for a private well system similar to the need for hundreds or thousands of samples to accurately characterize risk of lead in water across a city while there is no substitute for direct sampling collecting one or two samples at one household may miss water lead problems development of a model that predicts risk such as the methods developed in this research is justified because there is error in directly measuring lead a model that accurately predicts risk of lead in water based on relevant characteristics of tap water and plumbing can have more utility for households than direct lead testing which is subject to high error rates due to the random nature of the mechanics of lead transport in water systems new methodologies can extend the research described here to develop models of risk where risk is calculated based on the profile of multiple water samples collected at each household in this research some households reported lead in water at multiple points in time but successive samples were collected after several months or years further research can deploy intensive monitoring and modeling efforts to accurately characterize and predict risk further research can mitigate the error inherent in relying on a small number of samples to assess exposure to lead the models developed in this research can be applied at the household level for drinking water systems to classify lead new platforms are needed to distribute these models to lay persons to predict the risk of lead at individual households these models can be used as an interactive predictive tool to understand the relationships among features and lead levels increasing awareness about the cause of lead in tap water within communities that use private drinking water systems further research that addresses the limitations described above will contribute to solutions for under served populations on private water systems that do not have access to lead mitigation and monitoring technologies 8 conclusions predicting lead at the point of use is complicated by confounding factors that contribute to high wlls this research developed predictive tools to classify household level risk of lead based on household characteristics water quality data location information and discretization methods the data driven models created in this research were used to develop an understanding about the occurrence of lead at drinking water systems and provided insight that can be used to mitigate lead in drinking water predictive models were developed to apply methods to select features for building models discretize continuous water quality variables and train bayesian classifiers the nb model was identified as the best classifier for classifying lead based on metrics of recall and f 1 for training and validation data water chemistry parameters were the most important features for predicting lead and observations made by households contribute to the predictive capabilities of models while the requirement of precise and accurate water quality parameters for predicting lead limits the application of the models that are developed here this research yields new insight about the relationships among water quality parameters household characteristics and observations about water results demonstrated the importance and predictive power of having low resolution water quality data available to predict wlls future efforts can focus on implementation of the predictive tools on broader samples of drinking water from various geographical regions to enhance prediction capabilities of tools and quantify the associated errors with the at home kits households with private drinking water systems can be vulnerable to high water lead levels and need a set of tools for managing lead risk new models are needed that can be distributed to lay persons to predict the risk of lead at individual households bbn models generate a dag that can be viewed to understand the relationships among features and lead levels increasing awareness about the cause of lead in tap water within communities that use private drinking water systems the research presented in this manuscript provides such a tool that can be implemented in website or mobile apps to classify risks for households and generate insight for managing and mitigating lead exposure declaration of competing interest the

bayes classifiers are built based on bayes theorem for developing inferences about relationships between variables through causal and probabilistic structures heckerman and wellman 1995 a bbn is a probabilistic graphical model where nodes represent random variables that are connected via directed acyclic graphs dags dags represent causal relationships between variables to facilitate predictive and diagnostic reasoning pearl 2014 the strength of the relationship between a pair of variables is quantified by a conditionally probability table cpt and each node is assigned a cpt to specify its relationship with a connected node han et al 2012 korb and nicholson 2004 bayes theorem updates probabilities in the cpt using new datapoints for the set of variables two bayes classifiers described as follows are used in this research to explore the performance of alternative bbn structures bbn approaches were coded in r and the bbn models were developed using the bnlearn scutari 2010 package naïve bayes nb is the simplest bbn classifier an nb model is constructed with one parent node or predictand feature and all other feature nodes are considered children of the parent node the parent node in this research is the variable pbx or the presence of lead at a concentration above a threshold measured in the first draw the u s epa action level 15 ppb is used as a threshold to develop these models the bbn reports the likelihood of lead concentration above the threshold and samples are labeled as positive for likelihood 0 5 the model is constructed with the assumption that children nodes are independent and connections between children nodes are not allowed tree augmented naïve bayes tan is similar to the nb model however there is no assumption that children nodes are independent and network structures are formed that allow connections between pairs of children nodes assumptions for labeling samples as positive are consistent between nb and tan models a1 1 feature selection feature selection is the process of searching for the best subset of features feature selection can reduce model overfitting decrease model complexity and improve model performance by eliminating unnecessary redundant and mutually correlated features guyon and de 2003 two common methods for feature selection are forward selection and backward elimination which are robust and computationally efficient both methods use a greedy search to find the best subset of features guyon and de 2003 fasaee et al 2021 tested these two methods for use with the nb and tan classifiers and discretization approaches for a subset of the data they found that the effect of the feature selection method is marginal for most classifiers and in terms of computation cost the forward selection performs faster 15 20 less computation time compared to backward elimination this research applies the forward selection method to find the best subset of features forward selection is initialized with an empty model that contains no features and features are added to the model individually until all features have been added at each step the feature with the highest performance based on a predefined metric recall precision accuracy or f 1 as described in section a 3 is added to the model guyon and de 2003 james et al 2000 a2 edts configuration there are two main techniques to construct edts the bootstrap aggregation or bagging breiman 1996 and the boosting technique freund and schapire 1996 bagging uses mechanisms to reduce the predictor variance of individual decision trees boosting reduces bias by training decision trees sequentially the boosting technique aggregates the prediction of individual decision trees based on the weighted combination of coefficients that were found in the process of training the aggregated model freund and schapire 1997 boosting techniques are effective when classifying imbalanced datasets in which a dominant class considerably outnumbers another class galar et al 2012 the random under sampling boosting rusboost algorithm seiffert et al 2010 which is a variation of the adaptive boosting methods can improve model performance mounce et al 2017 rusboost randomly samples the majority class to match the number of elements of the minority class and resolve imbalanced data weighting coefficients are applied to weak learners in a sequential approach to improve the output of decision trees that report erroneous classifications each decision tree reports the probability that an observation corresponds to a determined class to merge the output of each decision tree rusboost averages the probabilities reported by each tree the settings to build an edt include the number of trees the trees depth and the overall learning rate a high number of trees improves the accuracy of the model while increasing its complexity and computation time based on previous applications in the water quality domain abernethy et al 2016 mounce et al 2017 and on a series of preliminary analyses to determine the number of trees a range between 100 and 1000 trees was evaluated a suitable option was found at 300 trees for the ensemble as the performance did not improve with more trees the minimum number of observations at the terminal node or leaf determines how shallow or deep a tree can be grown we analyzed a range between 10 and 100 observations where 40 observations per leaf yielded the best results similarly the learning rate that defines the step size of each iteration was analyzed between 0 001 and 1 0 and a value of 0 1 was defined as appropriate for this model a3 performance metrics classifiers are evaluated using a set of commonly used metrics that are calculated using the confusion matrix which shows the performance of a model in predicting samples within four classes fig a 2 true positives t p and true negatives t n denote the number of positive and negative samples that are correctly identified respectively in this research positive samples correspond to samples with wlls above the action level 15 ppb and negative samples correspond to samples with wlls below the action level false positives f p denotes the number of negative samples incorrectly identified as positive and false negatives f n indicates the number of positive samples incorrectly identified as negative using the confusion matrix performance metrics including recall precision and accuracy are calculated as follows a 1 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p f n f p t n a 2 r e c a l l t p t p f n a 3 p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p accuracy represents the proportion of samples that are correctly classified and evaluates the overall performance of a classifier for a balanced dataset imbalanced datasets on the other hand include a disproportionate number of positive or negative samples using accuracy to evaluate classifiers for imbalanced datasets can give a false indication that the classifier performance is high when in fact the classifier simply predicts all samples as belonging to the majority class recall and precision can be used instead to evaluate classification performance for imbalanced datasets recall represents the ability of a model to correctly classify the relevant cases or positive samples within a dataset and it is calculated as the ratio of predicted true positive samples to all positive samples gains in recall lead to a loss of precision which measures the accuracy of a model when it classifies a sample as positive precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives to all samples that are predicted as positive to consider both recall and precision simultaneously the f score family is used which calculates the weighted harmonic mean of recall and precision to address challenges associated with imbalanced data sets wang et al 2015 in this study the f 1 score is used which uses equal weights for recall and precision as shown in eq a 4 the f 1 score varies between zero and one representing the worst and the best performances respectively a 4 f 1 2 r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n the receiver operator characteristic roc curve is generated to compare models the roc plots the true positive rate tpr or the recall against the false positive rate fpr shown in eq a 5 at increasing threshold values for classifying true samples the threshold is varied from zero to one to generate the roc for generating the confusion matrix described above the threshold is kept constant at 0 5 a 5 f p r f p f p t n an roc curve that follows the diagonal line y x produces false positive and true positive results at the same rate therefore roc curves that are in the upper left hand quadrant perform better than a random classifier the metric area under the curve auc calculates the area under the roc curve to represent the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes high values of auc represent better performance of a model in classifying positive samples from negative samples bhandari 2020 a4 cross validation cross validation estimates the generalized error associated with a model to evaluate its performance k fold cross validation is a common method to estimate model performance and tune hyperparameters james et al 2000 kuhn and johnson 2013 to increase the precision of the estimate of model performance this research executes multiple runs of k fold cross validation kim 2009 molinaro et al 2005 for r runs of k fold cross validation at each run r the dataset is randomly split into k mutually exclusive folds one fold k is kept as the validation set and the remaining folds are grouped as the training set the training set is used to fit and build the predictive model and performance metrics are calculated and reported for the validation set m r k

15766,lead is a chemical contaminant that threatens public health and high levels of lead have been identified in drinking water at locations across the globe under served populations that use private systems for drinking water supplies may be at an elevated level of risk because utilities and governing agencies are not responsible for ensuring that lead levels meet the lead and copper rule at these systems predictive models that can be used by residents to assess water quality threats in their households can create awareness of water lead levels wlls this research explores and compares the use of statistical models i e bayesian belief classifiers and machine learning models i e ensemble of decision trees for predicting wlls models are developed using a dataset collected by the virginia household water quality program vahwqp at approximately 8000 households in virginia during 2012 2017 the dataset reports laboratory tested water quality parameters at households location information and household and plumbing characteristics including observations of water odor taste discoloration some water quality parameters such as ph iron and copper can be measured at low resolution by residents using at home water test kits and can be used to predict risk of wlls the use of at home water quality test kits was simulated through the discretization of water quality parameter measurements to match the resolution of at home water quality test kits and the introduction of error in water quality readings using this approach this research demonstrates that low resolution data collected by residents can be used as input for models to estimate wlls model predictability was explored for a set of at home water quality test kits that observe a variety of water quality parameters and report parameters at a range of resolutions the effects of the timing of water sampling e g first draw vs flushed samples and error in kits on model error were tested through simulations the prediction models developed through this research provide a set of tools for private well users to assess the risk of lead contamination models can be implemented as early warning

water classification water quality 1 introduction lead is a toxic metal that can be harmful to human health even at low exposure levels childhood exposure to lead poisoning is known to have long term irreversible effects such as loss of academic performance decline in problem solving skills hyperactivity and increased risk of alzheimers disease later in life reuben 2018 wani et al 2015 as demonstrated by water crises in washington d c in 2004 flint michigan in 2014 and newark new jersey in 2018 drinking water is a potential pathway for lead exposure edwards et al 2009 hanna attisha et al 2016 lytle et al 2020 pieper et al 2018 lead pipes faucets and fixtures can serve as sources of lead in drinking water as lead bearing plumbing materials corrode due to high acidity or low mineral content in water for homes that draw water from community water systems lead service lines or lead pipes that connect homes to the water main are often the most significant source of lead in the water when they are present sandvig et al 2009 for homes that use private water systems such as wells brass faucets and fixtures galvanized iron pipes and plumbing with lead solder can contribute to high water lead levels wlls the world health organization identifies lead as one of the major chemical contaminants threatening public health world health organization 2016 and the u s environmental protection agency usepa developed the lead and copper rule lcr to regulate lead in public drinking water systems the maximum contaminant level goal mclg for lead in drinking water was set at zero because there is no known safe level of lead exposure vorvolakos et al 2016 world health organization 2016 mclgs however are non enforceable health goals and are developed based on potential health risks and not treatment technologies the lcr specifies an enforceable lead action level of 15 parts per billion ppb and if more than 10 of tap water samples exceed the lead action level in community water systems then additional actions to mitigate lead are required united states environmental protection agency 1991 while the lcr applies to public drinking water systems private drinking water systems are not regulated by the usepa or subject to the requirements of the lcr united states environmental protection agency 1993 2012 private water systems include private wells cisterns and springs which serve no more than 25 people at least 60 days of the year and have 15 or fewer service connections approximately 14 of u s households rely on private drinking water systems maupin et al 2014 and residents using these systems may be vulnerable to exposure to lead because they lack the equipment and training required to manage lead in water morris et al 2016 pieper et al 2015a swistock et al 2013 many residents do not participate in testing to measure lead levels in drinking water and lack information about the risk of lead due to barriers such as awareness about the issue or the cost and availability of testing cost and inconvenience also limit the adoption of sequential sampling which could be implemented to identify the source of lead in drinking water and to monitor the effects of available lead mitigation strategies jarvis and fawell 2021 laboratory methods are resource intensive inconvenient and difficult to implement widely as a result many private water supplies are not monitored and remain vulnerable especially in resource limited contexts including some private drinking water systems that serve low income households the goal of this research is to develop modeling methods that can be applied to assess the risk of lead at households served by private drinking water systems predictive models can act as an early warning system to alert households of a risk of high wlls motivating households to pursue further testing or treatment while some descriptive models have been developed to characterize lead in drinking water for municipal systems abokifa et al 2020 goovaerts 2017a 2017b other research developed geostatistical and machine learning models to predict risk of lead by classifying drinking water at households as contaminated or not

pipes based on water quality sampling blackhurst 2021 machine learning approaches develop models that can accurately capture and predict complex systems but the models have intricate structures are difficult to interpret and may not provide insight about the relationships among variables mittelstadt et al 2019 by contrast statistical methods can provide insight about a problem by focusing on the relationships among variables inference creates and fits a probability model for a specific problem bzdok et al 2018 a bayesian belief network bbn is a statistical modeling method that uses a data driven approach to develop a compact and intuitive graphical model for representing probabilistic relationships among variables heckerman and wellman 1995 korb and nicholson 2004 in previous research fasaee et al 2021 developed bbn models to classify wlls at households unlike prior studies for flint and pittsburgh abernethy et al 2016 chojnacki et al 2017 goovaerts 2018 2019 hajiseyedjavadi et al 2020 the bbn models were developed to classify wlls for households that draw water from private drinking water systems features that are used as input variables include laboratory tested water quality parameters such as copper cu iron fe and ph household and plumbing characteristics observations of water odor taste and color location information the bbn models that were developed by fasaee et al 2021 have limited application in directly assessing the risk of lead at households due to the characteristics of the models first the most significant features in predicting lead are water quality parameters that are reported at high precision and accuracy through laboratory testing water quality parameters account for a substantial percentage of the predictability of models households however do not typically have access to laboratory water quality testing capability rendering these models unusable as early warning systems second at least two different samples of water are needed to accurately capture important dimensions of water lead risk the first draw sample requires at least six hours of stagnation and is typically collected in the morning the first draw sample represents the concentration of heavy metals including copper and lead as metals typically leach out of plumbing during stagnant periods a second flushed sample should be taken after the tap is open for at least one minute to measure ph fluoride f and nitrate no 3 n including both first draw and flushed samples or bottles improves the accurate representation of water quality but increases the complexity of collecting pertinent water quality parameters finally the models that were developed in previous research cannot be used at households in new regions because location data including county and physiographic province were important predictors this research describes and develops bbn models that can be used by households without the need for laboratory tested water quality parameters in this research we explore at home water quality testing as an alternative data source that households can use to improve the accuracy and precision of predicting wlls at home water quality test kits report discretized water quality parameters such as copper iron ph chlorine and hardness the use of at home water quality test kits is simulated in this research through the discretization of water quality parameter measurements to match the resolution of at home water quality test kits a range of kits are available and they differ in the number and set of parameters that are tested detection levels discretization and errors associated with readings this research investigates the effectiveness of using water quality data from different kits to predict wlls this research uses an existing dataset of laboratory tested water quality parameters and simulates that a set of water quality parameters were collected using at home kits by imposing artificial limits on detection levels and levels of data discretization for example laboratory tested data that reports a ph of 6 32 is changed to a level of 6 0 6 5 as reported by a water quality test kit we apply the bbn approach that was developed by fasaee et al 2021 to develop models that use simulated water quality data from at home test kits in addition to user reported household characteristics to classify wlls experiments test different water sampling times to simulate users who would test water quality using first draw or flushed samples the effect of different wll thresholds are assessed as they affect model predictability we simulate error in data collected by at home water quality test kits and assess model performance under increasing levels of error further bbns may not predict output as accurately as some machine learning approaches and this research develops and applies an ensemble of decision trees edts approach to compare with bbn approaches in developing new accessible and accurate models this research uses a comprehensive dataset of household characteristics and water quality at private water systems collected over a 5 year period including approximately 10 000 samples that were collected at different times at 8000 households the results of this research demonstrate that using at home water quality test kits can improve the predictive capability of models compared to only using variables such as household characteristics and location data these findings demonstrate the potential value of at home water quality test kits when used within a predictive modeling approach to serve as an early warning system that can alert households about the risk of high wlls the approach developed through this research can be used as a tool to identify households that are most at risk of high wlls and to prioritize households that should be tested for lead using more accurate laboratory based approaches 2 water quality testing and at home kits wlls can be measured using laboratory testing on site testing and at home testing kits measurement approaches vary in levels of accuracy reliability accessibility convenience and cost among the available options laboratory testing is the most expensive option and reports the highest accuracy and reliability on site testing can use spectrophotometric fluorescence based methods and anodic stripping voltammetry asv analysis which are portable fast relatively easy to use and relatively inexpensive cartier et al 2012 doré et al 2020 schock and george 1993 however these tests may be subject to interferences from other analytes in water and may not detect particulate lead leading to underestimates of wlls cartier et al 2012 doré et al 2020 schock and george 1993 while these technologies have lower capital costs than laboratory testing costs of portable instrumentation and disposable supplies can be significant cartier et al 2012 doré et al 2020 moreover on site testing requires technical expertise and cannot be reliably conducted by laypersons deshommes et al 2016 doré et al 2020 schock and george 1993 in contrast at home lead in water test kits that are low cost and commercially available may provide a good alternative for water consumers the efficacy accuracy and reliability of at home tests however are uncertain several organizations e g good housekeeping institute consumer reports have evaluated these commercially available at home kits but the testing was limited and failed to evaluate more complex problems associated with detecting particulate lead kriss et al 2021 sweigart marge 2021 the good housekeeping institute 2012 this research aims to integrate the power of statistical and machine learning with the convenience of at home water quality testing to predict risk of high wlls in this research the effect of error on the prediction capability of models is explored through sensitivity analysis and further research is recommended to fully characterize the error associated with at home testing in the field 3 materials and methods 3 1 virginia private water supply dataset the virginia household water quality program vahwqp collected 9723 water samples from 8172 unique private drinking water systems through collaboration with residents from 2012 to 2017 residents collected two bottles of water first draw and flushed samples the first draw sample was collected in the morning after at least six hours of stagnation a flushed sample was collected after at least one minute of flushing to measure ph fluoride f and nitrate no 3 n concentrations concentrations of fluoride and nitrate and ph levels are only assessed for the flushed sample samples were also analyzed for a variety of other water quality constituents including iron fe and copper cu hardness was calculated from magnesium mg and calcium ca concentrations vahwqp also collected data about household characteristics and the aesthetic properties of tap water through a resident completed questionnaire residents described their source of water well type well depth type of treatment device s if any water testing interval and other water characteristics such as taste color odor staining and the presence of floating particles in the tap water further details about sample collection and analysis were reported by pieper et al 2015b 3 1 1 database cleaning the dataset collected by vahwqp reports 159 features e g water quality system characteristics water observation and wlls for each sample sparse features were identified and removed using the following rule if the total number of missing values for one feature exceeded a threshold i e 5 of the total number of samples that feature was eliminated the dataset was subsequently cleaned to remove samples with missing values which resulted when respondents did not answer survey questions or water quality parameters were not measured the modified dataset included 9071 water samples from 7790 unique households including 111 features and one predictand variable pbx which was the presence of lead at a concentration above the threshold of 15 ppb as measured in the first draw samples 3 2 classifiers in this research two approaches were explored to predict the risk of exposure to lead a bbn framework was developed to focus on the probability of lead contamination and provide insight about the relationships among variables an edt approach was developed to explore how machine learning based models perform edt models can be difficult to interpret but may improve predictive capabilities the following sections provide more information about these approaches 3 2 1 bayesian belief network framework this research applied a bbn framework to construct models that classify water samples as contaminated or uncontaminated based on a pb threshold of 15 ppb a bbn is an elegant model that can be used to characterize the relationships among variables that predict the predictand node a bbn provides a principled approach to find explanations for observed evidence by modeling the quantitative strength of the relationship between variables and representing probabilistic beliefs about relationships these beliefs are updated based on observed data about the system pearl 2014 bbn models are commonly used in environmental assessment and management problems because they can handle diverse scales and uncertainty and they can effectively incorporate domain knowledge in the modeling process kelly et al 2013 bbn models have been used in water domains where data are scarce phan et al 2016 and they have been implemented to model and assess a range of environmental and water quality systems carvajal et al 2017 kabir et al 2015 reckhow 1999 troldborg et al 2013 the ability of bbns to update beliefs or probabilities using new information about a subset of the variables which is known as partial evidence provides a robust tool to predict in uncertain conditions yuan et al 2011 further because bbns use a structured modeling approach the relationships among features can be readily inspected and understood from the set of directed relationships that is generated through the modeling process a bbn model is constructed through the processes of discretization feature selection and bayes classification two classifiers were tested here a naïve bayes nb classifier is the simplest bbn classifier and is constructed with one parent node or predictand feature and all other feature nodes are considered children of the parent node the model is constructed with the assumption that children nodes are independent and connections between children nodes are not allowed we also test a tree augmented naïve bayes tan classifier which is similar to the nb model however there is no assumption that children nodes are independent and network structures are formed that allow connections between pairs of children nodes this research applied the forward selection method to find the best subset of features forward selection is initialized with an empty model that contains no features and features are added to the model individually until all features have been added models are evaluated through cross validation based on a set of metrics that evaluate model performance a brief description of the bbn framework is provided in the appendix a 1 and further details are provided by fasaee et al 2021 3 2 2 ensemble of decision trees machine learning methods including decision trees have been applied in the water quality domain to classify the risk of hazards such as pipe failure and water quality problems mounce et al 2017 winkler et al 2018 decision trees are used to graphically represent a classification or regression problem a single decision tree has three major components a root node internal nodes and leaf or terminal nodes see fig a 1 in a decision tree each leaf node is assigned a class label the non terminal nodes which include the root and other internal nodes contain feature test conditions to separate records that have different characteristics the root node has no incoming edges and can have multiple outgoing edges each internal node has exactly one incoming edge and two or more outgoing edges and each leaf node has exactly one incoming edge and no outgoing edges chakure 2019 mathematically a single decision tree has low bias and high variance therefore averaging the result of many decision trees reduces the variance while maintaining low bias russell 2017 an ensemble of decision trees edts can be used to improve model performance edts group individual decision trees as one model to predict or to fit numerical and categorical data while edts are more robust in terms of bias and variance with generally a better prediction performance it is more difficult to analyze and gain insight using an edt compared to individual decision trees rokach 2010 further information about the edt approach is provided in appendix a 2 3 3 discretization in this study we used four discretization approaches to simulate the different types of water quality collection protocols that can be used to collect water quality data discretization methods transform continuous variables to discrete variables by defining categories or bins to define discrete values in this study water quality variables were continuous and had to be discretized for use in classifiers this research used data driven methods and the discretization or resolution of at home kits to transform continuous variables to discrete variables data driven methods represent that laboratory tested water quality data are used to predict wlls and machine learning and statistical approaches are used in analyzing and discretizing data in other experiments we used the resolution that was used to report water quality from at home water quality testing kits to discretize water quality data by using the resolution and range for water quality parameters from at home test kits we simulated that water quality data were collected by households instead of collected and tested at laboratories finally for one set of experiments we did not use water quality parameters or discretization methods and this represented cases where households did not have any water quality information available 3 3 1 data driven discretization discretizing continuous variables can improve the performance accuracy and interpretation of bbns madhu et al 2014 tsai et al 2008 and discretization has been shown to effectively reduce the error of a nb classifier yang and webb 2002 2003 2009 for bbn models a data driven discretization algorithm that is separate from the classifier approach is used to pre process continuous data data driven discretization methods that can be used with bbn models include statistical and information based types previous work compared nine discretization methods for a subset of the data used in this research for nb classifiers the minimum description length principle mdlp performed best for improving model performance mdlp is an information based method that uses entropy to discretize variables fayyad and irani 1993 garcia et al 2013 for tan classifiers the best performance was found using chimerge kerber 1992 as a discretization method chimerge uses statistical evaluation or tests to measure the correlation between the values of a feature and the target class kotsiantis and kanellopoulos 2006 the discretization package in r kim 2012 was used to implement data driven discretization methods for edt models the data driven discretization is a part of the learning algorithm that develops new decision trees in applying edts variables can be provided as discrete or continuous for continuous variables discretization is determined within the rusboost algorithm and the threshold that is used for any feature at each node in the decision tree is determined through the learning process for features that are provided as discrete variables the decision tree is built through a simpler process that does not determine feature thresholds at nodes 3 3 2 discretization using at home water quality kits this research simulated that households used at home kits by discretizing water quality variables based on test strips provided in at home kits out of 11 kits reported by kriss et al 2021 two kits were used for simulation in this research kit 1 includes many of the water quality parameters that exist in the dataset and uses the highest resolution in measuring the water quality parameters specifically for copper iron and fluoride table 1 kit 2 is one of the simplest kits available and measures only ph and hardness table 2 both kits cover a similar range of ph values and kit 1 provides a slightly higher level of resolution both kits use a similar level of resolution in reporting hardness though kit 1 detects across a higher range of values to apply the discretization schemes shown in tables 1 and 2 each water quality parameter was converted to a unique discrete reading or category which could then be used as input for the edt and bbn predictive models 4 experiments a set of experiments was developed to test the effect of model settings on the predictive capabilities of models experiments tested the effects of household characteristics location and water sampling data location is reported as county and physiographic province which is a geographic region with a shared geomorphology in virginia the five geographic provinces are the coastal plain piedmont blue ridge valley and ridge and appalachian plateau geomorphology governs groundwater flows and water quality physiographic provinces are labeled as aquifers in the following sections that report results location data were included in models at four levels including 1 county 2 aquifer 3 county and aquifer and 4 no location information three types of discretization methods were used as described above in section 3 3 a data driven discretization method to discretize laboratory collected data kit 1 and kit 2 as described above nb models used mdlp and tan models used chimerge for data driven discretization and edt models used the ruboost algorithm for data driven discretization water sampling data includes two types of water samples first draw and flushed first draw sampling collects data for all water quality parameters except ph fluoride and nitrate and flushed sampling collects all water quality parameters for experiments that were labeled first draw ph fluoride and nitrate were not available or included in the analysis for each prediction algorithm i e nb tan and edt 52 experiments were defined four experiments tested the use of household characteristics with four different types of location information as input variables without water sampling data the remaining 48 experiments tested combinations of two water sampling procedures three discretization methods for water quality parameters and four types of location information and two settings with and without for household characteristics the time associated with developing predictive models was evaluated for the experiments the predictive models were implemented on a workstation configuration with a dual cpu intel xeon gold 6230 with 2 1 ghz and 128 gb memory the training time was affected most by the choice of classifier the edt model required a few seconds to train each model while the bbn model took several hours because it first found the best subset of features through feature selection for each experiment based on the number of features in the dataset n f n f n f 1 2 different bbn models were constructed and the performance of models were calculated based on 100 models of cross validation the simulation run time for bbn models was between 5 0 and 7 0 h for each model leading to approximately 26 days to simulate all 104 bbn models a main worker implementation in r was used to balance the load and used all the available processors to reduce the computational cost of the bbn construction a parallel simulation was used these models were simulated in parallel by a main worker method where each processor simulates a bbn model these models were distributed among 40 processors reducing the total run time of generating 104 models to 19 h 5 results experiments were run to create 156 bbn and edt models for each model 10 runs of 10 fold cross validation were executed to tune model hyperparameters the performance for classifiers and discretization methods over validation datasets is shown in fig 1 complete results are reported in supplementary information as the average recall precision accuracy f 1 and area under the curve auc over 100 validation datasets for nb models table s1 tan models table s2 and edt models table s3 the accuracy of all bbn models was similar at around 84 fig 1 this was expected because the dataset was imbalanced and approximately 86 of samples did not have high lead i e wll 15 ppb the accuracy of edt models varied in the range of 50 80 fig 1 recall is an important measure for imbalanced datasets because it highlights the performance of accurately identifying positive samples while penalizing models for misclassifying positive samples as negative edt performance for recall was in the range of 45 75 while the performance of bbn models varied within a larger range from slightly greater than 0 for kit 2 and up to around 80 for data driven discretization precision measures the ability of the model to classify positive samples but penalizes models for misclassifying negative samples as positive tan models reported the highest value for precision compared with nb and edt models models typically showed a trade off between recall and precision and because f 1 was based on both recall and precision it provided a comprehensive representation of model performance and was an alternative for accuracy in assessing performance for imbalanced datasets for this application the performance based on f 1 values for models was similar to performance for recall with a wide range across high and low values for bbn models and a tight range in mid level values for edt models auc was also reported in this research to provide a metric that can be used to evaluate this research across methods the nb and tan had similar f 1 values for data driven discretization outperforming edt models fig 1 for kit 1 kit 2 and no water quality data nb reported the highest f 1 values followed by edt with tan models reporting the lowest performance models are explored in further detail below 5 1 performance of at home kits in this study the discretization method implicitly represents the type of water quality data that was used laboratory tests measure water quality parameters at high accuracy and a high precision and provides 22 water quality parameters on the other hand kit 1 and kit 2 measured water quality parameters at low resolution kit 1 measured nine parameters and kit 2 measured two parameters as a result it was expected that the laboratory tested water quality data would lead to high performing models across all models laboratory tested water quality data reported as the data driven discretization approach led to models that perform better across all metrics fig 1 except accuracy which was similar across all discretization methods for the nb and tan models across recall precision f 1 and auc kit 1 outperforms kit 2 based on f 1 which was a comprehensive metric nb models built using kit 1 lose some performance with a reduction of the f 1 value by approximately 30 compared to models developed using laboratory data table s1 models that do not have any water quality data available shown as purple in fig 1 estimated the lower bound of performance metrics for example nb models built using kit 2 data performed worse than kit 1 models and showed a 50 60 reduction in f 1 compared with models developed using laboratory data table s1 kit 2 models reported marginally better performance than models that used no water quality data compared across all metrics while kit 1 models had significantly higher performance than models with no water quality data 5 2 sampling procedure water quality data can be collected at first draw or flushed samples fig 2 illustrates the performance of kit 1 and kit 2 based on first draw and flushed sampling kit 2 measured ph and hardness and models that were constructed using the flushed samples light green shapes in fig 2 have better performance in almost all metrics compared to kit 2 models that were constructed using first draw samples dark green shapes in fig 2 the gap in the performance i e the difference between the average value for recall f 1 and auc was relatively high between first draw and flushed samples on the other hand the relationships between sampling procedure and discretization methods for kit 1 were not as generalized as kit 2 for tan and edt the average recall value of first draw samples dark blue shapes in fig 2 were higher than flushed samples light blue shapes in fig 2 whereas the opposite case flushed samples out perform first draw samples was true for nb models the performance of kit 1 models with first draw samples dominated the performance of kit 1 models built using flushed samples when measured using precision and auc in general the differences between first draw and flushed are higher for kit 2 compared to kit 1 based on recall and f 1 first draw samples typically lead to better performance for kit 1 models kit 1 used a wider range of water quality parameters and heavy metals such as copper fig s1 that were more accurately captured through first draw samples which reflected the effect of stagnation and leaching of metals in the water matrix flushed samples led to better performance for kit 2 models kit 2 models relied on ph and hardness which were measured in the flushed sampling and were not measured in the first flush sampling the prediction range box height for flushed models was smaller than the first draw models indicating that flushed sampling led to less variance in model predictability the prediction range box height for flushed models was smaller than the first draw models indicating that flushed sampling leads to less variance in model predictability 5 3 nb models the performance of nb models was explored for f 1 and recall fig 3 the best performing models used laboratory tested water quality data as expected water quality collected using first draw samples perform better than flushed samples but there was little difference between models that include or exclude household characteristics shown as large red points in fig 3 the best performing nb model did not rely on location information and reported the highest value for f 1 of 60 0 and recall at 79 1 most nb models using laboratory collected water quality data had a similar model structure constructed with 26 predictors see table s1 for models that did not have any water quality data available purple points in fig 3 performance significantly dropped for these models information location and household characteristics contributed to improved prediction performance in these models location information raised the f 1 value from 16 8 recall value of 11 4 for a model without any location information to 26 8 recall value of 22 5 for a model with both county and aquifer information these models and data driven models red points in fig 3 provided the range of expected performance as the lower and upper bounds as shown above kit 1 models out performed kit 2 models the best kit 1 model had an f 1 value of 45 2 recall is 50 at a loss of almost 15 percentage points compared with the use of laboratory tested water quality data kit 2 models that use first draw data performed worse than models that use no water quality data household characteristics only marginally improved the performance of models that were constructed using the data driven discretion method however for kit 1 and kit 2 models the use of household characteristics improved model performance significantly when compared to models that do not use household characteristics in fig 3 the confusion matrix is shown for each type of water quality data none kit 1 kit 2 and data driven for models that included both county and aquifer data flushed data and household characteristics the confusion matrix can be used to interpret model performance for sharing with stakeholders for example the best nb model using laboratory collected water quality data led to predictions of wlls greater than 15 ppb that are accurate for 46 of true model predictions and predictions of wll less than 15 ppb that are accurate for 96 of false model predictions using this information households can assess the effect of model error on interpreting predictions about household risk of lead the same performance evaluation can be made for the kit 2 model a prediction of contaminated water was correct for 32 of positive model predictions a prediction of wlls less than the action level was correct for 91 of model predictions of uncontaminated drinking water 5 4 tan models tan models were compared across f 1 and recall values fig 4 trends for tan models were similar to the results shown for nb models however the gap between the models with and without household characteristics was greater for tan models when compared to nb models in contrast to the nb results tan kit 1 models did not show significantly better performance for flushed data compared to first draw models in addition the location information for kits models did not improve model predictability for tan models compared to nb models the highest performing tan models were constructed using data driven discretization methods and first draw samples with little difference between including or excluding the household characteristics and location information shown as large red points in fig 4 the best model included household characteristics with the highest value for f 1 at 62 4 and recall at 65 3 see table s1 for models that did not have any water quality data available purple points in fig 4 performance significantly dropped for these models information location in combination with household characteristics contributed to predictability of the model for tan models location information raised the f 1 value from 13 7 recall value of 8 5 for a model without any location information to 21 0 recall of 16 5 for a model with both county and aquifer these models and data driven models red points in fig 4 provided the range of performance as lower bound and upper bound respectively the best kit 1 model had an f 1 value of 45 2 and a recall value of 42 8 and the best kit 2 model had an f 1 value of 33 2 and recall value of 31 4 the drop in performance compared to laboratory tested water quality data was similar to results for the nb model kit 1 nb models had higher values for metrics across training validation and testing datasets in most categories when compared with kit 1 tan models tables s1 and s2 these results indicated that in developing models that could be used by households kit 1 performs better than kit 2 and nb models should be used rather than tan models 5 5 edt models the edt models reported a very different performance compared with bbn models fig 5 results showed a smaller loss of performance for water quality kit data and models were clustered closer together in the plot of f 1 vs recall based on f 1 values for the validation data set flushed water samples led to higher performing models than first draw samples when using laboratory tested water quality data data driven discretization f 1 values reached 50 recall of 71 3 when water quality and survey parameters were also included as predictors see table s1 the best nb model reported higher values for both f 1 and recall for data driven discretization the four most important predictors out of 111 predictors for the highest recall value were cadmium zinc copper and iron in the first draw the edt model that was constructed using only household information results in an f 1 value of 27 9 when aquifer information was included this value was slightly higher than f 1 values associated with bbn models constructed without water quality data nb f 1 26 8 tan f 1 21 0 edts as a machine learning approach can prove to be a powerful approach to develop models using low quality data for the edt model the number of predictors was 62 and the five most important predictors were source blue stain chemical treatment water taste and sulfur odor using kit 1 water quality data edt models performed almost as well as laboratory tested water quality data with a recall of 71 9 using first draw samples this recall value outperformed kit 1 models generated through the bbn approaches however the higher recall performance was at a loss of precision and the corresponding f 1 value of the model was 40 7 compared with f 1 values of 45 2 for the best tan kit 1 model and nb kit 1 model using kit 2 recall values reached 62 9 which exceeds the performance of bbn models the f 1 value for the edt model however was 30 3 compared with 33 2 for the best tan kit 2 model and 39 3 for the best nb kit 2 model 6 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of model predictions was explored based on detection limits and resolution of ph measurement lead detection levels and measurement error in at home testing kits the results reported in the first two sections 6 1 and 6 2 are based on the validation dataset while in the last section 6 3 results are reported for the test dataset 6 1 resolution and detection limits of ph several chemical parameters appeared in the models and some have a substantial effect on the predictive capabilities of models previous research reported that copper and ph are the top two most important chemical parameters for classifying lead in a bbn approach fasaee et al 2021 the best models for each type of classifier included copper in the first draw sample and ph in the flushed sample as important predictors removing copper and ph had a significant degrading effect on the performance of models in previous research where the average relative reduction in recall for copper and ph were reported as 37 9 and 25 7 respectively fasaee et al 2021 though accurately and precisely monitoring copper can be difficult for households ph may be more easily measured through readily available at home ph strips this analysis explored the effect of higher precision of ph measurements using high resolution strips on model prediction kit 1 and kit 2 measured the ph only in the range of 6 0 9 0 see tables 1 and 2 and 5 of samples in the database reside outside of the detection range this analysis explored the use of ph strips that cover the entire range of ph measurements 0 0 14 0 two additional ph strips were used in combination with kit 1 to replace ph measurements strip 1 measured ph from 0 0 14 0 in increments of 1 0 strip 2 provided higher resolution of ph reporting across the same range in increments of 0 5 ph was most accurately measured in flushed samples models were tested using strip 1 and strip 2 in combination with kit 1 water quality data for flushed samples these experiments trained eight nb models using forward selection and test water quality features with four settings for location information aquifer county aquifer and county and none results showed that the use of higher resolution and a full range of ph values do not improve model performance table 3 model performance for kit 1 with strip 1 and strip 2 showed a marginal improvement for aquifer data and county and aquifer data for no location data and county data model performance with strip 1 and strip 2 was marginally worse 6 2 water lead level thresholds for the results reported above the wll threshold was set at 15 ppb based on epa guidelines for the action level to signify a contaminated sample further analysis was conducted to explore the performance of models that classify samples as contaminated using lower wll thresholds no level of lead is considered safe and new models are developed to classify lead levels using alternative thresholds based on recommendations provided by the world health organization who world health organization 2008 the lead and cooper rule revision lcrr united states environmental protection agency 2021 and the food and drug administration fda cfr 000 for 5 ppb and 10 ppb models were developed using the nb classifier forward selection location information flushed water samples and kit 1 water quality data twelve new models were constructed and 10 fold cross validation was applied for 10 runs the average performance of models was calculated using training validation and testing data for 100 models performance for validation and testing data sets was reported for wll thresholds of 5 10 and 15 ppb for different sets of location data included as model features table 4 the model performance for validation data increased for recall precision and f 1 for lower wll thresholds though accuracy decreases and auc was similar across wll thresholds for example for models with county and aquifer data f 1 improved from 42 1 for 15 ppb to 50 5 and 60 0 for 10 and 5 ppb respectively for validation data new datasets that were created using lower wll thresholds for positive samples have a higher number of positive samples and generate a slightly more balanced data set leading to improved performance for recall precision and f 1 and a lower performance for accuracy for the lowest wll detection threshold 5 ppb the location information became less informative and the variation of performance for the different metrics becomes negligible table 4 as an example for models trained for 5 ppb the effect of location did not effect model performance significantly fig 4 for models trained for 5 ppb validation recall improved only 4 for new data recall was reported as 59 2 when no location data were used and as 61 7 when both county and aquifer data were used on the other hand for models trained to predict lead at 15 ppb validation recall improved 8 when new data were included recall was reported as 51 9 for no location data and as 55 8 for county and aquifer data though there were more positive samples available to train the models for lower wll thresholds classification of wll remained a difficult variable to predict and overall model performance improved only marginally for lower wll thresholds 6 3 measurement error in at home water quality test kits a monte carlo simulation approach was taken to assess how measurement error in kit 1 may affect model performance each simulation in the monte carlo approach randomly sampled a distribution around a data point and assessed model performance for that realization first distributions were created for each of the 9071 datapoints in the original dataset an error rate was used to create distributions for each of six water quality parameters the error is normally distributed on each water quality parameter measurement where a 10 error rate means that 10 of the samples are at least one category away from the true value five error rates were simulated 10 20 30 40 and 50 thirty five datasets were created to test the nb model that was developed using forward selection flushed water quality aquifer and county location data and survey data nb model is shown in fig s1 each of the 9071 datapoints in the original dataset was sampled 10 000 times to create each of the 35 datasets error distributions were applied to six individual water quality parameter measurements cu ph hardness f s o 4 and fe creating 30 new datasets the remaining five datasets were created by sampling from all six water quality parameters simultaneously at five error rates the distributions that were created for each of the six water quality parameters are shown in fig s2 results for f 1 and recall for are shown in fig 6 performance decreases most significantly for increasing error rates in ph and fluoride for example recall value decreased from 50 to 45 when an error rate of 50 was applied to fluoride the negative effect of error was amplified when error was included in all water quality parameters for an error rate of 50 in all parameters the f 1 value drops from 39 to 33 and the recall value dropped from 50 to 35 7 discussion this research explored the application of predictive tools for classifying lead at tap water in homes supplied by private systems this research explored how combinations of classifiers at home water quality testing kits and sets of predictors such as location information water sampling procedure and household characteristic affect the performance of models selection of a model for predicting lead in drinking water should be based on an appropriate performance metric this research focused on recall and f 1 because accurate detection of positive samples or contaminated water is of highest concern when protecting households from high levels of lead in water in addition the database was imbalanced with a low number of positive samples the goals of this research were to explore relationships among features of a rich dataset and develop models to predict lead in tap water at households for different sources of information the range of the predictive performance of models was bounded by the data types that were used to build and apply models the lower bound of performance corresponds to models that used only household characteristics and location information while the upper bound corresponds to the used of laboratory data that are discretized using data driven methods using at home kits to assess water quality parameters can improve model predictability compared to the lower bound of performance e g no water quality data the selection of at home kits drove the predictive capabilities of models in this research models that were based on a kit that reported more water quality parameters and reported at higher resolution lead to higher predictive performance an at home kit kit 1 that reported nine water quality parameters led to model performance that compares with laboratory tested data a second at home kit kit 2 was tested that reports only ph and hardness and model predictability suffered significantly the timing of collecting water samples was also tested in this research for using kit 1 first draw water samples led to better performance than flushed samples while for kit 2 flushed samples led to better model performance first draw sampling more accurately measured heavy metals such as copper which was an important water quality parameter and was typically correlated with lead kit 2 measured only ph and hardness and ph was captured in flushed water samples ph was an important feature that can be relatively easy to measure at home and other at home testing kits that were not directly simulated here can test a wider range of ph values at higher resolution through sensitivity analysis we explore improved testing of ph however improving the detection range and resolution of ph measurements beyond the capabilities of kit 1 did not improve model results the framework demonstrated here was applied to classify wlls that exceed the action level of 15 ppb further experiments tested the impact of the threshold on model predictive capabilities and it was found that using lower thresholds of wll led to improved model performance as noted above the mclg for lead is zero however and the models that are developed for 15 ppb may not serve well as early warning systems instead models that detected a lower concentration of lead can be used to warn households of the risk of lead in addition models that predicted concentration at 5 ppb and 10 ppb may be used with more confidence because these models have higher predictive capabilities than models that predict concentration at 15 ppb classifier approaches report some variation in performance and both bbn and edt models performed similarly across some experiments nb performed the best for data driven discretization based on recall and f 1 but this relies on laboratory tested water quality for kit 1 models edt models reported the highest recall values recall is important because this dataset was imbalanced however the precision of edt models suffered due to the emphasis on classifying positive samples the f 1 metric represents both precision and recall and is used in this research to evaluate models based on f 1 nb and tan models performed better than edt models for kit 1 data in summary results of this research recommend that bbn models can be used by households as an early warning system to generate the best performance models should predict samples with wlls above 5 ppb and kit 1 can be used to provide water quality data for flushed water samples in addition to household survey information and location data the requirement for water quality inputs to predict lead and the corresponding uncertainty in their measurements are a limitation for how the models developed in this research could be used at a household level this research tested the impact of uncertainty in at home water quality testing on model performance results demonstrate that uncertainty in fluoride and ph measurement reduce model performance substantially while other water parameters have smaller effects on the reduction of model performance future research can explore and quantify the error in water quality reported by at home tests and test models using datasets that are collected at homes using test kits location information is also an important set of predictors for many of the experiments that were identified here further work can explore how well models based on measurements of lead at neighboring private drinking water systems can predict lead models that are developed through this research are based on data collected from private water systems across virginia based on the performance for testing data it is expected that the level of performance of these models may remain high for new private water systems that are tested in virginia it is also expected that the models would perform similarly for geographic regions that have similar characteristics in source water and geophysical formations such as those states on the east coast that share geophysical provinces with virginia further testing is needed to explore the predictive capability of these models for well water across a range of locations direct measurement of lead in water risks is difficult lead in tap water of wells can vary with flushing time stagnation and seasonally lead release can also manifest as a stochastic process due to the random nature of the detachment of particles a large number of samples are needed to reasonably characterize lead in water risks for a private well system similar to the need for hundreds or thousands of samples to accurately characterize risk of lead in water across a city while there is no substitute for direct sampling collecting one or two samples at one household may miss water lead problems development of a model that predicts risk such as the methods developed in this research is justified because there is error in directly measuring lead a model that accurately predicts risk of lead in water based on relevant characteristics of tap water and plumbing can have more utility for households than direct lead testing which is subject to high error rates due to the random nature of the mechanics of lead transport in water systems new methodologies can extend the research described here to develop models of risk where risk is calculated based on the profile of multiple water samples collected at each household in this research some households reported lead in water at multiple points in time but successive samples were collected after several months or years further research can deploy intensive monitoring and modeling efforts to accurately characterize and predict risk further research can mitigate the error inherent in relying on a small number of samples to assess exposure to lead the models developed in this research can be applied at the household level for drinking water systems to classify lead new platforms are needed to distribute these models to lay persons to predict the risk of lead at individual households these models can be used as an interactive predictive tool to understand the relationships among features and lead levels increasing awareness about the cause of lead in tap water within communities that use private drinking water systems further research that addresses the limitations described above will contribute to solutions for under served populations on private water systems that do not have access to lead mitigation and monitoring technologies 8 conclusions predicting lead at the point of use is complicated by confounding factors that contribute to high wlls this research developed predictive tools to classify household level risk of lead based on household characteristics water quality data location information and discretization methods the data driven models created in this research were used to develop an understanding about the occurrence of lead at drinking water systems and provided insight that can be used to mitigate lead in drinking water predictive models were developed to apply methods to select features for building models discretize continuous water quality variables and train bayesian classifiers the nb model was identified as the best classifier for classifying lead based on metrics of recall and f 1 for training and validation data water chemistry parameters were the most important features for predicting lead and observations made by households contribute to the predictive capabilities of models while the requirement of precise and accurate water quality parameters for predicting lead limits the application of the models that are developed here this research yields new insight about the relationships among water quality parameters household characteristics and observations about water results demonstrated the importance and predictive power of having low resolution water quality data available to predict wlls future efforts can focus on implementation of the predictive tools on broader samples of drinking water from various geographical regions to enhance prediction capabilities of tools and quantify the associated errors with the at home kits households with private drinking water systems can be vulnerable to high water lead levels and need a set of tools for managing lead risk new models are needed that can be distributed to lay persons to predict the risk of lead at individual households bbn models generate a dag that can be viewed to understand the relationships among features and lead levels increasing awareness about the cause of lead in tap water within communities that use private drinking water systems the research presented in this manuscript provides such a tool that can be implemented in website or mobile apps to classify risks for households and generate insight for managing and mitigating lead exposure declaration of competing interest the

bayes classifiers are built based on bayes theorem for developing inferences about relationships between variables through causal and probabilistic structures heckerman and wellman 1995 a bbn is a probabilistic graphical model where nodes represent random variables that are connected via directed acyclic graphs dags dags represent causal relationships between variables to facilitate predictive and diagnostic reasoning pearl 2014 the strength of the relationship between a pair of variables is quantified by a conditionally probability table cpt and each node is assigned a cpt to specify its relationship with a connected node han et al 2012 korb and nicholson 2004 bayes theorem updates probabilities in the cpt using new datapoints for the set of variables two bayes classifiers described as follows are used in this research to explore the performance of alternative bbn structures bbn approaches were coded in r and the bbn models were developed using the bnlearn scutari 2010 package naïve bayes nb is the simplest bbn classifier an nb model is constructed with one parent node or predictand feature and all other feature nodes are considered children of the parent node the parent node in this research is the variable pbx or the presence of lead at a concentration above a threshold measured in the first draw the u s epa action level 15 ppb is used as a threshold to develop these models the bbn reports the likelihood of lead concentration above the threshold and samples are labeled as positive for likelihood 0 5 the model is constructed with the assumption that children nodes are independent and connections between children nodes are not allowed tree augmented naïve bayes tan is similar to the nb model however there is no assumption that children nodes are independent and network structures are formed that allow connections between pairs of children nodes assumptions for labeling samples as positive are consistent between nb and tan models a1 1 feature selection feature selection is the process of searching for the best subset of features feature selection can reduce model overfitting decrease model complexity and improve model performance by eliminating unnecessary redundant and mutually correlated features guyon and de 2003 two common methods for feature selection are forward selection and backward elimination which are robust and computationally efficient both methods use a greedy search to find the best subset of features guyon and de 2003 fasaee et al 2021 tested these two methods for use with the nb and tan classifiers and discretization approaches for a subset of the data they found that the effect of the feature selection method is marginal for most classifiers and in terms of computation cost the forward selection performs faster 15 20 less computation time compared to backward elimination this research applies the forward selection method to find the best subset of features forward selection is initialized with an empty model that contains no features and features are added to the model individually until all features have been added at each step the feature with the highest performance based on a predefined metric recall precision accuracy or f 1 as described in section a 3 is added to the model guyon and de 2003 james et al 2000 a2 edts configuration there are two main techniques to construct edts the bootstrap aggregation or bagging breiman 1996 and the boosting technique freund and schapire 1996 bagging uses mechanisms to reduce the predictor variance of individual decision trees boosting reduces bias by training decision trees sequentially the boosting technique aggregates the prediction of individual decision trees based on the weighted combination of coefficients that were found in the process of training the aggregated model freund and schapire 1997 boosting techniques are effective when classifying imbalanced datasets in which a dominant class considerably outnumbers another class galar et al 2012 the random under sampling boosting rusboost algorithm seiffert et al 2010 which is a variation of the adaptive boosting methods can improve model performance mounce et al 2017 rusboost randomly samples the majority class to match the number of elements of the minority class and resolve imbalanced data weighting coefficients are applied to weak learners in a sequential approach to improve the output of decision trees that report erroneous classifications each decision tree reports the probability that an observation corresponds to a determined class to merge the output of each decision tree rusboost averages the probabilities reported by each tree the settings to build an edt include the number of trees the trees depth and the overall learning rate a high number of trees improves the accuracy of the model while increasing its complexity and computation time based on previous applications in the water quality domain abernethy et al 2016 mounce et al 2017 and on a series of preliminary analyses to determine the number of trees a range between 100 and 1000 trees was evaluated a suitable option was found at 300 trees for the ensemble as the performance did not improve with more trees the minimum number of observations at the terminal node or leaf determines how shallow or deep a tree can be grown we analyzed a range between 10 and 100 observations where 40 observations per leaf yielded the best results similarly the learning rate that defines the step size of each iteration was analyzed between 0 001 and 1 0 and a value of 0 1 was defined as appropriate for this model a3 performance metrics classifiers are evaluated using a set of commonly used metrics that are calculated using the confusion matrix which shows the performance of a model in predicting samples within four classes fig a 2 true positives t p and true negatives t n denote the number of positive and negative samples that are correctly identified respectively in this research positive samples correspond to samples with wlls above the action level 15 ppb and negative samples correspond to samples with wlls below the action level false positives f p denotes the number of negative samples incorrectly identified as positive and false negatives f n indicates the number of positive samples incorrectly identified as negative using the confusion matrix performance metrics including recall precision and accuracy are calculated as follows a 1 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p f n f p t n a 2 r e c a l l t p t p f n a 3 p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p accuracy represents the proportion of samples that are correctly classified and evaluates the overall performance of a classifier for a balanced dataset imbalanced datasets on the other hand include a disproportionate number of positive or negative samples using accuracy to evaluate classifiers for imbalanced datasets can give a false indication that the classifier performance is high when in fact the classifier simply predicts all samples as belonging to the majority class recall and precision can be used instead to evaluate classification performance for imbalanced datasets recall represents the ability of a model to correctly classify the relevant cases or positive samples within a dataset and it is calculated as the ratio of predicted true positive samples to all positive samples gains in recall lead to a loss of precision which measures the accuracy of a model when it classifies a sample as positive precision is calculated as the ratio of true positives to all samples that are predicted as positive to consider both recall and precision simultaneously the f score family is used which calculates the weighted harmonic mean of recall and precision to address challenges associated with imbalanced data sets wang et al 2015 in this study the f 1 score is used which uses equal weights for recall and precision as shown in eq a 4 the f 1 score varies between zero and one representing the worst and the best performances respectively a 4 f 1 2 r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n the receiver operator characteristic roc curve is generated to compare models the roc plots the true positive rate tpr or the recall against the false positive rate fpr shown in eq a 5 at increasing threshold values for classifying true samples the threshold is varied from zero to one to generate the roc for generating the confusion matrix described above the threshold is kept constant at 0 5 a 5 f p r f p f p t n an roc curve that follows the diagonal line y x produces false positive and true positive results at the same rate therefore roc curves that are in the upper left hand quadrant perform better than a random classifier the metric area under the curve auc calculates the area under the roc curve to represent the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes high values of auc represent better performance of a model in classifying positive samples from negative samples bhandari 2020 a4 cross validation cross validation estimates the generalized error associated with a model to evaluate its performance k fold cross validation is a common method to estimate model performance and tune hyperparameters james et al 2000 kuhn and johnson 2013 to increase the precision of the estimate of model performance this research executes multiple runs of k fold cross validation kim 2009 molinaro et al 2005 for r runs of k fold cross validation at each run r the dataset is randomly split into k mutually exclusive folds one fold k is kept as the validation set and the remaining folds are grouped as the training set the training set is used to fit and build the predictive model and performance metrics are calculated and reported for the validation set m r k i in eq a 6 the overall performance for each metric and hyperparameter setting m i is the average of the performance of all models that have been constructed through the process of cross validation a

effectively remove micropollutants in recent years ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops have drawn increasing attention because they can produce highly reactive radicals to quickly degrade most micropollutants lester et al 2014 yang et al 2016 lee et al 2020 among them uv h2o2 is the most commonly applied process because of its high quantum yield of hydroxyl radical ho easy operation small footprint and no secondary pollution wunsch et al 2021 to evaluate the performance of uv aops for process design and field inspection it is necessary to determine the micropollutant degradation kinetics because uv reactors of different configurations deliver different fluence rates the photon fluence based rate constant of micropollutant degradation k p mp m2 einstein 1 has been more commonly adopted for uv aops than the time based rate constant s 1 for the purpose of result comparison among different laboratories rosenfeldt and linden 2007 bolton et al 2015 the k p mp is affected by many factors such as oxidants micropollutants water matrices and operating parameters hence numerous experiments should be conducted to determine the optimal process and operation conditions as well for a desired removal efficiency of target micropollutants this requires frequent field water collections transportations various bench scale tests using a well established photoreactor and high professional skills for operation of the photoreactor e g quasi collimated beam apparatus and advanced analytical instruments e g an ultra high performance liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer uplc ms ms for micropollutant analysis which is considerably time and labor consuming and thus expensive therefore there is an urgent need to develop a method for facilitated prediction of the k p mp under practical operation conditions of uv aops the photochemical model and ho concentration steady state approximation ssa model have been applied to kinetic simulations of micropollutant degradation by uv h2o2 glaze et al 1995 baeza and knappe 2011 the direct uv photolysis rate constant and the steady state ho concentration i e ho ss can be estimated through model simulations and then the indirect oxidation rate constant via ho is calculated as the product of ho ss and the second order reaction rate constant of a target micropollutant toward ho k ho mp the k ho mp can be obtained from published literatures measured experimentally by competition kinetics method onstein et al 1999 or predicted by a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model lee and von gunten 2012 sudhakaran and amy 2013 however the prediction of k p mp in real waters is a complex issue because the water matrix such as dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic ions e g hco 3 co 3 2 no 3 and po 4 3 will compete against the target micropollutant for reactive radicals formed during the uv h2o2 process kwon et al 2019 it is usually impossible to analyze all water matrix components and their concentrations required for the model input which may induce a large error in the k p mp prediction fortunately an integrated index ho scavenging capacity hrsc has been recently proposed to represent the overall ho competitiveness of a water matrix which can be easily measured by a visible spectrophotometer wang et al 2020 furthermore we have previously developed a mini fluidic photoreaction system mfps to facilitate bench scale photochemical studies compared to the commonly used quasi collimated beam apparatus the mfps has obvious advantages such as output of a high photon fluence rate to greatly reduce the experimental time accurate determination of photon fluence by using a micro fluorescent silica detector to monitor the real time fluctuation of lamp output on line absorbance measurement photoreactor temperature control and a small size li et al 2016a therefore it is an ideal portable device for field measurement of the hrsc of a real water matrix this study was aimed to develop a new method through combination of model simulation with portable measurement ms pm to facilitate the prediction of micropollutant degradation by uv h2o2 the model simulation was performed with photochemical ho concentration ssa and qsar models and the portable measurement was conducted on the mfps to quantify the hrsc of a water matrix sulfamethazine smn a typical sulfonamide antibiotic frequently detected in various waters hou et al 2015 chen et al 2020 was selected as a model micropollutant the photon fluence based degradation rate constants of smn by uv h2o2 i e k p smn were predicted by the ms pm method in seven test waters and further verified experimentally the novel method is expected to significantly facilitate the design and field assessment of uv aops for micropollutant removal from drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and analytical methods all chemicals used were of at least reagent grade hydrogen peroxide h2o2 isopropyl alcohol ipa and sodium bisulfite nahso3 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co china para chlorobenzoic acid p cba humic acid ha methylene blue mb and uridine from sigma aldrich

analyzed on an online dr1900 spectrophotometer hach usa at 664 nm uridine and uv254 were analyzed on a uv 2600 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan at 262 and 254 nm respectively dissolved organic carbon doc and ferric ion fe3 were measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph cpn shimadzu japan and an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 2000 perkinelmer usa respectively all reaction solutions were prepared with ultrapure water up produced from a milli q system advantage a10 millipore usa all experiments were conducted at least twice 2 2 simulation models 2 2 1 photochemical model in the uv h2o2 process micropollutant degradation results from both direct uv photolysis and indirect oxidation via ho which is expressed as follows 1 k p mp k d mp k i mp 2

goldstein et al 2007 and f h2o2 uv photon absorption fraction of h2o2 2 2 2 ssa model the ssa model applied to the uv h2o2 process assumes that the rate of ho consumption by water matrix target micropollutant and h2o2 is equal to its formation rate so the ho concentration reaches approximately steady state i e ho ss hence the ho ss and k i mp can be calculated consecutively as follows 4 h o

be 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 grebel et al 2010 2 2 3 qsar model qsar model was used to predict the k ho mp of a target micropollutant a data set consisting of 50 organic compounds with known second order reaction rate constants with ho k ho oc was established which was further divided into a training set and a validation set with a ratio of the number of organic compounds being 4 1 luo et al 2019 these organic compounds containing various functional groups cover a wide structural diversity to ensure the representativeness and broad applicability of the established qsar model sudhakaran and amy 2013 xiao et al 2015 for each organic compound totally 19 descriptors reflecting the constitutional electrostatic and quantum chemical properties were examined which were reported pertinent to radical reactivity kusic et al 2009 luo et al 2017 the molecular structure of each compound was preliminarily obtained by chembio3d ultra 12 0 and optimized by the b3lyp function 6 31 g d p basis set and polarizable continuum model taking account of the solvent effect of water of gaussian 09 to achieve the local minimum energy conformation lee et al 2015 borhani et al 2016 then by using spss 19 0 pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis pca were performed to screen out the significant descriptors and a linear relationship i e qsar model between lnk ho oc and the most significant descriptors was established through stepwise multiple linear regression mlr sudhakaran and amy 2013 jin et al 2015 the qsar model was further assessed by correlation coefficient r 2 leave one out cross validation q 2 loo and external explained variance q 2 ext as detailed in text s1 finally the second order reaction rate constant of a target micropollutant with ho e g k ho smn could be readily predicted by the qsar model established 2 3 portable measurement of hrsc 2 3 1 measurement device the mfps developed previously was used to measure the hrsc of a water matrix after certain modification its core part was a photoreactor containing an 8 w low pressure mercury vapor lamp wanhua co zhejiang china as the light source and a straight quartz tube for uv exposure fig s1 the photoreactor was featured with a portable size ca 4 cm of outer diameter and 30 cm of length and a light weight ca 200 g reaction solution stored in a glass container under magnetic stirring was recirculated with a peristaltic pump sequentially through the uv tube and an on line portable spectrophotometer hach dr1900 because only a part of the reaction solution could receive the uv exposure during each circulation a reduction equivalent exposure time t ree s was defined as the total reaction time t s multiplied by the ratio of the exposure volume of the uv tube πr tube 2 h tube m3 to the total volume of the reaction solution v m3 6 t ree π r tube 2 h tube v t where r tube and h tube internal radius 0 13 cm and length 29 cm of the uv tube respectively the uv photon fluence f 0 p uv einstein m 2 can then be calculated by eq 7 7 f p uv 0 e p uv 0 t ree the e 0 p uv in the uv tube was determined to be 3 98 10 4 einstein m 2 s 1 with a uridine solution 0 012 mm as shown in fig s2 jin et al 2006 2 3 2 measurement procedures as mentioned above the hrsc i e k ho s i s i in eq 4 was defined to represent the overall capacity of a water matrix competing for ho in this study the hrsc measurement procedures are illustrated in fig 1 specifically mb was used as a probe and ipa or p cba was used as a surrogate matrix component smc a series of standard solutions were prepared with mb 5 0 mg l 1 and smc with different concentrations ipa 0 0 320 μm or p cba 0 0 20 μm to represent different hrscs because the direct uv photolysis of mb fig s3 and ipa p cba was negligible rosenfeldt and linden 2007 wu et al 2008 these compounds were degraded predominantly by ho formed in the uv h2o2 process hence the rearrangement of eqs 4 and 5 yields a linear relationship between 1 k p mb and hrsc i e standard curve 8 1 k p mb e p uv 0 k h o mb r h o hrsc e p uv 0 k h o mb mb k h o h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k h o mb r h o where k p mb photon fluence based pseudo first order rate constant of mb degradation m2 einstein 1 as measured with the mfps and k ho mb second order reaction rate constant of mb with ho 2 1 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 the hrsc of a standard solution was calculated as the product of the second order reaction rate constant of an smc i e ipa p cba and its spiked concentration the k ho ipa and k ho p cba were reported to be 1 9 109 and 5 0 109 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 as different hrscs resulted in different k p mb values a standard curve could be established through linear regression i e eq 8 thereafter by spiking mb 5 0 mg l 1 into a test water and measuring the k p mb in the uv h2o2 process with the mfps the hrsc of the test water could be obtained by referring to the standard curve fig 1 2 4 ms pm method by combining the model simulation with the portable measurement as aforementioned the ms pm method was developed to facilitate the prediction of micropollutant degradation i e k p mp in the uv h2o2 process the prediction procedures of this method for a target micropollutant are summarized in fig 2 1 calculate the k d mp using the photochemical model of direct uv photolysis i e eq 2 2 calculate the r ho using the photochemical model of ho formation rate i e eq 3 and the k ho mp using the qsar model developed 3 establish a standard curve i e a plot of 1 k p mb vs hrsc in laboratory 4 measure the k p mb in a test water with the mfps in field and obtain the hrsc of the test water by referring to the standard curve 5 calculate the ho ss using the ssa model i e eq 4 and the k i mp using eq 5 and 6 obtain the k p mp by summing up the k d mp and k i mp i e eq 1 2 5 test waters seven different types of waters were tested including a up two synthetic waters prepared by dissolving ha in the up with doc values of 1 02 sw1 and 5 00 mg l 1 sw2 a raw water rw1 and a sand filtered effluent sf collected from a drinking water treatment plant located in yancheng city of jiangsu province and a raw water rw2 and a polymeric ferric sulfate coagulation ultrafiltration effluent pfs uf collected from a rural drinking water treatment facility located in changzhou city of jiangsu province the major quality parameters of these waters are provided in table 1 all test waters were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters and stored in a refrigerator 4 before experiments 3 results 3 1 prediction of k d smn and r ho by photochemical model taking smn as a model micropollutant its photon fluence based degradation rate constant via direct uv photolysis i e k d smn in the uv h2o2 process could be predicted by eq 2 at different initial concentrations of h2o2 h2o2 0 and smn smn 0 as shown in table s1 the k d smn varied little in the range of 19 26 19 44 m2 einstein 1 at h2o2 0 5 25 mg l 1 and smn 0 0 010 100 μg l 1 which was due to the low quantum yield of smn under direct uv photolysis φsmn 0 005 mole einstein 1 as well as the small photon absorption coefficients of h2o2 a h2o2 0 014 cm 1 and smn a smn 0 006 cm 1 under the experimental conditions applied boreen et al 2005 wang et al 2012 by using the photochemical model of ho formation rate i e eq 3 the r ho in the uv h2o2 process could be predicted at different h2o2 0 and smn 0 values as shown in fig s4 the predicted r ho exhibited a linear relationship with h2o2 0 in the range of 5 25 mg l 1 but was almost independent of smn 0 in the range of 0 010 100 μg l 1 3 2 qsar model establishment and prediction of k ho smn to establish the qsar model 19 descriptors were initially selected which are pertinent to the radical reactivity and thus frequently used to predict the second order reaction rate constants of organic compounds xiao et al 2015 li et al 2019 afterwards pearson correlation analysis pca and stepwise mlr were successively performed to reduce the dimensionality of variables in the training set 40 organic compounds first pearson correlation analysis was performed between the lnk ho oc and each descriptor and 9 descriptors i e c h o c acid ringatoms nonhatoms dbe e homo and hlg were screened out with an absolute pearson correlation coefficient r 0 4 at the 0 01 significance level double tailed table s2 second pca was performed to screen out significant descriptors as shown in fig s5 the first three components accounted for 90 4 of the total variance the component loading plots further reveal that c acid and e homo had the highest loading score in components 1 2 and 3 respectively fig s6 e homo represents the electron donating ability of a molecule which has been reported closely pertinent to the reactivity towards ho wang et al 2009 luo et al 2017 in addition o c and hlg were also selected because they had the second highest loading score absolute value in components 2 and 3 respectively and did not cluster with other descriptors finally the stepwise mlr was performed to establish the qsar model which also identified the two most significant descriptors i e o c and e homo table 2 shows three equations which established the linear relationship between the lnk ho oc and one two and five descriptors screened out above respectively by comparing the values of r 2 q 2 loo and q 2 ext text s1 and considering the conciseness in expression the qsar model was established as follows 9 ln k h o oc 27 992 2 131 o c 0 772 e homo table s3 lists the values of o c and e homo involved in the qsar model as well as the literature and predicted k ho oc values of each organic compound in the entire data set for most organic compounds the predicted k ho oc values agreed fairly well with the literature ones fig 3 while the largest deviation of k ho oc about 10 fold was observed for lactate table s3 it is worth noting that in respect to the second order reaction rate constant of an organic compound with a reactive radical the accuracy of a qsar model is usually considered acceptable if the predicted value deviates from the measured one within one order of magnitude kusic et al 2009 xiao et al 2015 by using the established qsar model i e eq 9 k ho smn was readily predicted to be 7 2 109 m 1 s 1 which is quite close to those reported before 5 0 0 3 109 m 1 s 1 boreen et al 2005 8 3 0 8 109 m 1 s 1 mezyk et al 2007 3 3 portable measurement of hrscs of test waters the k p mb values in the uv h2o2 process were measured in a series of smc ipa or p cba solutions to establish the standard curve i e a linear plot of 1 k p mb vs hrsc fig 4 a shows that the two standard curves established separately with ipa and p cba had nearly identical slopes the slight deviation may be ascribed to the small difference between the photon absorption coefficients of ipa and p cba at 254 nm because the water solubility of p cba is much lower than that of ipa ca 1 5300 at ambient temperature ipa can cover a much wider range of hrsc hence ipa is a better choice for smc to simulate the hrscs of more test waters although p cba gives rise to a nearly identical slope of the standard curve by measuring the k p mb in the uv h2o2 process in a test water the hrsc of the test water could be obtained by referring to the standard curve fig 1 fig 4b shows the k p mb and corresponding hrsc values of seven test waters as expected a smaller k p mb was associated with a higher hrsc i e a stronger competition for ho taking the standard curve established with ipa for example up showed the highest k p mb 121 5 m2 einstein 1 and the lowest hrsc 6 54 103 s 1 among the seven test waters because it only contained bicarbonate carbonate species hco 3 co 3 2 to compete for ho by contrast the high hrscs of rw1 5 91 105 s 1 and rw2 5 30 105 s 1 were attributed to their more complex matrices the doc values of rw1 and rw2 were 5 91 and 6 10 mg l 1 respectively higher than those of other test waters table 1 in addition the hrscs of sf 5 25 104 s 1 and pfs uf 1 06 105 s 1 were lower than those of rw1 and rw2 respectively implying a partial removal of ho scavenging components in water by the treatment processes applied in addition it can be seen that the two standard curves separately established with p cba and ipa led to the similar hrscs for each test water albeit with slightly different slopes 3 4 prediction of k p smn by ms pm method and experimental verification the r ho k ho smn and hrsc values obtained above were input into the ssa model i e eq 4 to calculate the ho ss in the seven test waters at various values of h2o2 0 5 25 mg l 1 and smn 0 0 01 100 μg l 1 as shown in table 3 the ho ss increased with increasing h2o2 0 in a certain test water and varied from 4 5 10 13 to 4 91 10 11 m in the seven test waters smn 0 100 μg l 1 the highest and lowest ho ss values were observed in the up and rw1 respectively which agrees well with their hrscs fig 4 in addition the ho ss values in the sf and pfs uf were higher than those in the rw1 and rw2 respectively besides the two standard curves separately established with p cba and ipa led to similar ho ss values under the same experimental conditions once the ho ss was available the k i smn could be predicted by eq 5 then the k p smn in each test water was readily calculated by summing up the k d smn and k i smn i e eq 1 as summarized in table s4 for a certain test water the predicted k p smn increased with increasing h2o2 0 at a fixed smn 0 for all the seven test waters the predicted k p smn increased with decreasing hrsc fig 4 or increasing ho ss table 3 when h2o2 0 and smn 0 were fixed again it is seen that a water matrix with a higher hrsc would consume more ho thus leading to a lower k p smn to verify the predicted values experiments were further conducted on the mfps to measure the k p smn values at h2o2 0 5 25 mg l 1 and smn 0 100 μg l 1 micropollutants are usually present in surface and drinking waters at trace levels i e ng l 1 to μg l 1 luo et al 2014 here a relatively high smn 0 i e 100 μg l 1 was adopted for the purpose of convenient analysis of water samples without solid phase extraction as mentioned above smn 0 in the studied range of 0 010 100 μg l 1 showed a negligible impact on the predicted k d smn table s1 and r ho fig s4 and eventually a low impact on the predicted k p smn in all test waters except the up due to its relatively instable hrscs table s4 fig 5 manifests a quite good consistency between the measured and predicted k p smn values in the seven test waters nevertheless it is noted that a majority of the predicted k p smn values were lower than the measured ones implying that the k ho smn i e 7 2 109 m 1 s 1 predicted by the qsar model was likely to be underestimated in the data set for establishing the qsar model organic compounds with similar functional groups to smn such as amoxicillin penicillin g v tryptophan and tyrosine with amine and or sulfur groups also had a predicted k ho oc lower than the literature one table s3 the k p smn values measured experimentally in the seven test waters were also provided in table s4 with the relative percent differences rpds all below 12 the relative error re between the predicted and measured k p smn values ranged from 48 to 20 in the seven test waters a majority of cases showed a negative re value but the pfs uf cases showed a positive re value at h2o2 0 15 and 25 mg l 1 in the uv h2o2 process a relatively high residual fe3 in the pfs uf 0 34 mg l 1 table 1 would be reduced to fe2 under uv irradiation which further reacted with h2o2 to produce reactive radicals i e photo fenton process meanwhile fe3 may also complex with mb to accelerate the mb degradation li et al 2016b hence the presence of fe3 in the pfs uf could induce an overestimation of k p smn 4 discussion in general the predicted k p smn values were lower than the measured ones in the seven test waters which was primarily attributed to an underestimation of the k ho smn by the qsar model in addition other potential errors may originate from the ssa model and the linear standard curve for the qsar model in consideration of the cost benefit ratio of quantum chemical calculation the molecular conformation was optimized on a local minimum energy rather than on a global minimum energy which may somewhat affect the accuracy of molecular orbital energy calculation lee et al 2015 furthermore the data set employed to establish the qsar model only consisted of 50 organic compounds which was probably insufficient to achieve reliable statistical analysis results in the future the optimization of molecular conformation on a global minimum energy and a sufficiently large data set may be attempted to improve the qsar model accuracy for the ssa model only ho formed via uv photolysis of h2o2 was considered whereas ho and other reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide anion o2 formed via uv photolysis of dom were all neglected this may also cause an underestimation of the predicted k p smn for the linear standard curve the r ho term in the denominator was actually impacted by the uv absorption coefficient at 254 nm of a test water as reflected in eq 3 as proposed by wang et al 2020 this impact could be significantly alleviated by using a high concentration of probe and a photoreactor with a short optical path length in this study a high concentration of mb 5 0 mg l 1 and the mfps l 0 46 cm were purposely employed fig s7 shows that the re of r ho δr ho which is defined in text s2 was below 7 5 for all the seven test waters hence both the accuracy and the range of application were improved for the linear standard curve nevertheless in the future if the ms pm method is extended to municipal and industrial wastewaters which have considerably lower uv transmittances than those of surface and drinking waters the impact of uv absorption coefficient of a test water should be corrected appropriately 5 conclusion this study developed a novel ms pm method to facilitate prediction of the k p mp in the uv h2o2 process based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn an ms pm method was developed by combining model simulation with portable measurement which could significantly facilitate prediction of the k p mp in the uv h2o2 process model simulation was performed with photochemical ho concentration ssa and qsar models and portable measurement was conducted on an mfps to quantify the hrsc of a water matrix taking smn as a model micropollutant the k p smn values predicted by the ms pm method in seven test waters exhibited a descending order as follows up sw1 sf pfs uf sw2 rw2 rw1 obviously the k p smn increased with decreasing hrsc or increasing ho ss in the test waters at an identical dose of h2o2 in general the predicted k p smn values were lower than the measured ones which was primarily attributed to an underestimation of the k ho smn by the qsar model although the re of k p smn ranged from 48 to 20 in the seven test waters the ms pm method demonstrated a sufficient accuracy if considering its distinct feature that is rapid evaluation of the performance of uv aops for micropollutant removal in the future the ms pm method can also be extended to other uv aops e g uv chlorine and uv persulfate and other polluted waters e g municipal and industrial wastewaters after certain modifications considering the fact that micropollutants are posing a big challenge to aquatic systems nowadays this developed method will significantly promote the application of uv aops especially with the increasingly strict standards of drinking water municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater

15767,ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are highly effective for micropollutant degradation however it is considerably time and labor consuming to evaluate the practical performance of uv aops this study developed a novel method through combination of model simulation with portable measurement ms pm to facilitate prediction of the photon fluence based rate constant of micropollutant degradation k p mp by uv h2o2 a commercially available uv aop model simulation was performed with photochemical hydroxyl radical ho concentration steady state approximation and quantitative structure activity relationship models and portable measurement was conducted on a mini fluidic photoreaction system to quantify the ho scavenging capacity hrsc of a water matrix the method was established and further verified experimentally in seven test waters by taking sulfamethazine smn as a model micropollutant a lower k p smn was predicted in a water matrix with a higher

conditions as well for a desired removal efficiency of target micropollutants this requires frequent field water collections transportations various bench scale tests using a well established photoreactor and high professional skills for operation of the photoreactor e g quasi collimated beam apparatus and advanced analytical instruments e g an ultra high performance liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometer uplc ms ms for micropollutant analysis which is considerably time and labor consuming and thus expensive therefore there is an urgent need to develop a method for facilitated prediction of the k p mp under practical operation conditions of uv aops the photochemical model and ho concentration steady state approximation ssa model have been applied to kinetic simulations of micropollutant degradation by uv h2o2 glaze et al 1995 baeza and knappe 2011 the direct uv photolysis rate constant and the steady state ho concentration i e ho ss can be estimated through model simulations and then the indirect oxidation rate constant via ho is calculated as the product of ho ss and the second order reaction rate constant of a target micropollutant toward ho k ho mp the k ho mp can be obtained from published literatures measured experimentally by competition kinetics method onstein et al 1999 or predicted by a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model lee and von gunten 2012 sudhakaran and amy 2013 however the prediction of k p mp in real waters is a complex issue because the water matrix such as dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic ions e g hco 3 co 3 2 no 3 and po 4 3 will compete against the target micropollutant for reactive radicals formed during the uv h2o2 process kwon et al 2019 it is usually impossible to analyze all water matrix components and their concentrations required for the model input which may induce a large error in the k p mp prediction fortunately an integrated index ho scavenging capacity hrsc has been recently proposed to represent the overall ho competitiveness of a water matrix which can be easily measured by a visible spectrophotometer wang et al 2020 furthermore we have previously developed a mini fluidic photoreaction system mfps to facilitate bench scale photochemical studies compared to the commonly used quasi collimated beam apparatus the mfps has obvious advantages such as output of a high photon fluence rate to greatly reduce the experimental time accurate determination of photon fluence by using a micro fluorescent silica detector to monitor the real time fluctuation of lamp output on line absorbance measurement photoreactor temperature control and a small size li et al 2016a therefore it is an ideal portable device for field measurement of the hrsc of a real water matrix this study was aimed to develop a new method through combination of model simulation with portable measurement ms pm to facilitate the prediction of micropollutant degradation by uv h2o2 the model simulation was performed with photochemical ho concentration ssa and qsar models and the portable measurement was conducted on the mfps to quantify the hrsc of a water matrix sulfamethazine smn a typical sulfonamide antibiotic frequently detected in various waters hou et al 2015 chen et al 2020 was selected as a model micropollutant the photon fluence based degradation rate constants of smn by uv h2o2 i e k p smn were predicted by the ms pm method in seven test waters and further verified experimentally the novel method is expected to significantly facilitate the design and field assessment of uv aops for micropollutant removal from drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and analytical methods all chemicals used were of at least reagent grade hydrogen peroxide h2o2

analyzed on an online dr1900 spectrophotometer hach usa at 664 nm uridine and uv254 were analyzed on a uv 2600 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan at 262 and 254 nm respectively dissolved organic carbon doc and ferric ion fe3 were measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph cpn shimadzu japan and an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 2000 perkinelmer usa respectively all reaction solutions were prepared with ultrapure water up produced from a milli q system advantage a10 millipore usa all experiments were conducted at least twice 2 2 simulation models 2 2 1 photochemical model in the uv h2o2 process micropollutant degradation results from both direct uv photolysis and indirect oxidation via ho which is expressed as follows 1 k p mp k d mp k i mp 2

goldstein et al 2007 and f h2o2 uv photon absorption fraction of h2o2 2 2 2 ssa model the ssa model applied to the uv h2o2 process assumes that the rate of ho consumption by water matrix target micropollutant and h2o2 is equal to its formation rate so the ho concentration reaches approximately steady state i e ho ss hence the ho ss and k i mp can be calculated consecutively as follows 4 h o

be 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 grebel et al 2010 2 2 3 qsar model qsar model was used to predict the k ho mp of a target micropollutant a data set consisting of 50 organic compounds with known second order reaction rate constants with ho k ho oc was established which was further divided into a training set and a validation set with a ratio of the number of organic compounds being 4 1 luo et al 2019 these organic compounds containing various functional groups cover a wide structural diversity to ensure the representativeness and broad applicability of the established qsar model sudhakaran and amy 2013 xiao et al 2015 for each organic compound totally 19 descriptors reflecting the constitutional electrostatic and quantum chemical properties were examined which were reported pertinent to radical reactivity kusic et al 2009 luo et al 2017 the molecular structure of each compound was preliminarily obtained by chembio3d ultra 12 0 and optimized by the b3lyp function 6 31 g d p basis set and polarizable continuum model taking account of the solvent effect of water of gaussian 09 to achieve the local minimum energy conformation lee et al 2015 borhani et al 2016 then by using spss 19 0 pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis pca were performed to screen out the significant descriptors and a linear relationship i e qsar model between lnk ho oc and the most significant descriptors was established through stepwise multiple linear regression mlr sudhakaran and amy 2013 jin et al 2015 the qsar model was further assessed by correlation coefficient r 2 leave one out cross validation q 2 loo and external explained variance q 2 ext as detailed in text s1 finally the second order reaction rate constant of a target micropollutant with ho e g k ho smn could be readily predicted by the qsar model established 2 3 portable measurement of hrsc 2 3 1 measurement device the mfps developed previously was used to measure the hrsc of a water matrix after certain modification its core part was a photoreactor containing an 8 w low pressure mercury vapor lamp wanhua co zhejiang china as the light source and a straight quartz tube for uv exposure fig s1 the photoreactor was featured with a portable size ca 4 cm of outer diameter and 30 cm of length and a light weight ca 200 g reaction solution stored in a glass container under magnetic stirring was recirculated with a peristaltic pump sequentially through the uv tube and an on line portable spectrophotometer hach dr1900 because only a part of the reaction solution could receive the uv exposure during each circulation a reduction equivalent exposure time t ree s was defined as the total reaction time t s multiplied by the ratio of the exposure volume of the uv tube πr tube 2 h tube m3 to the total volume of the reaction solution v m3 6 t ree π r tube 2 h tube v t where r tube and h tube internal radius 0 13 cm and length 29 cm of the uv tube respectively the uv photon fluence f 0 p uv einstein m 2 can then be calculated by eq 7 7 f p uv 0 e p uv 0 t ree the e 0 p uv in the uv tube was determined to be 3 98 10 4 einstein m 2 s 1 with a uridine solution 0 012 mm as shown in fig s2 jin et al 2006 2 3 2 measurement procedures as mentioned above the hrsc i e k ho s i s i in eq 4 was defined to represent the overall capacity of a water matrix competing for ho in this study the hrsc measurement procedures are illustrated in fig 1 specifically mb was used as a probe and ipa or p cba was used as a surrogate matrix component smc a series of standard solutions were prepared with mb 5 0 mg l 1 and smc with different concentrations ipa 0 0 320 μm or p cba 0 0 20 μm to represent different hrscs because the direct uv photolysis of mb fig s3 and ipa p cba was negligible rosenfeldt and linden 2007 wu et al 2008 these compounds were degraded predominantly by ho formed in the uv h2o2 process hence the rearrangement of eqs 4 and 5 yields a linear relationship between 1 k p mb and hrsc i e standard curve 8 1 k p mb e p uv 0 k h o mb r h o hrsc e p uv 0 k h o mb mb k h o h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k h o mb r h o where k p mb photon fluence based pseudo first order rate constant of mb degradation m2 einstein 1 as measured with the mfps and k ho mb second order reaction rate constant of mb with ho 2 1 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 the hrsc of a standard solution was calculated as the product of the second order reaction rate constant of an smc i e ipa p cba and its spiked concentration the k ho ipa and k ho p cba were reported to be 1 9 109 and 5 0 109 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 as different hrscs resulted in different k p mb values a standard curve could be established through linear regression i e eq 8 thereafter by spiking mb 5 0 mg l 1 into a test water and measuring the k p mb in the uv h2o2 process with the mfps the hrsc of the test water could be obtained by referring to the standard curve fig 1 2 4 ms pm method by combining the model simulation with the portable measurement as aforementioned the ms pm method was developed to facilitate the prediction of micropollutant degradation i e k p mp in the uv h2o2 process the prediction procedures of this method for a target micropollutant are summarized in fig 2 1 calculate the k d mp using the photochemical model of direct uv photolysis i e eq 2 2 calculate the r ho using the photochemical model of ho formation rate i e eq 3 and the k ho mp using the qsar model developed 3 establish a standard curve i e a plot of 1 k p mb vs hrsc in laboratory 4 measure the k p mb in a test water with the mfps in field and obtain the hrsc of the test water by referring to the standard curve 5 calculate the ho ss using the ssa model i e eq 4 and the k i mp using eq 5 and 6 obtain the k p mp by summing up the k d mp and k i mp i e eq 1 2 5 test waters seven different types of waters were tested including a up two synthetic waters prepared by dissolving ha in the up with doc values of 1 02 sw1 and 5 00 mg l 1 sw2 a raw water rw1 and a sand filtered effluent sf collected from a drinking water treatment plant located in yancheng city of jiangsu province and a raw water rw2 and a polymeric ferric sulfate coagulation ultrafiltration effluent pfs uf collected from a rural drinking water treatment facility located in changzhou city of jiangsu province the major quality parameters of these waters are provided in table 1 all test waters were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters and stored in a refrigerator 4 before experiments 3 results 3 1 prediction of k d smn and r ho by photochemical model taking smn as a model micropollutant its photon fluence based degradation rate constant via direct uv photolysis i e k d smn in the uv h2o2 process could be predicted by eq 2 at different initial concentrations of h2o2 h2o2 0 and smn smn 0 as shown in table s1 the k d smn varied little in the range of 19 26 19 44 m2 einstein 1 at h2o2 0 5 25 mg l 1 and smn 0 0 010 100 μg l 1 which was due to the low quantum yield of smn under direct uv photolysis φsmn 0 005 mole einstein 1 as well as the small photon absorption coefficients of h2o2 a h2o2 0 014 cm 1 and smn a smn 0 006 cm 1 under the experimental conditions applied boreen et al 2005 wang et al 2012 by using the photochemical model of ho formation rate i e eq 3 the r ho in the uv h2o2 process could be predicted at different h2o2 0 and smn 0 values as shown in fig s4 the predicted r ho exhibited a linear relationship with h2o2 0 in the range of 5 25 mg l 1 but was almost independent of smn 0 in the range of 0 010 100 μg l 1 3 2 qsar model establishment and prediction of k ho smn to establish the qsar model 19 descriptors were initially selected which are pertinent to the radical reactivity and thus frequently used to predict the second order reaction rate constants of organic compounds xiao et al 2015 li et al 2019 afterwards pearson correlation analysis pca and stepwise mlr were successively performed to reduce the dimensionality of variables in the training set 40 organic compounds first pearson correlation analysis was performed between the lnk ho oc and each descriptor and 9 descriptors i e c h o c acid ringatoms nonhatoms dbe e homo and hlg were screened out with an absolute pearson correlation coefficient r 0 4 at the 0 01 significance level double tailed table s2 second pca was performed to screen out significant descriptors as shown in fig s5 the first three components accounted for 90 4 of the total variance the component loading plots further reveal that c acid and e homo had the highest loading score in components 1 2 and 3 respectively fig s6 e homo represents the electron donating ability of a molecule which has been reported closely pertinent to the reactivity towards ho wang et al 2009 luo et al 2017 in addition o c and hlg were also selected because they had the second highest loading score absolute value in components 2 and 3 respectively and did not cluster with other descriptors finally the stepwise mlr was performed to establish the qsar model which also identified the two most significant descriptors i e o c and e homo table 2 shows three equations which established the linear relationship between the lnk ho oc and one two and five descriptors screened out above respectively by comparing the values of r 2 q 2 loo and q 2 ext text s1 and considering the conciseness in expression the qsar model was established as follows 9 ln k h o oc 27 992 2 131 o c 0 772 e homo table s3 lists the values of o c and e homo involved in the qsar model as well as the literature and predicted k ho oc values of each organic compound in the entire data set for most organic compounds the predicted k ho oc values agreed fairly well with the literature ones fig 3 while the largest deviation of k ho oc about 10 fold was observed for lactate table s3 it is worth noting that in respect to the second order reaction rate constant of an organic compound with a reactive radical the accuracy of a qsar model is usually considered acceptable if the predicted value deviates from the measured one within one order of magnitude kusic et al 2009 xiao et al 2015 by using the established qsar model i e eq 9 k ho smn was readily predicted to be 7 2 109 m 1 s 1 which is quite close to those reported before 5 0 0 3 109 m 1 s 1 boreen et al 2005 8 3 0 8 109 m 1 s 1 mezyk et al 2007 3 3 portable measurement of hrscs of test waters the k p mb values in the uv h2o2 process were measured in a series of smc ipa or p cba solutions to establish the standard curve i e a linear plot of 1 k p mb vs hrsc fig 4 a shows that the two standard curves established separately with ipa and p cba had nearly identical slopes the slight deviation may be ascribed to the small difference between the photon absorption coefficients of ipa and p cba at 254 nm because the water solubility of p cba is much lower than that of ipa ca 1 5300 at ambient temperature ipa can cover a much wider range of hrsc hence ipa is a better choice for smc to simulate the hrscs of more test waters although p cba gives rise to a nearly identical slope of the standard curve by measuring the k p mb in the uv h2o2 process in a test water the hrsc of the test water could be obtained by referring to the standard curve fig 1 fig 4b shows the k p mb and corresponding hrsc values of seven test waters as expected a smaller k p mb was associated with a higher hrsc i e a stronger competition for ho taking the standard curve established with ipa for example up showed the highest k p mb 121 5 m2 einstein 1 and the lowest hrsc 6 54 103 s 1 among the seven test waters because it only contained bicarbonate carbonate species hco 3 co 3 2 to compete for ho by contrast the high hrscs of rw1 5 91 105 s 1 and rw2 5 30 105 s 1 were attributed to their more complex matrices the doc values of rw1 and rw2 were 5 91 and 6 10 mg l 1 respectively higher than those of other test waters table 1 in addition the hrscs of sf 5 25 104 s 1 and pfs uf 1 06 105 s 1 were lower than those of rw1 and rw2 respectively implying a partial removal of ho scavenging components in water by the treatment processes applied in addition it can be seen that the two standard curves separately established with p cba and ipa led to the similar hrscs for each test water albeit with slightly different slopes 3 4 prediction of k p smn by ms pm method and experimental verification the r ho k ho smn and hrsc values obtained above were input into the ssa model i e eq 4 to calculate the ho ss in the seven test waters at various values of h2o2 0 5 25 mg l 1 and smn 0 0 01 100 μg l 1 as shown in table 3 the ho ss increased with increasing h2o2 0 in a certain test water and varied from 4 5 10 13 to 4 91 10 11 m in the seven test waters smn 0 100 μg l 1 the highest and lowest ho ss values were observed in the up and rw1 respectively which agrees well with their hrscs fig 4 in addition the ho ss values in the sf and pfs uf were higher than those in the rw1 and rw2 respectively besides the two standard curves separately established with p cba and ipa led to similar ho ss values under the same experimental conditions once the ho ss was available the k i smn could be predicted by eq 5 then the k p smn in each test water was readily calculated by summing up the k d smn and k i smn i e eq 1 as summarized in table s4 for a certain test water the predicted k p smn increased with increasing h2o2 0 at a fixed smn 0 for all the seven test waters the predicted k p smn increased with decreasing hrsc fig 4 or increasing ho ss table 3 when h2o2 0 and smn 0 were fixed again it is seen that a water matrix with a higher hrsc would consume more ho thus leading to a lower k p smn to verify the predicted values experiments were further conducted on the mfps to measure the k p smn values at h2o2 0 5 25 mg l 1 and smn 0 100 μg l 1 micropollutants are usually present in surface and drinking waters at trace levels i e ng l 1 to μg l 1 luo et al 2014 here a relatively high smn 0 i e 100 μg l 1 was adopted for the purpose of convenient analysis of water samples without solid phase extraction as mentioned above smn 0 in the studied range of 0 010 100 μg l 1 showed a negligible impact on the predicted k d smn table s1 and r ho fig s4 and eventually a low impact on the predicted k p smn in all test waters except the up due to its relatively instable hrscs table s4 fig 5 manifests a quite good consistency between the measured and predicted k p smn values in the seven test waters nevertheless it is noted that a majority of the predicted k p smn values were lower than the measured ones implying that the k ho smn i e 7 2 109 m 1 s 1 predicted by the qsar model was likely to be underestimated in the data set for establishing the qsar model organic compounds with similar functional groups to smn such as amoxicillin penicillin g v tryptophan and tyrosine with amine and or sulfur groups also had a predicted k ho oc lower than the literature one table s3 the k p smn values measured experimentally in the seven test waters were also provided in table s4 with the relative percent differences rpds all below 12 the relative error re between the predicted and measured k p smn values ranged from 48 to 20 in the seven test waters a majority of cases showed a negative re value but the pfs uf cases showed a positive re value at h2o2 0 15 and 25 mg l 1 in the uv h2o2 process a relatively high residual fe3 in the pfs uf 0 34 mg l 1 table 1 would be reduced to fe2 under uv irradiation which further reacted with h2o2 to produce reactive radicals i e photo fenton process meanwhile fe3 may also complex with mb to accelerate the mb degradation li et al 2016b hence the presence of fe3 in the pfs uf could induce an overestimation of k p smn 4 discussion in general the predicted k p smn values were lower than the measured ones in the seven test waters which was primarily attributed to an underestimation of the k ho smn by the qsar model in addition other potential errors may originate from the ssa model and the linear standard curve for the qsar model in consideration of the cost benefit ratio of quantum chemical calculation the molecular conformation was optimized on a local minimum energy rather than on a global minimum energy which may somewhat affect the accuracy of molecular orbital energy calculation lee et al 2015 furthermore the data set employed to establish the qsar model only consisted of 50 organic compounds which was probably insufficient to achieve reliable statistical analysis results in the future the optimization of molecular conformation on a global minimum energy and a sufficiently large data set may be attempted to improve the qsar model accuracy for the ssa model only ho formed via uv photolysis of h2o2 was considered whereas ho and other reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide anion o2 formed via uv photolysis of dom were all neglected this may also cause an underestimation of the predicted k p smn for the linear standard curve the r ho term in the denominator was actually impacted by the uv absorption coefficient at 254 nm of a test water as reflected in eq 3 as proposed by wang et al 2020 this impact could be significantly alleviated by using a high concentration of probe and a photoreactor with a short optical path length in this study a high concentration of mb 5 0 mg l 1 and the mfps l 0 46 cm were purposely employed fig s7 shows that the re of r ho δr ho which is defined in text s2 was below 7 5 for all the seven test waters hence both the accuracy and the range of application were improved for the linear standard curve nevertheless in the future if the ms pm method is extended to municipal and industrial wastewaters which have considerably lower uv transmittances than those of surface and drinking waters the impact of uv absorption coefficient of a test water should be corrected appropriately 5 conclusion this study developed a novel ms pm method to facilitate prediction of the k p mp in the uv h2o2 process based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn an ms pm method was developed by combining model simulation with portable measurement which could significantly facilitate prediction of the k p mp in the uv h2o2 process model simulation was performed with photochemical ho concentration ssa and qsar models and portable measurement was conducted on an mfps to quantify the hrsc of a water matrix taking smn as a model micropollutant the k p smn values predicted by the ms pm method in seven test waters exhibited a descending order as follows up sw1 sf pfs uf sw2 rw2 rw1 obviously the k p smn increased with decreasing hrsc or increasing ho ss in the test waters at an identical dose of h2o2 in general the predicted k p smn values were lower than the measured ones which was primarily attributed to an underestimation of the k ho smn by the qsar model although the re of k p smn ranged from 48 to 20 in the seven test waters the ms pm method demonstrated a sufficient accuracy if considering its distinct feature that is rapid evaluation of the performance of uv aops for micropollutant removal in the future the ms pm method can also be extended to other uv aops e g uv chlorine and uv persulfate and other polluted waters e g municipal and industrial wastewaters after certain modifications considering the fact that micropollutants are posing a big challenge to aquatic systems nowadays this developed method will significantly promote the application of uv aops especially with the increasingly strict standards of drinking water municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater

15768,polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation experiments at pilot scale were performed with fullscale municipal waste activated sludge development of biomass pha content was quantified by thermogravimetric analysis over 48 h the biomass reached up to 0 49 0 03 gpha gvss n 4 samples were processed in parallel to characterise the distribution of pha in the biomass selective staining methods and image analysis were performed by confocal laser scanning microscopy the image analysis indicated that nominally 55 of this waste activated sludge was engaged in pha storage activity thus even if the biomass pha content reached 0 49gpha gvss the accumulating fraction of the biomass was estimated to have attained about 0 64gpha gvss the combination of quantitative microscopy and polymer mass assessment enabled to distinguish the effect of level of enrichment in pha storing bacteria and the average pha storage capacity of the accumulating bacteria the distribution of microbial 16s rrna levels did not follow a measurable trend during pha accumulation keywords polyhydroxyalkanoate pha biopolymer activated sludge staining image analysis thermogravimetric analysis tga data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are polyesters that can be accumulated as intracellular granules by many types of microorganisms especially under dynamic environmental conditions anderson and dawes 1990 dawes and senior 1973 van loosdrecht et al 1997 typically these dynamic conditions are created by alternating the presence and absence of organic carbon sources and or electron acceptors under dynamic conditions pha accumulation is a competition strategy for microorganisms to thrive majone et al 1999 reis et al 2003 van loosdrecht et al 1997 the accumulated intracellular polymers can be harvested and applied as biobased and biodegradable polyesters phas are functional and suitable in many kinds of applications compared to fossil oil derived polyesters used ubiquitously today laycock et al 2013 pratt et al 2019 microbial community based pha production processes exploit purposefully imposed or inherently present environmental conditions in open microbiological processes that favour the growth and enrichment of pha storing phenotypes estevez alonso et al 2021 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 kourmentza et al 2017 depending on the source of the pha storing biomass microbial community based pha production methods may be denoted as either enrichment accumulation or direct accumulation approaches enrichment accumulation refers to pha production with a biomass that has been produced purposefully with optimised selection conditions a majority of the selected bacteria in the biomass is expected to produce pha a direct accumulation process uses waste activated sludge produced in municipal and or industrial biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps bengsston et al 2017 morgan sagastume 2016 notwithstanding that the principal function of the process is to treat wastewater selection of pha storing microorganisms will occur due to the inherent dynamic process conditions van loosdrecht et al 1997 the selection could be due to the cyclic day night loading regime in wastewater supply and or a plug flow character in the wastewater treatment process werker et al 2020 the wastewater treatment processes select for a microbial community that has broad functional diversity as a result there will be non pha storing microorganisms in the direct accumulation biomass essential for the treatment of influent contaminants pei et al 2022 pha production is accomplished in a side stream fed batch bioprocess where the supplied pha storing biomass is fed with volatile fatty acid rich substrates to reach the maximum biomass pha content the volatile fatty acid rich substrates can be derived for example from the fermentation of wastewater organic fraction of municipal solid waste or the primary sludge of a wwtp estevez alonso et al 2021 the use of fermented primary sludge also offers the possibility of converting the wwtp into a pha production facility without modifying the main treatment process over the past 10 years different pilot scale studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of microbial community based pha production processes using different feedstocks estevez alonso et al 2021 in the pha production process maximum biomass pha content is a critical performance factor that influences the economic viability of commercial advancements estevez alonso et al 2021 paul et al 2020 valentino et al 2017 consequently in almost all the microbial community based research literature to date maximum achievable biomass pha content has been a key parameter when assessing the performance of the pha production process biomass pha content is typically quantified by the mass of pha accumulated with respect to the total volatile suspended solids vss active biomass is commonly approximated by the vss minus the pha mass in these solids microbial community based approaches have been reported to have a maximum biomass pha content between 30 and 90 gpha gvss estevez alonso et al 2021 implicitly it is often assumed that improvement in pha production is reflected by improvement in selection and mitigating flanking populations during accumulation tamis et al 2014 observed different biomass pha content for microbial community based approaches may be attributed to two main factors one factor is the fraction of pha storing bacteria in the biomass defined as a degree of enrichment the other factor is the pha accumulation capacity of the active pha storing bacteria the current methods for measurement of biomass pha content do not provide insight to distinguish between these two factors to assess the individual cellular pha distribution flow cytometry or raman spectroscopy may be applied in pure cultures nile red or bodipy staining has been employed with flow cytometry to quantify the pha content and to study the pha content in single cells kacmar et al 2006 saranya et al 2012 vidal mas et al 2001 similarly methods have been explored based on floc disruption and statistics of cell to cell pha content by means of raman spectroscopy of the dispersed microbial biomass majed et al 2009 in microbial community based pha research these methods are less applicable due to problems of dispersion of the biomass in single cells and the variation of cellular morphologies in microbial communities moreover destruction of the floc structure obscures to obtain information from the distribution of the pha granules and pha storing bacteria in the communities the aim of the present work is to develop the selective staining methods for a quantitative estimation of the municipal activated sludge degree of enrichment and consequently the average pha accumulation capacity of the pha storing fraction of that biomass in the present work the pha rich biomass was produced with a municipal activated sludge using the direct accumulation approach at pilot scale the progress of polymer accumulation was monitored over time with grab samples for biomass pha content recently developed selective staining for visualisation on parallel samples was also applied pei et al 2022 obtained confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm images were analysed to quantify the pha distribution 2 material and methods 2 1 pha accumulation methods and sampling a well mixed 200 l jacketed stainless steel reactor with 167 l working volume for pha accumulation was

temperature 25 c in the active working volume aeration and mixing were up to 12 h until steady state dissolved oxygen levels indicated a steady biomass endogenous respiration level this pre aeration was followed by acclimation applied as a sequence of three feast famine cycles morgan sagastume et al 2017 at the beginning of the feast period a pulse of substrate that targeted a reactor acetic acid concentration of 100 mgcod l was given for each feast famine cycle the length of the feast and famine period was approximately 20 and 60 min respectively after the third famine phase pulse wise feed on demand pha accumulation was performed over 48 h with constant mixing and aeration pei et al 2022 substrate doses in pulse wise inputs targeted a maximum reactor acetic acid concentration of 100 mgcod l at selected time points 4 x 50 ml representative mixed liquor grab samples were taken duplicate sub samples of 5 ml were fixed with formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3 7 sigma aldrich netherlands preserved in 10 ml 1x phosphate buffered saline panreac applichem itw reagents spain with 10 ml pure ethanol vwr the netherlands and stored at 5 c before performing the staining afterwards the remaining fixed sample was stored at 20 c for long term preservation 2 2 analytical methods mixed liquor sample volumes were measured v mixed liquor suspended solids were separated by centrifugation 3248rcf and 4 c for 20 m and the supernatant was removed the pellet mass was transferred with milli q water merck germany by rinsing into a clean pre dried 105 c and tare weighed crucible the pellet mass m1 representing total suspended solids tss was estimated from the dried weight 105 c over 12 h afterwards pellet fixed solids m2 were determined by ashing at 550 c for 2 h the mixed liquor vss concentration was estimated as m 1 m 2 v biomass pha content was determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga according to chan et al 2017 with minor modification the mixed liquor

decanting supernatent about 5 mg of powder samples were disposed to thermal decomposition tga 2 meller toledor switherlands in 3 principal steps as follows 1 isothermal nitrogen gas atmosphere drying at 105 c for 10 min 2 heating with nitrogen gas atmosphere at 10 min to 550 c 3 isothermal ashing in air atmosphere at 550 c for 30 min the biomass pha content as gpha gvss was derived from the background corrected characteristic polymer decomposition peak detectable from the derivative thermogravimetric trend as described in chan et al 2017 using in house matlab data processing algorithms mathworks ma usa non pha biomass was estimated as vss minus pha mass subsequently the mass ratio of pha and non pha biomass was calculated 2 3 biomass staining and microscopy image analysis for the samples fixed with formaldehyde intracellular pha granules and protein staining was performed using bodipy 493 503 bodipy thermo fisher scientific ma usa in combination with sypro red thermo fisher scientific ma usa as described in pei et al 2022 glass slides with 10 reaction wells paul marienfeld gmbh co kg germany were used in each reaction well 5 µl fixed sample was loaded with 0 5 µl bodipy at 2 ng µl and 0 5 µl of 100 times diluted sypro red the loaded slides were incubated at 46 c until dried the dried slide was washed with milli q water to remove any excess dye and then dried again with compressed air each prepared slide was mounted with vectashield hardset antifade mounting medium h 1400 10 vectashield vector laboratories ca usa and sealed for the same series of the fixed samples fluorescence in situ hybridization fish using the bacterial probe eub338 i 5 gct gcc tcc cgt agg agt3 labelled with cy5 was combined with pha staining via bodipy and dna staining with dapi the staining was performed according to llobet brossa et al 1998 with modifications as described in pei et al 2022 a 0 5 µl aliquot fixed sample was heat fixed in a slide well then dehydrated with ethanol hybridization buffer 10 µl with 35 formamide was added followed by 0 5 µl of eub 338i bodipy and dapi at respectively 50 ng µl 2 ng µl and 250 ng µl the hybridization was performed at 46 c for 1 5 h followed by washing using buffer pre heated to 48 c for 15 m and cold milli q water the washed slide was dried with compressed air then mounted and sealed with vectashield the confocal laser scanning microscope lsm 880 carl zeiss germany was used with plan apochromat 10x 0 45 m27 20x 0 8 m27 and 63x 1 4 oil dic objectives carl zeiss germany from each sample well with 63x objective a sequence of 11 randomly selected images with floc containing fields of view were acquired digital resolution 1584 by 1584 pixel for the images with 2 dyes and 1912 pixel by 1912 pixel for the images with 3 dyes after initially surveying the well for sample quality dyes were excited and dye specific captured images averaged from 16 scans were saved to separate file channels at 16 bit depth to excite dapi bodipy sypro red and cy5 a diode 405 30 laser at 405 nm an argon laser at 488 nm a dpss 561 10 laser at 561 nm and a hene633 laser at 633 nm were used respectively the same laser power and gain were used for each dye in each respective set of 11 images taken and imaging conditions were otherwise kept similar from well to well fiji image j imagej2 ver 1 52p was used for processing the captured images brightness levels were maximized without overexposing pixel data then for each dye specific channel with each respective well series of 11 images a cut off threshold intensity level was established by visual inspection total pixel areas of bodipy sypro red rna fish and dapi were measured representing areas bio volume of pha proteins 16s rrna and dna 2 4 data analysis and interpretation the trends in progress of biomass pha content gpha gvss over time were estimated by least squares regression analysis according to bengsston et al 2017 1 biomass pha content a 0 a 1 1 e t τ where a 0 and a 1 are constants that enable the estimation of rates as a function of time the accumulation time constant τ h represented process first order kinetics in reaching a maximum level of pha content from microscopy and image analysis a characteristic relative area ratio for pha to non pha biomass ratio v v was calculated 2 pha to non pha biomass ratio v v pha area non pha biomass area where the overlay of pha pixel area distribution on flocs were evaluated from the bodipy signal the non pha biomass area could be assessed from protein or dna related fluorescent signals namely protein area and dna area relative signal pixel distributions in overlay areas defined by the individual biomass flocs were used to give an index representing the fraction of the viable microorganisms as 3 viable microorganism fraction rna area dna area similarly an index representing a measure for the pha storing microorganism fraction within the expressed viable areas for flocs within each captured field of view was characterized as 4 viable pha storing microorganism fraction pha area rna area in order to impose a normal distribution for statistical analysis the obtained v v ratios were transformed to a logit scale warton and hui 2011 5 x l n x 1 x where x is the v v ratios of pha to non pha biomass viable microorganism fraction and viable pha storing microorganism fraction obtained by eqs 2 4 and x is the respective transformed v v ratios the statistical analysis including one way anova pearson s chi square normality test quantile quantile plot and linear regression were performed in the logit scale the averages and the standard deviations for the ratios eqs 2 4 were calculated with the logit transformed results x final results are reported with values transformed back to the scale of proportions 0 1 6 x 10 x 10 x 1 where x is the average v v ratios of pha to non pha biomass viable microorganism fraction and viable pha storing microorganism fraction in the logit scale 3 results and discussion the potential for quantitative image analysis was evaluated from replicated accumulation experiments for the reproducibility and selection of image magnification the pha accumulation process performance was assessed by the biomass pha content development eq 1 from the optimal magnification correlation between volume and mass ratios of pha to non pha biomass was established the degree of enrichment of pha storing bacteria for activated sludge from bath wwtp was estimated subsequently from the estimated biomass pha content and the degree of enrichment the average biomass pha content for the pha storing fraction in the activated sludge was calculated combined staining of pha fish and dna was applied to monitor the trend of microbial activity during the pha accumulation process 3 1 quantification of pha distribution previously methods of selective staining were developed and applied to visualise the pha storage process pei et al 2022 efforts to extend methods for quantitative image analysis started with the assessment of reproducibility alongside considerations for optimal image magnification for the cslm system available objectives with 10 20 and 63x magnification using optimum settings with 2 image channels represented image pixel dimensions of 0 26 0 15 and 0 09 μ m pixel respectively replicate slides n 3 were prepared with 4 replicate wells per slide on biomass samples with negligible polymer content 0 h accumulation and with significant polymer content 24 h accumulation for each well 4 to 11 fields of view were acquired at the three available magnifications fig 1 less images were acquired with 10x magnification compared to 63x where 11 images were taken due to floc concentration and differences in coverage this dataset was used to evaluate quantitative reproducibility the pixel area of pha is expected to be proportional to an integrated volume of pha defined by the magnification dependent pixel area and cslm focal depth similarly the volume of non pha biomass is expected to be proportional to the protein area or dna area identified with sypro red or dapi respectively these volumes relate to mass by respective densities of the biomass and pha granules if the densities remain constant during the accumulation process then the pha to non pha biomass volume to volume ratio v v from image analysis should correspond directly with the pha to non pha biomass mass to mass ratio m m provided by tga analysis however the mass ratio can range from 0 to infinity while the volume ratio derived from overlapping respective pixel areas from image analysis is constrained to range from 0 to 1 this constrained range also affects the normality of the obtained results warton and hui 2011 to make the correlation between the volume ratio and the mass ratio a logit transformation eq 5 was applied to the data of image analysis to account for the inherently bounded scale after the logit transformation the reproducibility of the volume ratio between the area of pha and non pha biomass represented by the area of protein stain was assessed for initial samples 0 h or samples after accumulation 24 h one way anova of the averaged pha and non pha biomass protein volume ratio per reaction well indicated no significant difference 95 ci for analysis of replicate wells n 4 on the same slide similarly no significant difference 95 ci was found among the reaction wells among three replicate slides this outcome suggested that one well with a representative sample could describe the average state of the biomass during an accumulation if sufficient fields of view are acquired per well consistent outcomes between replicate slides supported potential for the quantitative reproducibility of the methods of staining and image analysis influences of magnification on the observation of pha rich biomass were first assessed qualitatively details of interest including individual bacterial cells and pha granules were anticipated to be in the order of 1 μ m and 0 5 μ m respectively as shown in fig 1 the applied magnification for analysis did not strongly influence outcomes of image analysis at the beginning of an accumulation because biomass pha content is low at start even with 10x magnification the morphology of microorganisms and the floc structures were clearly visible after 24 h with a pronounced degree of pha accumulation resolution of pha with respect to biomass pixel areas was dependent on the magnification fig 1 a lower magnification provides a greater observation area with greater depth of field but pha granules and individual cells were not well resolved with increasing magnification from 0 26 μ m pixel to 0 09 μ m pixel resolution boundaries between cells and even between the intracellular pha granules became increasingly more discernible for example considering filamentous microorganisms fig 1 the area occupied by pha is smaller than biomass area defined by protein staining it was observed that with lower magnification interpreted extracellular polymeric substances surrounding flocs diffuse the signal by scattering signal from pha this reduced image quality and resulted in harder to determine area boundaries the potential for an influence from magnification on the quantitative image analysis was considered fig 2 at low biomass pha content even if average values may suggest a drift of underestimation one way anova results on the logit scale suggested no significant difference of the means 95 ci for the pha rich biomass after 24 h accumulation the average volume ratio of pha to non pha biomass protein on the logit scale suggests a trend of a significant overestimation at lower magnification df 2 residue 26 f 27 48 p 001 such bias may be due to pixel areas over representing the underlying pha granule area with the decreased resolution the normality of the pha to non pha biomass volume ratio of 24 h samples obtained with different magnifications was tested using pearson s chi square test the ratios obtained when using 63x objective p 67 showed a better normality compared to 10x p 07 and 20x p 02 objectives were used therefore considering the resolution and the outcomes for a normal distribution of the obtained results 63x magnification was selected in subsequent development for a quantitative analysis a disadvantage of using higher magnification for the image acquisition and quantitative analysis was that each field of view captures a smaller absolute area due to an observed heterogeneity in floc to floc pha granule distribution sufficient fields of view were required towards obtaining a representative average value pei et al 2022 monte carlo simulation was performed for random selection of the pooled replicate data for 63x magnification and 24 h accumulation fig 3 results of monte carlo simulation fig 3 a suggested an increasing number of fields of view estimated pha to non pha biomass ratios distributed in smaller ranges fig 3 b shows the standard deviation of the simulated results given in fig 3 a when using different numbers of fields of view the standard deviation indicated that increasing the acquired number of fields of view resulted in progressive reduction in the uncertainty of an estimated volume ratio of pha to non pha biomass protein the trend suggests that for 63x magnification at least 10 fields of view were required for reaching a low and steady standard deviation when the numbers of fields of views increased from 3 to 10 the standard deviation decreased from 0 15 to 0 06 when the numbers of fields of view further increased from 10 to 20 the standard deviation decreased from 0 06 to 0 05 considering the trade off between the workload the benefits and the necessary redundancy 11 fields of view were implemented in the following sections for a robust estimate of the average v v distribution in the biomass 3 2 pha accumulation processes performance to assess if the staining method could follow the development of the pha accumulation process quantitatively 4 replicate 48 h pha accumulation experiments were conducted and evaluated as shown in fig 4 the trends of tga measured biomass pha content exhibited the robust performance with minor differences in accumulation extent even for these different batches of full scale waste activated sludge collected on different days over 5 weeks the trend in biomass pha content development in time could be described according to eq 1 with a 0 a 1 and τ equal to 0 02 gpha gvss 0 48 gpha gvss and 9 1 h with the standard errors of 0 009 0 010 and 0 720 respectively on average with pooled data from this development it was estimated that the biomass pha content became essentially constant by 27 h 3 τ an average estimated biomass pha content in replicate accumulations after 27 h was 0 49 0 03 gpha gvss the average maximum biomass pha content was similar to what has been previously reported for this particular activated sludge bengtsson et al 2017 the average observed yield on substrate from the 4 accumulation experiments was also similar and equal to 0 27 0 03 gpha gacetate cod basis 3 3 quantitative image analysis samples were taken during all accumulation experiments fixed and stained according to developed methods pei et al 2022 the images were at 63x magnification assessed by cslm with 11 random fields of view per well the average of these 11 images was taken to represent average pha to non pha biomass volume ratio floc to floc pha distribution was found to be heterogeneous and variable the correlation between the pha to non pha biomass volume ratio and mass ratio was assessed by pearson correlation test the pearson correlation test showed that the ratio of pha to non pha biomass volume represented by protein area cor 0 90 df 46 p 0 001 and dna area cor 0 81 df 45 p 0 001 gave correspondence with pha to non pha biomass mass ratio figs 5 and 6 the slope of the correlations is expected to be related to both measurement related factors as well as a density ratio conversion factor from v v to w w measurements different fluorophores have different characteristic imaging properties such as quantum yields the outcome is that the more intense a signal the higher the probability that the fluorescence signal will diffuse and illuminate other surrounding z stack layers of the floc structures by clsm thin slices of the specimen are analyzed with 1 array unit setting for the clsm the integrated slice thickness depends directly also on the applied laser wavelength thus as estimated in the appendix the depth resolution decrease is in order of dapi 258 nm bodipy 296 nm sypro red 355 nm and cy5 388 nm measurement related factors may impose a systematic bias on the correlation and they can also contribute to amplification of the observed variability depending on floc to floc differences in compactness another factor that can affect the slope of the correlations is density differences between the pha and non pha biomass these differences generate a correction factor between the expressed mass ratio by tga and the bio volume ratios the density of dried phb powder is expected to be 1 25g cm3 and non pha biomass had a density of around 1 01g cm3 andreadakis 1993 peeters and reynaers 1994 however the amorphous pha and the nature of the pha rich biomass structures when hydrated is expected to influence density significantly neglecting the above mentioned laser dependent effects volume ratio of pha to non pha biomass protein correlation coefficient suggests that the pha granules would be about half the density of the non pha biomass fig 5 the suggested density difference would infer that for the downstream processing the pha rich fraction of the biomass could be separated selectively by for example gradient centrifugation more importantly it suggested that the pha could be harvested from the lighter fraction which agreed with oshiki et al 2010 where more pha was recovered from the light fraction using buoyant density separation dna staining and protein staining showed significant but also different correlation constants in the v v to w w relationship the pha to non pha biomass ratio was considered to be more closely reflected by pha area and protein area because cell protein is more abundant and is distributed more widely interestingly development of intracellular pha granules could be observed to take space in the cell cytoplasm and displace dna pei et al 2022 this effect was considered to be important especially when observing thicker floc structures in these cases pha and dna features were not well captured within the same focal plane affecting the representation the respective stained areas however overall both the dna and protein staining methods were capable of following the relative importance of v v pha accumulation in the biomass 3 4 degree of enrichment for pha storing microorganism both pha to non pha biomass mass and volume ratios increased over time during the pha accumulation process at the later stage of the accumulation stained pha almost occupied the whole cell area to almost completely overlap with the biomass signal pei et al 2022 therefore the volume ratio of pha to non pha biomass at later stage was used to approximate the degree of enrichment for the pha storing biomass fraction since the mass of pha approached its extant maximum after 27 h accumulation fig 4 results of v v were pooled for an improved estimate of the degree of enrichment for pha storing microorganisms in the activated sludge the degree of enrichment for pha storing microorganisms was estimated based on the applied staining pair bodipy with sypro red or bodipy with dapi the degree of enrichment estimated based on protein and dna after 27 h was found to be described by a normal distribution on the logit scale fig 7 the average degree of enrichment logit scale statistics estimated based on protein for waste activated sludge from bath wwtp was 55 the range from the back transformed logit based standard deviation was between 47 to 62 v v the interpreted degree of enrichment for pha storing microorganisms of waste activated sludge from bath wwtp indicates that only 55 of the biomass was accumulating pha this level is a significantly lower degree of enrichment compared to results reported for enrichment accumulation where the degree of enrichment was indicated up to almost 100 crognale et al 2019 therefore waste activated sludge would perform better with direct accumulation if more of the organisms would accumulate pha it has been suggested that possibilities to produce a better functional biomass in municipal activated sludge readily exist by methods to improve the stringency of disposing the biomass to periodic feast environments during the wwtp process morgan sagastume et al 2014 improvements in selection pressure without need for major process upgrades are expected to bring significant improvements in degree of enrichment without impacting on the core contaminants removal function of a wwtp for example it has been shown at pilot scale how more stringent anoxic feast pre denitrification for a bnr process increased biomass pha content from 0 15 gpha gvss to 0 49 gpha gvss bengsston et al 2017 however in this past work a distinction was not made between feast pressures to induce microbial community changes for pha storing microorganism enrichment versus performance of the pha storing microorganisms in the biomass the methods of the present investigation enable to evaluate enrichment distinct from accumulation potential the observed heterogeneous nature of distribution of pha in the sludge flocs is also informative towards development of efficient process strategies to recover the polymers this work found that 45 of the biomass was void of polymer research efforts have been applied previously to upgrade a pha rich biomass based on density differences selective protein digestion or mild non specific oxidative treatment of the floc structures may also be expected to be effective pre treatment if the non pha biomass fractions are more selectively influenced at the same time stress imposed on the biomass is known to promote polymer degradation this risk for losses must be considered at the same time obruca et al 2018 the advantage of selective staining methods is that such pre treated biomass may also be evaluated towards a qualitative or quantitative impression of the morphological influence as a function of pre treatment severity 3 5 the pha storing fraction the estimated average pha content in pha accumulating fraction was defined as follows 7 biomass pha content biomass pha content de non pha biomass where biomass pha content after 3 τ is used and de is the degree of enrichment defined by eq 2 in the present study average biomass pha content for the pha storing fraction in the activated sludge was equal to 0 64 0 04 gpha gvss the estimated average pha accumulation capacity for the pha storing fraction in these direct accumulation experiments was higher than the pha accumulation capacity found for enrichment accumulation reported by valentino et al 2019 however the average pha accumulation capacity for the pha storing fraction found in these direct accumulations was still lower than the more functionalized enrichment accumulation methods that select for plasticicumulans acidivorans johnson et al 2009 therefore the pha accumulation capacity for the selected pha storing bacteria also influences the pha accumulation potential these differences of the pha accumulation capacity in both enrichment and direct accumulation suggested that selection of pha storing microorganisms does not necessarily mean the selection of the accumulators with high pha accumulation potential therefore the function of the selection needs to be further understood and clarified without ambiguity with respect to effects of both degree of enrichment and pha accumulation capacity for the pha storing fraction in the biomass selection and resultant phenotype potential is one aspect of expressing a high biomass pha content in a microbial community physiological state has also been reported to be of influence to the expressed biomass pha content for given microorganisms or microbial communities morgan sagastume et al 2017 obruca et al 2017 a given feast famine regime or feed on demand strategy may be applied which induces optimum response for pha accumulation often there are small differences in operational conditions that are not considered explicitly in reported comparisons of results these differences may include biomass history in the wwtp before the accumulation process specific details also include the substrate supply during the accumulation process background substrate levels during the accumulation process the sizes or concentration of the pulses and acclimation insights from evaluations based only on the end point biomass pha content are limited without reference to degree of enrichment therefore it is important to incorporate the methods like selective staining to elucidate deepened understanding of operational conditions on the maximum biomass pha content 3 6 quantification of the dynamics of microbial activity expressed by 16s rrna dynamics of microbial activity were assessed by fish targeting at 16s rrna incorporated with pha staining and non pha biomass counter staining the area ratio between rna and dna was used to represent the viable bacteria fraction eq 3 in the direct accumulation process the viable bacteria fraction identified from individual fields of view at 63x magnification showed significant differences during the accumulation process df 12 residue 568 f 12 04 p 001 this significant difference suggested that within the biomass the microbial activity is distributed heterogeneously among flocs the average activity for the biomass was calculated by making an average of the rna to dna ratio for 11 fields of view from one well with 63x magnification this average activity for the biomass did not follow a measurable trend during the whole accumulation process df 12 residue 34 f 1 503 p 0 171 the interpreted average microbial activity levels for the biomass were stable without correlation to time within the precision of these evaluations a specific activity level influence of acclimation before accumulation was also not found to increase the resolution of the methods it is necessary to identify pha accumulation activity level at the cellular level this level of identification would require techniques such as applying qpcr to the expressed phac gene fish targeting at mrna of phac or boncat fish targeting at expressed pha polymerise proteins the staining tools in combination with fish could be applied to follow the dynamic nature of the biomass and discriminate between active pha accumulating active non pha accumulating and non active organic fractions of the activated sludge in the waste activated sludge collected from bath wwtp based on the replicate experiments of distinct batches the activated sludge was fractionated the average viable biomass fraction during the whole accumulation process evaluated on the logit scale was 70 with a range from the back transformed logit standard deviation of 52 to 83 rna dna the area ratio between pha and rna was used to represent the pha accumulating fraction of the viable biomass eq 4 it was found that 68 pha rna of the active biomass was accumulating pha combining the size of active biomass fraction and its pha accumulating fraction it was estimated that 48 of non pha biomass based on dna staining was actively accumulating pha therefore as shown in fig 8 the non pha biomass for activated sludge from bath wwtp could be fractionated into 48 of active pha accumulating fraction 22 of active non pha accumulating fraction and 30 non active organic fraction the active non pha storing fraction dilutes not only the biomass pha content but also consumes substrates and oxygen this active flanking population could contribute to lowering pha yield and overall process performance productivity 4 conclusions quantitative image analysis methods for evaluating pha storing microbial communities have been developed they allow for the estimation of the pha storing bacteria fraction and the average pha content of the pha storing bacteria the waste activated sludge used in these direct accumulation experiments expressed a degree of enrichment of 55 47 62 the pha in the activated sludge was diluted by flanking biomass the estimated average biomass pha content for the pha storing biomass fraction was 0 64 0 04 gpha gvss enrichment accumulation approach has higher degree of enrichment but is not necessarily enriching bacteria that express a higher pha accumulation capacity compared to direct accumulation selection has two components to improve the degree of enrichment and to promote conditions to select pha storing bacteria with a higher pha accumulation capacity microbial activities in the total biomass were relatively constant during the accumulation process and 68 of active bacteria were estimated to be accumulating pha this outcome confirmed the existence of viable flanking microbial population which may consume added substrate and

15768,polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation experiments at pilot scale were performed with fullscale municipal waste activated sludge development of biomass pha content was quantified by thermogravimetric analysis over 48 h the biomass reached up to 0 49 0 03 gpha gvss n 4 samples were processed in parallel to characterise the distribution of pha in the biomass selective staining methods and image analysis were performed by confocal laser scanning microscopy the image analysis indicated that nominally 55 of this waste activated sludge was engaged in pha storage activity thus even if the biomass pha content reached 0 49gpha gvss the accumulating fraction of the biomass was estimated to have attained about 0 64gpha gvss the combination of quantitative microscopy and polymer mass assessment enabled to distinguish the effect of level of enrichment in pha storing bacteria and the average pha storage capacity of the accumulating bacteria the distribution of microbial 16s rrna levels did not

made available on request 1 introduction polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are polyesters that can be accumulated as intracellular granules by many types of microorganisms especially under dynamic environmental conditions anderson and dawes 1990 dawes and senior 1973 van loosdrecht et al 1997 typically these dynamic conditions are created by alternating the presence and absence of organic carbon sources and or electron acceptors under dynamic conditions pha accumulation is a competition strategy for microorganisms to thrive majone et al 1999 reis et al 2003 van loosdrecht et al 1997 the accumulated intracellular polymers can be harvested and applied as biobased and biodegradable polyesters phas are functional and suitable in many kinds of applications compared to fossil oil derived polyesters used ubiquitously today laycock et al 2013 pratt et al 2019 microbial community based pha production processes exploit purposefully imposed or inherently present environmental conditions in open microbiological processes that favour the growth and enrichment of pha storing phenotypes estevez alonso et al 2021 kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 kourmentza et al 2017 depending on the source of the pha storing biomass microbial community based pha production methods may be denoted as either enrichment accumulation or direct accumulation approaches enrichment accumulation refers to pha production with a biomass that has been produced purposefully with optimised selection conditions a majority of the selected bacteria in the biomass is expected to produce pha a direct accumulation process uses waste activated sludge produced in municipal and or industrial biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps bengsston et al 2017 morgan sagastume 2016 notwithstanding that the principal function of the process is to treat wastewater selection of pha storing microorganisms will occur due to the inherent dynamic process conditions van loosdrecht et al 1997 the selection could be due to the cyclic day night loading regime in wastewater supply and or a plug flow character in the wastewater treatment process werker et al 2020 the wastewater treatment processes select for a microbial community that has broad functional diversity as a result there will be non pha storing microorganisms in the direct accumulation biomass essential for the treatment of influent contaminants pei et al 2022 pha production is accomplished in a side stream fed batch bioprocess where the supplied pha storing biomass is fed with volatile fatty acid rich substrates to reach the maximum biomass pha content the volatile fatty acid rich substrates can be derived for example from the fermentation of wastewater organic fraction of municipal solid waste or the primary sludge of a wwtp estevez alonso et al 2021 the use of fermented primary sludge also offers the possibility of converting the wwtp into a pha production facility without modifying the main treatment process over the past 10 years different pilot scale studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of microbial community based pha production processes using different feedstocks estevez alonso et al 2021 in the pha production process maximum biomass pha content is a critical performance factor that influences the economic viability of commercial advancements estevez alonso et al 2021 paul et al 2020 valentino et al 2017 consequently in almost all the microbial community based research literature to date maximum achievable biomass pha content has been a key parameter when assessing the performance of the pha production process biomass pha content is typically quantified by the mass of pha accumulated with respect to the total volatile suspended solids vss active biomass is commonly approximated by the vss minus the pha mass in these solids microbial community based approaches have been reported to have a maximum biomass pha content between 30 and 90 gpha gvss estevez alonso et al 2021 implicitly it is often assumed that improvement in pha production is reflected by improvement in selection and mitigating flanking populations during accumulation tamis et al 2014 observed different biomass pha content for microbial community based approaches may be attributed to two main factors one factor is the fraction of pha storing bacteria in the biomass defined as a degree of enrichment the other factor is the pha accumulation capacity of the active pha storing bacteria the current methods for measurement of biomass pha content do not provide insight to distinguish between these two factors to assess the individual cellular pha distribution flow cytometry or raman spectroscopy may be applied in pure cultures nile red or bodipy staining has been employed with flow cytometry to quantify the pha content and to study the pha content in single cells kacmar et al 2006 saranya et al 2012 vidal mas et al 2001 similarly methods have been explored based on floc disruption and statistics of cell to cell pha content by means of raman spectroscopy of the dispersed microbial biomass majed et al 2009 in microbial community based pha research these methods are less applicable due to problems of dispersion of the biomass in single cells and the variation of cellular morphologies in microbial communities moreover destruction of the floc structure obscures to obtain information from the distribution of the pha granules and pha storing bacteria in the communities the aim of the present work is to develop the selective staining methods for a quantitative estimation of the municipal activated sludge degree of enrichment and consequently the average pha accumulation capacity of the pha storing fraction of that biomass in the present work the pha rich biomass was produced with a municipal activated sludge using the direct accumulation approach at pilot scale the progress of polymer accumulation was monitored over time with grab samples for biomass pha content recently developed selective staining for visualisation on parallel samples was also applied pei et al 2022 obtained confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm images were analysed to quantify the pha distribution 2 material and methods 2 1 pha accumulation methods and sampling a well mixed 200 l jacketed stainless steel reactor with 167 l working volume for pha accumulation was

temperature 25 c in the active working volume aeration and mixing were up to 12 h until steady state dissolved oxygen levels indicated a steady biomass endogenous respiration level this pre aeration was followed by acclimation applied as a sequence of three feast famine cycles morgan sagastume et al 2017 at the beginning of the feast period a pulse of substrate that targeted a reactor acetic acid concentration of 100 mgcod l was given for each feast famine cycle the length of the feast and famine period was approximately 20 and 60 min respectively after the third famine phase pulse wise feed on demand pha accumulation was performed over 48 h with constant mixing and aeration pei et al 2022 substrate doses in pulse wise inputs targeted a maximum reactor acetic acid concentration of 100 mgcod l at selected time points 4 x 50 ml representative mixed liquor grab samples were taken duplicate sub samples of 5 ml were fixed with formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3 7 sigma aldrich netherlands preserved in 10 ml 1x phosphate buffered saline panreac applichem itw reagents spain with 10 ml pure ethanol vwr the netherlands and stored at 5 c before performing the staining afterwards the remaining fixed sample was stored at 20 c for long term preservation 2 2 analytical methods mixed liquor sample volumes were measured v mixed liquor suspended solids were separated by centrifugation 3248rcf and 4 c for 20 m and the supernatant was removed the pellet mass was transferred with milli q water merck germany by rinsing into a clean pre dried 105 c and tare weighed crucible the pellet mass m1 representing total suspended solids tss was estimated from the dried weight 105 c over 12 h afterwards pellet fixed solids m2 were determined by ashing at 550 c for 2 h the mixed liquor vss concentration was estimated as m 1 m 2 v biomass pha content was determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga according to chan et al 2017 with minor modification the mixed liquor

decanting supernatent about 5 mg of powder samples were disposed to thermal decomposition tga 2 meller toledor switherlands in 3 principal steps as follows 1 isothermal nitrogen gas atmosphere drying at 105 c for 10 min 2 heating with nitrogen gas atmosphere at 10 min to 550 c 3 isothermal ashing in air atmosphere at 550 c for 30 min the biomass pha content as gpha gvss was derived from the background corrected characteristic polymer decomposition peak detectable from the derivative thermogravimetric trend as described in chan et al 2017 using in house matlab data processing algorithms mathworks ma usa non pha biomass was estimated as vss minus pha mass subsequently the mass ratio of pha and non pha biomass was calculated 2 3 biomass staining and microscopy image analysis for the samples fixed with formaldehyde intracellular pha granules and protein staining was performed using bodipy 493 503 bodipy thermo fisher scientific ma usa in combination with sypro red thermo fisher scientific ma usa as described in pei et al 2022 glass slides with 10 reaction wells paul marienfeld gmbh co kg germany were used in each reaction well 5 µl fixed sample was loaded with 0 5 µl bodipy at 2 ng µl and 0 5 µl of 100 times diluted sypro red the loaded slides were incubated at 46 c until dried the dried slide was washed with milli q water to remove any excess dye and then dried again with compressed air each prepared slide was mounted with vectashield hardset antifade mounting medium h 1400 10 vectashield vector laboratories ca usa and sealed for the same series of the fixed samples fluorescence in situ hybridization fish using the bacterial probe eub338 i 5 gct gcc tcc cgt agg agt3 labelled with cy5 was combined with pha staining via bodipy and dna staining with dapi the staining was performed according to llobet brossa et al 1998 with modifications as described in pei et al 2022 a 0 5 µl aliquot fixed sample was heat fixed in a slide well then dehydrated with ethanol hybridization buffer 10 µl with 35 formamide was added followed by 0 5 µl of eub 338i bodipy and dapi at respectively 50 ng µl 2 ng µl and 250 ng µl the hybridization was performed at 46 c for 1 5 h followed by washing using buffer pre heated to 48 c for 15 m and cold milli q water the washed slide was dried with compressed air then mounted and sealed with vectashield the confocal laser scanning microscope lsm 880 carl zeiss germany was used with plan apochromat 10x 0 45 m27 20x 0 8 m27 and 63x 1 4 oil dic objectives carl zeiss germany from each sample well with 63x objective a sequence of 11 randomly selected images with floc containing fields of view were acquired digital resolution 1584 by 1584 pixel for the images with 2 dyes and 1912 pixel by 1912 pixel for the images with 3 dyes after initially surveying the well for sample quality dyes were excited and dye specific captured images averaged from 16 scans were saved to separate file channels at 16 bit depth to excite dapi bodipy sypro red and cy5 a diode 405 30 laser at 405 nm an argon laser at 488 nm a dpss 561 10 laser at 561 nm and a hene633 laser at 633 nm were used respectively the same laser power and gain were used for each dye in each respective set of 11 images taken and imaging conditions were otherwise kept similar from well to well fiji image j imagej2 ver 1 52p was used for processing the captured images brightness levels were maximized without overexposing pixel data then for each dye specific channel with each respective well series of 11 images a cut off threshold intensity level was established by visual inspection total pixel areas of bodipy sypro red rna fish and dapi were measured representing areas bio volume of pha proteins 16s rrna and dna 2 4 data analysis and interpretation the trends in progress of biomass pha content gpha gvss over time were estimated by least squares regression analysis according to bengsston et al 2017 1 biomass pha content a 0 a 1 1 e t τ where a 0 and a 1 are constants that enable the estimation of rates as a function of time the accumulation time constant τ h represented process first order kinetics in reaching a maximum level of pha content from microscopy and image analysis a characteristic relative area ratio for pha to non pha biomass ratio v v was calculated 2 pha to non pha biomass ratio v v pha area non pha biomass area where the overlay of pha pixel area distribution on flocs were evaluated from the bodipy signal the non pha biomass area could be assessed from protein or dna related fluorescent signals namely protein area and dna area relative signal pixel distributions in overlay areas defined by the individual biomass flocs were used to give an index representing the fraction of the viable microorganisms as 3 viable microorganism fraction rna area dna area similarly an index representing a measure for the pha storing microorganism fraction within the expressed viable areas for flocs within each captured field of view was characterized as 4 viable pha storing microorganism fraction pha area rna area in order to impose a normal distribution for statistical analysis the obtained v v ratios were transformed to a logit scale warton and hui 2011 5 x l n x 1 x where x is the v v ratios of pha to non pha biomass viable microorganism fraction and viable pha storing microorganism fraction obtained by eqs 2 4 and x is the respective transformed v v ratios the statistical analysis including one way anova pearson s chi square normality test quantile quantile plot and linear regression were performed in the logit scale the averages and the standard deviations for the ratios eqs 2 4 were calculated with the logit transformed results x final results are reported with values transformed back to the scale of proportions 0 1 6 x 10 x 10 x 1 where x is the average v v ratios of pha to non pha biomass viable microorganism fraction and viable pha storing microorganism fraction in the logit scale 3 results and discussion the potential for quantitative image analysis was evaluated from replicated accumulation experiments for the reproducibility and selection of image magnification the pha accumulation process performance was assessed by the biomass pha content development eq 1 from the optimal magnification correlation between volume and mass ratios of pha to non pha biomass was established the degree of enrichment of pha storing bacteria for activated sludge from bath wwtp was estimated subsequently from the estimated biomass pha content and the degree of enrichment the average biomass pha content for the pha storing fraction in the activated sludge was calculated combined staining of pha fish and dna was applied to monitor the trend of microbial activity during the pha accumulation process 3 1 quantification of pha distribution previously methods of selective staining were developed and applied to visualise the pha storage process pei et al 2022 efforts to extend methods for quantitative image analysis started with the assessment of reproducibility alongside considerations for optimal image magnification for the cslm system available objectives with 10 20 and 63x magnification using optimum settings with 2 image channels represented image pixel dimensions of 0 26 0 15 and 0 09 μ m pixel respectively replicate slides n 3 were prepared with 4 replicate wells per slide on biomass samples with negligible polymer content 0 h accumulation and with significant polymer content 24 h accumulation for each well 4 to 11 fields of view were acquired at the three available magnifications fig 1 less images were acquired with 10x magnification compared to 63x where 11 images were taken due to floc concentration and differences in coverage this dataset was used to evaluate quantitative reproducibility the pixel area of pha is expected to be proportional to an integrated volume of pha defined by the magnification dependent pixel area and cslm focal depth similarly the volume of non pha biomass is expected to be proportional to the protein area or dna area identified with sypro red or dapi respectively these volumes relate to mass by respective densities of the biomass and pha granules if the densities remain constant during the accumulation process then the pha to non pha biomass volume to volume ratio v v from image analysis should correspond directly with the pha to non pha biomass mass to mass ratio m m provided by tga analysis however the mass ratio can range from 0 to infinity while the volume ratio derived from overlapping respective pixel areas from image analysis is constrained to range from 0 to 1 this constrained range also affects the normality of the obtained results warton and hui 2011 to make the correlation between the volume ratio and the mass ratio a logit transformation eq 5 was applied to the data of image analysis to account for the inherently bounded scale after the logit transformation the reproducibility of the volume ratio between the area of pha and non pha biomass represented by the area of protein stain was assessed for initial samples 0 h or samples after accumulation 24 h one way anova of the averaged pha and non pha biomass protein volume ratio per reaction well indicated no significant difference 95 ci for analysis of replicate wells n 4 on the same slide similarly no significant difference 95 ci was found among the reaction wells among three replicate slides this outcome suggested that one well with a representative sample could describe the average state of the biomass during an accumulation if sufficient fields of view are acquired per well consistent outcomes between replicate slides supported potential for the quantitative reproducibility of the methods of staining and image analysis influences of magnification on the observation of pha rich biomass were first assessed qualitatively details of interest including individual bacterial cells and pha granules were anticipated to be in the order of 1 μ m and 0 5 μ m respectively as shown in fig 1 the applied magnification for analysis did not strongly influence outcomes of image analysis at the beginning of an accumulation because biomass pha content is low at start even with 10x magnification the morphology of microorganisms and the floc structures were clearly visible after 24 h with a pronounced degree of pha accumulation resolution of pha with respect to biomass pixel areas was dependent on the magnification fig 1 a lower magnification provides a greater observation area with greater depth of field but pha granules and individual cells were not well resolved with increasing magnification from 0 26 μ m pixel to 0 09 μ m pixel resolution boundaries between cells and even between the intracellular pha granules became increasingly more discernible for example considering filamentous microorganisms fig 1 the area occupied by pha is smaller than biomass area defined by protein staining it was observed that with lower magnification interpreted extracellular polymeric substances surrounding flocs diffuse the signal by scattering signal from pha this reduced image quality and resulted in harder to determine area boundaries the potential for an influence from magnification on the quantitative image analysis was considered fig 2 at low biomass pha content even if average values may suggest a drift of underestimation one way anova results on the logit scale suggested no significant difference of the means 95 ci for the pha rich biomass after 24 h accumulation the average volume ratio of pha to non pha biomass protein on the logit scale suggests a trend of a significant overestimation at lower magnification df 2 residue 26 f 27 48 p 001 such bias may be due to pixel areas over representing the underlying pha granule area with the decreased resolution the normality of the pha to non pha biomass volume ratio of 24 h samples obtained with different magnifications was tested using pearson s chi square test the ratios obtained when using 63x objective p 67 showed a better normality compared to 10x p 07 and 20x p 02 objectives were used therefore considering the resolution and the outcomes for a normal distribution of the obtained results 63x magnification was selected in subsequent development for a quantitative analysis a disadvantage of using higher magnification for the image acquisition and quantitative analysis was that each field of view captures a smaller absolute area due to an observed heterogeneity in floc to floc pha granule distribution sufficient fields of view were required towards obtaining a representative average value pei et al 2022 monte carlo simulation was performed for random selection of the pooled replicate data for 63x magnification and 24 h accumulation fig 3 results of monte carlo simulation fig 3 a suggested an increasing number of fields of view estimated pha to non pha biomass ratios distributed in smaller ranges fig 3 b shows the standard deviation of the simulated results given in fig 3 a when using different numbers of fields of view the standard deviation indicated that increasing the acquired number of fields of view resulted in progressive reduction in the uncertainty of an estimated volume ratio of pha to non pha biomass protein the trend suggests that for 63x magnification at least 10 fields of view were required for reaching a low and steady standard deviation when the numbers of fields of views increased from 3 to 10 the standard deviation decreased from 0 15 to 0 06 when the numbers of fields of view further increased from 10 to 20 the standard deviation decreased from 0 06 to 0 05 considering the trade off between the workload the benefits and the necessary redundancy 11 fields of view were implemented in the following sections for a robust estimate of the average v v distribution in the biomass 3 2 pha accumulation processes performance to assess if the staining method could follow the development of the pha accumulation process quantitatively 4 replicate 48 h pha accumulation experiments were conducted and evaluated as shown in fig 4 the trends of tga measured biomass pha content exhibited the robust performance with minor differences in accumulation extent even for these different batches of full scale waste activated sludge collected on different days over 5 weeks the trend in biomass pha content development in time could be described according to eq 1 with a 0 a 1 and τ equal to 0 02 gpha gvss 0 48 gpha gvss and 9 1 h with the standard errors of 0 009 0 010 and 0 720 respectively on average with pooled data from this development it was estimated that the biomass pha content became essentially constant by 27 h 3 τ an average estimated biomass pha content in replicate accumulations after 27 h was 0 49 0 03 gpha gvss the average maximum biomass pha content was similar to what has been previously reported for this particular activated sludge bengtsson et al 2017 the average observed yield on substrate from the 4 accumulation experiments was also similar and equal to 0 27 0 03 gpha gacetate cod basis 3 3 quantitative image analysis samples were taken during all accumulation experiments fixed and stained according to developed methods pei et al 2022 the images were at 63x magnification assessed by cslm with 11 random fields of view per well the average of these 11 images was taken to represent average pha to non pha biomass volume ratio floc to floc pha distribution was found to be heterogeneous and variable the correlation between the pha to non pha biomass volume ratio and mass ratio was assessed by pearson correlation test the pearson correlation test showed that the ratio of pha to non pha biomass volume represented by protein area cor 0 90 df 46 p 0 001 and dna area cor 0 81 df 45 p 0 001 gave correspondence with pha to non pha biomass mass ratio figs 5 and 6 the slope of the correlations is expected to be related to both measurement related factors as well as a density ratio conversion factor from v v to w w measurements different fluorophores have different characteristic imaging properties such as quantum yields the outcome is that the more intense a signal the higher the probability that the fluorescence signal will diffuse and illuminate other surrounding z stack layers of the floc structures by clsm thin slices of the specimen are analyzed with 1 array unit setting for the clsm the integrated slice thickness depends directly also on the applied laser wavelength thus as estimated in the appendix the depth resolution decrease is in order of dapi 258 nm bodipy 296 nm sypro red 355 nm and cy5 388 nm measurement related factors may impose a systematic bias on the correlation and they can also contribute to amplification of the observed variability depending on floc to floc differences in compactness another factor that can affect the slope of the correlations is density differences between the pha and non pha biomass these differences generate a correction factor between the expressed mass ratio by tga and the bio volume ratios the density of dried phb powder is expected to be 1 25g cm3 and non pha biomass had a density of around 1 01g cm3 andreadakis 1993 peeters and reynaers 1994 however the amorphous pha and the nature of the pha rich biomass structures when hydrated is expected to influence density significantly neglecting the above mentioned laser dependent effects volume ratio of pha to non pha biomass protein correlation coefficient suggests that the pha granules would be about half the density of the non pha biomass fig 5 the suggested density difference would infer that for the downstream processing the pha rich fraction of the biomass could be separated selectively by for example gradient centrifugation more importantly it suggested that the pha could be harvested from the lighter fraction which agreed with oshiki et al 2010 where more pha was recovered from the light fraction using buoyant density separation dna staining and protein staining showed significant but also different correlation constants in the v v to w w relationship the pha to non pha biomass ratio was considered to be more closely reflected by pha area and protein area because cell protein is more abundant and is distributed more widely interestingly development of intracellular pha granules could be observed to take space in the cell cytoplasm and displace dna pei et al 2022 this effect was considered to be important especially when observing thicker floc structures in these cases pha and dna features were not well captured within the same focal plane affecting the representation the respective stained areas however overall both the dna and protein staining methods were capable of following the relative importance of v v pha accumulation in the biomass 3 4 degree of enrichment for pha storing microorganism both pha to non pha biomass mass and volume ratios increased over time during the pha accumulation process at the later stage of the accumulation stained pha almost occupied the whole cell area to almost completely overlap with the biomass signal pei et al 2022 therefore the volume ratio of pha to non pha biomass at later stage was used to approximate the degree of enrichment for the pha storing biomass fraction since the mass of pha approached its extant maximum after 27 h accumulation fig 4 results of v v were pooled for an improved estimate of the degree of enrichment for pha storing microorganisms in the activated sludge the degree of enrichment for pha storing microorganisms was estimated based on the applied staining pair bodipy with sypro red or bodipy with dapi the degree of enrichment estimated based on protein and dna after 27 h was found to be described by a normal distribution on the logit scale fig 7 the average degree of enrichment logit scale statistics estimated based on protein for waste activated sludge from bath wwtp was 55 the range from the back transformed logit based standard deviation was between 47 to 62 v v the interpreted degree of enrichment for pha storing microorganisms of waste activated sludge from bath wwtp indicates that only 55 of the biomass was accumulating pha this level is a significantly lower degree of enrichment compared to results reported for enrichment accumulation where the degree of enrichment was indicated up to almost 100 crognale et al 2019 therefore waste activated sludge would perform better with direct accumulation if more of the organisms would accumulate pha it has been suggested that possibilities to produce a better functional biomass in municipal activated sludge readily exist by methods to improve the stringency of disposing the biomass to periodic feast environments during the wwtp process morgan sagastume et al 2014 improvements in selection pressure without need for major process upgrades are expected to bring significant improvements in degree of enrichment without impacting on the core contaminants removal function of a wwtp for example it has been shown at pilot scale how more stringent anoxic feast pre denitrification for a bnr process increased biomass pha content from 0 15 gpha gvss to 0 49 gpha gvss bengsston et al 2017 however in this past work a distinction was not made between feast pressures to induce microbial community changes for pha storing microorganism enrichment versus performance of the pha storing microorganisms in the biomass the methods of the present investigation enable to evaluate enrichment distinct from accumulation potential the observed heterogeneous nature of distribution of pha in the sludge flocs is also informative towards development of efficient process strategies to recover the polymers this work found that 45 of the biomass was void of polymer research efforts have been applied previously to upgrade a pha rich biomass based on density differences selective protein digestion or mild non specific oxidative treatment of the floc structures may also be expected to be effective pre treatment if the non pha biomass fractions are more selectively influenced at the same time stress imposed on the biomass is known to promote polymer degradation this risk for losses must be considered at the same time obruca et al 2018 the advantage of selective staining methods is that such pre treated biomass may also be evaluated towards a qualitative or quantitative impression of the morphological influence as a function of pre treatment severity 3 5 the pha storing fraction the estimated average pha content in pha accumulating fraction was defined as follows 7 biomass pha content biomass pha content de non pha biomass where biomass pha content after 3 τ is used and de is the degree of enrichment defined by eq 2 in the present study average biomass pha content for the pha storing fraction in the activated sludge was equal to 0 64 0 04 gpha gvss the estimated average pha accumulation capacity for the pha storing fraction in these direct accumulation experiments was higher than the pha accumulation capacity found for enrichment accumulation reported by valentino et al 2019 however the average pha accumulation capacity for the pha storing fraction found in these direct accumulations was still lower than the more functionalized enrichment accumulation methods that select for plasticicumulans acidivorans johnson et al 2009 therefore the pha accumulation capacity for the selected pha storing bacteria also influences the pha accumulation potential these differences of the pha accumulation capacity in both enrichment and direct accumulation suggested that selection of pha storing microorganisms does not necessarily mean the selection of the accumulators with high pha accumulation potential therefore the function of the selection needs to be further understood and clarified without ambiguity with respect to effects of both degree of enrichment and pha accumulation capacity for the pha storing fraction in the biomass selection and resultant phenotype potential is one aspect of expressing a high biomass pha content in a microbial community physiological state has also been reported to be of influence to the expressed biomass pha content for given microorganisms or microbial communities morgan sagastume et al 2017 obruca et al 2017 a given feast famine regime or feed on demand strategy may be applied which induces optimum response for pha accumulation often there are small differences in operational conditions that are not considered explicitly in reported comparisons of results these differences may include biomass history in the wwtp before the accumulation process specific details also include the substrate supply during the accumulation process background substrate levels during the accumulation process the sizes or concentration of the pulses and acclimation insights from evaluations based only on the end point biomass pha content are limited without reference to degree of enrichment therefore it is important to incorporate the methods like selective staining to elucidate deepened understanding of operational conditions on the maximum biomass pha content 3 6 quantification of the dynamics of microbial activity expressed by 16s rrna dynamics of microbial activity were assessed by fish targeting at 16s rrna incorporated with pha staining and non pha biomass counter staining the area ratio between rna and dna was used to represent the viable bacteria fraction eq 3 in the direct accumulation process the viable bacteria fraction identified from individual fields of view at 63x magnification showed significant differences during the accumulation process df 12 residue 568 f 12 04 p 001 this significant difference suggested that within the biomass the microbial activity is distributed heterogeneously among flocs the average activity for the biomass was calculated by making an average of the rna to dna ratio for 11 fields of view from one well with 63x magnification this average activity for the biomass did not follow a measurable trend during the whole accumulation process df 12 residue 34 f 1 503 p 0 171 the interpreted average microbial activity levels for the biomass were stable without correlation to time within the precision of these evaluations a specific activity level influence of acclimation before accumulation was also not found to increase the resolution of the methods it is necessary to identify pha accumulation activity level at the cellular level this level of identification would require techniques such as applying qpcr to the expressed phac gene fish targeting at mrna of phac or boncat fish targeting at expressed pha polymerise proteins the staining tools in combination with fish could be applied to follow the dynamic nature of the biomass and discriminate between active pha accumulating active non pha accumulating and non active organic fractions of the activated sludge in the waste activated sludge collected from bath wwtp based on the replicate experiments of distinct batches the activated sludge was fractionated the average viable biomass fraction during the whole accumulation process evaluated on the logit scale was 70 with a range from the back transformed logit standard deviation of 52 to 83 rna dna the area ratio between pha and rna was used to represent the pha accumulating fraction of the viable biomass eq 4 it was found that 68 pha rna of the active biomass was accumulating pha combining the size of active biomass fraction and its pha accumulating fraction it was estimated that 48 of non pha biomass based on dna staining was actively accumulating pha therefore as shown in fig 8 the non pha biomass for activated sludge from bath wwtp could be fractionated into 48 of active pha accumulating fraction 22 of active non pha accumulating fraction and 30 non active organic fraction the active non pha storing fraction dilutes not only the biomass pha content but also consumes substrates and oxygen this active flanking population could contribute to lowering pha yield and overall process performance productivity 4 conclusions quantitative image analysis methods for evaluating pha storing microbial communities have been developed they allow for the estimation of the pha storing bacteria fraction and the average pha content of the pha storing bacteria the waste activated sludge used in these direct accumulation experiments expressed a degree of enrichment of 55 47 62 the pha in the activated sludge was diluted by flanking biomass the estimated average biomass pha content for the pha storing biomass fraction was 0 64 0 04 gpha gvss enrichment accumulation approach has higher degree of enrichment but is not necessarily enriching bacteria that express a higher pha accumulation capacity compared to direct accumulation selection has two components to improve the degree of enrichment and to promote conditions to select pha storing bacteria with a higher pha accumulation capacity microbial activities in the total biomass were relatively constant during the accumulation process and 68 of active bacteria were estimated to be accumulating pha this outcome confirmed the existence of viable flanking microbial population which may consume added substrate and generate additional oxygen demand in a pha accumulation process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

concentration of microplastics larger than 20 µm in tap water is less than 2 microplastics particles per litre between the different raw water sources it is found that groundwater had by far the lowest microplastics concentrations 1 000 microplastics per m3 and the highest concentration was found in riverine water up to 460 000 particles per m3 specifically in the lek canal a canal connected to the river rhine on average the most abundant plastics found are polyamide pa 33 polyethylene terephthalate pet 15 rubbers 10 polyethylene pe 10 and chlorinated polyethylene cpe 7 this study also showed that natural treatment steps such as dune infiltration and sedimentation remove microplastics effectively however this may introduce an adverse effect where microplastics potentially accumulate

the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in december 2020 the new european drinking water directive was adopted which came into force on january 12th 2021 member states of the european union eu are obliged to implement the provisions of the revised drinking water directive into national laws and regulations article 13 of the new directive refers to a watch list of substances to meet growing concern about the effects of new compounds explicitly including microplastics mp on human health via water intended for human consumption and to address risks from new compounds in the water supply system this means that microplastics must be monitored and risk assessments must be drawn up in short analysis methods and knowledge of current microplastics concentrations are important in order to meet the obligations of this drinking water directive the presence of mp in the environment is well known their presence in the marine environment has been demonstrated burns and boxall 2018 lusher 2015 also numbers of studies regarding microplastics in freshwater are increasing in particular the number of scientific publications on microplastics in surface water and in drinking water has increased exponentially kirstein et al 2021b li et al 2018 novotna et al 2019 novotna et al 2019 and eerkes medrano et al 2019 indicated that mp are frequently found in sources of drinking water but little was known about the presence and fate of mp in drinking water shen et al 2020 made a graphical overview of the sources and transport of microplastics in raw water and treated drinking water both tap water and bottled water according to these authors the main sources of microplastics are agriculture and sewage effluent but eerkes medrano et al 2019 also take atmospheric deposition into account recently microplastics have also been detected in drinking water johnson et al 2020 kirstein et al 2021b mintenig et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 showed that mp were found in 81 of 159 samples of tap water from different countries and 93 of 259 samples of bottled water from 11 different brands the reported values range between few particles to 1000 particles per m3 however numbers mentioned in scientific papers are often difficult to compare sampling pre treatment techniques and different analytical techniques influence the recorded amount of particles and may impose different size ranges hence it is too early to draw a solid conclusion on the amounts of microplastics in fresh and drinking water removal of microplastics in water treatment has only recently been studied removal efficiency varies between 80 and 99 johnson et al 2020 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 techniques such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration and activated carbon filtration can reduce mp concentrations by about 80 pivokonsky et al 2018 according to shen et al 2020 other promising techniques for removing mp from water are electrocoagulation magnetic extraction and membrane filtration especially the latter techniques i e nf nanofiltration and ro reverse osmosis are already used in drinking water treatment but are susceptible to fouling by the mp barchiesi et al 2021 li et al 2020 regarding the human toxicity of mp in drinking water data are still too scarce according to vethaak and legler there is a lack of information on both human exposure to mp and their toxicological effects vethaak and legler 2021 there is however an indication that mp can carry biofilm and antibiotic resistance genes li et al 2020 mughini gras et al 2021 biofilm formation often takes place on mp because they have a rough and relative large surface area and because auxiliary substances diffusing from them can be used as nutrients learbuch et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in the present research we focus on the fate of mp in drinking water production the effect of treatment processes on the removal of mp was studied in five different drinking water production processes dwpp different types of drinking water sources and subsequent treatment stages were investigated surface water from a reservoir dune filtrate groundwater and riverbank filtrate we analysed various water samples from different stages in the dwpp chain thus we obtained not only insight in the removal efficiency of current water treatment processes but also in possible unintentional introduction of microplastics during the treatment or distribution processes 2 materials and methods this study utilises the combination of two techniques laser infrared imaging ldir and microscopy to cover most of the possible microplastics between 5000 µm to 20 µm microscopy is used to cover larger particles 50 µm and ldir is used to cover smaller particles from 500 µm to 20 µm 2 1 chemicals laser direct infrared imaging ldir the following chemicals were purchased sodium dodecylsulfonate and koh from merck darmstadt germany 30 solution h2o2 zncl2 and ethanol from boom meppel the netherlands fluorescent green polyethylene microspheres from cospheric santa barbara usa milliq water with 18 mω from veolia ede the netherlands all liquids used including the cleaning liquids were filtered prior to usage over 10 µm stainless steel sieves microscopy the following chemicals were purchased stabilized hydrogen peroxide 30 solution from merck darmstadt germany demineralised water was produced in house liquid chemicals were filtered over 30 µm stainless steel mesh filters before usage 2 2 research locations reservoir dwpp a water from the river meuse is used as a source after intake water subsequently passes three different reservoirs in the biesbosch area de gijster honderd dertig and petrusplaat the total residence time of the meuse water in the three biesbosch reservoirs is around 5 months in addition for part of the year including the summer artificial aeration is used to promote mixing of the water in the reservoirs post reservoir the water is treated with coagulation flocculation sedimentation and double layer filtration dlf and finally filtration over activated carbon acf samples were taken at four different stages of the water treatment incoming water from the river meuse outgoing water after storage in the reservoir lake petrusplaat after dlf and after acf sampling occurred on three different dates with a gap of two weeks at each sampling location for each sampling event two consecutive samples were taken one sample was processed for ldir analysis and one for microscopic analysis see sampling methods dune filtration dwpp b surface water from the dutch lek canal is used as a source after pre treatment coagulation flocculation sedimentation and rapid sand filtration rf the water is infiltrated in dunes after dune filtration water is further purified to drinking water four samples were taken surface water pre treated surface water dune infiltrate drinking water on site samples were only analysed using the ldir method riverbank filtrate 1 dwpp c in total four samples of intake water were taken surface water from dutch river overijsselse vecht ov and three incoming riverbank filtrates these latter three samples were chosen deliberately to see whether there is a difference between the three incoming filtrates samples were only analysed using ldir groundwater dwpp d water from different wells is combined and purified to drinking water four samples were taken groundwater from one well combined water from several wells drinking water on the production site tap water in a private home samples were only analysed using ldir riverbank filtrate 2 dwpp e river bank filtrate is pre treated with aeration and sand filtration four groundwater samples were taken after pre treatment drinking water on site and tap water from two private homes ph1 and ph2 samples were only analysed using ldir details on all locations can be found in table 1 and table s1 2 3 sampling for ldir and microscopy weather conditions no extreme weather conditions were recorded during sampling during sampling outside a building no rain fall was recorded the wind speed never exceeded 13 m s ldir two sampling methods were applied for the ldir analysis a cascade of metal sieves and a metal candle filter cascade the first one was used for samples with an expected high amount of mp the latter for samples with an expected low amount of mp details in si at each sampling event between 1000 and 10 000 l exact amounts are in table s1 of water was filtered through either the cascade of two metal sieves gilson usa of 500 μm and 100 μm with a 10 μm plankton net hydro bios germany at the end or a candle filter cascade 5 10 100 and 500 μm the 500 μm sieve or filter was used to remove large mp and to prevent clogging of the smaller sieves filters residue from that sieve filter was not analysed the other residues were later transferred into separate glass bottles using ultrapure water and stored at 4 c microscopy sampling of microplastics was done with varying volumes depending on the sampling point see table s1 keizersveer 400 2500 litres petrusplaat 550 950 litres after double layer filtration dlf 13 000 litres after activated carbon filtration acf 5000 7000 litres microplastics were separated from the water by filtering through a stainless steel sieve cascade with mesh sizes of 50 µm 125 µm 250 µm 1000 µm and 5000 µm retsch germany at a constant flow rate the smallest sieve 50 µm was removed after 400 600 litres at keizersveer to avoid clogging exact volumes per sieve were noted and used for the subsequent concentration calculations all sieves were wrapped in aluminium foil and transported for analysis microplastics were recovered from the sieves by backflushing with ultrapure water and collection in one glass bottle per sieve microplastic samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c in glass bottles until sample treatment 2 4 sample treatment and quality control ldir potential contamination occurring during sample handling was minimised by cleaning all working surfaces with ethanol rinsing equipment and immediate covering with aluminium foil and wearing a cotton lab coat at all times furthermore solutions of chemicals were filtered 10 µm metal mesh prior to use use of plastic materials during sample handling was minimised e g a metal filter setup with teflon tubing and glassware for sample storage and separation negative controls were treated in parallel with each batch of actual samples to determine the degree of contamination for the positive control a known number of plastic particles green fluorescent pe average diameter 100 µm were added to a water sample the ratio between the particle number before and after work up is the recovery rate these control particles were visually counted under a microscope recoveries ranged typically from ca 65 to 80 microscopy clean up of samples was kept as simple as possible as visual counting is not strongly influenced by background contamination each glass sample bottle containing different size fractions was concentrated separately by using a 30 µm stainless steel mesh filter the residue on the 30 µm mesh was backflushed with 10 ml of prefiltered ultrapure water for each sample five beakers corresponding to five sieve fractions were prepared to each sample 10 ml of 30 h2o2 was added and heated to 75 c under constant stirring the solution was left to settle for at least 24 h after digestion samples were filtered again over 30 µm stainless steel filters and the residue was transferred by prefiltered ultrapure water and separately vacuum filtered the microplastics were transferred to a bacterial cellulose nitrate cn filter on which subsequent particle counting was performed sartorius cellulose nitrate filters sterile pore size 0 45 µm green for storage the cn filters were kept wet and sealed from air under refrigerated conditions until analysis 2 5 analysis procedure microplastic measurements ldir sample preparation to remove unwanted organic and inorganic matter and particle analyses were based on previously described methods leslie et al 2017 löder et al 2015 mintenig et al 2018 mintenig et al 2020 mughini gras et al 2021 particle analysis focused on residues of the 10 μm and 100 μm sieves suspensions from these two fractions were combined and filtered over a 10 µm metal mesh the filter was then transferred into a beaker with a 10 sodium dodecyl sulfonate solution after a day the suspension was filtered over a 10 µm metal mesh the filter was transferred into a beaker with 75 ml 12 5 potassium hydroxide solution and left standing for 5 days at 35 c subsequently the suspension was filtered again through the same 10 µm metal filter the residues were transferred into a beaker with 50 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide solution and left standing for one day at 35 c the sample was filtered again through the same metal filter and the residues were transferred into a separation funnel using a 100 ml zinc chloride solution 1 6 g cm3 the funnels were shaken and left standing to enable settling of denser materials the settled material was discarded by continuously turning the valve of the funnel to prevent clogging re suspension and loss of plastics about 10 ml of liquid was allowed to remain in the funnel these 10 ml were filtered again over a metal filter using 4 ml ethanol the retained materials were removed from the filter and transferred into a glass vial the particles in the 4 ml ethanol are therefore all the particles that could be extracted from the original sample next a vortex was created in this suspension using a vortex mixer to distribute the mp evenly in the ethanol an aliquot 2 50 µl was taken from this liquid and transferred to the microscope slide for analysis from this subsample the actual particle number in the 4 ml ethanol is calculated the subsample is necessary as otherwise too many mp will be transferred onto the slide the sample was analysed using an agilent chemical imaging laser direct infrared ldir mp ranging from 20 500 µm were measured and quantified if not stated otherwise listed particle numbers are always in the size range from 20 500 µm four samples were analysed in parallel in combination with a negative control sample see quality control to calculate the recovery rate microscopy analysis was performed with an olympus stereomicroscope szx10 magnification 6 3 63x assisted by a light source photonische optische geräter led lichtquellef3000 the cn filter was visually scanned for the presence of microplastics metal tweezers were occasionally used to determine the fluidity and tension to assess whether a particle was a plastic particles were classified as mp if they were solid not elastic and able to resist tension force each confirmed microplastic particle was counted and categorized based on morphology no size was recorded at low numbers of microplastics the entire filter was counted if more than 300 particles cm2 filter surface were present at least 10 of the filter surface was counted and the results extrapolated 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 ldir particle number the mp number per sample is corrected for the number of mp in the negative control these numbers are subtracted from the sample furthermore the recovery rate from the positive control is applied to the particle number e g a recovery rate of 90 means that the particle number of the sample is divided by 0 9 limit of detection lod it is defined that a sample contains mp if the particle number is above the 95 confidence interval of the negative controls lod for all sampling sites can be found in the supporting information table s2 limit of quantification loq the particle number is quantified if the particle number in the sample is twice the upper limit of the 95 ci of the negative controls loq for all sampling sites can be found in the supporting information table s2 particle size particle size was determined by the agilent software based on the infrared image of the particle the width and height of the particle were measured the smallest dimension defines the category the particle belongs to chemical characterisation the mp were identified by the agilent software clarity v1 1 microplastic shape and colour determination mp colour cannot be determined by this method the particle shape of the identified mp was determined using the random forest model package breiman and cutler s random forests for classification and regression version 4 6 14 in r breiman et al 2020 the mp were divided into six categories sphere undefined particle rod fibre fibre cluster and artefact example pictures of each class can be found here table s4 about 500 different mp were categorised manually and this data set was used to identify the shapes of the other mp variables defining the category of a mp were diameter aspect ratio area perimeter eccentricity circularity solidity and the maximum ir adsorption artefacts were removed from the sets statistical analysis column statistics were performed using graphpad prism 5 01 anova analysis of variation shapiro wilt test and t tests were performed in r v 1 2 1335 from stats package 3 6 1 for p values a threshold of 0 05 was used 2 6 2 microscopy size classification mp were assigned a size fraction based on the filter these were found on the sieve on which the mp were found defines the size category mp size was not measured for each mp individually e g an mp found on a 50 µm sieve will be binned as an mp of 50 125 µm in size regardless of its actual size this approach was chosen as measuring the size of each mp individually would have been too time consuming particle number the amount of mp per sieve size was counted the cn filter is divided in 144 units in a grid depending on the number of microplastics on the filter it was partially counted at least 15 units or completely counted if the collection filter was counted completely the total amount of plastics was used as is if the collection filter was partially counted results were extrapolated to account for the entire collection to express it as volume based unit the total amount of plastics was corrected for the sampling volume particle colour and shape microplastics were binned based on morphological qualities colour shape and size each individual microplastic particle was assigned a shape category and colour category manually the following shape categories were defined sphere rod miscellaneous and fibre the following colour categories were defined white grey white black blue green yellow red and miscellaneous when mp are mentioned all different shapes are included dataset due to the binning methods applied for size shape and colour each analysis resulted in a combination of 55 parameters consisting of bins size shape and colour combinations per parameter the total number of microplastics corresponding to that classification was reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 choice of analytical techniques this study employs two different analytical techniques microscopy and ldir in parallel on dwpp a and utilizes ldir only on dwpp b through e differences between microscopy and ldir are plentiful but most important are the differences in acquirable range and sensitivity and to a lesser extend the time cost of analysis the differences between microscopy and ldir are covered in extensive detail in a report kools et al 2021 the aim of current study is not to provide a comprehensive comparison between two methods however some discussion on the arguments to use two methods is needed to further place results in context the range of microplastics is from 5000 µm downwards and no single technique can cover the entire range of plastics ldir s upper limit is 500 µm whereas microscopy is limited to microplastic particles sizes 50 µm to 5000 µm however it is also expected that especially smaller plastics are more prevalent and large microplastics i e 1000 µm are comparatively rare and least likely to be relevant to drinking water microscopy is unable to adequately cover the small microplastics but is a relatively inexpensive and simple technique to cover for larger particles as few larger particles 500 µm were found in dwpp a it was decided not to probe water from other plants for the presence of larger particles as ldir will adequately cover the majority of microplastic particles 3 2 measurements sampling locations were along the treatment lines of five different drinking water production plants dwpp anonymised as a e in four cases dwpp a b and c the first stage is intake of raw surface water and the subsequent stages are further steps in the production process for dwpp d the intake groundwater both from one well and from combined wells was analysed in case of dwpp e the source water was not included in the analysis the focus was on the end of the production process a single drinking water production process dwpp a was monitored extensively by two methods three samples per location and at four different stages of water purification the other four other production processes dwpp b e were analysed at four points in a single sampling event and only by ldir 3 2 1 dwpp a river meuse and reservoir stabilisation fig 1 and figure si6 show the total mp and fibre numbers for each sampling location in dwpp a there is a clear difference between the various sampling points in the chain throughout dwpp a the total level of microplastics decreases substantially eventually reaching about 10 000 mp m3 ldir and 50 mp m3 microscope in purified water the highest microplastic concentration was found in the surface water from the meuse at keizersveer the microplastic concentration varies between about 65 000 and 90 000 mp m3 for the ldir analysis variability of 1 4 between the lowest and the highest value and between 200 and 3500 mp m3 for the microscopy variability of 5 9 between the highest and the lowest value in addition the meuse seems to contain the highest fibre concentration of all samples in this study up to 4000 fibres m3 ldir and up to 2500 fibres m3 microscopy the difference in fibre concentration between ldir and microscopy is notably less pronounced than between total microplastic concentration fibres are generally larger mp as compared to particles and therefore have a greater overlap between ldir and microscopy for fibres the differences in the minimal mesh size of the filters applied for the microscopic and ldir method is smaller as the meuse is predominantly a rain fed river large fluctuations in the absolute concentration of microplastics are to be expected such fluctuations were indeed observed in the data larger fluctuations in mp concentration between two sampling events are most pronounced at keizersveer using microscopic analysis in part this can occur due to the sample matrix and clean up as the water may have contained organic sediment and inorganic material sand that disturbed counting as the ldir method had a more extensive sample clean up it was expected that ldir would be less affected by sediment than the microscopic method the variability in the riverine water can also be seen in the data from the other sampling locations however the water in petrusplaat is less or similarly affected by temporal fluctuations due to its purpose as a buffer reservoir the lower and higher particle numbers differ by a factor of 3 9 and 1 7 respectively the other two locations acf and dlf show relative variations between 1 8 and 4 4 for both methods in absolute numbers they are less affected than the two surface water locations it seems necessary that especially for riverine surface waters several measurements over different seasons and hydrological conditions and or time averaged sampling are required to obtain the full dynamics of the mp concentrations in a large riverine system as one sample rich in organic and inorganic material can have a significant impact on the mp concentration fig 2 shows the relative mp number throughout dwpp a compared to intake at keizersveer most mp 80 95 are removed after the residence time in the reservoir this is in accordance with recent literature pivokonsky et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the largest removal of microplastics is observed after basin passage and pre treatment a smaller number of microplastics are removed by double layer filters dlf process in case of ldir analysis the differences between the raw water source keizersveer and the partly treated water other sampling points are significant p value 0 01 microscopic data shows a similar trend but not statistically significant between all other sampling points in the production chain the differences also cannot be backed statistically the most likely explanation for the removal of mp in the reservoir is that they will sink to the bottom processes such as biofilmformation and heteroaggregation are possibly the reason sharma et al 2021 wang et al 2021 for sedimentation of mp consequently one can expect mp and fibres to remain in the soil and accumulate in the sediment one notable observation in the data is the apparent increase of mp after activated carbon filtration acf even though the differences before and after acf were not significant p 0 1 for the measurements with microscopy and ldir separately both techniques show a trend that concentration post treatment are higher than pre treatment these differences cannot be explained by activated carbon particles as these would be recognized by both ldir and microscopy possible explanations for the increase in mp during acf i open containers are used which allow mp to enter due to air deposition or ii plastic was already in the activated carbon before it was used the current data is insufficient to provide an adequate causes or a statistically backed increase and further research to investigate this phenomenon is needed using the optical microscope the colour of the mp 50 to 5000 µm can also be determined figure s5 the majority 70 85 of the mp found at all locations are white it is important here to consider the reprocessing step where peroxide is used it is possible for mp to lose their colour due to this preprocessing step different pretreatment steps are possibly more suited to retain the original colour of the plastic particles but the low cost simplicity and efficacy of h2o2 to effectively remove organic matter is currently difficult to match thomas et al 2020 the second most abundant particle colour is black 8 19 the other colours found incidentally are green red grey blue and yellow both methods show that most particles are found in the smallest size fraction figure s2 and s3 the ldir method also shows that the quantity of mp decreases exponentially with increasing size however statistical analysis of the slopes shows that the differences are statistically insignificant figure s3 it must also be noted that especially for samples with a relatively low amount of mp e g acf and dlf it is possible that the amount of mp in the samples is too low for proper size based quantification fig 4 shows the polymer type speciation of microplastics at different stages the relative mp composition at each of the locations is similar and no significant differences between the four locations can be detected hence there appears to be no difference in removal of microplastics based on polymer type most of plastic polymers found in this study are also detected in other drinking water related samples notably pa pe pet and rubbers mintenig et al also find rubbers in surface water from the river meuse as well as pe and pet mintenig et al 2020 however the most notable difference is the amount of polyamide pa whereas mintenig et al only found small amounts of pa they constitute often the largest group in this research there is no explanation yet for this discrepancy 3 2 2 dwpp b canal lek and dune filtration results from dwpp b show the most extreme case of microplastics removal having the highest microplastic levels at surface water intake 400 000 mp m3 and a magnitude 103 reduction 99 9 in concentration in drinking water in dwpp b surface water is used to produce drinking water through a number of filtration and post purification steps the first treatment step rapid sand filtration rsf removes most plastics the mp concentration fig 3 and table 1 drops significantly from more than 400 000 mp m3 at intake to 1000 mp m3 after this first treatment step rsf the final drinking water contains 241 mp m3 with fibres below lod a notable observation is the sudden increase in concentration prior to dune infiltration from 1000 to 14 000 p m3 the pre treated water is stored in open basins in the dunes before it is infiltrated hence exposure to atmosphere may be the cause of increased microplastic levels but no data supports this and more specific research into this effect is needed this increase in concentration is subsequently undone by infiltration this indicates that microplastics may deposit in the sediment of the infiltration system and possibly accumulate in the sediment further research into sediment of infiltration systems could provide insight in whether microplastics end up in the sediment as seen before with dwpp a by far the most mp in all treatment steps in dwpp b are found in the smallest size category figure s3 plastic types are similar across all samples fig 4 with two notable differences the relatively high amount of rubber in drinking water and the presence of silicone plastics in the two dune samples 3 2 3 dwpp c river overijsselse vecht and riverbank filtration in dwpp c the mp concentration shows a lower albeit efficient rate of removal magnitude 90 after riverbank filtration as no further samples are taken beyond riverbank filtration no further information on post treatment steps is available the removal of approximately 90 microplastics from raw surface water indicates that an approximately equal amount of microplastics will be deposited on the riverbank soil if they do not degrade hence a major fraction of mp and fibres in the size range of 20 to 500 µm are accumulating in the soil of the river bank the total number of microplastics found in dwpp c is lower than in dwpp a or dwpp b in the riverine water of the overijsselse vecht about 13 000 mp m3 are detected fig 3 and table 1 three points after riverbank filtration are measured providing a range of removal efficiencies from this particular treatment step after the passage through the riverbank the total mp concentration is reduced between 98 to 78 on average ca 1237 mp m3 are in the found in riverbank filtrate a similar result is observed for the total fibre concentration that was reduced from 444 fibres m3 to less than 30 fibres m3 a reduction of 93 the size distribution does not change between the two sampling points there are no notable differences in the relative mp type composition fig 4 most particles are found in the smallest size category 3 2 4 dwpp d groundwater and distribution dwpp d and linked drinking and tap water sites are a fully groundwater fed system and very few microplastics were found while overall not exceeding 2000 mp m3 or 2 particles per litre no fibres could be detected or quantified in any of the four samples the analysis of a specific groundwater well revealed that no microplastics above the limit of detection could be found however the mixed water of several groundwater wells showed a detectable amount of microplastics at approximately 1000 mp m3 subsequent tap water showed similar concentrations furthermore the highest mp number was found in the tap sample taken in a private home the groundwater samples are notable because differences between the samples indicate that treatment or transport steps seem to increase the level of microplastics although concentrations in all samples remain extremely low and may not be meaningful for example the increase could be a result of measuring too close to the lod because all samples concentrations are low and near limit of detection these results cannot simply be attributed to a single cause and other effects may strongly influence results e g mp deposition from air or the influence of the sampling event itself the low mp concentration in groundwater related samples are in accordance with prior research mintenig et al 2019 mukotaka et al 2021 as the concentrations in all groundwater based samples are close to particle count detection limits size distribution plots are not meaningful there are no notable differences in the relative mp type composition see fig 4 3 2 5 dwpp e groundwater from riverbank and distribution dwpp e uses groundwater after riverbank filtration to produce drinking water the first sampling point after groundwater extraction is right after aeration sand filtration and just before the water softening here 2223 mp m3 were found after softening and active carbon filtration the mp concentration drops to 519 mp m3 tap water at two different private home ph1 and ph2 showed similar yet slightly elevated concentrations 1387 1484 mp m3 fibres were not detected at any of the four sampling locations of dwpp e the size distribution at all four locations is comparable in all samples the majority of particles is found in the smallest size fractions the type of mp is similar at all locations except for the location dw at ph1 there a seemingly elevated relative amount of pa was detected but it was not backed statistically there is currently no explanation of increased levels of pa at ph1 3 2 6 comparison of the five dwpp a recurring and expected result throughout all dwpp is that primary treatment steps often based on filtration remove a major portion up to 95 of mp fibrous microplastic particles are frequently removed entirely by primary treatment demonstrating that filtration steps are effective at removing mp at individual dwpp is important to assure drinking water quality is not adversely affected by mp both natural and non natural water treatment steps appear capable at removing the vast majority of mp consequently the resulting drinking water is relatively free of microplastics 20 µm as concentrations are below 2000 mp m3 2 particles per litre in contrast riverine surface water contains a significant abundance of microplastics especially the lek canal a possible explanation for these elevated concentrations compared to the other rivers is that the water abstraction point in the lek canal is frequented by container ships capable of whirling up sediment generally the most abundant plastics found are polyamide pa 33 polyethylene terephthalate pet 15 rubbers 10 polyethylene pe 10 and chlorinated polyethylene cpe 7 see fig 4 the sole notable exception is the high amount of pa ca 75 in ph1 from dwpp e the general high abundance of pa is noteworthy and unexpected usually lower relative concentrations are found pivokonsky et al 2018 pivokonský et al 2020 wang et al 2020 a possible explanation could be an artefact as a result of wrongly labelled mp e g natural occurring polyamide is insufficiently removed during clean up and then falsely labelled as synthetic pa exploring the size distribution between sample types is similarly limited in many samples especially drinking water samples the mp concentration is too low to obtain a reliable size distribution it is notable that the size distribution seems to be comparable in all water sources with the sole exception of the groundwater well of dwpp d figure s3 particles were further categorised by ldir shape assessment e g as undefined particle rod sphere or fibre cluster for example see pictures in table s4 no significant difference between shapes in the various samples was observed figure s4 the largest group in the size range 20 500 µm is by far are the undefined particles followed up by rod shaped particles in general fibres fibre cluster and spheres are uncommon on average less than 5 of mp are fibres or fibre cluster this appears to be in contrast with microscopic analyses where the majority of mp are identified as fibres however microscopic method has a lower particle size cut off at 50 µm in contrast to 20 µm by ldir and covers also the size range above 500 µm fibres are usually larger particles i e fibres that become too small are defined as rods and therefore are more dominant in microscopic analysis 3 3 intake of microplastics through consumption of tap water the potential intake of microplastics through tap water can be compared to other potential routes of microplastic intake based on these and other studies comparing results requires a disclaimer foremost determination of mp concentrations from various papers and methods is prone to error because there is still no universally agreed format to report microplastic concentrations mpc in relation to their characterisation and size range small methodological differences can cause large experimental variations for example the mp size range analysed differ between studies and consequently concentrations may differ greatly as effect of the used size range a minor change in mp size from e g 20 µm to 10 µm will under the theoretical assumption that mp breakdown three dimensionally immediately increase the mpc by a factor of eight therefore harmonisation in report format is critically needed kirstein et al 2021a van mourik et al 2021 although exposure to microplastics from different sources is not always directly comparable preliminary comparisons show that dutch tap water contributes little to the total human intake of mp per year other consumption liquids air exposure and food consumption have a far bigger share in annual intake than tap drinking water the level of microplastics in tap water found in this study is low ranging from about 0 2 mp per litre to 1 5 mp per litre this number is comparable to recent findings by cox et al 2019 for the usa on average 4 2 mp l lam et al 2020 2 2 mp l in hong kong and dalmau soler et al 2021 0 06 mp l in catalonia spain sometimes much higher concentrations 440 mp l china are reported tong et al 2020 assuming that an average person drinks about 1 l of tap water a day coffee tea not included between ca 70 and 550 mp would be consumed annually this means the number of mp found in dutch tap water also only amounts to less than 1 of the total intake of mp consumption and inhalation and to less than 2 of the intake of mp by inhalation only based on numbers from cox et al if only consumption is taken into account based on cox et al the relative contribution of tap water to the total consumption would be between 0 8 to 1 5 it should be noted however that in all these cases no size range is mentioned highlighting the need for reporting formats to increase comparability of studies aside from potential exposure to microplastics through drinking water other sources of exposure are being increasingly investigated and compared for example microplastics can also be found in household dust enyoh et al 2019 gasperi et al 2018 annual intake of airborne mp is estimated to be 12 891 4472 fibres year 50 5000 µm soltani et al 2021 and 99 280 mp year 272 mp day vianello et al 2019 in comparison to these numbers the total intake through tap water based on the highest concentrations observed in the current study only amounts to 4 and 0 5 respectively however the assessed size range of mp in tap water was broader than the ranged used by soltani the intake of mp from tap water can also be compared to other bottled beverages which similarly shows that tap water contributes little to the total intake of mp kutralam muniasamy et al 2020 found that milk can contain between 1 14 mp l in the size range 11 to 5000 µm according to shruti et al 2020 beer can contain up to 28 mp l in the size range 100 to 1000 µm shruti et al 2020 moreover soft drinks and tea contain between 1 and 7 mp l yet the intake of microplastics by consumption of fruits and vegetables appears to dwarf the intake from liquids in fruits a mpc of 223 000 mp g and in vegetables 97 800 mp g at a lower size range of below 10 µm is found oliveri conti et al 2020 the microplastics lower size range is below 10 while literature assessments provides some insights in different sources of exposure to mp it is still extremely difficult as differences can be the result of sampling measuring and 4 conclusions this research explored the fate of microplastic particles in drinking water production and drinking water the data shows that mp are present in measurable quantities in riverine surface water whereas different surface waters contain vastly different concentration levels between about 12 000 and 450 000 mp m3 the total concentration of microplastics significantly decreases during the treatment process between 80 99 the results show that filtration steps are capable of removing microplastics but as a consequence the natural filters e g rapid sand filtration dune soil and or bank filtrate or the reservoir could accumulate these plastics as plastics degrade poorly analysis of soil or sediment samples would therefore be highly interesting to compare with water data removal by water treatment results in very low levels of microplastics in drinking water less than 2 mp l in the size range 20 to 500 µm no microplastics could be quantified in a single groundwater well but small amounts of microplastics were found in the groundwater collection network although these levels remained low throughout the whole treatment process measurements were carried out at various stages of treatment which showed removal rates of specific groups of treatment steps during the treatment processes sudden and unexpected increases of microplastic concentrations were observed at two different stages first a concentration spike was noted prior to dune infiltration and secondly a minor spike occurred after activated carbon filtration at the moment it is not clear whether the increase in mp after filtration over activated carbon and before dune infiltration is structural and significant and further analyses on these treatment points is suggested the current data are insufficient to define a probable cause for increase if structurally finding out the cause is a recommendation all water samples taken in the distribution network at private homes show a higher concentration of mp compared to the treated water prior to distribution however this increase appears to be minor and the actual drinking water contains less than 2 mp l regardless it is not clear if there are actually more mp in samples taken at household taps or if microplastics are introduced during the sampling event the composition of microplastics e g colour type of plastic is unchanged during water treatment as mp properties do not change statistically significantly during the purification process only changes in the concentration of mp and fibres were observed by far the largest group of mp between 20 and 500 µm are particle shaped opposed to fibres in fact fibres constitute only a small fraction in this size range 1 5 however the larger the mp the more the ratio between particles and fibres shifts in favour of the fibres fibres are almost completely absent after the first treatment step in any treatment on average the most abundant plastic types found are polyamide pa 33 polyethylene terephthalate pet 15 rubbers 10 polyethylene pe 10 and chlorinated polyethylene cpe 7 this study shows like earlier studies that the smaller mp outnumber the larger ones therefore if mp numbers are relevant one must consider to measure the smallest mp possible and if one wants to compare results size ranges should be carefully aligned with ldir the lower size limit is currently about 10 µm with regard to the contribution of tap water to the total intake of mp 20 5000 µm of a person per year it can be concluded that tap water in the netherlands only contributes to a minor extent to the total intake presumably less than 1 however the need to reliably align data between studies is greatly needed as comparing data from different sources is currently unviable due to a lack

15769,microplastics are ubiquitous and consequently enter drinking water treatment plants knowledge of the microplastic fate in drinking water production is still very limited although explorative studies have shown tap water contains low contents of microplastics in this study we measure microplastic concentrations in drinking water sources and assess the effectiveness of various drinking water treatment facilities to reduce the microplastic concentrations in water to gain insight into the fate of microplastics two analytical techniques laser direct infrared spectroscopy ldir and optical microscopy have been applied to cover the particle size range from 20 µm to 5 mm in total five different drinking water sites were investigated using four different types of raw water groundwater surface water dune filtrate and riverbank filtrate for drinking water production this research shows that drinking water treatment removes the majority of microplastics and that concentration of microplastics larger than 20 µm in tap water is less than 2 microplastics particles per litre between the different raw water sources it is found that groundwater had by far the lowest microplastics concentrations 1 000 microplastics per m3 and the highest concentration was found in riverine water up to 460 000 particles per m3 specifically in the lek canal a canal connected to the river rhine on average the most abundant plastics found are polyamide pa 33 polyethylene terephthalate pet 15 rubbers 10 polyethylene pe 10 and chlorinated polyethylene cpe 7 this study also showed that natural treatment steps such as dune infiltration and sedimentation remove microplastics effectively however this may introduce an adverse effect where microplastics potentially accumulate

the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in december 2020 the new european drinking water directive was adopted which came into force on january 12th 2021 member states of the european union eu are obliged to implement the provisions of the revised drinking water directive into national laws and regulations article 13 of the new directive refers to a watch list of substances to meet growing concern about the effects of new compounds explicitly including microplastics mp on human health via water intended for human consumption and to address risks from new compounds in the water supply system this means that microplastics must be monitored and risk assessments must be drawn up in short analysis methods and knowledge of current microplastics concentrations are important in order to meet the obligations of this drinking water directive the presence of mp in the environment is well known their presence in the marine environment has been demonstrated burns and boxall 2018 lusher 2015 also numbers of studies regarding microplastics in freshwater are increasing in particular the number of scientific publications on microplastics in surface water and in drinking water has increased exponentially kirstein et al 2021b li et al 2018 novotna et al 2019 novotna et al 2019 and eerkes medrano et al 2019 indicated that mp are frequently found in sources of drinking water but little was known about the presence and fate of mp in drinking water shen et al 2020 made a graphical overview of the sources and transport of microplastics in raw water and treated drinking water both tap water and bottled water according to these authors the main sources of microplastics are agriculture and sewage effluent but eerkes medrano et al 2019 also take atmospheric deposition into account recently microplastics have also been detected in drinking water johnson et al 2020 kirstein et al 2021b mintenig et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 showed that mp were found in 81 of 159 samples of tap water from different countries and 93 of 259 samples of bottled water from 11 different brands the reported values range between few particles to 1000 particles per m3 however numbers mentioned in scientific papers are often difficult to compare sampling pre treatment techniques and different analytical techniques influence the recorded amount of particles and may impose different size ranges hence it is too early to draw a solid conclusion on the amounts of microplastics in fresh and drinking water removal of microplastics in water treatment has only recently been studied removal efficiency varies between 80 and 99 johnson et al 2020 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 techniques such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration and activated carbon filtration can reduce mp concentrations by about 80 pivokonsky et al 2018 according to shen et al 2020 other promising techniques for removing mp from water are electrocoagulation magnetic extraction and membrane filtration especially the latter techniques i e nf nanofiltration and ro reverse osmosis are already used in drinking water treatment but are susceptible to fouling by the mp barchiesi et al 2021 li et al 2020 regarding the human toxicity of mp in drinking water data are still too scarce according to vethaak and legler there is a lack of information on both human exposure to mp and their toxicological effects vethaak and legler 2021 there is however an indication that mp can carry biofilm and antibiotic resistance genes li et al 2020 mughini gras et al 2021 biofilm formation often takes place on mp because they have a rough and relative large surface area and because auxiliary substances diffusing from them can be used as nutrients learbuch et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in the present research we focus on the fate of mp in drinking water production the effect of treatment processes on the removal of mp was studied in five different drinking water production processes dwpp different types of drinking water sources and subsequent treatment stages were investigated surface water from a reservoir dune filtrate groundwater and riverbank filtrate we analysed various water samples from different stages in the dwpp chain thus we obtained not only insight in the removal efficiency of current water treatment processes but also in possible unintentional introduction of microplastics during the treatment or distribution processes 2 materials and methods this study utilises the combination of two techniques laser infrared imaging ldir and microscopy to cover most of the possible microplastics between 5000 µm to 20 µm microscopy is used to cover larger particles 50 µm and ldir is used to cover smaller particles from 500 µm to 20 µm 2 1 chemicals laser direct infrared imaging ldir the following chemicals were purchased sodium dodecylsulfonate and koh from merck darmstadt germany 30 solution h2o2 zncl2 and ethanol from boom meppel the netherlands fluorescent green polyethylene microspheres from cospheric santa barbara usa milliq water with 18 mω from veolia ede the netherlands all liquids used including the cleaning liquids were filtered prior to usage over 10 µm stainless steel sieves microscopy the following chemicals were purchased stabilized hydrogen peroxide 30 solution from merck darmstadt germany demineralised water was produced in house liquid chemicals were filtered over 30 µm stainless steel mesh filters before usage 2 2 research locations reservoir dwpp a water from the river meuse is used as a source after intake water subsequently passes three different reservoirs in the biesbosch area de gijster honderd dertig and petrusplaat the total residence time of the meuse water in the three biesbosch reservoirs is around 5 months in addition for part of the year including the summer artificial aeration is used to promote mixing of the water in the reservoirs post reservoir the water is treated with coagulation flocculation sedimentation and double layer filtration dlf and finally filtration over activated carbon acf samples were taken at four different stages of the water treatment incoming water from the river meuse outgoing water after storage in the reservoir lake petrusplaat after dlf and after acf sampling occurred on three different dates with a gap of two weeks at each sampling location for each sampling event two consecutive samples were taken one sample was processed for ldir analysis and one for microscopic analysis see sampling methods dune filtration dwpp b surface water from the dutch lek canal is used as a source after pre treatment coagulation flocculation sedimentation and rapid sand filtration rf the water is infiltrated in dunes after dune filtration water is further purified to drinking water four samples were taken surface water pre treated surface water dune infiltrate drinking water on site samples were only analysed using the ldir method riverbank filtrate 1 dwpp c in total four samples of intake water were taken surface water from dutch river overijsselse vecht ov and three incoming riverbank filtrates these latter three samples were chosen deliberately to see whether there is a difference between the three incoming filtrates samples were only analysed using ldir groundwater dwpp d water from different wells is combined and purified to drinking water four samples were taken groundwater from one well combined water from several wells drinking water on the production site tap water in a private home

water on site and tap water from two private homes ph1 and ph2 samples were only analysed using ldir details on all locations can be found in table 1 and table s1 2 3 sampling for ldir and microscopy weather conditions no extreme weather conditions were recorded during sampling during sampling outside a building no rain fall was recorded the wind speed never exceeded 13 m s ldir two sampling methods were applied for the ldir analysis a cascade of metal sieves and a metal candle filter cascade the first one was used for samples with an expected high amount of mp the latter for samples with an expected low amount of mp details in si at each sampling event between 1000 and 10 000 l exact amounts are in table s1 of water was filtered through either the cascade of two metal sieves gilson usa of 500 μm and 100 μm with a 10 μm plankton net hydro bios germany at the end or a candle filter cascade 5 10 100 and 500 μm the 500 μm sieve or filter was used to remove large mp and to prevent clogging of the smaller sieves filters residue from that sieve filter was not analysed the other residues were later transferred into separate glass bottles using ultrapure water and stored at 4 c microscopy sampling of microplastics was done with varying volumes depending on the sampling point see table s1 keizersveer 400 2500 litres petrusplaat 550 950 litres after double layer filtration dlf 13 000 litres after activated carbon filtration acf 5000 7000 litres microplastics were separated from the water by filtering through a stainless steel sieve cascade with mesh sizes of 50 µm 125 µm 250 µm 1000 µm and 5000 µm retsch germany at a constant flow rate the smallest sieve 50 µm was removed after 400 600 litres at keizersveer to avoid clogging exact volumes per sieve were noted and used for the subsequent concentration calculations all sieves were wrapped in aluminium foil and transported for analysis microplastics were recovered from the sieves by backflushing with ultrapure water and collection in one glass bottle per sieve microplastic samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c in glass bottles until sample treatment 2 4 sample treatment and quality control ldir potential contamination occurring during sample handling was minimised by cleaning all working surfaces with ethanol rinsing equipment and immediate covering with aluminium foil and wearing a cotton lab coat at all times furthermore solutions of chemicals were filtered 10 µm metal mesh prior to use use of plastic materials during sample handling was minimised e g a metal filter setup with teflon tubing and glassware for sample storage and separation negative controls were treated in parallel with each batch of actual samples to determine the degree of contamination for the positive control a known number of plastic particles green fluorescent pe average diameter 100 µm were added to a water sample the ratio between the particle number before and after work up is the recovery rate these control particles were visually counted under a microscope recoveries ranged typically from ca 65 to 80 microscopy clean up of samples was kept as simple as possible as visual counting is not strongly influenced by background contamination each glass sample bottle containing different size fractions was concentrated separately by using a 30 µm stainless steel mesh filter the residue on the 30 µm mesh was backflushed with 10 ml of prefiltered ultrapure water for each sample five beakers corresponding to five sieve fractions were prepared to each sample 10 ml of 30 h2o2 was added and heated to 75 c under constant stirring the solution was left to settle for at least 24 h after digestion samples were filtered again over 30 µm stainless steel filters and the residue was transferred by prefiltered ultrapure water and separately vacuum filtered the microplastics were transferred to a bacterial cellulose nitrate cn filter on which subsequent particle counting was performed sartorius cellulose nitrate filters sterile pore size 0 45 µm green for storage the cn filters were kept wet and sealed from air under refrigerated conditions until analysis 2 5 analysis procedure microplastic measurements ldir sample preparation to remove unwanted organic and inorganic matter and particle analyses were based on previously described methods leslie et al 2017 löder et al 2015 mintenig et al 2018 mintenig et al 2020 mughini gras et al 2021 particle analysis focused on residues of the 10 μm and 100 μm sieves suspensions from these two fractions were combined and filtered over a 10 µm metal mesh the filter was then transferred into a beaker with a 10 sodium dodecyl sulfonate solution after a day the suspension was filtered over a 10 µm metal mesh the filter was transferred into a beaker with 75 ml 12 5 potassium hydroxide solution and left standing for 5 days at 35 c subsequently the suspension was filtered again through the same 10 µm metal filter the residues were transferred into a beaker with 50 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide solution and left standing for one day at 35 c the sample was filtered again through the same metal filter and the residues were transferred into a separation funnel using a 100 ml zinc chloride solution 1 6 g cm3 the funnels were shaken and left standing to enable settling of denser materials the settled material was discarded by continuously turning the valve of the funnel to prevent clogging re suspension and loss of plastics about 10 ml of liquid was allowed to remain in the funnel these 10 ml were filtered again over a metal filter using 4 ml ethanol the retained materials were removed from the filter and transferred into a glass vial the particles in the 4 ml ethanol are therefore all the particles that could be extracted from the original sample next a vortex was created in this suspension using a vortex mixer to distribute the mp evenly in the ethanol an aliquot 2 50 µl was taken from this liquid and transferred to the microscope slide for analysis from this subsample the actual particle number in the 4 ml ethanol is calculated the subsample is necessary as otherwise too many mp will be transferred onto the slide the sample was analysed using an agilent chemical imaging laser direct infrared ldir mp ranging from 20 500 µm were measured and quantified if not stated otherwise listed particle numbers are always in the size range from 20 500 µm four samples were analysed in parallel in combination with a negative control sample see quality control to calculate the recovery rate microscopy analysis was performed with an olympus stereomicroscope szx10 magnification 6 3 63x assisted by a light source photonische optische geräter led lichtquellef3000 the cn filter was visually scanned for the presence of microplastics metal tweezers were occasionally used to determine the fluidity and tension to assess whether a particle was a plastic particles were classified as mp if they were solid not elastic and able to resist tension force each confirmed microplastic particle was counted and categorized based on morphology no size was recorded at low numbers of microplastics the entire filter was counted if more than 300 particles cm2 filter surface were present at least 10 of the filter surface was counted and the results extrapolated 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 ldir particle number the mp number per sample is corrected for the number of mp in the negative control these numbers are subtracted from the sample furthermore the recovery rate from the positive control is applied to the particle number e g a recovery rate of 90 means that the particle number of the sample is divided by 0 9 limit of detection lod it is defined that a sample contains mp if the particle number is above the 95 confidence interval of the negative controls lod for all sampling sites can be found in the supporting information table s2 limit of quantification loq the particle number is quantified if the particle number in the sample is twice the upper limit of the 95 ci of the negative controls loq for all sampling sites can be found in the supporting information table s2 particle size particle size was determined by the agilent software based on the infrared image of the particle the width and height of the particle were measured the smallest dimension defines the category the particle belongs to chemical characterisation the mp were identified by the agilent software clarity v1 1 microplastic shape and colour determination mp colour cannot be determined by this method the particle shape of the identified mp was determined using the random forest model package breiman and cutler s random forests for classification and regression version 4 6 14 in r breiman et al 2020 the mp were divided into six categories sphere undefined particle rod fibre fibre cluster and artefact example pictures of each class can be found here table s4 about 500 different mp were categorised manually and this data set was used to identify the shapes of the other mp variables defining the category of a mp were diameter aspect ratio area perimeter eccentricity circularity solidity and the maximum ir adsorption artefacts were removed from the sets statistical analysis column statistics were performed using graphpad prism 5 01 anova analysis of variation shapiro wilt test and t tests were performed in r v 1 2 1335 from stats package 3 6 1 for p values a threshold of 0 05 was used 2 6 2 microscopy size classification mp were assigned a size fraction based on the filter these were found on the sieve on which the mp were found defines the size category mp size was not measured for each mp individually e g an mp found on a 50 µm sieve will be binned as an mp of 50 125 µm in size regardless of its actual size this approach was chosen as measuring the size of each mp individually would have been too time consuming particle number the amount of mp per sieve size was counted the cn filter is divided in 144 units in a grid depending on the number of microplastics on the filter it was partially counted at least 15 units or completely counted if the collection filter was counted completely the total amount of plastics was used as is if the collection filter was partially counted results were extrapolated to account for the entire collection to express it as volume based unit the total amount of plastics was corrected for the sampling volume particle colour and shape microplastics were binned based on morphological qualities colour shape and size each individual microplastic particle was assigned a shape category and colour category manually the following shape categories were defined sphere rod miscellaneous and fibre the following colour categories were defined white grey white black blue green yellow red and miscellaneous when mp are mentioned all different shapes are included dataset due to the binning methods applied for size shape and colour each analysis resulted in a combination of 55 parameters consisting of bins size shape and colour combinations per parameter the total number of microplastics corresponding to that classification was reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 choice of analytical techniques this study employs two different analytical techniques microscopy and ldir in parallel on dwpp a and utilizes ldir only on dwpp b through e differences between microscopy and ldir are plentiful but most important are the differences in acquirable range and sensitivity and to a lesser extend the time cost of analysis the differences between microscopy and ldir are covered in extensive detail in a report kools et al 2021 the aim of current study is not to provide a comprehensive comparison between two methods however some discussion on the arguments to use two methods is needed to further place results in context the range of microplastics is from 5000 µm downwards and no single technique can cover the entire range of plastics ldir s upper limit is 500 µm whereas microscopy is limited to microplastic particles sizes 50 µm to 5000 µm however it is also expected that especially smaller plastics are more prevalent and large microplastics i e 1000 µm are comparatively rare and least likely to be relevant to drinking water microscopy is unable to adequately cover the small microplastics but is a relatively inexpensive and simple technique to cover for larger particles as few larger particles 500 µm were found in dwpp a it was decided not to probe water from other plants for the presence of larger particles as ldir will adequately cover the majority of microplastic particles 3 2 measurements sampling locations were along the treatment lines of five different drinking water production plants dwpp anonymised as a e in four cases dwpp a b and c the first stage is intake of raw surface water and the subsequent stages are further steps in the production process for dwpp d the intake groundwater both from one well and from combined wells was analysed in case of dwpp e the source water was not included in the analysis the focus was on the end of the production process a single drinking water production process dwpp a was monitored extensively by two methods three samples per location and at four different stages of water purification the other four other production processes dwpp b e were analysed at four points in a single sampling event and only by ldir 3 2 1 dwpp a river meuse and reservoir stabilisation fig 1 and figure si6 show the total mp and fibre numbers for each sampling location in dwpp a there is a clear difference between the various sampling points in the chain throughout dwpp a the total level of microplastics decreases substantially eventually reaching about 10 000 mp m3 ldir and 50 mp m3 microscope in purified water the highest microplastic concentration was found in the surface water from the meuse at keizersveer the microplastic concentration varies between about 65 000 and 90 000 mp m3 for the ldir analysis variability of 1 4 between the lowest and the highest value and between 200 and 3500 mp m3 for the microscopy variability of 5 9 between the highest and the lowest value in addition the meuse seems to contain the highest fibre concentration of all samples in this study up to 4000 fibres m3 ldir and up to 2500 fibres m3 microscopy the difference in fibre concentration between ldir and microscopy is notably less pronounced than between total microplastic concentration fibres are generally larger mp as compared to particles and therefore have a greater overlap between ldir and microscopy for fibres the differences in the minimal mesh size of the filters applied for the microscopic and ldir method is smaller as the meuse is predominantly a rain fed river large fluctuations in the absolute concentration of microplastics are to be expected such fluctuations were indeed observed in the data larger fluctuations in mp concentration between two sampling events are most pronounced at keizersveer using microscopic analysis in part this can occur due to the sample matrix and clean up as the water may have contained organic sediment and inorganic material sand that disturbed counting as the ldir method had a more extensive sample clean up it was expected that ldir would be less affected by sediment than the microscopic method the variability in the riverine water can also be seen in the data from the other sampling locations however the water in petrusplaat is less or similarly affected by temporal fluctuations due to its purpose as a buffer reservoir the lower and higher particle numbers differ by a factor of 3 9 and 1 7 respectively the other two locations acf and dlf show relative variations between 1 8 and 4 4 for both methods in absolute numbers they are less affected than the two surface water locations it seems necessary that especially for riverine surface waters several measurements over different seasons and hydrological conditions and or time averaged sampling are required to obtain the full dynamics of the mp concentrations in a large riverine system as one sample rich in organic and inorganic material can have a significant impact on the mp concentration fig 2 shows the relative mp number throughout dwpp a compared to intake at keizersveer most mp 80 95 are removed after the residence time in the reservoir this is in accordance with recent literature pivokonsky et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the largest removal of microplastics is observed after basin passage and pre treatment a smaller number of microplastics are removed by double layer filters dlf process in case of ldir analysis the differences between the raw water source keizersveer and the partly treated water other sampling points are significant p value 0 01 microscopic data shows a similar trend but not statistically significant between all other sampling points in the production chain the differences also cannot be backed statistically the most likely explanation for the removal of mp in the reservoir is that they will sink to the bottom processes such as biofilmformation and heteroaggregation are possibly the reason sharma et al 2021 wang et al 2021 for sedimentation of mp consequently one can expect mp and fibres to remain in the soil and accumulate in the sediment one notable observation in the data is the apparent increase of mp after activated carbon filtration acf even though the differences before and after acf were not significant p 0 1 for the measurements with microscopy and ldir separately both techniques show a trend that concentration post treatment are higher than pre treatment these differences cannot be explained by activated carbon particles as these would be recognized by both ldir and microscopy possible explanations for the increase in mp during acf i open containers are used which allow mp to enter due to air deposition or ii plastic was already in the activated carbon before it was used the current data is insufficient to provide an adequate causes or a statistically backed increase and further research to investigate this phenomenon is needed using the optical microscope the colour of the mp 50 to 5000 µm can also be determined figure s5 the majority 70 85 of the mp found at all locations are white it is important here to consider the reprocessing step where peroxide is used it is possible for mp to lose their colour due to this preprocessing step different pretreatment steps are possibly more suited to retain the original colour of the plastic particles but the low cost simplicity and efficacy of h2o2 to effectively remove organic matter is currently difficult to match thomas et al 2020 the second most abundant particle colour is black 8 19 the other colours found incidentally are green red grey blue and yellow both methods show that most particles are found in the smallest size fraction figure s2 and s3 the ldir method also shows that the quantity of mp decreases exponentially with increasing size however statistical analysis of the slopes shows that the differences are statistically insignificant figure s3 it must also be noted that especially for samples with a relatively low amount of mp e g acf and dlf it is possible that the amount of mp in the samples is too low for proper size based quantification fig 4 shows the polymer type speciation of microplastics at different stages the relative mp composition at each of the locations is similar and no significant differences between the four locations can be detected hence there appears to be no difference in removal of microplastics based on polymer type most of plastic polymers found in this study are also detected in other drinking water related samples notably pa pe pet and rubbers mintenig et al also find rubbers in surface water from the river meuse as well as pe and pet mintenig et al 2020 however the most notable difference is the amount of polyamide pa whereas mintenig et al only found small amounts of pa they constitute often the largest group in this research there is no explanation yet for this discrepancy 3 2 2 dwpp b canal lek and dune filtration results from dwpp b show the most extreme case of microplastics removal having the highest microplastic levels at surface water intake 400 000 mp m3 and a magnitude 103 reduction 99 9 in concentration in drinking water in dwpp b surface water is used to produce drinking water through a number of filtration and post purification steps the first treatment step rapid sand filtration rsf removes most plastics the mp concentration fig 3 and table 1 drops significantly from more than 400 000 mp m3 at intake to 1000 mp m3 after this first treatment step rsf the final drinking water contains 241 mp m3 with fibres below lod a notable observation is the sudden increase in concentration prior to dune infiltration from 1000 to 14 000 p m3 the pre treated water is stored in open basins in the dunes before it is infiltrated hence exposure to atmosphere may be the cause of increased microplastic levels but no data supports this and more specific research into this effect is needed this increase in concentration is subsequently undone by infiltration this indicates that microplastics may deposit in the sediment of the infiltration system and possibly accumulate in the sediment further research into sediment of infiltration systems could provide insight in whether microplastics end up in the sediment as seen before with dwpp a by far the most mp in all treatment steps in dwpp b are found in the smallest size category figure s3 plastic types are similar across all samples fig 4 with two notable differences the relatively high amount of rubber in drinking water and the presence of silicone plastics in the two dune samples 3 2 3 dwpp c river overijsselse vecht and riverbank filtration in dwpp c the mp concentration shows a lower albeit efficient rate of removal magnitude 90 after riverbank filtration as no further samples are taken beyond riverbank filtration no further information on post treatment steps is available the removal of approximately 90 microplastics from raw surface water indicates that an approximately equal amount of microplastics will be deposited on the riverbank soil if they do not degrade hence a major fraction of mp and fibres in the size range of 20 to 500 µm are accumulating in the soil of the river bank the total number of microplastics found in dwpp c is lower than in dwpp a or dwpp b in the riverine water of the overijsselse vecht about 13 000 mp m3 are detected fig 3 and table 1 three points after riverbank filtration are measured providing a range of removal efficiencies from this particular treatment step after the passage through the riverbank the total mp concentration is reduced between 98 to 78 on average ca 1237 mp m3 are in the found in riverbank filtrate a similar result is observed for the total fibre concentration that was reduced from 444 fibres m3 to less than 30 fibres m3 a reduction of 93 the size distribution does not change between the two sampling points there are no notable differences in the relative mp type composition fig 4 most particles are found in the smallest size category 3 2 4 dwpp d groundwater and distribution dwpp d and linked drinking and tap water sites are a fully groundwater fed system and very few microplastics were found while overall not exceeding 2000 mp m3 or 2 particles per litre no fibres could be detected or quantified in any of the four samples the analysis of a specific groundwater well revealed that no microplastics above the limit of detection could be found however the mixed water of several groundwater wells showed a detectable amount of microplastics at approximately 1000 mp m3 subsequent tap water showed similar concentrations furthermore the highest mp number was found in the tap sample taken in a private home the groundwater samples are notable because differences between the samples indicate that treatment or transport steps seem to increase the level of microplastics although concentrations in all samples remain extremely low and may not be meaningful for example the increase could be a result of measuring too close to the lod because all samples concentrations are low and near limit of detection these results cannot simply be attributed to a single cause and other effects may strongly influence results e g mp deposition from air or the influence of the sampling event itself the low mp concentration in groundwater related samples are in accordance with prior research mintenig et al 2019 mukotaka et al 2021 as the concentrations in all groundwater based samples are close to particle count detection limits size distribution plots are not meaningful there are no notable differences in the relative mp type composition see fig 4 3 2 5 dwpp e groundwater from riverbank and distribution dwpp e uses groundwater after riverbank filtration to produce drinking water the first sampling point after groundwater extraction is right after aeration sand filtration and just before the water softening here 2223 mp m3 were found after softening and active carbon filtration the mp concentration drops to 519 mp m3 tap water at two different private home ph1 and ph2 showed similar yet slightly elevated concentrations 1387 1484 mp m3 fibres were not detected at any of the four sampling locations of dwpp e the size distribution at all four locations is comparable in all samples the majority of particles is found in the smallest size fractions the type of mp is similar at all locations except for the location dw at ph1 there a seemingly elevated relative amount of pa was detected but it was not backed statistically there is currently no explanation of increased levels of pa at ph1 3 2 6 comparison of the five dwpp a recurring and expected result throughout all dwpp is that primary treatment steps often based on filtration remove a major portion up to 95 of mp fibrous microplastic particles are frequently removed entirely by primary treatment demonstrating that filtration steps are effective at removing mp at individual dwpp is important to assure drinking water quality is not adversely affected by mp both natural and non natural water treatment steps appear capable at removing the vast majority of mp consequently the resulting drinking water is relatively free of microplastics 20 µm as concentrations are below 2000 mp m3 2 particles per litre in contrast riverine surface water contains a significant abundance of microplastics especially the lek canal a possible explanation for these elevated concentrations compared to the other rivers is that the water abstraction point in the lek canal is frequented by container ships capable of whirling up sediment generally the most abundant plastics found are polyamide pa 33 polyethylene terephthalate pet 15 rubbers 10 polyethylene pe 10 and chlorinated polyethylene cpe 7 see fig 4 the sole notable exception is the high amount of pa ca 75 in ph1 from dwpp e the general high abundance of pa is noteworthy and unexpected usually lower relative concentrations are found pivokonsky et al 2018 pivokonský et al 2020 wang et al 2020 a possible explanation could be an artefact as a result of wrongly labelled mp e g natural occurring polyamide is insufficiently removed during clean up and then falsely labelled as synthetic pa exploring the size distribution between sample types is similarly limited in many samples especially drinking water samples the mp concentration is too low to obtain a reliable size distribution it is notable that the size distribution seems to be comparable in all water sources with the sole exception of the groundwater well of dwpp d figure s3 particles were further categorised by ldir shape assessment e g as undefined particle rod sphere or fibre cluster for example see pictures in table s4 no significant difference between shapes in the various samples was observed figure s4 the largest group in the size range 20 500 µm is by far are the undefined particles followed up by rod shaped particles in general fibres fibre cluster and spheres are uncommon on average less than 5 of mp are fibres or fibre cluster this appears to be in contrast with microscopic analyses where the majority of mp are identified as fibres however microscopic method has a lower particle size cut off at 50 µm in contrast to 20 µm by ldir and covers also the size range above 500 µm fibres are usually larger particles i e fibres that become too small are defined as rods and therefore are more dominant in microscopic analysis 3 3 intake of microplastics through consumption of tap water the potential intake of microplastics through tap water can be compared to other potential routes of microplastic intake based on these and other studies comparing results requires a disclaimer foremost determination of mp concentrations from various papers and methods is prone to error because there is still no universally agreed format to report microplastic concentrations mpc in relation to their characterisation and size range small methodological differences can cause large experimental variations for example the mp size range analysed differ between studies and consequently concentrations may differ greatly as effect of the used size range a minor change in mp size from e g 20 µm to 10 µm will under the theoretical assumption that mp breakdown three dimensionally immediately increase the mpc by a factor of eight therefore harmonisation in report format is critically needed kirstein et al 2021a van mourik et al 2021 although exposure to microplastics from different sources is not always directly comparable preliminary comparisons show that dutch tap water contributes little to the total human intake of mp per year other consumption liquids air exposure and food consumption have a far bigger share in annual intake than tap drinking water the level of microplastics in tap water found in this study is low ranging from about 0 2 mp per litre to 1 5 mp per litre this number is comparable to recent findings by cox et al 2019 for the usa on average 4 2 mp l lam et al 2020 2 2 mp l in hong kong and dalmau soler et al 2021 0 06 mp l in catalonia spain sometimes much higher concentrations 440 mp l china are reported tong et al 2020 assuming that an average person drinks about 1 l of tap water a day coffee tea not included between ca 70 and 550 mp would be consumed annually this means the number of mp found in dutch tap water also only amounts to less than 1 of the total intake of mp consumption and inhalation and to less than 2 of the intake of mp by inhalation only based on numbers from cox et al if only consumption is taken into account based on cox et al the relative contribution of tap water to the total consumption would be between 0 8 to 1 5 it should be noted however that in all these cases no size range is mentioned highlighting the need for reporting formats to increase comparability of studies aside from potential exposure to microplastics through drinking water other sources of exposure are being increasingly investigated and compared for example microplastics can also be found in household dust enyoh et al 2019 gasperi et al 2018 annual intake of airborne mp is estimated to be 12 891 4472 fibres year 50 5000 µm soltani et al 2021 and 99 280 mp year 272 mp day vianello et al 2019 in comparison to these numbers the total intake through tap water based on the highest concentrations observed in the current study only amounts to 4 and 0 5 respectively however the assessed size range of mp in tap water was broader than the ranged used by soltani the intake of mp from tap water can also be compared to other bottled beverages which similarly shows that tap water contributes little to the total intake of mp kutralam muniasamy et al 2020 found that milk can contain between 1 14 mp l in the size range 11 to 5000 µm according to shruti et al 2020 beer can contain up to 28 mp l in the size range 100 to 1000 µm shruti et al 2020 moreover soft drinks and tea contain between 1 and 7 mp l yet the intake of microplastics by consumption of fruits and vegetables appears to dwarf the intake from liquids in fruits a mpc of 223 000 mp g and in vegetables 97 800 mp g at a lower size range of below 10 µm is found oliveri conti et al 2020 the microplastics lower size range is below 10 while literature assessments provides some insights in different sources of exposure to mp it is still extremely difficult as differences can be the result of sampling measuring and 4 conclusions this research explored the fate of microplastic particles in drinking water production and drinking water the data shows that mp are present in measurable quantities in riverine surface water whereas different surface waters contain vastly different concentration levels between about 12 000 and 450 000 mp m3 the total concentration of microplastics significantly decreases during the treatment process between 80 99 the results show that filtration steps are capable of removing microplastics but as a consequence the natural filters e g rapid sand filtration dune soil and or bank filtrate or the reservoir could accumulate these plastics as plastics degrade poorly analysis of soil or sediment samples would therefore be highly interesting to compare with water data removal by water treatment results in very low levels of microplastics in drinking water less than 2 mp l in the size range 20 to 500 µm no microplastics could be quantified in a single groundwater well but small amounts of microplastics were found in the groundwater collection network although these levels remained low throughout the whole treatment process measurements were carried out at various stages of treatment which showed removal rates of specific groups of treatment steps during the treatment processes sudden and unexpected increases of microplastic concentrations were observed at two different stages first a concentration spike was noted prior to dune infiltration and secondly a minor spike occurred after activated carbon filtration at the moment it is not clear whether the increase in mp after filtration over activated carbon and before dune infiltration is structural and significant and further analyses on these treatment points is suggested the current data are insufficient to define a probable cause for increase if structurally finding out the cause is a recommendation all water samples taken in the distribution network at private homes show a higher concentration of mp compared to the treated water prior to distribution however this increase appears to be minor and the actual drinking water contains less than 2 mp l regardless it is not clear if there are actually more mp in samples taken at household taps or if microplastics are introduced during the sampling event the composition of microplastics e g colour type of plastic is unchanged during water treatment as mp properties do not change statistically significantly during the purification process only changes in the concentration of mp and fibres were observed by far the largest group of mp between 20 and 500 µm are particle shaped opposed to fibres in fact fibres constitute only a small fraction in this size range 1 5 however the larger the mp the more the ratio between particles and fibres shifts in favour of the fibres fibres are almost completely absent after the first treatment step in any treatment on average the most abundant plastic types found are polyamide pa 33 polyethylene terephthalate pet 15 rubbers 10 polyethylene pe 10 and chlorinated polyethylene cpe 7 this study shows like earlier studies that the smaller mp outnumber the larger ones therefore if mp numbers are relevant one must consider to measure the smallest mp possible and if one wants to compare results size ranges should be carefully aligned with ldir the lower size limit is currently about 10 µm with regard to the contribution of tap water to the total intake of mp 20 5000 µm of a person per year it can be concluded that tap water in the netherlands only contributes to a minor extent to the total intake presumably less than 1 however the need to reliably align data between studies is greatly needed as comparing data from different sources is currently unviable due to a lack
