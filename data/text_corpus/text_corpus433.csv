2165,a reduced fresh water supply e g as a consequence of climate change can cause an increased salinization of coastal surface water systems and accurate robust and computationally efficient models

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the study of water availability in complex surface water systems is becoming an increasingly important task for managers of those systems especially when facing changing and uncertain boundary conditions such as climate change changing land use or population growth even regions that are known to have a moderate climate can become vulnerable for water shortages to give an example belgium ranks high in the water stress ranking of the world resources institute hofste et al 2019 as it has a high population density and only few natural water resources when studying the balance between water demand and supply one aspect that cannot be ignored is quality as climate change is expected to have a significant influence on the quality of water resources delpla et al 2009 one of those potentially impacted quality aspects is the increased salinization of surface waters as sea level rise increasing upstream concentrations and reduced runoff volumes can cause an inland motion of salt water bertels and willems 2022a van den brink et al 2019 zwolsman and becker 2012 bonte and zwolsman 2010 mathematical models of these complex systems are crucial tools when studying these potential negative impacts of changing conditions or when developing optimal strategies to mitigate them to assure these models reach a sufficient accuracy knowledge of the dominant physical processes are incorporated in a model either by learning the system s behavior from observations or by applying and solving physical laws that are deemed applicable for the specific case if the objective is to study the system s behavior under new unseen conditions the models need to be robust for those changes in the boundary conditions finally the optimization of management strategies statistical analysis of impacts of adaptation measures or uncertainty analyses typically require large numbers of model runs or long term simulations this requires the models to be sufficiently computationally efficient physics based models use numerical schemes to solve partial differential equations that describe the changes in the state of the modeled system for the specific case of salinization of surface waters the used set of equations is often the one or two dimensional shallow water equations in some cases three dimensional problems are studied for example in complex geometries or when large vertical density gradients can occur e g used by vijverberg et al 2010 a practical application of these detailed models requires making simplifications and assumptions that are not always valid and a set up of those models typically requires large amounts of information and data extensive computational resources can be required when studying large and complex systems which is not practical when performing long term simulations or if many model runs are required for an optimization when designing measures or when performing uncertainty analyses a growth in available data powerful model architectures and training algorithms has led to an increasing use of machine learning ml techniques also in the field of water resources and water quality prediction wu et al 2014 maier et al 2010 a popular group of ml models recurrent neural networks rnn introduces memory in the model structure and they were successfully applied for predicting water quality time series for example aslan et al 2022 used various neural network approaches for a water quality assessment in a coastal area and select standard recurrent neural networks and long short term memory lstm models as best performing lee et al 2022 selected the lstm model as optimal choice for predicting lake water quality these models are typically computationally very efficient and partly meet the typical problem of insufficient knowledge about the modelled system they require however sufficient amounts of training data a major downside of these ml techniques is their black box structure the optimized model internals are not interpretable making the models unreliable for predictions under boundary conditions not present in the training dataset and can even produce physically inconsistent predictions daw et al 2020 the practice of integrating scientific knowledge in ml is gaining popularity in the research community this knowledge can for example refer to governing equations or simulation results of physics based models that are used in the model design or training phase of the ml technique raissi et al 2017 demonstrated the solving of partial differential equations e g governing laws of a model problem by evaluating them in the loss function of a ml model training this approach was referred to as physics informed neural networks pinns other authors have built further upon this concept resulting in many variants of the pinn concept such as cpinn jagtap et al 2020 xpinn jagtap and karniadakis 2021 ppinn meng et al 2020 or the work of berg and nyström 2018 cedillo et al 2022 used pinns to predict the steady state surface water profile in a 1d open channel in both a variety of artificial test cases as for a real mountain river morphology zhang et al 2020 use physics informed lstm networks for modelling nonlinear structures however the application of the pinn concept remains mostly limited to test cases on small spatial and temporal scales scientific knowledge can further be integrated in ml by generating training data with mechanistic models either for optimally initializing the trainable ml model parameters willard et al 2022 or to use the ml model as a computationally efficient emulator or metamodel e g bjerre et al 2022 maxwell et al 2021 soriano et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 starn et al 2021 another approach to integrate knowledge in the ml model is to adjust the model s architecture to make violations of the physical constraints impossible daw et al 2020 use this approach by integrating depth temperature density relationships when predicting lake temperature profiles hoedt et al 2021 demonstrate an adapted lstm type model architecture for predicting rainfall runoff their model specifically enforces the conservation of mass or another conservative quantity which is a property of many physical systems as the physical constraints are problem specific these types of physics informed ml architectures are not always readily applicable for other cases no applications of physics informed ml on a realistic scale for the study of pollutant transport or salinity of surface water can be found in the literature to the best knowledge of the authors the presented work aims to contribute to this literature by proposing a novel lstm based model architecture that uses the principle of mass conservation for predicting pollutant transport in surface water systems and test it for a real case problem the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 the basic principles of rnn and lstm models are briefly described together with a new lstm based model architecture that is specifically designed for modelling pollutant transport in surface water this section further presents the case studies that are used for testing the proposed method section 3 presents and discusses the simulation results of the various models that are described and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 methods 2 1 recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm models a basic artificial neural network ann contains multiple connected layers that each transform an input vector x to a hidden state our output in case of the final layer vector h by means of a weight matrix w a bias vector b and an activation function act see eq 1 1 h f x a c t w x b multiple layers are combined in a multilayer perceptron and training of the model comes down to finding optimal values for the weights and biases using suitable optimization techniques these feedforward neural networks were used successfully for water quality modelling see for example keupers et al 2015 or antanasijević et al 2014 as a way to introduce memory in a neural network recurrent neural networks rnn introduce a feedback mechanism that sends the output state h of a layer back to its input for the next evaluation rumelhart et al 1986 this allows to take the history of previous inputs into account for the following predictions and to simulate dynamic behavior of a system a standard rnn can be described by adjusting eq 1 for a hidden layer into eq 2 2 h t f x t h t 1 a c t w 1 x t w 2 h t 1 b standard rnn s are used for a variety of tasks including water quality modelling chen et al 2020 but can be hard to train due to phenomena such as the vanishing and exploding gradient pascanu et al 2013 the lstm model was introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it adds an internal memory state c in the rnn structure as well as a series of gates that control the flow and storage of information to overcome the mentioned issues and store information for many more time steps or evaluations than the standard form of rnn these gates eqs 3 to 5 are dependent on the inputs and previous outputs of the layer similarly as for eq 2 3 i t σ w i 1 x t w i 2 h t 1 b i 4 f t σ w f 1 x t w f 2 h t 1 b f 5 o t σ w o 1 x t w o 2 h t 1 b o with f t i t and o t the forget input and output gates respectively gers et al 2000 σ represents the use of the sigmoid function as activation function these gates are used to update the cell state c to optimally store useful information for next time steps while removing redundant information 6 c t f t c t 1 i t f x t h t 1 the operator denotes the element wise multiplication lstm models were applied successfully in a wide variety of fields including water quality studies e g by aslan et al 2022 lee et al 2022 tran et al 2022 and yang and zhang 2019 2 2 pt lstm the lstm model architecture and information storage principle was adapted by hoedt et al 2021 to model systems in which conservation of mass or other quantities is an essential property as example they describe amongst others traffic and hydrological systems in the latter water can enter the system as precipitation and leave it as evapotranspiration or rainfall runoff at the outlet of the considered area this principle of mass conservation is enforced in the model firstly by assigning a unit of mass or the conserved quantity to the internal memory state c t making it physically interpretable the layer s inputs are divided in inputs x t with that same unit and auxiliary inputs that influence the behavior of the control gates finally mass present in the system is redistributed internally or can leave the system which is controlled using gates and redistribution matrices that enforce mass conservation their proposed architecture model is named mass conserving lstm or mc lstm the key equations of the mc lstm concept are the following 7 m t o t t r t c t 1 i t x t 8 c t 1 o t m t o t t 9 h t o t m t o t t eq 7 represents the redistribution of the internal mass and the addition of external mass that enters the system mass is conserved as the redistribution matrix r t and input gate i t are column normalized this total mass in the system is in the following step divided in a fraction c t which remains in the system eq 8 and a fraction h t which leaves the system eq 9 the redistribution matrix and control gates are learned during the training phase and can be chosen as either constant or dependent on the internal mass distribution and auxiliary input variables this concept of introducing knowledge of the system by enforcing mass conservation of inputs and internal variables in a lstm cell like architecture was built upon further by bertels and willems 2022b in the pollutant transport lstm or pt lstm it can be interpreted as a combination of two mc lstm cells with the first v t representing the water volume in the system and the second m t the mass of a conservative pollutant the total water and pollutant mass in every evaluation is calculated by redistributing the mass remaining from the previous time step by multiplication with the left stochastic redistribution matrices r v t and r m t see eqs 10 and 11 at the same time mass additions x v i n t and x m i n t and extractions x v o u t t and x m o u t t from known boundary conditions are accounted for making use of input and output gates i and o respectively in the original version of the pt lstm cell i and o were identical for both the water and pollutant mass exchanges to allow for additions of mass without net exchange of water e g due to density currents at open doors of lock chambers as is the case in the case studies of this paper a separate i and o for water and mass are proposed eqs 10 and 11 the output of the model cell is a vector h t of pollutant concentrations calculated as the weighted average of the internal cell concentrations eqs 12 and 13 10 v t r v t v t 1 i v x v i n t o v x v o u t t 11 m t r m t m t 1 i m x m i n t o m x m o u t t 12 c t m t v t 1 13 h t s c c t the softmax operator is applied column wise to normalize the redistribution and gate matrices and row wise for normalizing the weighing matrix s c in the presented version of the pt lstm cell the input and output gates as well as s c are chosen as constant and learned during training while the redistribution matrices are dependent on the internal mass distribution and the value of the mass additions and extractions 14 r v t s o f t m a x w v v t 1 v t 1 w v i n x v i n t w v o u t x v o u t t b v with trainable weights and biases w v w v i n w v o u t and b v a similar equation is used for the calculation of r m t the full structure of the pt lstm cell is shown in fig 1 2 3 description of case studies the model is demonstrated for two shipping canals and port areas in the flanders region of belgium the ghent terneuzen canal and the port area of antwerp the ghent terneuzen canal managed by north sea port connects the city of ghent in belgium with the scheldt tidal river at terneuzen in the netherlands fig 2 and fig 3 north sea port is the 10th largest european sea port for freight traffic north sea port 2022 and is a major economic actor in the region the ghent terneuzen canal has a length of 32 km a width of roughly 200 m and a water depth around 13 5 m the upstream water supply is provided by the lys and scheldt rivers mainly through the evergem weir and lock complex and additionally through a number of smaller shipping locks and gates in the city centre of ghent at the downstream boundary three tidal locks are capable of transferring ships with a draught of up to 12 5 m and a capacity of over 5000 shipping containers to the scheldt the locks are equipped with gates to evacuate excess water in the canal during wet periods in dry periods those gates are used to prevent salt water from intruding upstream in the canal an international treaty with the netherlands states that belgium has to guarantee a minimal supply of fresh water to the canal of 13 m3 s averaged over two months as to reduce the possible salinization of the canal this treaty is therefore a boundary condition preventing excess salt concentrations in the canal salinity in the canal is monitored by the flanders environment agency flanders environment agency 2022 in the belgian southern section of the canal and by rijkswaterstaat rws 2022 in the dutch section all data driven models are trained for predicting the salinity at four selected locations indicated in fig 3 this selection aims to represent the concentration gradient from the tidal locks to the ghent area that exists in the canal the antwerp port area connects the scheldt river with the campine canals a network of navigable waterways between liège and antwerp bridging the meuse and scheldt river basins see fig 2 a more in depth description of this area is given in bertels and willems 2022a the water supply to the network is provided by the meuse river through a number of weirs and shipping locks in the area between liège and maastricht as the meuse is a rain fed river its discharge is highly variable ward et al 2008 shipping traffic along the albert canal with six locks to overcome a height difference of 56 m in total controls the water transfers from the meuse to the port area this is the main fresh water source for the port area a secondary source of fresh water is the connection with the artificial zoommeer lake in the north where a pumping station functions to prevent salinization of the lake furthermore five tidal locks connect the docks to the scheldt and are equipped with bypass channels to drain excess water when the water levels rise or to supply the docks with salt water when the levels drop this interaction with the tidal river causes a high chloride concentration in the port area these concentrations are however not uniform but are characterized by a rather large gradient due to the docks large and complex area four locations in the dock area indicated in fig 4 are selected as target locations for demonstrating the proposed modelling techniques a treaty with the netherlands regulates the maximum water supply of the campine canals during dry periods the reason is because the meuse river is not only supplying the campine canals in flanders but also acts as a drinking water production source for the netherlands and has an important ecological function the canal manager in flanders installed hydropower stations that can be used as pumping stations at the lock complexes to comply with the treaty these stations are used to pump water back upstream in times of drought but as a consequence transfer salt water from the docks to higher canal reaches as the albert canal the main channel of the campine canal network is a major drinking water source for the region flanders environment agency 2019 a good understanding through monitoring and modelling of this intruding salt wedge is of high importance 2 4 mass balance model of canals the discharges in the canal networks are modelled using a conceptual mass balance model this model uses the principle of a division of the area in storage cells and an explicit closing of the continuity equation eq 15 to evaluate the water exchange between cells in every time step 15 d s i dt i i t s q i t s this equation describes the rate of change of the volume s i stored in cell i due to incoming i i and outgoing o i water which are both dependent on the state of the system s part of these water additions extractions or exchanges between reservoirs are measured are based on permits for water usage or are calculated using registrations of ship traffic the remainder is calculated in the model under the assumption that the canal is operated to maintain a water level between defined minimum and maximum levels that allow shipping traffic and assure stability of the banks the upstream boundary condition of the model is the observed discharge in the scheldt and lyse rivers upstream of ghent and the meuse river upstream of liège for the two cases respectively the model is validated using discharge observations throughout the canal network more details on this conceptual mass balance model can be found in bertels and willems 2022a 2 5 physics based model chloride concentrations salinity or conductivity observations are only scarcely available in the study areas to rigorously test the proposed method and compare them with the reference models training and validation data is generated using physics based models for the pollutant transport in the canals and docks for the ghent terneuzen canal the one dimensional shallow water equations and the advection dispersion equation are solved in a finite volume method fvm scheme this method is identical to the pollutant transport model described in bertels and willems 2022a the main source of salt water in the canal is the exchange at the three tidal locks at terneuzen a salt intrusion module is developed that takes the various operational phases of locks into account in order to calculate the mass of salt entering or leaving the canal these phases in one cycle are a levelling of the lock chamber to the current sea level the opening of the lock gate at the sea side the entering and leaving of ships the closing of the gate the levelling the chamber to the water level of the canal the opening of the gates at the canal side the entering and leaving of ships and again the closing of the gate using the known water volumes exchanged between canal lock chamber and sea combined with known or calculated salt concentrations the salinity of the chamber can be calculated after each phase assuming a perfect and instant mixture the exchange of water as a consequence of density differences is calculated using the method proposed by vrijburgt and glerum 2000 the exchange fraction u is defined as the fraction of the lock chamber volume that is exchanged for water of the canal or sea and is calculated as a function of the effective time t open that the chamber door is opened and the theoretical time for a full exchange t le based on the initial velocity c of the density current 16 u tanh η t open t le 17 t le 2 l c 18 c 1 2 g δ ρ ρ h in these equations l represents the length of the lock chamber h its height and δ ρ is the density difference between the lock chamber and the canal or the scheldt the correction factor η allows to take intrusion reduction measures such as bubble screens into account the more complex area of the antwerp docks is modelled using a combined 1d 2d fvm scheme in this scheme the unstructured grid scheme proposed by begnudelli and sanders 2006 is applied for the docks while the same 1d scheme as used for the ghent terneuzen canal is used for the connected canal reaches a local time stepping lts scheme sanders 2008 was applied to reduce the computational effort 2 6 ml model set up for case studies separate pt lstm lstm and rnn model are constructed for the ghent terneuzen and antwerp port cases the boundary conditions for both the pt lstm and reference models are constituted from the water and salt mass in and outflows of the modelled systems a list of these predictors for both cases is given in the supplementary material the predictands of the models are the salinity time series for the four selected locations of each case study all inputs and targets for the reference models are z score normalized using the mean values and standard deviation of the features for the training period additional tests were performed with median normalization by scaling the features by the median of the training period and a normalization of all input and target data to the 0 8 0 8 interval based on the maximum absolute value of the features for the training period no normalization was used for the input features and target data of the pt lstm models as its inputs and output values all have a unit of water or pollutant mass all models are trained with a hidden cell state size of 10 15 and 20 elements of which the best performing variant is selected in case only small differences are found the smallest number is selected the adam optimizer algorithm kingma and ba 2014 is used with the mean squared error mse of the predicted salinity to the target salinity as the loss function a table s1 summarizing the model set up and calibration parameters is provided in the supplementary material all ml models which include the pt lstm and the reference rnn and lstm models are programmed in the julia programming language bezanson et al 2017 and training is performed using the tools available in the flux library for machine learning innes 2018 innes et al 2018 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 given by eq 19 is used as an evaluation metric for the predicted salinity s time series of simulated salinity are presented additionally to allow for a visual inspection of the model results 19 nse 1 i 1 n s i o b s e r v e d s i p r e d i c t e d 2 i 1 n s i o b s e r v e d mean s i o b s e r v e d 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 physics based models the salinity in the ghent terneuzen canal simulated using the salt intrusion module and finite volume scheme is compared with quasi continuous dutch section and monthly belgian section observations a good correspondence between model and observations is found with a pearson correlation varying between 0 95 and 0 98 and nse values between 0 73 and 0 95 at the different locations indicating that both the concentration gradient as the incoming mass flux of salt are approximated well simulated and observed values are presented in fig 5 it can be concluded that using these simulation results for training of the data driven models instead of actual observations is equivalent in terms of applicability for the antwerp port area only few observations are available with a low temporal resolution calibration and validation of the physics based pollutant transport model for the albert canal section of the area was performed by bertels and willems 2022a using bi daily observations along the reach for the summer period of 2019 and 2020 for the dock section and the northern canal reach a comparison between observations and simulated salinity is made in fig 6 this area is more complex and the large uncertainty in most of the boundary conditions can explain in part the deviation between observations and model results to give two examples the usage of some locks and pumping stations are registered only monthly and data of industrial water usage and discharges are only available on a yearly resolution this lower model performance should be kept in mind when evaluating the pt lstm and reference models for the antwerp port area in the remainder of the text performance is for these models evaluated as the ability of the ml model to emulate the physically based model results rather than a good representation of the observed behaviour in the dock area 3 2 evaluation of pt lstm model 3 2 1 ghent terneuzen canal the models are trained using discharge and salinity data for the years 2017 and 2018 and are tested using the data for the year 2019 nse values for the four locations in the canal are presented in table 1 all trained models achieve good results when evaluated for the training period as indicated by the nse values approaching 1 both the pt lstm and lstm models perform slightly better indicating that the more simple rnn model structure is perhaps not fully capable of capturing the behaviour of the transport of salt water in the canal the difference in model performance increases when evaluating it for the independent testing period while the pt lstm achieves a very similar performance with the average nse value for the four locations dropping with only 0 0168 the lstm models drop in average nse performance with 0 344 and the rnn models even with 0 557 the latter methods thus achieve a poor to moderate performance the pt lstm model is clearly more robust note however that all reference models succeed to predict the course of the concentration change well without any physical inconsistency negative values see the comparison in fig 7 the reference models and more specifically the lstm model can still be useful for predictions under circumstances similar to that of the training period this is consistent with the conclusions of tran et al 2022 and yang and zhang 2019 who used lstm based networks to predict salinity in river deltas and selected them as best performing amongst a selection of other ml model approaches to test the proposed model s performance under limited training data availability new models were trained with a reduced dataset in a first step only inputs and targets for 2017 were used in a second step the training data was further reduced to only the first six months of 2017 this has as a consequence that the decreasing behaviour of the salinity occurring in the wetter periods is no longer part of the training set when evaluated for the test period 2019 the mean nse value for the different locations for the pt lstm lstm and rnn models equal 0 98 0 71 and 0 62 respectively for the first data reduction step and 0 91 0 55 and 0 29 for the second step while this analysis does not allow to formulate general statements concerning the minimum data requirements for training the pt lstm and reference models it suggests that the proposed method seems robust for training with limited data sources 3 2 2 port of antwerp the correlation matrix of the predictors and predictands for the poa case fig s2 in the supplementary material shows some expected results concerning the relation between the target salinity and the inflow of fresh and salt water at the area s boundary see description in the supplementary material however this matrix only provides insight in possible linear relations between predictors and predictands while it is possible that strongly non linear relations between these exist to further investigate other relations one could apply for example methods that are used to select optimal inputs predictors in machine learning applications an example of such a technique is the partial mutual information pmi algorithm bowden et al 2005 sharma 2000 a popular approach to interpret model predictions is shap lundberg and lee 2017 a powerful method that enables the evaluation of the model s decisions and compare it with for example expert knowledge the results for the port of antwerp case show strong differences in salinity variations at the four locations fig 8 locations a and b show a clear seasonal pattern similar to the one in the scheldt river for the salinity at location c located at the canal section connecting the docks with the zoommeer lake no such yearly variation is observed but the salinity shows some more sudden peak periods the salinity at location d the connection between the docks and the albert canal shows a similar seasonal variation but with additionally a distinct weekly pattern this is explained by the reduction of shipping traffic in the canal in weekends and was also noticed in a measuring campaign by the drinking water production company during the summers of 2019 and 2020 bertels and willems 2022a similar as for the ghent terneuzen canal case the data in 2017 and 2018 were used as training data and the data in 2019 and part of 2020 for testing the models all models perform well when evaluated for the training period with all nse values higher than 0 9 except for the rnn trained at location c table 2 the model evaluation for the independent testing period shows that the pt lstm models indicate a much better robustness the nse values remain high except for location c where the nse drops significantly however it remains positive indicating a better model performance than simply using the average value as model prediction this is not the case for the reference models where a negative nse value is found for the testing period at location c indicating that the models have no predicting capabilities for this location at the other locations the reference models perform much worse than for the training period similarly as for the ghent terneuzen canal case 3 3 physical interpretation of the internal state variables and model parameters the internal state variables of the pt lstm are physically interpretable in the sense that they are attributed a unit of water or pollutant mass and represent the distribution of this mass throughout the modelled system the parameters on the other hand are interpreted as the redistribution of internal and incoming mass whose behavior is learned from the training data these concepts are briefly illustrated for the port of antwerp case in fig s3 in the supplementary material the internally stored salinity the c t vector of the trained pt lstm model for the antwerp docks are plotted for 4 selected elements on the right hand size of the figure the transposed s c matrix is visualized to illustrate how the salinity at the target locations is constructed from a linear combination of the internal concentrations such an analysis can be useful in reconstructing the patterns that the model has learned from the data during training another attempt to visualize the learned behavior of the modelled system is made by visualizing the temporal mean value of the r m matrix responsible for the internal redistribution of pollutant mass in each time step given in fig s4 of the supplementary material this figure allows to deduce how mass stored in the system is transferred between elements of the internal memory state vectors a next step could be to link this interpretation of the model s internals to useful physical variables that are currently not part of the model output but are known to play a role in the physical phenomena that are being studied for example discharges in the dock area are not explicitly part of the model state variables but could potentially be linked to the r v matrix which represents a redistribution of water in the system an attempt to conduct such an analysis is presented in the recent work by lees et al 2022 a method that could also be extended to the reference models as the authors present their technique for standard lstm models in a context of hydrological modelling the authors attempt to interpret the internal state of the trained lstm model by extracting it for all locations and time steps and fitting a single linear model called probe to known hydrological variables such as soil moisture and snow depth to see whether these variables are related to this internal state and the model has learned to take these physical processes into account when making discharge predictions a similar analysis might be conducted for the cases in this work for example by linking the internal state variables to known discharges note that this concept of physical interpretation of the model s internals differs somewhat from the common usage of the term interpretability in the machine learning literature where interpretability is focused more on the idea that humans are able to understand the rationale behind model predictions başağaoğlu et al 2022 as for example the objective in the shap analysis mentioned above 3 4 scenario analysis the robustness of the trained model is further tested by performing a scenario analysis for the two cases the upstream river flow rate is reduced and the mass balance models of the canal networks are used to evaluate the discharges at the boundaries this reduction of discharge in the meuse corresponds with a climate change scenario for a high impact on drought projected for the year 2050 as presented in vansteenkiste et al 2009 in the case of the ghent terneuzen canal the discharge of the scheldt and lys rivers were reduced by a factor of 0 5 the changed boundary conditions are used in the trained models to re calculate the chloride concentrations the goal is not to study the impact under a realistic climate change scenario but rather to investigate how the trained models cope with changes in these boundary conditions as compared to the available training data the physics based models are used to simulate reference concentrations the use of neural network models for conditions not present in the training range typically leads to poor results barnard and wessels 1992 as the models are not designed for extrapolation this allows therefore to better show the benefits of the proposed pt lstm technique for application in for example climate change impact studies for the ghent terneuzen canal case the simulated concentrations are plotted in figs 9 11 the pt lstm model succeeds to approach the physics based simulation results well even though the estimated concentrations are significantly larger than in the training dataset nse values higher than 0 95 are obtained for all locations table 3 scenario 1 for the lstm and rnn models lower nse values are obtained but higher than 0 7 so these are fairly good results based on these values it can be concluded that the reference models are still applicable for a simple scenario analysis such as the one presented here however when inspecting the simulation results in fig 9 it is clear that the models fail in predicting concentrations higher than the maximum of the training data and they are not useful for studying the water quality when good estimations of the absolute concentration values are required in these tests all mass exchanges of the modelled surface water systems both water and salt were known or calculated using the physics based model and used as boundary conditions in the evaluation of the data driven approaches in a true scenario analysis however not all of those would be known more specifically the salt exchanges at the tidal locks due to density currents are dependent on the unknown simulated concentrations in the canal to test the applicability of the models the experiment was repeated with the integration of the dedicated salt intrusion module for the tidal locks by iterating between the data driven models and this module it is possible to integrate the calculation of the impact of density currents with the salt water transport models and obtain fully independent models that can perform a true scenario analysis the density current model was initialized with the average concentration for the reference conditions and 10 iterations were found to be sufficient to achieve a negligible change in predicted concentrations the results are presented in table 3 as scenario 2 compared to the initial model performance the pt lstm model has a drop in nse value but still achieves good results for all locations the reference models on the contrary seem to lose most of their predictive capabilities and are therefore not suited to be used in a true scenario analysis the results of the analysis for the antwerp case differ more per location the nse values are given in table 4 and the simulated time series are shown in figs 12 and 13 the salinity at location a closely follows that of the scheldt river as the intensive shipping traffic at the tidal locks causes a large exchange of salt water as only the upstream discharge was decreased in the scenario and not this concentration boundary condition the salinity in the docks as calculated using the physics based model does not differ much from its original values both the pt lstm and the reference models are able to simulate the salinity in the docks rather well at location b the salinity still follows the seasonal course of the scheldt but the peak values that typically occur around fall are higher than under normal conditions as for the first case the data driven reference models fail in predicting these increased values while the pt lstm model performs better no significant changes in average salinity are calculated for location c as it is mainly dependent on the supply of fresh water from the zoommeer lake both the pt lstm and lstm reference model overestimate the impact that an increased average salinity over the total dock area has on the salinity at this location while the rnn model is more insensitive for this change and achieves the best performance although it still performs rather poor finally at location 4 the results are more consistent with that of the ghent terneuzen case with an acceptable performance for the pt lstm model and underestimations of the salinity by the reference models 3 5 limitations and future work the effect of altering or using a different optimizer algorithm for training the pt lstm and reference models was not studied in this work further work is needed to explore the potential benefits of choosing the hyperparameters in more detail such as the hidden cell state size the batch size and number of epochs of training etc in addition there exists a wide variety of other ml models that have been implemented successfully for studying water quality tung and yaseen 2020 common examples include support vector machines deep neural networks or tree based techniques such as random forests or xgboost e g bedi et al 2020 sahour et al 2020 heddam and kisi 2018 a comparison of the pt lstm model with these and other techniques could provide further insight in the new method s advantages and disadvantages for example tree based algorithms can easily facilitate model interpretability which can improve the understanding of the complex system that is modelled training the ml models using data that is generated with a physics based model introduces additional scientific knowledge as mentioned in the introduction section this study did not investigate further the model s performance for testing conditions due to the very limited number of available observations a more detailed analysis of the minimum data requirements to achieve good model performance is therefore suggested as future work spatial transferability of the ml models was not studied each model was trained for a specific area as pollutant transport in the surface water systems considered depends on the specific layout boundary conditions and location of the target locations it would not be straightforward to train a general model and apply it for a previously unseen case temporal transferability of the ml models has been tested but to a limited extend a more rigorous analysis could be inspired on the method proposed by bjerre et al 2022 who train metamodels that predict drainage fractions for different subdomains and attempt to quantify how well the model can be transferred to other subdomains by evaluating the distance between input features for the training and new domains weighed according to input feature importance additions and extractions of water or pollutant mass are for the moment required as known boundary conditions for the pt lstm model while those can be very uncertain for complex or poorly observed cases overestimations of mass additions can probably be handled by the model structure as it might learn to store this excess mass in a trash cell that is not incorporated in the calculation of the output concentrations furthermore the computational efficiency of the pt lstm model allows to study the share of uncertainty of the model inputs in the total output concentration uncertainty given that the model was trained using a reliable physics based model of the study area the current version of the pt lstm model architecture is limited to the modelling of transport of conservative pollutants an application for multiple and possibly interacting water quality indicators such as dissolved oxygen and organic material might be established by coupling multiple pt lstm cells using known reaction rates 4 conclusions increasing trends such as population growth more shipping traffic and climate change including sea level rise may put our water resources under severe stress accurate robust and efficient modelling tools will be crucial to assess the impacts of potential threats on the future availability of good quality water in the optimization of management strategies and the statistical analysis of impacts of changing conditions and mitigation measures while machine learning ml techniques are gaining popularity as computationally very efficient alternatives or surrogates for physics based approaches they often lack a physically interpretable structure and can produce unreliable predictions for conditions not present in the training dataset this study aims to contribute to the applicability of ml techniques in scenario analyses by presenting a novel physics informed model architecture for describing transport of conservative pollutants in surface water systems named pt lstm the model is inspired on the long short term memory lstm architecture and explicitly enforces the conservation of water and pollutant mass the aim is to present a technique that can benefit from the vast amount of available training techniques and the efficient model evaluation of ml models while being more robust for use under uncertain and new boundary conditions than traditional ml approaches the proposed model is demonstrated for the case of salinization of shipping canals and port areas in coastal regions due to the possible decrease of fresh water supply the model was trained and compared with reference models standard recurrent neural networks rnn and lstm models for two relevant cases in belgium and consistently outperforms these reference techniques when evaluated for an independent dataset see tables 1 4 furthermore the technique shows potential for use in scenario analyses demonstrated by strongly changing the boundary conditions for the modelled systems and comparing the simulation results with the results of a detailed physics based reference model while the rnn and lstm reference models fail in predicting higher salinity values than present in the training dataset the proposed pt lstm model manages to accurately predict the salinity for most test locations figs 9 13 suggestions for future work include a further optimization of the model s hyperparameters and an expansion of the set of reference models used to place the proposed technique s performance in context also an adaptation of the technique to suit the modelling of non conservative pollutants could prove interesting it is to the best knowledge of the authors the first demonstration of a physics informed ml type model for modelling pollutant transport in surface water on a realistic scale its basic principles could perhaps be applied in other related model architectures or the model itself

2165,a reduced fresh water supply e g as a consequence of climate change can cause an increased salinization of coastal surface water systems and accurate robust and computationally efficient models are needed to study these phenomena while machine learning ml techniques are rapidly gaining popularity their application is not straightforward and their black box structure is typically not interpretable making the models unreliable for predictions under boundary conditions that differ from the training dataset this paper presents a new ml model architecture based on the lstm cell the principle of mass conservation is enforced in the model s architecture to introduce scientific knowledge with the goal of increasing the technique s robustness the model is compared with established reference neural networks for predicting salinization of navigable waterways in belgium training data are generated with a detailed physics based solute transport model the proposed model shows higher accuracy under new conditions when compared to the reference models keywords physics informed machine learning neural networks long short term memory solute transport climate change salt intrusion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the study of water availability in complex surface water systems is becoming an increasingly important task for managers of those systems especially when facing changing and uncertain boundary conditions such as climate change changing land use or population growth even regions that are known to have a moderate climate can become vulnerable for water shortages to give an example belgium ranks high in the water stress ranking of the world resources institute hofste et al 2019 as it has a high population density and only few natural water resources when studying the balance between water demand and supply one aspect that cannot be ignored is quality as climate change is expected to have a significant influence on the quality of water resources delpla et al 2009 one of those potentially impacted quality aspects is the increased salinization of surface waters as sea level rise increasing upstream concentrations and reduced runoff volumes can cause an inland motion of salt water bertels and willems 2022a van den brink et al 2019 zwolsman and becker 2012 bonte and zwolsman 2010 mathematical models of these complex systems are crucial tools when studying these potential negative impacts of changing conditions or when developing optimal strategies to mitigate them to assure these models reach a sufficient accuracy knowledge of the dominant physical processes are incorporated in a model either by learning the system s behavior from observations or by applying and solving physical laws that are deemed applicable for the specific case if the objective is to study the system s behavior under new unseen conditions the models need to be robust for those changes in the boundary conditions finally the optimization of management strategies statistical analysis of impacts of adaptation measures or uncertainty analyses typically require large numbers of model runs or long term simulations this requires the models to be sufficiently computationally efficient physics based models use numerical schemes to solve partial differential equations that describe the changes in the state of the modeled system for the specific case of salinization of surface waters the used set of equations is often the one or two dimensional shallow water equations in some cases three dimensional problems are studied for example in complex geometries or when large vertical density gradients can occur e g used by vijverberg et al 2010 a practical application of these detailed models requires making simplifications and assumptions that are not always valid and a set up of those models typically requires large amounts of information and data extensive computational resources can be required when studying large and complex systems which is not practical when performing long term simulations or if many model runs are required for an optimization when designing measures or when performing uncertainty analyses a growth in available data powerful model architectures and training algorithms has led to an increasing use of machine learning ml techniques also in the field of water resources and water quality prediction wu et al 2014 maier et al 2010 a popular group of ml models recurrent neural networks rnn introduces memory in the model structure and they were successfully applied for predicting water quality time series for example aslan et al 2022 used various neural network approaches for a water quality assessment in a coastal area and select standard recurrent neural networks and long short term memory lstm models as best performing lee et al 2022 selected the lstm model as optimal choice for predicting lake water quality these models are typically computationally very efficient and partly meet the typical problem of insufficient knowledge about the modelled system they require however sufficient amounts of training data a major downside of these ml techniques is their black box structure the optimized model internals are not interpretable making the models unreliable for predictions under boundary conditions not present in the training dataset and can even produce physically inconsistent predictions daw et al 2020 the practice of integrating scientific knowledge in ml is gaining popularity in the research community this knowledge can for example refer to governing equations or simulation results of physics based models that are used in the model design or training phase of the ml technique raissi et al 2017 demonstrated the solving of partial differential equations e g governing laws of a model problem by evaluating them in the loss function of a ml model training this approach was referred to as physics informed neural networks pinns other authors have built further upon this concept resulting in many variants of the pinn concept such as cpinn jagtap et al 2020 xpinn jagtap and karniadakis 2021 ppinn meng et al 2020 or the work of berg and nyström 2018 cedillo et al 2022 used pinns to predict the steady state surface water profile in a 1d open channel in both a variety of artificial test cases as for a real mountain river morphology zhang et al 2020 use physics informed lstm networks for modelling nonlinear structures however the application of the pinn concept remains mostly limited to test cases on small spatial and temporal scales scientific knowledge can further be integrated in ml by generating training data with mechanistic models either for optimally initializing the trainable ml model parameters willard et al 2022 or to use the ml model as a computationally efficient emulator or metamodel e g bjerre et al 2022 maxwell et al 2021 soriano et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 starn et al 2021 another approach to integrate knowledge in the ml model is to adjust the model s architecture to make violations of the physical constraints impossible daw et al 2020 use this approach by integrating depth temperature density relationships when predicting lake temperature profiles hoedt et al 2021 demonstrate an adapted lstm type model architecture for predicting rainfall runoff their model specifically enforces the conservation of mass or another conservative quantity which is a property of many physical systems as the physical constraints are problem specific these types of physics informed ml architectures are not always readily applicable for other cases no applications of physics informed ml on a realistic scale for the study of pollutant transport or salinity of surface water can be found in the literature to the best knowledge of the authors the presented work aims to contribute to this literature by proposing a novel lstm based model architecture that uses the principle of mass conservation for predicting pollutant transport in surface water systems and test it for a real case problem the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 the basic principles of rnn and lstm models are briefly described together with a new lstm based model architecture that is specifically designed for modelling pollutant transport in surface water this section further presents the case studies that are used for testing the proposed method section 3 presents and discusses the simulation results of the various models that are described and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 methods 2 1 recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm models a basic artificial neural network ann contains multiple connected layers that each transform an input vector x to a hidden state our output in case of the final layer vector h by means of a weight matrix w a bias vector b and an activation function act see eq 1 1 h f x a c t w x b multiple layers are combined in a multilayer perceptron and training of the model comes down to finding optimal values for the weights and biases using suitable optimization techniques these feedforward neural networks were used successfully for water quality modelling see for example keupers et al 2015 or antanasijević et al 2014 as a way to introduce memory in a neural network recurrent neural networks rnn introduce a feedback mechanism that sends the output state h of a layer back to its input for the next evaluation rumelhart et al 1986 this allows to take the history of previous inputs into account for the following predictions and to simulate dynamic behavior of a system a standard rnn can be described by adjusting eq 1 for a hidden layer into eq 2 2 h t f x t h t 1 a c t w 1 x t w 2 h t 1 b standard rnn s are used for a variety of tasks including water quality modelling chen et al 2020 but can be hard to train due to phenomena such as the vanishing and exploding gradient pascanu et al 2013 the lstm model was introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it adds an internal memory state c in the rnn structure as well as a series of gates that control the flow and storage of information to overcome the mentioned issues and store information for many more time steps or evaluations than the standard form of rnn these gates eqs 3 to 5 are dependent on the inputs and previous outputs of the layer similarly as for eq 2 3 i t σ w i 1 x t w i 2 h t 1 b i 4 f t σ w f 1 x t w f 2 h t 1 b f 5 o t σ w o 1 x t w o 2 h t 1 b o with f t i t and o t the forget input and output gates respectively gers et al 2000 σ represents the use of the sigmoid function as activation function these gates are used to update the cell state c to optimally store useful information for next time steps while removing redundant information 6 c t f t c t 1 i t f x t h t 1 the operator denotes the element wise multiplication lstm models were applied successfully in a wide variety of fields including water quality studies e g by aslan et al 2022 lee et al 2022 tran et al 2022 and yang and zhang 2019 2 2 pt lstm the lstm model architecture and information storage principle was adapted by hoedt et al 2021 to model systems in which conservation of mass or other quantities is an essential property as example they describe amongst others traffic and hydrological systems in the latter water can enter the system as precipitation and leave it as evapotranspiration or rainfall runoff at the outlet of the considered area this principle of mass conservation is enforced in the model firstly by assigning a unit of mass or the conserved quantity to the internal memory state c t making it physically interpretable the layer s inputs are divided in inputs x t with that same unit and auxiliary inputs that influence the behavior of the control gates finally mass present in the system is redistributed internally or can leave the system which is controlled using gates and redistribution matrices that enforce mass conservation their proposed architecture model is named mass conserving lstm or mc lstm the key equations of the mc lstm concept are the following 7 m t o t t r t c t 1 i t x t 8 c t 1 o t m t o t t 9 h t o t m t o t t eq 7 represents the redistribution of the internal mass and the addition of external mass that enters the system mass is conserved as the redistribution matrix r t and input gate i t are column normalized this total mass in the system is in the following step divided in a fraction c t which remains in the system eq 8 and a fraction h t which leaves the system eq 9 the redistribution matrix and control gates are learned during the training phase and can be chosen as either constant or dependent on the internal mass distribution and auxiliary input variables this concept of introducing knowledge of the system by enforcing mass conservation of inputs and internal variables in a lstm cell like architecture was built upon further by bertels and willems 2022b in the pollutant transport lstm or pt lstm it can be interpreted as a combination of two mc lstm cells with the first v t representing the water volume in the system and the second m t the mass of a conservative pollutant the total water and pollutant mass in every evaluation is calculated by redistributing the mass remaining from the previous time step by multiplication with the left stochastic redistribution matrices r v t and r m t see eqs 10 and 11 at the same time mass additions x v i n t and x m i n t and extractions x v o u t t and x m o u t t from known boundary conditions are accounted for making use of input and output gates i and o respectively in the original version of the pt lstm cell i and o were identical for both the water and pollutant mass exchanges to allow for additions of mass without net exchange of water e g due to density currents at open doors of lock chambers as is the case in the case studies of this paper a separate i and o for water and mass are proposed eqs 10 and 11 the output of the model cell is a vector h t of pollutant concentrations calculated as the weighted average of the internal cell concentrations eqs 12 and 13 10 v t r v t v t 1 i v x v i n t o v x v o u t t 11 m t r m t m t 1 i m x m i n t o m x m o u t t 12 c t m t v t 1 13 h t s c c t the softmax operator is applied column wise to normalize the redistribution and gate matrices and row wise for normalizing the weighing matrix s c in the presented version of the pt lstm cell the input and output gates as well as s c are chosen as constant and learned during training while the redistribution matrices are dependent on the internal mass distribution and the value of the mass additions and extractions 14 r v t s o f t m a x w v v t 1 v t 1 w v i n x v i n t w v o u t x v o u t t b v with trainable weights and biases w v w v i n w v o u t and b v a similar equation is used for the calculation of r m t the full structure of the pt lstm cell is shown in fig 1 2 3 description of case studies the model is demonstrated for two shipping canals and port areas in the flanders region of belgium the ghent terneuzen canal and the port area of antwerp the ghent terneuzen canal managed by north sea port connects the city of ghent in belgium with the scheldt tidal river at terneuzen in the netherlands fig 2 and fig 3 north sea port is the 10th largest european sea port for freight traffic north sea port 2022 and is a major economic actor in the region the ghent terneuzen canal has a length of 32 km a width of roughly 200 m and a water depth around 13 5 m the upstream water supply is provided by the lys and scheldt rivers mainly through the evergem weir and lock complex and additionally through a number of smaller shipping locks and gates in the city centre of ghent at the downstream boundary three tidal locks are capable of transferring ships with a draught of up to 12 5 m and a capacity of over 5000 shipping containers to the scheldt the locks are equipped with gates to evacuate excess water in the canal during wet periods in dry periods those gates are used to prevent salt water from intruding upstream in the canal an international treaty with the netherlands states that belgium has to guarantee a minimal supply of fresh water to the canal of 13 m3 s averaged over two months as to reduce the possible salinization of the canal this treaty is therefore a boundary condition preventing excess salt concentrations in the canal salinity in the canal is monitored by the flanders environment agency flanders environment agency 2022 in the belgian southern section of the canal and by rijkswaterstaat rws 2022 in the dutch section all data driven models are trained for predicting the salinity at four selected locations indicated in fig 3 this selection aims to represent the concentration gradient from the tidal locks to the ghent area that exists in the canal the antwerp port area connects the scheldt river with the campine canals a network of navigable waterways between liège and antwerp bridging the meuse and scheldt river basins see fig 2 a more in depth description of this area is given in bertels and willems 2022a the water supply to the network is provided by the meuse river through a number of weirs and shipping locks in the area between liège and maastricht as the meuse is a rain fed river its discharge is highly variable ward et al 2008 shipping traffic along the albert canal with six locks to overcome a height difference of 56 m in total controls the water transfers from the meuse to the port area this is the main fresh water source for the port area a secondary source of fresh water is the connection with the artificial zoommeer lake in the north where a pumping station functions to prevent salinization of the lake furthermore five tidal locks connect the docks to the scheldt and are equipped with bypass channels to drain excess water when the water levels rise or to supply the docks with salt water when the levels drop this interaction with the tidal river causes a high chloride concentration in the port area these concentrations are however not uniform but are characterized by a rather large gradient due to the docks large and complex area four locations in the dock area indicated in fig 4 are selected as target locations for demonstrating the proposed modelling techniques a treaty with the netherlands regulates the maximum water supply of the campine canals during dry periods the reason is because the meuse river is not only supplying the campine canals in flanders but also acts as a drinking water production source for the netherlands and has an important ecological function the canal manager in flanders installed hydropower stations that can be used as pumping stations at the lock complexes to comply with the treaty these stations are used to pump water back upstream in times of drought but as a consequence transfer salt water from the docks to higher canal reaches as the albert canal the main channel of the campine canal network is a major drinking water source for the region flanders environment agency 2019 a good understanding through monitoring and modelling of this intruding salt wedge is of high importance 2 4 mass balance model of canals the discharges in the canal networks are modelled using a conceptual mass balance model this model uses the principle of a division of the area in storage cells and an explicit closing of the continuity equation eq 15 to evaluate the water exchange between cells in every time step 15 d s i dt i i t s q i t s this equation describes the rate of change of the volume s i stored in cell i due to incoming i i and outgoing o i water which are both dependent on the state of the system s part of these water additions extractions or exchanges between reservoirs are measured are based on permits for water usage or are calculated using registrations of ship traffic the remainder is calculated in the model under the assumption that the canal is operated to maintain a water level between defined minimum and maximum levels that allow shipping traffic and assure stability of the banks the upstream boundary condition of the model is the observed discharge in the scheldt and lyse rivers upstream of ghent and the meuse river upstream of liège for the two cases respectively the model is validated using discharge observations throughout the canal network more details on this conceptual mass balance model can be found in bertels and willems 2022a 2 5 physics based model chloride concentrations salinity or conductivity observations are only scarcely available in the study areas to rigorously test the proposed method and compare them with the reference models training and validation data is generated using physics based models for the pollutant transport in the canals and docks for the ghent terneuzen canal the one dimensional shallow water equations and the advection dispersion equation are solved in a finite volume method fvm scheme this method is identical to the pollutant transport model described in bertels and willems 2022a the main source of salt water in the canal is the exchange at the three tidal locks at terneuzen a salt intrusion module is developed that takes the various operational phases of locks into account in order to calculate the mass of salt entering or leaving the canal these phases in one cycle are a levelling of the lock chamber to the current sea level the opening of the lock gate at the sea side the entering and leaving of ships the closing of the gate the levelling the chamber to the water level of the canal the opening of the gates at the canal side the entering and leaving of ships and again the closing of the gate using the known water volumes exchanged between canal lock chamber and sea combined with known or calculated salt concentrations the salinity of the chamber can be calculated after each phase assuming a perfect and instant mixture the exchange of water as a consequence of density differences is calculated using the method proposed by vrijburgt and glerum 2000 the exchange fraction u is defined as the fraction of the lock chamber volume that is exchanged for water of the canal or sea and is calculated as a function of the effective time t open that the chamber door is opened and the theoretical time for a full exchange t le based on the initial velocity c of the density current 16 u tanh η t open t le 17 t le 2 l c 18 c 1 2 g δ ρ ρ h in these equations l represents the length of the lock chamber h its height and δ ρ is the density difference between the lock chamber and the canal or the scheldt the correction factor η allows to take intrusion reduction measures such as bubble screens into account the more complex area of the antwerp docks is modelled using a combined 1d 2d fvm scheme in this scheme the unstructured grid scheme proposed by begnudelli and sanders 2006 is applied for the docks while the same 1d scheme as used for the ghent terneuzen canal is used for the connected canal reaches a local time stepping lts scheme sanders 2008 was applied to reduce the computational effort 2 6 ml model set up for case studies separate pt lstm lstm and rnn model are constructed for the ghent terneuzen and antwerp port cases the boundary conditions for both the pt lstm and reference models are constituted from the water and salt mass in and outflows of the modelled systems a list of these predictors for both cases is given in the supplementary material the predictands of the models are the salinity time series for the four selected locations of each case study all inputs and targets for the reference models are z score normalized using the mean values and standard deviation of the features for the training period additional tests were performed with median normalization by scaling the features by the median of the training period and a normalization of all input and target data to the 0 8 0 8 interval based on the maximum absolute value of the features for the training period no normalization was used for the input features and target data of the pt lstm models as its inputs and output values all have a unit of water or pollutant mass all models are trained with a hidden cell state size of 10 15 and 20 elements of which the best performing variant is selected in case only small differences are found the smallest number is selected the adam optimizer algorithm kingma and ba 2014 is used with the mean squared error mse of the predicted salinity to the target salinity as the loss function a table s1 summarizing the model set up and calibration parameters is provided in the supplementary material all ml models which include the pt lstm and the reference rnn and lstm models are programmed in the julia programming language bezanson et al 2017 and training is performed using the tools available in the flux library for machine learning innes 2018 innes et al 2018 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 given by eq 19 is used as an evaluation metric for the predicted salinity s time series of simulated salinity are presented additionally to allow for a visual inspection of the model results 19 nse 1 i 1 n s i o b s e r v e d s i p r e d i c t e d 2 i 1 n s i o b s e r v e d mean s i o b s e r v e d 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 physics based models the salinity in the ghent terneuzen canal simulated using the salt intrusion module and finite volume scheme is compared with quasi continuous dutch section and monthly belgian section observations a good correspondence between model and observations is found with a pearson correlation varying between 0 95 and 0 98 and nse values between 0 73 and 0 95 at the different locations indicating that both the concentration gradient as the incoming mass flux of salt are approximated well simulated and observed values are presented in fig 5 it can be concluded that using these simulation results for training of the data driven models instead of actual observations is equivalent in terms of applicability for the antwerp port area only few observations are available with a low temporal resolution calibration and validation of the physics based pollutant transport model for the albert canal section of the area was performed by bertels and willems 2022a using bi daily observations along the reach for the summer period of 2019 and 2020 for the dock section and the northern canal reach a comparison between observations and simulated salinity is made in fig 6 this area is more complex and the large uncertainty in most of the boundary conditions can explain in part the deviation between observations and model results to give two examples the usage of some locks and pumping stations are registered only monthly and data of industrial water usage and discharges are only available on a yearly resolution this lower model performance should be kept in mind when evaluating the pt lstm and reference models for the antwerp port area in the remainder of the text performance is for these models evaluated as the ability of the ml model to emulate the physically based model results rather than a good representation of the observed behaviour in the dock area 3 2 evaluation of pt lstm model 3 2 1 ghent terneuzen canal the models are trained using discharge and salinity data for the years 2017 and 2018 and are tested using the data for the year 2019 nse values for the four locations in the canal are presented in table 1 all trained models achieve good results when evaluated for the training period as indicated by the nse values approaching 1 both the pt lstm and lstm models perform slightly better indicating that the more simple rnn model structure is perhaps not fully capable of capturing the behaviour of the transport of salt water in the canal the difference in model performance increases when evaluating it for the independent testing period while the pt lstm achieves a very similar performance with the average nse value for the four locations dropping with only 0 0168 the lstm models drop in average nse performance with 0 344 and the rnn models even with 0 557 the latter methods thus achieve a poor to moderate performance the pt lstm model is clearly more robust note however that all reference models succeed to predict the course of the concentration change well without any physical inconsistency negative values see the comparison in fig 7 the reference models and more specifically the lstm model can still be useful for predictions under circumstances similar to that of the training period this is consistent with the conclusions of tran et al 2022 and yang and zhang 2019 who used lstm based networks to predict salinity in river deltas and selected them as best performing amongst a selection of other ml model approaches to test the proposed model s performance under limited training data availability new models were trained with a reduced dataset in a first step only inputs and targets for 2017 were used in a second step the training data was further reduced to only the first six months of 2017 this has as a consequence that the decreasing behaviour of the salinity occurring in the wetter periods is no longer part of the training set when evaluated for the test period 2019 the mean nse value for the different locations for the pt lstm lstm and rnn models equal 0 98 0 71 and 0 62 respectively for the first data reduction step and 0 91 0 55 and 0 29 for the second step while this analysis does not allow to formulate general statements concerning the minimum data requirements for training the pt lstm and reference models it suggests that the proposed method seems robust for training with limited data sources 3 2 2 port of antwerp the correlation matrix of the predictors and predictands for the poa case fig s2 in the supplementary material shows some expected results concerning the relation between the target salinity and the inflow of fresh and salt water at the area s boundary see description in the supplementary material however this matrix only provides insight in possible linear relations between predictors and predictands while it is possible that strongly non linear relations between these exist to further investigate other relations one could apply for example methods that are used to select optimal inputs predictors in machine learning applications an example of such a technique is the partial mutual information pmi algorithm bowden et al 2005 sharma 2000 a popular approach to interpret model predictions is shap lundberg and lee 2017 a powerful method that enables the evaluation of the model s decisions and compare it with for example expert knowledge the results for the port of antwerp case show strong differences in salinity variations at the four locations fig 8 locations a and b show a clear seasonal pattern similar to the one in the scheldt river for the salinity at location c located at the canal section connecting the docks with the zoommeer lake no such yearly variation is observed but the salinity shows some more sudden peak periods the salinity at location d the connection between the docks and the albert canal shows a similar seasonal variation but with additionally a distinct weekly pattern this is explained by the reduction of shipping traffic in the canal in weekends and was also noticed in a measuring campaign by the drinking water production company during the summers of 2019 and 2020 bertels and willems 2022a similar as for the ghent terneuzen canal case the data in 2017 and 2018 were used as training data and the data in 2019 and part of 2020 for testing the models all models perform well when evaluated for the training period with all nse values higher than 0 9 except for the rnn trained at location c table 2 the model evaluation for the independent testing period shows that the pt lstm models indicate a much better robustness the nse values remain high except for location c where the nse drops significantly however it remains positive indicating a better model performance than simply using the average value as model prediction this is not the case for the reference models where a negative nse value is found for the testing period at location c indicating that the models have no predicting capabilities for this location at the other locations the reference models perform much worse than for the training period similarly as for the ghent terneuzen canal case 3 3 physical interpretation of the internal state variables and model parameters the internal state variables of the pt lstm are physically interpretable in the sense that they are attributed a unit of water or pollutant mass and represent the distribution of this mass throughout the modelled system the parameters on the other hand are interpreted as the redistribution of internal and incoming mass whose behavior is learned from the training data these concepts are briefly illustrated for the port of antwerp case in fig s3 in the supplementary material the internally stored salinity the c t vector of the trained pt lstm model for the antwerp docks are plotted for 4 selected elements on the right hand size of the figure the transposed s c matrix is visualized to illustrate how the salinity at the target locations is constructed from a linear combination of the internal concentrations such an analysis can be useful in reconstructing the patterns that the model has learned from the data during training another attempt to visualize the learned behavior of the modelled system is made by visualizing the temporal mean value of the r m matrix responsible for the internal redistribution of pollutant mass in each time step given in fig s4 of the supplementary material this figure allows to deduce how mass stored in the system is transferred between elements of the internal memory state vectors a next step could be to link this interpretation of the model s internals to useful physical variables that are currently not part of the model output but are known to play a role in the physical phenomena that are being studied for example discharges in the dock area are not explicitly part of the model state variables but could potentially be linked to the r v matrix which represents a redistribution of water in the system an attempt to conduct such an analysis is presented in the recent work by lees et al 2022 a method that could also be extended to the reference models as the authors present their technique for standard lstm models in a context of hydrological modelling the authors attempt to interpret the internal state of the trained lstm model by extracting it for all locations and time steps and fitting a single linear model called probe to known hydrological variables such as soil moisture and snow depth to see whether these variables are related to this internal state and the model has learned to take these physical processes into account when making discharge predictions a similar analysis might be conducted for the cases in this work for example by linking the internal state variables to known discharges note that this concept of physical interpretation of the model s internals differs somewhat from the common usage of the term interpretability in the machine learning literature where interpretability is focused more on the idea that humans are able to understand the rationale behind model predictions başağaoğlu et al 2022 as for example the objective in the shap analysis mentioned above 3 4 scenario analysis the robustness of the trained model is further tested by performing a scenario analysis for the two cases the upstream river flow rate is reduced and the mass balance models of the canal networks are used to evaluate the discharges at the boundaries this reduction of discharge in the meuse corresponds with a climate change scenario for a high impact on drought projected for the year 2050 as presented in vansteenkiste et al 2009 in the case of the ghent terneuzen canal the discharge of the scheldt and lys rivers were reduced by a factor of 0 5 the changed boundary conditions are used in the trained models to re calculate the chloride concentrations the goal is not to study the impact under a realistic climate change scenario but rather to investigate how the trained models cope with changes in these boundary conditions as compared to the available training data the physics based models are used to simulate reference concentrations the use of neural network models for conditions not present in the training range typically leads to poor results barnard and wessels 1992 as the models are not designed for extrapolation this allows therefore to better show the benefits of the proposed pt lstm technique for application in for example climate change impact studies for the ghent terneuzen canal case the simulated concentrations are plotted in figs 9 11 the pt lstm model succeeds to approach the physics based simulation results well even though the estimated concentrations are significantly larger than in the training dataset nse values higher than 0 95 are obtained for all locations table 3 scenario 1 for the lstm and rnn models lower nse values are obtained but higher than 0 7 so these are fairly good results based on these values it can be concluded that the reference models are still applicable for a simple scenario analysis such as the one presented here however when inspecting the simulation results in fig 9 it is clear that the models fail in predicting concentrations higher than the maximum of the training data and they are not useful for studying the water quality when good estimations of the absolute concentration values are required in these tests all mass exchanges of the modelled surface water systems both water and salt were known or calculated using the physics based model and used as boundary conditions in the evaluation of the data driven approaches in a true scenario analysis however not all of those would be known more specifically the salt exchanges at the tidal locks due to density currents are dependent on the unknown simulated concentrations in the canal to test the applicability of the models the experiment was repeated with the integration of the dedicated salt intrusion module for the tidal locks by iterating between the data driven models and this module it is possible to integrate the calculation of the impact of density currents with the salt water transport models and obtain fully independent models that can perform a true scenario analysis the density current model was initialized with the average concentration for the reference conditions and 10 iterations were found to be sufficient to achieve a negligible change in predicted concentrations the results are presented in table 3 as scenario 2 compared to the initial model performance the pt lstm model has a drop in nse value but still achieves good results for all locations the reference models on the contrary seem to lose most of their predictive capabilities and are therefore not suited to be used in a true scenario analysis the results of the analysis for the antwerp case differ more per location the nse values are given in table 4 and the simulated time series are shown in figs 12 and 13 the salinity at location a closely follows that of the scheldt river as the intensive shipping traffic at the tidal locks causes a large exchange of salt water as only the upstream discharge was decreased in the scenario and not this concentration boundary condition the salinity in the docks as calculated using the physics based model does not differ much from its original values both the pt lstm and the reference models are able to simulate the salinity in the docks rather well at location b the salinity still follows the seasonal course of the scheldt but the peak values that typically occur around fall are higher than under normal conditions as for the first case the data driven reference models fail in predicting these increased values while the pt lstm model performs better no significant changes in average salinity are calculated for location c as it is mainly dependent on the supply of fresh water from the zoommeer lake both the pt lstm and lstm reference model overestimate the impact that an increased average salinity over the total dock area has on the salinity at this location while the rnn model is more insensitive for this change and achieves the best performance although it still performs rather poor finally at location 4 the results are more consistent with that of the ghent terneuzen case with an acceptable performance for the pt lstm model and underestimations of the salinity by the reference models 3 5 limitations and future work the effect of altering or using a different optimizer algorithm for training the pt lstm and reference models was not studied in this work further work is needed to explore the potential benefits of choosing the hyperparameters in more detail such as the hidden cell state size the batch size and number of epochs of training etc in addition there exists a wide variety of other ml models that have been implemented successfully for studying water quality tung and yaseen 2020 common examples include support vector machines deep neural networks or tree based techniques such as random forests or xgboost e g bedi et al 2020 sahour et al 2020 heddam and kisi 2018 a comparison of the pt lstm model with these and other techniques could provide further insight in the new method s advantages and disadvantages for example tree based algorithms can easily facilitate model interpretability which can improve the understanding of the complex system that is modelled training the ml models using data that is generated with a physics based model introduces additional scientific knowledge as mentioned in the introduction section this study did not investigate further the model s performance for testing conditions due to the very limited number of available observations a more detailed analysis of the minimum data requirements to achieve good model performance is therefore suggested as future work spatial transferability of the ml models was not studied each model was trained for a specific area as pollutant transport in the surface water systems considered depends on the specific layout boundary conditions and location of the target locations it would not be straightforward to train a general model and apply it for a previously unseen case temporal transferability of the ml models has been tested but to a limited extend a more rigorous analysis could be inspired on the method proposed by bjerre et al 2022 who train metamodels that predict drainage fractions for different subdomains and attempt to quantify how well the model can be transferred to other subdomains by evaluating the distance between input features for the training and new domains weighed according to input feature importance additions and extractions of water or pollutant mass are for the moment required as known boundary conditions for the pt lstm model while those can be very uncertain for complex or poorly observed cases overestimations of mass additions can probably be handled by the model structure as it might learn to store this excess mass in a trash cell that is not incorporated in the calculation of the output concentrations furthermore the computational efficiency of the pt lstm model allows to study the share of uncertainty of the model inputs in the total output concentration uncertainty given that the model was trained using a reliable physics based model of the study area the current version of the pt lstm model architecture is limited to the modelling of transport of conservative pollutants an application for multiple and possibly interacting water quality indicators such as dissolved oxygen and organic material might be established by coupling multiple pt lstm cells using known reaction rates 4 conclusions increasing trends such as population growth more shipping traffic and climate change including sea level rise may put our water resources under severe stress accurate robust and efficient modelling tools will be crucial to assess the impacts of potential threats on the future availability of good quality water in the optimization of management strategies and the statistical analysis of impacts of changing conditions and mitigation measures while machine learning ml techniques are gaining popularity as computationally very efficient alternatives or surrogates for physics based approaches they often lack a physically interpretable structure and can produce unreliable predictions for conditions not present in the training dataset this study aims to contribute to the applicability of ml techniques in scenario analyses by presenting a novel physics informed model architecture for describing transport of conservative pollutants in surface water systems named pt lstm the model is inspired on the long short term memory lstm architecture and explicitly enforces the conservation of water and pollutant mass the aim is to present a technique that can benefit from the vast amount of available training techniques and the efficient model evaluation of ml models while being more robust for use under uncertain and new boundary conditions than traditional ml approaches the proposed model is demonstrated for the case of salinization of shipping canals and port areas in coastal regions due to the possible decrease of fresh water supply the model was trained and compared with reference models standard recurrent neural networks rnn and lstm models for two relevant cases in belgium and consistently outperforms these reference techniques when evaluated for an independent dataset see tables 1 4 furthermore the technique shows potential for use in scenario analyses demonstrated by strongly changing the boundary conditions for the modelled systems and comparing the simulation results with the results of a detailed physics based reference model while the rnn and lstm reference models fail in predicting higher salinity values than present in the training dataset the proposed pt lstm model manages to accurately predict the salinity for most test locations figs 9 13 suggestions for future work include a further optimization of the model s hyperparameters and an expansion of the set of reference models used to place the proposed technique s performance in context also an adaptation of the technique to suit the modelling of non conservative pollutants could prove interesting it is to the best knowledge of the authors the first demonstration of a physics informed ml type model for modelling pollutant transport in surface water on a realistic scale its basic principles could perhaps be applied in other related model architectures or the model itself can perhaps be applied in fields where conservation of different quantities is an intrinsic property of the modelled system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

2166,correctly understanding the coordinated development between the social economy and the ecological environment is the key to achieving the sustainable development of river basins previous coupling coordination degree models are empirical ones and very complex without physical parameters here a novel social ecological coupling model was established to meet the challenge within the budyko framework nd was adopted to characterize the social ecological coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship in basins in addition a social ecological coupling coordination model with basins in northern shaanxi province china as units the multiple linear regression mlr model was used to quantitatively analyze the evolutional relationship between economic development and ecological environment research results show that r2 is larger than 0 6 in the comprehensive evaluation results of the novel model this means that the model can well reflect changes in vegetation coverage and simplify expression of the coordinated development of social ecological systems the evaluation results of the human water relationship in the basins are gradually improved year by year and the coordination state evolved constantly the two systems have positive promotion effects on each other the social ecological coupling coordination degree d is spatially different and various basins are listed in a descending order as the yanhe wuding and kuye river basins according to d d of the three basins all evolves from 0 2 moderate incoordination to 0 6 mild coordination combined with analysis of arima time series it is anticipated that the human water relationship will reach moderate coordination by 2030 finally without changing the premise of the social ecological coupling model limitations of the current model factors can be improved for future research to provide policy suggestions exploring ways to coordinate development of social ecological systems in northern shaanxi keywords budyko framework social ecological coupling model northern shaanxi human water relationship in basins linear regression data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the water balance and heat balance of a river basin are the basis of the budyko assumption miller et al 1974 many studies have addressed on the balance laws and their driving factors in different basins in china therein the budyko framework can effectively evaluate interactions between the climate vegetation and hydrological cycle due to its concise and robust expression and the physical mechanism on this basis numerous scholars have come up with a series of budyko empirical formulas fu 1981 choudhury 1999 yang and yang 2011 and conducted theoretical deduction and empirical research on these formulas shen et al 2017 the budyko curve was the first to introduce drought indices the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation that showed considerable predictive power in a variety of practical applications ranging from long term water balance mcmahon et al 2013 to climate change impacts dooge 1992 and flood frequency distribution guo et al 2014 this work contributes to a deeper understanding of long term water balance and its influences as well as to other hydrological applications in 2020 sankarasubramanian et al 2020 reviewed recent advances in the interpretation and application of the budyko framework and its future extensions to address issues related to hydrology and environmental change in the budyko framework the characteristic parameter n of the underlying surfaces is commonly a constant while the explanation of n for the ecological environment deepens with the climate change and the development and utilization of water resources zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2022b used a stepwise multiple regression smr model to identify the contribution of glacier fraction and other factors to the characteristic parameter ω value based on fu s budyko type equation li et al 2013 proposed that the optimal parameter ω and the long term average fractional vegetation cover fvc of a specific basin have a linear regression relationship ω a fvc b thus fvc and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are linearly correlated kim and kaluarachchi 2017 amogu et al 2010 mango et al 2011 different scholars have endowed new connotation to n liu et al 2022a gan et al 2021 either climate changes development and utilization of water resources or social and economic development can alter n and widen its definition the harmonious development between the social economy and the ecological environment has become an important research field for the high quality development of global basins grossman and krueger 1991 the sustainable utilization of water resources is a strategic issue for the economic and social development of china and social and economic development should be based on the sustainable utilization of resources lei et al 2018 zuo et al 2022 first proposed the human water relationship discipline in 2021 zuo et al 2021 believed that the coupling coordinated development of the human water relationship is an important guarantee for realizing the ecological civilization construction of water resources while respecting the natural law of water systems as well as economic and social development laws analyzing the evolution of the coupling coordination between human and water helps in the realization of the high quality development of social ecological systems in northern shaanxi liu et al 2021 generally composite indices coupling two or more indices are used to describe the social ecological relationship chen et al 2022 however within the budyko framework n reflects changes in the underlying surface conditions in response to urban expansion and economic development therefore it is more comprehensive to use n to characterize the coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship in basins in comparison with composite indices as the earliest response to the national policy to implement the project of returning farmland to forest grass northern shaanxi province is also the key area of ecological civilization construction implementation since a large area of vegetation has been greatly restored human activities have changed the local ecological environment and water cycle qiu et al 2021 and it has become an important area in which to study the coupling between ecological protection and economic development zhao et al 2021 this region is therefore most appropriate to study the relationship between humans and water in river basins among those in this region the kuye wuding and yanhe river basins are three basins cover the largest areas in northern shaanxi and they are geographically located from north to south the runoff tendency rates of the three basins from 1960 to 2020 were 7 983 5 991 and 2 716 mm 10a respectively as calculated by the climate tendency rate ma et al 2013 under the dual effects of climate changes and vegetation restoration the runoff has decreased dramatically over the years at present china focuses on economic construction how to practice the concept of ecological development is the focus of current work northern shaanxi has unique human and water attributes in order to realize ecological civilization construction it is vital to clarify the social and ecological coupling and coordinated development of the human water relationship in each river basin since most of the previous coupling coordination degree models are empirical and complex there is no physical mechanism therefore following the social ecological interaction the research established a social ecological coupling model within the budyko framework to study the coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship of the above named three basins in northern shaanxi from 1960 to 2020 based on the choudhury yang equation nd was used to characterize the complex interaction between human and water in the basins and the analysis of auto regressive integrated moving average arima time series was adopted to predict future the changes in the human water relationship the research structure is organized as follows section 2 describes research data and methods section 3 1 analyzes the temporal variation of the social ecological coupling coordination degree in basins in section 3 2 a novel social ecological coupling model is built section 3 3 analyzes the association of the human water relationship in basins with the vegetation restoration the research results are discussed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 research methods 2 1 overview of the research area the loess plateau in northern shaanxi is located in a semi arid region it is in the hekou town longmen section which is in the upper section of the middle reaches of the yellow river the plateau is high in the northwest while low in the southeast and has many river basins this research selected three representative basins namely the yanhe wuding and kuye river basins covering large areas on the loess plateau the basic overview of each basin is shown in fig 1 the mann kendall mk trend test method was used to carry out trend tests on climate and underlying surface factors of the three basins and the time series of characteristic parameters of the budyko equation and the results are listed in table 1 the actual evapotranspiration et annual potential evapotranspiration et0 fvc and n of the three basins are all rising except for the yanhe river basin average annual precipitation p in other two basins exhibits an increasing trend only annual runoff r shows the significant reduction trend in the basins 2 2 data sources meteorological data were collected from the national meteorological information center p and et0 data were obtained through kriging interpolation in arcgis et was calculated using the water balance equation et0 was determined by using the fao 56 penman monteith equation based on meteorological data the hydrologic control stations at the outlets of the yanhe wuding and kuye river basins are wenjiachuan baijiachuan and ganguyi stations r data at the three hydrologic stations were from 1960 to 2020 and were collected from the china river sediment bulletin and the hydrologic data yearbook of the yellow river basin data of year end population per capita gdp output value of the primary industry output value of the secondary industry output value of the tertiary industry year end cultivated area and afforestation area of current year from 1990 to 2020 were derived from the shaanxi statistical yearbook yan an statistical yearbook and yulin statistical yearbook the noaa climate data record cdr of avhrr ndvi normalized difference vegetation index data version 5 from 1982 to 2020 based on the google earth engine was used annual data were synthesized using the monthly maximum data in the arcgis database fvc was calculated by referring to yang et al 2009 1 fvc ndvi n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min where fvc represents the fractional vegetation cover which is dimensionless and indicates the proportion of vegetation coverage in the total land surface area ndvimin and ndvimax are the ndvi signals from bare soil and dense green vegetation respectively ndvimin and ndvimax are respectively defined as 0 05 and 0 80 rui et al 2002 fvc reflects the influences of climatic seasonality soil properties and topographic features and summarizes influences of ecological and hydrological processes on water and energy balance 2 3 experimental design to evaluate the social ecological coupling model of the human water relationship within the budyko framework three basins were selected for simulation experiments the experiments were divided into two stages that is the establishment and the verification data from 1990 to 2010 were adopted to build the multiple regression model and those from 2011 to 2020 were used to verify the model in this way the overall framework of the social ecological coupling system was built as illustrated in fig 2 the detailed experimental processes included the following considerations a due to the complexity of the human water relationship in basins the relationship was decomposed into the social economy and the ecological environment which are mutually promoting and interacting the range method was used to standardize the original data to eliminate influences of different dimensions of various indices to distinguish the relative importance of indices at different levels in the coupling system the independence weight coefficient method was adopted to determine the weights of indices zhang et al 2018 the coupling coordination degree d of the social ecological system was obtained as follows 2 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 2 2 1 2 3 t α u 1 β u 2 4 d ct where c denotes the coupling degree u1 and u2 respectively represent comprehensive indices of the social and ecological systems and are calculated by weighting various indices in the social and ecological systems α and β are weight coefficients of u1 and u2 respectively t is a comprehensive evaluation index for the two subsystems and d is the coupling coordination degree b based on the coupling coordination degree d climate factors in the ecological system to be characterized thereby were taken the research was based on the hydrothermal coupled equilibrium equation choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 deduced by yang et al 2008 in tsinghua university due to its wide application the moving average method was adopted to obtain n a parameter reflecting hydro thermal features of basins in the choudhury yang equation 5 et e t 0 p p n e t 0 n 1 n c by referring to the above n the mlr model was adopted to construct eqns 7 and 8 for nd which fit the linear regression of economic and ecological factors and reveal the dependency of climate and underlying surface factors on

system a is the intercept of the stepwise regression equation b c d and e are model coefficients of independent variables x1 x2 x3 xm represent related influencing factors in systems u1 and u2 2 4 model performance evaluation and data analysis first the mk trend test method was used to analyze the trends of the characteristic parameters of the three basins and long time series data of their influencing factors mann 1945 kendall 1975 pearson correlation analysis was performed to explore linkages between various influencing factors and n hlinka et al 2014 finally using n calculated by the choudhury yang equation as actual values and nd determined using eq 8 as simulated values the model performance based on the correlation coefficient r2 between the simulated and actual values was numerically assessed the threshold of the influence of vegetation coverage was identified by analyzing the elastic coefficient ec of nd and fvc jiang et al 2015 the ec was attained by derivation of the fitting function of fvc and nd 9 ec d n d d fvc the time series analyses arima were used to predict the coordinated development of the future human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi arima is a perfect statistical method for non stationary time series prediction and its details can refer to previous research luo et al 2019 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of social ecological coupling coordination degree in basins ten indices were selected from the socio economic and ecological systems from the perspective of the human water relationship total population size x1 per capita gdp x2 output value of the tertiary industry x3 output value of the secondary industry x4 output value of the primary industry x5 p x6 r x7 fvc x8 year end cultivated area x9 and afforestation area of current year x10 the weights of each index were calculated and the results are displayed in fig 3 d the project to return farmland to forest started in 1999 before this time more attention was paid to economic development and the weights of the economic index α and ecological index β were respectively 0 6 and 0 4 after implementation of the project the focus shifted from economic development to ecological protection and the weights of α and β were reversed to be 0 4 and 0 6 respectively the social ecological coupling coordination degree was calculated based on the indicators givenabove fig 3 a and c the society and economy in each basin have persistently and substantially developed since 2005 kuye and wuding river basins are mainly located in yulin city northern shaanxi province where the ecological environment has undergone similar changes in terms of temporal variation d of the three basins shows an increasing trend on the whole and evolves from the moderate incoordination 0 2 to mild coordination 0 6 moreover d of the three basins all exceeded 0 3 around 2000 when the three basins entered the transition state on the whole specifically d of the kuye river basin exhibits a wave like ascending trend with five years as a cycle and approximated to mild coordination in 2016 d of the wuding river basin declined greatly between 2002 and 2005 and again in 2015 d of the yanhe river basin decreased in the period of 2013 2016 while it showed an increasing trend in other periods 3 2 establishment of the social ecological coupling model of basins among social factors of river basins changes in the population size and per capita gdp are extremely important exerting great influence on the water cycling system the cultivated area and afforestation area are also leading social factors that affect changes in underlying surfaces the three basins in this study which are all located in northern shaanxi differ greatly in the social and economic development first correlation analysis was carried out on n and influencing factors reflecting the human water relationship in basins as displayed in table 2 among correlations of driving factors with n r was significantly correlated with other driving factors except for the cultivated and afforestation area and in particular the correlation coefficients of the industrial structure indices population size and fvc with n all exceed 0 6 to better establish the social ecological coupling model influencing factors with the correlation coefficient larger than 0 7 were selected to construct the multiple regression model as expressed as eqns 10 11 and 12 the durbin watson independence test results of residuals of the kuye wuding and yanhe river basins in the simulation periods were 1 090 1 387 and 1 213 respectively and r2 values were 0 801 0 915 and 0 767 respectively this indicates that 80 1 of changes in nd kuye of the kuye river basin are explained by variation of x1 x2 x3 x4 and x8 91 5 of changes in nd wuding of the wuding river basin are explained by variation of x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x8 and x9 and 76 7 of changes in nd yanhe of the yanhe river basin are explained by variation of x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 and x8 therefore nd can fully characterize the human water relationship in basins because the three basins are located in the loess plateau of northern shaanxi the geographical conditions and climate change are similar and so they are affected by some of the same factors x1 x2 x3 x4 x8 on the other hand the cultivated area of wuding river basin accounts for more than 89 wang et al 2022b while those of the kuye and yanhe river basins are less than 30 jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2022a thus unlike nd kuye and nd yanhe nd wuding is affected by the year end cultivated area at the same time because of the different development of the three industries the influences on nd in the watersheds are different that is the influence sequence on the three watersheds is x5 wuding x5 yanhe x5 kuye 10 n d k u y e 1 514 0 166 x 1 8 972 x 2 1 686 x 3 7 170 x 4 0 239 x 8 11 n d w u d i n g 1 714 0 249 x 1 560 x 2 0 770 x 3 0 417 x 4 0 252 x 5 0 208 x 8 0 211 x 9 12 n d y a n h e 2 149 0 042 x 1 11 820 x 2 5 768 x 3 6 243 x 4 0 231 x 5 0 462 x 8 3 3 the relationship between the nd of basins and vegetation restoration dynamic changes in nd of basins during 1960 2020 were calculated based on the established social ecological coupling model fig 4 comparison of the original nd and five year moving averaged nd reveals that the series obtained over a long time span is more stationary comparison of the same period in fig 3 and fig 4 shows that nd and d change basically in the same trend and the social and economic development and the quality of the ecological environment lag behind each other in different periods through interactive forcing and interaction of the two yang et al 2021 the relationship between the economic development and the ecological environment is coordinated and evolves from antagonism to good coordination with the implementation of the project to return farmland to forest and grassland the fvc changes a lot in basins in northern shaanxi fig 5 as shown in fig 5a the annual fvc growth rates of the kuye wuding and yanhe river basins during 1982 1999 were 0 27 0 24 and 0 05 respectively since the implementation of the project 2000 2020 the fvc of basins in northern shaanxi has risen significantly the fvc of the kuye 0 67 year and wuding 0 69 year river basins has changed in a similar trend with both growing from about 35 to about 50 the fvc of the yanhe river basin increased most rapidly 0 96 year and compared with that in 2000 has grown from 50 to 75 spatially fig 5b the fvc of the yanhe river basin was the largest over years followed by the wuding river basin while that in the kuye river basin was the lowest the fvc values of the three basins are all high in the south while low in the north combined with the above analysis of nd it can be seen that with the increase of vegetation coverage the human water relationship in basins develops towards the mild coordination trend the least squares fitting was used to fit nd and fvc to acquire the regression coefficients a and b the latest research of li et al 2013 shows that the ndvi is linearly correlated with the characteristic parameter n in the budyko equation based on fu s equation likewise nd is also highly correlated with fvc it can be seen from fig 6 that r2 0 80 0 78 and 0 64 respectively for the kuye wuding and yanhe river basins the fitted linear relations of the three basins are nd kuye 4 18fvc1 0 23 nd wuding 2 42fvc2 0 78 and nd yanhe 2 69fvc3 0 86 in these basins nd is positively correlated with fvc especially nd and fvc in the kuye river basin which are highly correlated 4 discussion 4 1 model performance northern shaanxi shares a similar environment while differs from basin to basin in terms of the economic and ecological levels which results in inconsistent social ecological coupling degrees due to the complex interaction between human activities and environment factors many factors cause changes in river basin characteristics zhang et al 2001 it is therefore challenging to determine the extent to which changes in the human water relationship are caused by any one driving factor in consideration of this the established social ecological coupling model was applied to different basins to discuss the human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi during vegetation restoration the model is unique and targeted by selecting driving factors with close correlations the multiple stepwise regression model of a single basin was built to fit the social ecological coupling degree of the human water relationship in basins taking n within the budyko framework as the actual value the verification results of the model are illustrated in fig 7 it can be seen that r2 of each basin is larger than 0 6 which enhances the confidence of simulation experiments of the model in identifying the social ecological coupling system for evaluating the human water relationship in basins within the budyko framework the evaluation results indicate that model simulation can well verify the coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship therefore the newly established model not only well reflects changes in vegetation coverage but also simplifies the expression of the coordinated development of the social ecological system 4 2 sensitivity of nd of basins to vegetation restoration by analyzing characteristics of the human system water system and their coupling system the human water relationship is found to turn from ecological development towards social and economic development that is nd kuye nd wuding and nd yanhe of basins all shift leftwards along the budyko curves under influences of vegetation restoration on the whole fig 8 a from the reference period 1990 2000 to the vegetation restoration period 2000 2020 this indicates that et0 changes in the three basins are more substantial than changes in p jaramillo et al 2022 however for the evaporation rate et p the vertical movement of nd kuye and nd wuding is more obvious than the horizontal movement which suggests significant augmentation of et in the kuye and wuding river basins this indicates that the effect of vegetation restoration in reducing r has exceeded that of climate changes which is consistent with previous results gao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 tian et al 2019 fig 8b shows the elastic changes of nd with fvc in various basins of northern shaanxi during 1960 2020 ec represents changes in nd due to per unit increase in fvc and ec decreases with the enlarging fvc in the basins the ec thresholds appear in the kuye and wuding river basins when fvc is in the range of 51 53 while that of the yanhe river basin occurs when fvc is 65 this suggests that in different spatial scales the conditions for appearance of the threshold may change so the fvc and nd of basins when the threshold appears can be taken as reference for the implementation of vegetation restoration in northern shaanxi fvc in northern shaanxi grew from 29 1 to 50 6 during 1989 1999 fig 5 in particular a significant effect was observed within 2 7 years after implementation of the project in addition as fvc enlarges the sensitivity of nd of basins to vegetation restoration is also enhanced 4 3 evaluation of the social ecological coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi as shown in fig 9 a circles and rhombi in the same color basically exhibit the same trend and changes in the human water relationship and the social ecological coupling coordination degree tend to be consistent and the two are positively correlated kreibich et al 2022 through equal proportion transformation the optimal value for the development of the human water relationship in basins within the budyko framework can be predicted the human system influences attributive characteristics of the water system by implementation of water conservancy projects changes in vegetation coverage and industrial development the evaluation results of the social ecological coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi are shown in fig 9b on the time scale the coupling coordination degree rose year by year from 1990 to 2020 and the basins are listed in a descending order as the yanhe wuding and kuye river basins in terms of changes in the social ecological coupling coordination degree the coupling coordination degree in 2021 2030 is predicted using arima fig 9b the results show that the social ecological coupling coordination degree in these basins all exhibit an increase trend and will reach 0 7 by 2030 which indicates that the human water relationship may reach moderate coordination in the future on the whole the future development trend of the social ecological system in northern shaanxi is good the coordination among subsystems develops rapidly and the coupling coordination degree increases steadily the three main industries x3 x5 developed rapidly and the proportion of the primary industry x5 diminished the cultivated area x9 and the afforestation area x10 changed in a similar trend the urban population size x1 surged around 2000 accompanied by constant growth of the per capita gdp x2 all these changes cannot be separated from responses to the human system the water system as the basic resources acts on the human system through changes in the p x6 and r x7 compared with the kuye and wuding river basins the yanhe river basin is more greatly affected by human activities and therefore evolves earlier from antagonism to good coordination coupling however the constant economic growth exerts huge influences on the social ecological coupling coordination degree in the various basins and the economic input in ecological restoration will become the main constraint that influences the good coordinated development in northern shaanxi therefore in the future while maintaining the existing development advantages it is necessary to constantly focus on the development of the social economy and ecological environment improvement of economic benefits strengthening of ecological protection and restoration while also paying attention to the coordinated development of the various subsystem 5 conclusions considering development of the human water relationship and especially the complex system within basins as geographical units in norther shaanxi a simple and extensive social ecological coupling model was established based on the coupling coordination degree model the model combines the coupling coordination mechanism of human and water systems within the budyko framework the coordination of the human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi and the social ecological coupling coordination effect were analyzed the novel social ecological coupling framework correlates human and water in river basins and the model yields favorable evaluation results r2 greater than 0 6 the nd is used to represent the degree of social ecological coupling and coordination of human water relations in the basin which can predict the degree of human water coordination in the future and is more comprehensive the coupling coordination degree between the economic development and the ecological environment constantly rose in 1990 2020 and d evolved from moderate incoordination to mild coordination under interventions from the human system the yanhe river basin was the first to evolved from antagonistic coordination to good coordination and well coupling morphological evolution among the three river basins in norther shaanxi since the implementation of the project of returning farmland to forest and grassland in 2000 fvc has increased significantly in basin in northern shaanxi and the human water relationship in basin has developed to the mild coordination trend meanwhile threshold identification in different basins is also scale dependent with the decreasing latitude and enhanced human activities the fvc and nd grow when the ec threshold appears using arima to predict that the coupling of human water relations will achieve intermediate coordinated development in the future on this basis the social ecological coupling model of the human water relationship in basins within the budyko framework was established which is of important significance for clarifying the future development direction of vegetation restoration in norther shaanxi however the research data are only limited to statistical hydrological data economic indices and ecological improvement measures while do not include the areas of specific ecological improvement measures data concerning horizontal terrace check dam and natural reforestation will be introduced in future

2166,correctly understanding the coordinated development between the social economy and the ecological environment is the key to achieving the sustainable development of river basins previous coupling coordination degree models are empirical ones and very complex without physical parameters here a novel social ecological coupling model was established to meet the challenge within the budyko framework nd was adopted to characterize the social ecological coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship in basins in addition a social ecological coupling coordination model with basins in northern shaanxi province china as units the multiple linear regression mlr model was used to quantitatively analyze the evolutional relationship between economic development and ecological environment research results show that r2 is larger than 0 6 in the comprehensive evaluation results of the novel model this means that the model can well reflect changes in vegetation coverage and simplify expression of the coordinated development of social ecological systems the evaluation results of the human water relationship in the basins are gradually improved year by year and the coordination state evolved constantly the two systems have positive promotion effects on each other the social ecological coupling coordination degree d is spatially different and various basins are listed in a descending order as the yanhe wuding and kuye river basins according to d d of the three basins all evolves from 0 2 moderate incoordination to 0 6 mild coordination combined with analysis of arima time series it is anticipated that the human water relationship will reach moderate coordination by 2030 finally without changing the premise of the social ecological coupling model limitations of the current model factors can be improved for future research to provide policy suggestions exploring ways to coordinate development of social ecological systems in northern shaanxi

introduction the water balance and heat balance of a river basin are the basis of the budyko assumption miller et al 1974 many studies have addressed on the balance laws and their driving factors in different basins in china therein the budyko framework can effectively evaluate interactions between the climate vegetation and hydrological cycle due to its concise and robust expression and the physical mechanism on this basis numerous scholars have come up with a series of budyko empirical formulas fu 1981 choudhury 1999 yang and yang 2011 and conducted theoretical deduction and empirical research on these formulas shen et al 2017 the budyko curve was the first to introduce drought indices the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation that showed considerable predictive power in a variety of practical applications ranging from long term water balance mcmahon et al 2013 to climate change impacts dooge 1992 and flood frequency distribution guo et al 2014 this work contributes to a deeper understanding of long term water balance and its influences as well as to other hydrological applications in 2020 sankarasubramanian et al 2020 reviewed recent advances in the interpretation and application of the budyko framework and its future extensions to address issues related to hydrology and environmental change in the budyko framework the characteristic parameter n of the underlying surfaces is commonly a constant while the explanation of n for the ecological environment deepens with the climate change and the development and utilization of water resources zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2022b used a stepwise multiple regression smr model to identify the contribution of glacier fraction and other factors to the characteristic parameter ω value based on fu s budyko type equation li et al 2013 proposed that the optimal parameter ω and the long term average fractional vegetation cover fvc of a specific basin have a linear regression relationship ω a fvc b thus fvc and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are linearly correlated kim and kaluarachchi 2017 amogu et al 2010 mango et al 2011 different scholars have endowed new connotation to n liu et al 2022a gan et al 2021 either climate changes development and utilization of water resources or social and economic development can alter n and widen its definition the harmonious development between the social economy and the ecological environment has become an important research field for the high quality development of global basins grossman and krueger 1991 the sustainable utilization of water resources is a strategic issue for the economic and social development of china and social and economic development should be based on the sustainable utilization of resources lei et al 2018 zuo et al 2022 first proposed the human water relationship discipline in 2021 zuo et al 2021 believed that the coupling coordinated development of the human water relationship is an important guarantee for realizing the ecological civilization construction of water resources while respecting the natural law of water systems as well as economic and social development laws analyzing the evolution of the coupling coordination between human and water helps in the realization of the high quality development of social ecological systems in northern shaanxi liu et al 2021 generally composite indices coupling two or more indices are used to describe the social ecological relationship chen et al 2022 however within the budyko framework n reflects changes in the underlying surface conditions in response to urban expansion and economic development therefore it is more comprehensive to use n to characterize the coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship in basins in comparison with composite indices as the earliest response to the national policy to implement the project of returning farmland to forest grass northern shaanxi province is also the key area of ecological civilization construction implementation since a large area of vegetation has been greatly restored human activities have changed the local ecological environment and water cycle qiu et al 2021 and it has become an important area in which to study the coupling between ecological protection and economic development zhao et al 2021 this region is therefore most appropriate to study the relationship between humans and water in river basins among those in this region the kuye wuding and yanhe river basins are three basins cover the largest areas in northern shaanxi and they are geographically located from north to south the runoff tendency rates of the three basins from 1960 to 2020 were 7 983 5 991 and 2 716 mm 10a respectively as calculated by the climate tendency rate ma et al 2013 under the dual effects of climate changes and vegetation restoration the runoff has decreased dramatically over the years at present china focuses on economic construction how to practice the concept of ecological development is the focus of current work northern shaanxi has unique human and water attributes in order to realize ecological civilization construction it is vital to clarify the social and ecological coupling and coordinated development of the human water relationship in each river basin since most of the previous coupling coordination degree models are empirical and complex there is no physical mechanism therefore following the social ecological interaction the research established a social ecological coupling model within the budyko framework to study the coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship of the above named three basins in northern shaanxi from 1960 to 2020 based on the choudhury yang equation nd was used to characterize the complex interaction between human and water in the basins and the analysis of auto regressive integrated moving average arima time series was adopted to predict future the changes in the human water relationship the research structure is organized as follows section 2 describes research data and methods section 3 1 analyzes the temporal variation of the social ecological coupling coordination degree in basins in section 3 2 a novel social ecological coupling model is built section 3 3 analyzes the association of the human water relationship in basins with the vegetation restoration the research results are discussed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 research methods 2 1 overview of the research area the loess plateau in northern shaanxi is located in a semi arid region it is in the hekou town longmen section which is in the upper section of the middle reaches of the yellow river the plateau is high in the northwest while low in the southeast and has many river basins this research selected three representative basins namely the yanhe wuding and kuye river basins covering large areas on the loess plateau the basic overview of each basin is shown in fig 1 the mann kendall mk trend test method was used to carry out trend tests on climate and underlying surface factors of the three basins and the time series of characteristic parameters of the budyko equation and the results are listed in table 1 the actual evapotranspiration et annual potential evapotranspiration et0 fvc and n of the three basins are all rising except for the yanhe river basin average annual precipitation p in other two basins exhibits an increasing trend only annual runoff r shows the significant reduction trend in the basins 2 2 data sources meteorological data were collected from the national meteorological information center p and et0 data were obtained through kriging interpolation in arcgis et was calculated using the water balance equation et0 was determined by using the fao 56 penman monteith equation based on meteorological data the hydrologic control stations at the outlets of the yanhe wuding and kuye river basins are wenjiachuan baijiachuan and ganguyi stations r data at the three hydrologic stations were from 1960 to 2020 and were collected from the china river sediment bulletin and the hydrologic data yearbook of the yellow river basin data of year end population per capita gdp output value of the primary industry output value of the secondary industry output value of the tertiary industry year end cultivated area and afforestation area of current year from 1990 to 2020 were derived from the shaanxi statistical yearbook yan an statistical yearbook and yulin statistical yearbook the noaa climate data record cdr of avhrr ndvi normalized difference vegetation index data version 5 from 1982 to 2020 based on the google earth engine was used annual data were synthesized using the monthly maximum data in the arcgis database fvc was calculated by referring to yang et al 2009 1 fvc ndvi n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min where fvc represents the fractional vegetation cover which is dimensionless and indicates the proportion of vegetation coverage in the total land surface area ndvimin and ndvimax are the ndvi signals from bare soil and dense green vegetation respectively ndvimin and ndvimax are respectively defined as 0 05 and 0 80 rui et al 2002 fvc reflects the influences of climatic seasonality soil properties and topographic features and summarizes influences of ecological and hydrological processes on water and energy balance 2 3 experimental design to evaluate the social ecological coupling model of the human water relationship within the budyko framework three basins were selected for simulation experiments the experiments were divided into two stages that is the establishment and the verification data from 1990 to 2010 were adopted to build the multiple regression model and those from 2011 to 2020 were used to verify the model in this way the overall framework of the social ecological coupling system was built as illustrated in fig 2 the detailed experimental processes included the following considerations a due to the complexity of the human water relationship in basins the relationship was decomposed into the social economy and the ecological environment which are mutually promoting and interacting the range method was used to standardize the original data to eliminate influences of different dimensions of various indices to distinguish the relative importance of indices at different levels in the coupling system the independence weight coefficient method was adopted to determine the weights of indices zhang et al 2018 the coupling coordination degree d of the social ecological system was obtained as follows 2 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 2 2 1 2 3 t α u 1 β u 2 4 d ct where c denotes the coupling degree u1 and u2 respectively represent comprehensive indices of the social and ecological systems and are calculated by weighting various indices in the social and ecological systems α and β are weight coefficients of u1 and u2 respectively t is a comprehensive evaluation index for the two subsystems and d is the coupling coordination degree b based on the coupling coordination degree d climate factors in the ecological system to be characterized thereby were taken the research was based on the hydrothermal coupled equilibrium equation choudhury yang equation choudhury 1999 deduced by yang et al 2008 in tsinghua university due to its wide application the moving average method was adopted to obtain n a parameter reflecting hydro thermal features of basins in the choudhury yang equation 5 et e t 0 p p n e t 0 n 1 n c by referring to the above n the mlr model was adopted to construct eqns 7 and 8 for nd which fit the linear regression of economic and ecological factors and reveal the dependency of climate and underlying surface factors on specific parameters 6 et e t 0 p p n d e t 0 n d 1 n d where 7 n d a b u 1 c u 2 8 n d a b x 1 c x 2 d x 3 e x m where nd characterizes the complex interaction between the human system and the water system a is the intercept of the stepwise regression equation b c d and e are model coefficients of independent variables x1 x2 x3 xm represent related influencing factors in systems u1 and u2 2 4 model performance evaluation and data analysis first the mk trend test method was used to analyze the trends of the characteristic parameters of the three basins and long time series data of their influencing factors mann 1945 kendall 1975 pearson correlation analysis was performed to explore linkages between various influencing factors and n hlinka et al 2014 finally using n calculated by the choudhury yang equation as actual values and nd determined using eq 8 as simulated values the model performance based on the correlation coefficient r2 between the simulated and actual values was numerically assessed the threshold of the influence of vegetation coverage was identified by analyzing the elastic coefficient ec of nd and fvc jiang et al 2015 the ec was attained by derivation of the fitting function of fvc and nd 9 ec d n d d fvc the time series analyses arima were used to predict the coordinated development of the future human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi arima is a perfect statistical method for non stationary time series prediction and its details can refer to previous research luo et al 2019 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of social ecological coupling coordination degree in basins ten indices were selected from the socio economic and ecological systems from the perspective of the human water relationship total population size x1 per capita gdp x2 output value of the tertiary industry x3 output value of the secondary industry x4 output value of the primary industry x5 p x6 r x7 fvc x8 year end cultivated area x9 and afforestation area of current year x10 the weights of each index were calculated and the results are displayed in fig 3 d the project to return farmland to forest started in 1999 before this time more attention was paid to economic development and the weights of the economic index α and ecological index β were respectively 0 6 and 0 4 after implementation of the project the focus shifted from economic development to ecological protection and the weights of α and β were reversed to be 0 4 and 0 6 respectively the social ecological coupling coordination degree was calculated based on the indicators givenabove fig 3 a and c the society and economy in each basin have persistently and substantially developed since 2005 kuye and wuding river basins are mainly located in yulin city northern shaanxi province where the ecological environment has undergone similar changes in terms of temporal variation d of the three basins shows an increasing trend on the whole and evolves from the moderate incoordination 0 2 to mild coordination 0 6 moreover d of the three basins all exceeded 0 3 around 2000 when the three basins entered the transition state on the whole specifically d of the kuye river basin exhibits a wave like ascending trend with five years as a cycle and approximated to mild coordination in 2016 d of the wuding river basin declined greatly between 2002 and 2005 and again in 2015 d of the yanhe river basin decreased in the period of 2013 2016 while it showed an increasing trend in other periods 3 2 establishment of the social ecological coupling model of basins among social factors of river basins changes in the population size and per capita gdp are extremely important exerting great influence on the water cycling system the cultivated area and afforestation area are also leading social factors that affect changes in underlying surfaces the three basins in this study which are all located in northern shaanxi differ greatly in the social and economic development first correlation analysis was carried out on n and influencing factors reflecting the human water relationship in basins as displayed in table 2 among correlations of driving factors with n r was significantly correlated with other driving factors except for the cultivated and afforestation area and in particular the correlation coefficients of the industrial structure indices population size and fvc with n all exceed 0 6 to better establish the social ecological coupling model influencing factors with the correlation coefficient larger than 0 7 were selected to construct the multiple regression model as expressed as eqns 10 11 and 12 the durbin watson independence test results of residuals of the kuye wuding and yanhe river basins in the simulation periods were 1 090 1 387 and 1 213 respectively and r2 values were 0 801 0 915 and 0 767 respectively this indicates that 80 1 of changes in nd kuye of the kuye river basin are explained by variation of x1 x2 x3 x4 and x8 91 5 of changes in nd wuding of the wuding river basin are explained by variation of x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x8 and x9 and 76 7 of changes in nd yanhe of the yanhe river basin are explained by variation of x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 and x8 therefore nd can fully characterize the human water relationship in basins because the three basins are located in the loess plateau of northern shaanxi the geographical conditions and climate change are similar and so they are affected by some of the same factors x1 x2 x3 x4 x8 on the other hand the cultivated area of wuding river basin accounts for more than 89 wang et al 2022b while those of the kuye and yanhe river basins are less than 30 jiang et al 2020 wang et al 2022a thus unlike nd kuye and nd yanhe nd wuding is affected by the year end cultivated area at the same time because of the different development of the three industries the influences on nd in the watersheds are different that is the influence sequence on the three watersheds is x5 wuding x5 yanhe x5 kuye 10 n d k u y e 1 514 0 166 x 1 8 972 x 2 1 686 x 3 7 170 x 4 0 239 x 8 11 n d w u d i n g 1 714 0 249 x 1 560 x 2 0 770 x 3 0 417 x 4 0 252 x 5 0 208 x 8 0 211 x 9 12 n d y a n h e 2 149 0 042 x 1 11 820 x 2 5 768 x 3 6 243 x 4 0 231 x 5 0 462 x 8 3 3 the relationship between the nd of basins and vegetation restoration dynamic changes in nd of basins during 1960 2020 were calculated based on the established social ecological coupling model fig 4 comparison of the original nd and five year moving averaged nd reveals that the series obtained over a long time span is more stationary comparison of the same period in fig 3 and fig 4 shows that nd and d change basically in the same trend and the social and economic development and the quality of the ecological environment lag behind each other in different periods through interactive forcing and interaction of the two yang et al 2021 the relationship between the economic development and the ecological environment is coordinated and evolves from antagonism to good coordination with the implementation of the project to return farmland to forest and grassland the fvc changes a lot in basins in northern shaanxi fig 5 as shown in fig 5a the annual fvc growth rates of the kuye wuding and yanhe river basins during 1982 1999 were 0 27 0 24 and 0 05 respectively since the implementation of the project 2000 2020 the fvc of basins in northern shaanxi has risen significantly the fvc of the kuye 0 67 year and wuding 0 69 year river basins has changed in a similar trend with both growing from about 35 to about 50 the fvc of the yanhe river basin increased most rapidly 0 96 year and compared with that in 2000 has grown from 50 to 75 spatially fig 5b the fvc of the yanhe river basin was the largest over years followed by the wuding river basin while that in the kuye river basin was the lowest the fvc values of the three basins are all high in the south while low in the north combined with the above analysis of nd it can be seen that with the increase of vegetation coverage the human water relationship in basins develops towards the mild coordination trend the least squares fitting was used to fit nd and fvc to acquire the regression coefficients a and b the latest research of li et al 2013 shows that the ndvi is linearly correlated with the characteristic parameter n in the budyko equation based on fu s equation likewise nd is also highly correlated with fvc it can be seen from fig 6 that r2 0 80 0 78 and 0 64 respectively for the kuye wuding and yanhe river basins the fitted linear relations of the three basins are nd kuye 4 18fvc1 0 23 nd wuding 2 42fvc2 0 78 and nd yanhe 2 69fvc3 0 86 in these basins nd is positively correlated with fvc especially nd and fvc in the kuye river basin which are highly correlated 4 discussion 4 1 model performance northern shaanxi shares a similar environment while differs from basin to basin in terms of the economic and ecological levels which results in inconsistent social ecological coupling degrees due to the complex interaction between human activities and environment factors many factors cause changes in river basin characteristics zhang et al 2001 it is therefore challenging to determine the extent to which changes in the human water relationship are caused by any one driving factor in consideration of this the established social ecological coupling model was applied to different basins to discuss the human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi during vegetation restoration the model is unique and targeted by selecting driving factors with close correlations the multiple stepwise regression model of a single basin was built to fit the social ecological coupling degree of the human water relationship in basins taking n within the budyko framework as the actual value the verification results of the model are illustrated in fig 7 it can be seen that r2 of each basin is larger than 0 6 which enhances the confidence of simulation experiments of the model in identifying the social ecological coupling system for evaluating the human water relationship in basins within the budyko framework the evaluation results indicate that model simulation can well verify the coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship therefore the newly established model not only well reflects changes in vegetation coverage but also simplifies the expression of the coordinated development of the social ecological system 4 2 sensitivity of nd of basins to vegetation restoration by analyzing characteristics of the human system water system and their coupling system the human water relationship is found to turn from ecological development towards social and economic development that is nd kuye nd wuding and nd yanhe of basins all shift leftwards along the budyko curves under influences of vegetation restoration on the whole fig 8 a from the reference period 1990 2000 to the vegetation restoration period 2000 2020 this indicates that et0 changes in the three basins are more substantial than changes in p jaramillo et al 2022 however for the evaporation rate et p the vertical movement of nd kuye and nd wuding is more obvious than the horizontal movement which suggests significant augmentation of et in the kuye and wuding river basins this indicates that the effect of vegetation restoration in reducing r has exceeded that of climate changes which is consistent with previous results gao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 tian et al 2019 fig 8b shows the elastic changes of nd with fvc in various basins of northern shaanxi during 1960 2020 ec represents changes in nd due to per unit increase in fvc and ec decreases with the enlarging fvc in the basins the ec thresholds appear in the kuye and wuding river basins when fvc is in the range of 51 53 while that of the yanhe river basin occurs when fvc is 65 this suggests that in different spatial scales the conditions for appearance of the threshold may change so the fvc and nd of basins when the threshold appears can be taken as reference for the implementation of vegetation restoration in northern shaanxi fvc in northern shaanxi grew from 29 1 to 50 6 during 1989 1999 fig 5 in particular a significant effect was observed within 2 7 years after implementation of the project in addition as fvc enlarges the sensitivity of nd of basins to vegetation restoration is also enhanced 4 3 evaluation of the social ecological coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi as shown in fig 9 a circles and rhombi in the same color basically exhibit the same trend and changes in the human water relationship and the social ecological coupling coordination degree tend to be consistent and the two are positively correlated kreibich et al 2022 through equal proportion transformation the optimal value for the development of the human water relationship in basins within the budyko framework can be predicted the human system influences attributive characteristics of the water system by implementation of water conservancy projects changes in vegetation coverage and industrial development the evaluation results of the social ecological coupling coordination degree of the human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi are shown in fig 9b on the time scale the coupling coordination degree rose year by year from 1990 to 2020 and the basins are listed in a descending order as the yanhe wuding and kuye river basins in terms of changes in the social ecological coupling coordination degree the coupling coordination degree in 2021 2030 is predicted using arima fig 9b the results show that the social ecological coupling coordination degree in these basins all exhibit an increase trend and will reach 0 7 by 2030 which indicates that the human water relationship may reach moderate coordination in the future on the whole the future development trend of the social ecological system in northern shaanxi is good the coordination among subsystems develops rapidly and the coupling coordination degree increases steadily the three main industries x3 x5 developed rapidly and the proportion of the primary industry x5 diminished the cultivated area x9 and the afforestation area x10 changed in a similar trend the urban population size x1 surged around 2000 accompanied by constant growth of the per capita gdp x2 all these changes cannot be separated from responses to the human system the water system as the basic resources acts on the human system through changes in the p x6 and r x7 compared with the kuye and wuding river basins the yanhe river basin is more greatly affected by human activities and therefore evolves earlier from antagonism to good coordination coupling however the constant economic growth exerts huge influences on the social ecological coupling coordination degree in the various basins and the economic input in ecological restoration will become the main constraint that influences the good coordinated development in northern shaanxi therefore in the future while maintaining the existing development advantages it is necessary to constantly focus on the development of the social economy and ecological environment improvement of economic benefits strengthening of ecological protection and restoration while also paying attention to the coordinated development of the various subsystem 5 conclusions considering development of the human water relationship and especially the complex system within basins as geographical units in norther shaanxi a simple and extensive social ecological coupling model was established based on the coupling coordination degree model the model combines the coupling coordination mechanism of human and water systems within the budyko framework the coordination of the human water relationship in basins in northern shaanxi and the social ecological coupling coordination effect were analyzed the novel social ecological coupling framework correlates human and water in river basins and the model yields favorable evaluation results r2 greater than 0 6 the nd is used to represent the degree of social ecological coupling and coordination of human water relations in the basin which can predict the degree of human water coordination in the future and is more comprehensive the coupling coordination degree between the economic development and the ecological environment constantly rose in 1990 2020 and d evolved from moderate incoordination to mild coordination under interventions from the human system the yanhe river basin was the first to evolved from antagonistic coordination to good coordination and well coupling morphological evolution among the three river basins in norther shaanxi since the implementation of the project of returning farmland to forest and grassland in 2000 fvc has increased significantly in basin in northern shaanxi and the human water relationship in basin has developed to the mild coordination trend meanwhile threshold identification in different basins is also scale dependent with the decreasing latitude and enhanced human activities the fvc and nd grow when the ec threshold appears using arima to predict that the coupling of human water relations will achieve intermediate coordinated development in the future on this basis the social ecological coupling model of the human water relationship in basins within the budyko framework was established which is of important significance for clarifying the future development direction of vegetation restoration in norther shaanxi however the research data are only limited to statistical hydrological data economic indices and ecological

2167,the spatial variability evaluation of hydrometeorological elements under the impact of climate change and human activities is important for the water utilization and management in the river basin in this study a case study is conducted in the daqing river basin dqrb of china the spatial variability index system is constructed in the dqrb and the spatial variability characteristics are comprehensively analyzed and evaluated by geostatistical method and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis model the results show that 1 the nugget to sill ratios of the models selected for different hydrometeorological elements in plain and mountain areas are all less than 75 indicating that the spatial structure of hydrometeorological elements has moderate or strong spatial autocorrelation spa moreover the spatial heterogeneity is strongly influenced by structural property stp 2 the variability is mainly caused by variability component vac and anisotropy ani and the variability intensity vai is the least likely to occur in the spatial variability 3 the hydrometeorological elements in plain and mountain areas are mainly characterized by moderate or moderate strong spatial variability meanwhile the temperature and evaporation in plain area are more likely to have strong spatial variability with comprehensive evaluation scores of 0 691 and 0 634 respectively it shows that the effect of regional climate change is significant and the plain area is more affected and should be paid more attention to this study can provide a new idea for quantitatively evaluating the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in other regions keywords spatial variability hydrometeorological elements index system geostatistical method topsis model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays climate change has become a concerning issue in human society gosling and arnell 2016 under the background of global climate change the temperature shows an increasing trend and the rising temperature plays a key role in precipitation and evaporation huang et al 2015 konapala et al 2020 meanwhile the change in precipitation and evaporation will lead to different degrees of changes in the hydrological cycle process yao et al 2009 wang and alimohammadi 2012 yao et al 2020 in addition human activities such as the construction of water conservancy projects and rapid urbanization will also have a significant impact on watershed underlying surface and hydrological processes hao et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 thus hydrometeorological elements in the basin will have different degrees of spatial variability resulting in a variety of extreme disaster events rainstorms drought high temperature etc which directly or indirectly threaten water security and human survival and development engel et al 2019 therefore it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in the basin which is helpful in correctly implementing relevant policies and measures to ensure the safety of ecosystems and water systems affected by natural factors such as climate change and topography and social factors such as human activities yang et al 2019 jehanzaib et al 2020 the evolution of hydrometeorological elements in the basin is complex and changeable this complex property is manifested not only on the time scale but also on the spatial scale lee et al 2019 this phenomenon is called the spatial and temporal variability of hydrometeorological elements zhou et al 2022 however at present the relevant studies focus on the temporal variability of hydrological or meteorological elements taye and willems 2013 toledo et al 2015 and there are relatively few studies on the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements it is very important to study the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements to analyze the changes in hydrological processes spatial variability theory perez martin et al 2014 zhou and liu 2018 is based on spatial statistics to study the spatial distribution and characteristics of natural phenomena with stp and rap the geostatistical method is based on regionalized variables and provides a basis for quantitative study of spatial variability with the help of the variogram marteau et al 2014 since its appearance in the 1960s geostatistics has been applied to many fields furthermore in previous studies on spatial variability gonga saholiariliva et al 2016 soulis et al 2020 the geostatistical method was mostly used to analyze the correlation and variability of spatial variability however there is a lack of an integrated spatial index system to quantify and comprehensively evaluate the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements the dqrb is located in the middle of the haihe river basin in china and xiongan new area is in the hinterland of the dqrb in recent years extreme hydrological events have occurred frequently in the basin runoff has dropped sharply groundwater overexploitation has been serious and the hydrometeorological elements have shown obvious spatial and temporal variability characteristics zeng et al 2017 jiao et al 2022 especially in the spatial region the characteristics in plain and mountain areas are significantly different it is urgent to identify the spatial variability characteristics of hydrometeorological elements and analyze the main variability factors and quantify the variability li and babovic 2019 therefore a case study is conducted in the dqrd the present study develops a spatial variability evaluation model considering multi dimensional information by integrating geostatistical method entropy weight method and topsis model into the general framework for quantifying spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in this study the novelty of the integrated framework can not only comprehensively identify the spatial variability index of hydrometeorological elements by constructing the index system but also quantitatively evaluate their spatial variability in the changing environment the objective is to construct the spatial variability index system according to the spatial variability characteristics of hydrometeorological elements in the basin and quantify their spatial variability 1 firstly the spatial factors are analyzed based on the geostatistics theory and the reasonable spatial variability index is determined moreover the spatial variability index system is constructed 2 the variogram and kriging interpolation method are used to quantify the spatial variability index and the entropy weight method is used to analyze the importance and impact of each index 3 finally combined with the topsis model the spatial variability index system is comprehensively evaluated and the characteristics and degrees of spatial variability are identified the integrated framework developed in this study provides an effective way to quantify the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the dqrb 113 39 117 34 e 38 23 40 102 n includes plain area and mountain area with a total area of 42972 km2 the plain area is distributed in the eastern region accounting for about 57 of the total watershed area the mountain area is in the west of the basin covering an area of about 18602 km2 tong et al 2021 the precipitation temperature evaporation runoff and groundwater depth from 1974 to 2020 are used among them the precipitation temperature and evaporation are mainly observed from 28 meteorological stations in plain area and 13 meteorological stations in mountain area the evaporation data is the observed values of evaporation pan the groundwater data in plain area mainly refers to baoding water resources bulletin involving 20 gauging stations the runoff data in mountain area is obtained from four hydrological stations fuping daomaguan zhongtangmei and zijinguan the location of the study area and the main stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 geostatistical method the geostatistical method requires variables to show spatial distribution and the variogram is usually used to effectively reveal the spatial structure correlation and characteristics of the variables lebrenz and bardossy 2017 the variogram is based on regionalized variables and can describe both the random and structural changes of regionalized variables the core of geostatistics is to analyze the relationship between spatial attributes and point distance among regionalized variables the formula is 1 γ x h 1 2 e z x z x h 2 where γ x h is the variogram h is the spatial space of sample points called step length z x is the measured value of the variable at point x z x h is the measured value of the variable at the distance h from the point x γ x h is a monotonically increasing function when the distance h exceeds a certain value γ x h will remain near a limit value and will not increase monotonically this phenomenon is called transition phenomenon this limit value is the sill value c 0 c when h tends to 0 lim γ x h c 0 is constant this phenomenon is called nugget effect c 0 is the nugget value furthermore kriging interpolation is the most used interpolation method in geostatistics plouffe et al 2015 in general kriging interpolation is used to estimate the local linear unbiased optimal estimation of regionalized variables at unsampled points by using the original data of regionalized variables and the structural characteristics of the variogram its formula is as follows 2 z x 0 i 1 n λ i z x i where z x 0 is the predicted value at x 0 z x i is the measured value at x i λ i is kriging weight coefficient n is the number of samples 2 2 2 entropy weight method the entropy weight method li et al 2022 was introduced by shannon which is an objective weight determination method in the field of statistics when the data is more dispersed and the entropy is smaller it is considered that the data contains more information so the weight is larger delgado and romero 2016 by judging the dispersion degree of various indexes the shannon entropy is calculated and the weights of different indexes are finally obtained assuming that there are m evaluation objects and n evaluation indexes the matrix of the original data x x ij m n can be expressed as 3 x x 11 x 1 n x m 1 x mn firstly the data of different indexes need to be normalized the max min normalization method is used and the positive indexes are normalized as 4 y ij x ij min x ij max x ij min x ij the negative indexes are normalized as 5 y ij max x ij x ij max x ij min x ij where x ij is the original matrix y ij is the normalized matrix min x ij and max x ij are the minimum and maximum values of the i th item on the j th index all values are between 0 and 1 through normalization and the direction of influence is consistent secondly the characteristic proportion p ij corresponding to the j th index in m items is calculated 6 p ij y ij i 1 m y ij the p ij is used to calculate the entropy p j and the characteristic difference coefficient g j of the j th index 7 p j 1 ln m i 1 m p ij ln p ij 8 g j 1 p j finally the weight w j corresponding to the j th index can be calculated by using the characteristic difference coefficient 9 w j g j j 1 n g j 2 2 3 topsis model the topsis model was proposed by hwang and yoon 1981 according to the closeness of the limited evaluation object and the idealized target by measuring the distance between the evaluation object and the optimal solution and the distance between the evaluation object and the worst solution the evaluation object is finally ranked yang et al 2020 the main calculation steps are as follows 1 standardize the original matrix x with m evaluation objects and n evaluation indexes to obtain the standardized matrix y 10 y y 11 y 1 n y m 1 y mn 2 calculate the optimal solution y and the worst solution y of different evaluation indexes in m objects that is the corresponding maximum and minimum values of each evaluation object the calculation formula is as follows 11 y y 1 y 2 y j y n max y 11 y 21 y m 1 max y 1 j y 2 j y mj max y 1 n y 2 n y mn 12 y y 1 y 2 y j y n min y 11 y 21 y m 1 min y 1 j y 2 j y mj min y 1 n y 2 n y mn 3 the weighted euclidean distance between the i th evaluation object and the optimal solution d i is calculated similarly the weighted euclidean distance between the i th evaluation object and the worst solution d i is determined 13 d i j 1 n w j y ij y j 2 14 d i j 1 n w j y ij y j 2 where w j is the weight of the j th index 4 finally the evaluation score c i of the i th evaluation object can be calculated by using equations 13 and 14 15 c i d i d i d i i 1 2 m according to the evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements the variability levels are divided into five levels the different levels are when the evaluation score is within the interval 0 0 2 it corresponds to no spatial variability in the interval 0 2 0 4 it has weak spatial variability in the interval 0 4 0 6 it has moderate spatial variability in the interval 0 6 0 8 it has moderate strong spatial variability in the interval 0 8 1 it has strong spatial variability 2 3 construction of spatial variability index system based on the characteristics of the variogram in geostatistics the spatial variability index system is constructed from four levels of vac spa ani and vai ① in terms of vac two indexes are selected stp and rap ② in terms of spa autocorrelation degree aud and autocorrelation range aur are selected as indexes ③ in the ani the ani in the four directions of 0 45 90 and 135 is selected the spatial variability index system of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb is established according to the selected indexes as shown in table 1 the meaning and quantification process of different indexes in the criterion layer first level index and index layer second level index are as follows 1 vac and vai the vac includes the variability due to stp and rap in the variogram the ratio of the nugget value c 0 to the sill value c 0 c nugget to sill ratio c 0 c 0 c is used to represent the rap of regionalized variables and the partial sill value c reflects the stp of regionalized variables the sill value reflects the vai of regionalized variables within the study range 2 spc in the spc the range a is used to reflect the aur and the nugget to sill ratio represents the aud if the ratio is less than 25 it shows strong spa the ratio is between 25 and 75 it has moderate spa when the ratio is greater than 75 the spa is very weak the larger the nugget to sill ratio is the more the spatial variability is caused by natural factors and the weaker the spa is on the contrary the spa is stronger 3 ani when the variability of regionalized variables is different in all directions there is ani ani is expressed by the ratio of the primary axis range a 1 to the secondary axis range a 2 the closer the ani ratio is to 1 it indicates that there is no ani in the regionalized variables on the contrary there is ani the four directions of 0 45 90 and 135 are selected to compare the sill values and range values of each direction upward to determine whether it belongs to ani finally according to the research idea of this study the framework of spatial variability evaluation of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb is shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 spatial variability analysis of hydrometeorological elements 3 1 1 spatial variability analysis in plain area the statistical characteristic values of hydrometeorological elements in plain area are shown in table 2 in which k s test is used to determine their normal distribution as shown in table 2 the maximum and minimum values of precipitation and groundwater depth in plain area are quite different indicating that the precipitation and groundwater depth vary greatly in addition the standard deviations of precipitation and evaporation are large indicating that the spatial differences of precipitation and evaporation in each station in the plain area are large the k s test is conducted for different hydrometeorological elements with the significance of 5 two tailed test as the standard since their test values are all less than the critical value 0 237 they obey the normal distribution therefore the geostatistical method can be used to analyze the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in plain area the variograms of hydrometeorological elements in plain area are calculated by geostatistical method the optimal fitting model and parameters are obtained by fitting the theoretical models gaussian exponential and spherical of variograms as shown in table 3 based on the principle that the root mean square rms is the minimum and the standard error of mean sem is the closest to 0 the optimal fitting models of different hydrometeorological elements are selected according to the parameters of different models in plain area table 3 the gaussian model is selected as the best fitting model for precipitation temperature and groundwater depth and the spherical model is selected as the best fitting model for evaporation when the models are selected cross validation is performed on the selected models to determine the overall accuracy of the spatial interpolation the cross validation indexes are shown in table 4 the criteria for the reasonableness of the fitted model and its parameters are as follows the mean error me and sem are close to 0 the root mean square error rmse is as small as possible the mean standard error mse is close to the rmse and the normalized root mean square error nrmse is close to 1 if the mse is greater than the rmse the predicted value is overestimated on the contrary the predicted value is underestimated as can be seen from table 4 the mse and me corresponding to the cross validation of spatial interpolation of hydrometeorological elements in plain area are close to 0 and the mse and rmse are roughly equal moreover the different nrmses are all greater than 1 but they are all close to 1 indicating that the predicted value is more accurate and slightly lower in summary the selections of fitting models and parameters for different hydrometeorological elements in plain area are generally reasonable 1 spc and vai as shown in table 3 for the aud the nugget to sill ratio of the selected model for precipitation in plain area is 9 3 which is less than 25 it indicates that the spatial structure of precipitation has strong spa at the same time the nugget to sill ratios of temperature evaporation and groundwater depth are all between 25 and 75 indicating that the spatial structure of other hydrometeorological elements in plain area has moderate spa for the aur the maximum range of evaporation is 104830 and the minimum range of groundwater depth is 0 51 within the range all the regionalized variables have autocorrelation and the spa gradually decreases with the increase of distance when the distance of spatial points exceeds the range value the regionalized variables no longer have spa 2 vac it can be seen from table 3 that in the variogram the nugget to sill ratio of precipitation in plain area is 9 3 the results show that the spatial heterogeneity caused by random factors accounts for 9 3 of the total spatial heterogeneity while the spatial heterogeneity caused by stp accounts for 90 7 of the total spatial variability therefore the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation in plain area is greatly influenced by the stp and hardly affected by the rap similarly the nugget to sill ratios of temperature evaporation and groundwater depth in plain area are 40 3 29 0 and 39 3 respectively it indicates that their spatial heterogeneity is more affected by stp than rap 3 ani according to the selected directions of 0 45 90 and 135 the ani ratio of each direction is calculated the results are shown in table 5 as can be seen from table 5 the ani ratio of regionalized variables of precipitation and temperature in plain area is close to 1 in the directions of 45 and 135 so there is almost no ani in the directions of 45 and 135 however the ani ratio is not close to 1 in the directions of 0 and 90 and there is ani in the directions of 0 and 90 therefore the spatial variability of regionalized variables in the directions of 0 and 90 is not only related to the distance but also related to the direction between stations in the directions of 45 and 135 there is only isotropy and the spatial variability in the corresponding directions is similar similarly for the evaporation and groundwater depth in plain area the ani ratios in the four directions are all significantly different from 1 therefore there is ani for regionalized variables in the selected directions it shows that the spatial variability of evaporation and groundwater depth in the selected directions is not only related to distance but also related to the direction between stations 3 1 2 spatial variability analysis in mountain area the characteristic values of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area are calculated and their normal distribution is tested the results are shown in table 6 the standard deviation of precipitation and evaporation in mountain area is larger indicating that the spatial difference of precipitation and evaporation in each station is larger at the 5 significant level the k s test values of precipitation evaporation and runoff are all less than the critical value 0 237 so they conform to the normal distribution the k s test value of temperature is greater than the critical value which does not obey the normal distribution but obeys the normal distribution after box cox transformation after the k s test the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area can be analyzed by geostatistical method according to the data of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area the corresponding variograms are calculated and the optimal fitting model is analyzed table 7 the model selection principle is similar to that of the plain area it can be seen from table 7 that in mountain area the spherical model is selected as the optimal model for precipitation the gaussian model is selected as the optimal model for evaporation and runoff and the exponential model is selected as the optimal model for temperature similarly cross validation is performed on the selected models and the cross validation values are shown in table 8 in table 8 the sem and the me of the cross validation of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area are close to 0 the mse and rmse are basically equal and the nrmse is close to 1 in general it meets the judging criteria therefore the selection of the fitting model and its parameters in mountain area is reasonable in addition the mse of temperature is larger than the rmse and the nrmse is less than 1 it shows that the predicted value of temperature in mountain area is overestimated similarly the predicted values of precipitation evaporation and runoff are underestimated however the corresponding nrmses are close to 1 the overall prediction error is small and the models are reasonable 1 spc and vai as can be seen from table 7 for the spc the nugget to sill ratio for the selected model of temperature is 0 indicating that the spatial structure of temperature in mountain area has strong spa similarly the spatial structure of precipitation evaporation and runoff in mountain area has moderate spa for the aur the range of temperature in mountain area is the largest and the range of runoff in mountain area is the smallest within the range the regional variables all have autocorrelation and the spa gradually decreases with the increase of distance 2 vac as shown in table 7 the nugget to sill ratios of precipitation and runoff in mountain area are 51 0 and 57 1 respectively indicating that their spatial heterogeneity is greatly affected by rap and less affected by stp the nugget to sill ratio of evaporation in mountain area is 30 0 indicating that the spatial heterogeneity is more influenced by stp than rap therefore the variability caused by the stp accounts for the main part of the spatial variability of evaporation in mountain area at the same time the spatial variability of temperature in mountain area is completely caused by stp 3 ani the ani ratios of hydrometeorological elements in different directions in mountain area are shown in table 9 for precipitation and runoff in mountain area the ani ratio of regionalized variables in the directions of 0 and 90 is close to 1 table 9 thus there is only isotropy in the directions of 0 and 90 with similar spatial variability in the corresponding directions however the ani ratio is not close to 1 in the directions of 45 and 135 where ani exists the spatial variability in the directions of 45 and 135 is not only related to distance but also the direction between stations similarly the ani ratios of temperature and evaporation in the directions of 0 45 90 and 135 are significantly different from 1 and the regionalized variables have ani in the four directions 3 2 spatial variability evaluation of hydrometeorological elements 3 2 1 spatial variability evaluation in plain area 3 2 1 1 importance analysis of different indexes in plain area according to the entropy weight method the weight of each index of the spatial variability in plain area is calculated and the results are shown in fig 3 1 among the first level indexes of hydrometeorological elements in plain area the ani has the largest weight and the vai has the smallest weight it shows that in the hydrometeorological elements in plain area the variability caused by ani is the main spatial variability form and the vai is the least likely to occur in the spatial variability meanwhile in precipitation and temperature the spatial variability caused by vac is also easy to occur in evaporation and groundwater depth the weight of variability caused by spc is also large which should be paid attention to 2 according to the weights of the second level indexes in the vac except for evaporation the stp of other hydrometeorological elements in plain area has a large weight it shows that the vac in the spatial variability is mainly caused by stp however the weight of rap in evaporation is 0 75 indicating that the vac is mainly caused by rap in the spc the aud of precipitation and temperature has a larger weight while the aur of evaporation and groundwater depth has a larger weight therefore in plain area precipitation and temperature are greatly affected by the aud while evaporation and groundwater depth are greatly affected by aur in the ani precipitation and temperature are mainly reflected in the direction of 0 evaporation is mainly manifested in the direction of 135 and groundwater depth is mainly expressed in the direction of 90 3 2 1 2 comprehensive evaluation of spatial variability in plain area the topsis model is used to comprehensively evaluate the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in plain area and the results are shown in fig 4 fig 4 illustrates that the evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements in plain area are mainly concentrated between 0 4 and 0 8 and only in a few years are at the levels of 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 1 it indicates that they have moderate or moderate strong spatial variability the spatial variability of precipitation in plain area is the smallest in 2004 with the lowest evaluation score of 0 359 meanwhile except for precipitation the evaluation scores of the temperature evaporation and groundwater depth in plain area are mostly greater than 0 6 especially for temperature and evaporation there are 37 years and 26 years with the evaluation scores greater than 0 6 in the statistical period respectively their annual mean evaluation scores are 0 691 and 0 634 which belong to a relatively strong degree of spatial variability the lowest score of temperature is 0 467 in 2010 and the lowest score of evaporation is 0 461 in 1985 which show moderate spatial variability although the spatial variability of temperature and evaporation in corresponding years is the smallest their evaluation scores are large in general the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in plain area is relatively strong furthermore the evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements in plain area change relatively uniformly before 1995 but fluctuate greatly after 1995 it shows that after 1995 with the development of the social economy the intensification of climate change and human activities the spatial difference of hydrometeorological elements in plain area is relatively large and the change of spatial variability is obvious 3 2 2 spatial variability evaluation in mountain area 3 2 2 1 importance analysis of different indexes in mountain area similarly the weights of spatial variability indexes in mountain area are calculated as shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that 1 among the first level indexes for precipitation and evaporation in mountain area the weights of vac and ani are larger and the weight of vai is the smallest in the temperature the weight of ani and spc is larger in the runoff the spc and vac have a larger weight it shows that the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area is mainly caused by vac and ani moreover the weight of vai in the first level indexes is the smallest indicating that it is the least important and least likely to occur in spatial variability 2 among the secondary indexes the stp of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area has a larger weight for the vac it shows that in the spatial variability the vac is mainly caused by stp and is relatively less affected by rap in precipitation and evaporation the weight of stp is larger which is 0 76 and 0 93 respectively in the spc except for precipitation the aur of temperature evaporation and runoff in mountain area has a larger weight therefore precipitation is greatly affected by the aud while other hydrometeorological elements are greatly affected by the aur in the ani precipitation and evaporation are mainly reflected in the direction of 0 and 135 temperature is mainly expressed in the direction of 45 and 90 and runoff is mainly performed in the direction of 0 and 45 3 2 2 2 comprehensive evaluation of spatial variability in mountain area the comprehensive evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area are shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 the spatial variability of precipitation in mountain area in 1994 is the largest with the highest evaluation score of 0 853 the evaluation scores of the precipitation are mainly concentrated between 0 4 and 0 6 and the average annual evaluation score is 0 479 which generally shows moderate spatial variability similarly the evaluation scores of the evaporation in mountain area are mainly at the level of 0 2 to 0 4 and only a few years are greater than 0 4 the average annual evaluation score of the evaporation is 0 367 which shows weak spatial variability similar to evaporation the evaluation scores of the spatial variability of runoff are also small with an average annual evaluation score of 0 223 thus the spatial variability of runoff is also weak however for temperature only in 2013 the evaluation score of the spatial variability is less than 0 4 which is 0 370 and most of them are between 0 6 and 0 8 the average annual evaluation score is 0 604 which is a moderate strong degree of spatial variability in summary the evaluation score of the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area is smaller than that in plain area and the overall spatial variability is smaller it shows that the mountain area is closer to the natural state while the hydrometeorological elements in plain area are more affected and disturbed by climate change and human activities and they are more prone to spatial variability 4 discussion accurate and reasonable spatial variability evaluation of hydrometeorological elements is an important basis for understanding the changes in hydrological processes which is conducive to regional sustainable development and sustainable water utilization however previous studies chang et al 2014 maier et al 2020 sang et al 2022 mostly focused on the spatial variability of individual hydrometeorological elements which was not holistically considered and did not involve the whole hydrological process in addition the evaluation index system of spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements is not perfect and there is a lack of effective quantitative evaluation means of spatial variability compared with previous studies the spatial variability index system constructed in this study can comprehensively quantify and evaluate the spatial variability of different hydrometeorological elements zhao et al 2015 alemayehu et al 2022 the main contributions of this study are 1 the spatial variability index system and evaluation model are constructed to reveal the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements which makes up for the deficiencies in the research index and variability evaluation of regional hydrometeorological elements over the years 2 the spatial variability characteristics and variability degree of main hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb are identified which can better guide the utilization and protection of water resources as well as the production and development of agriculture and animal husbandry and formulate reasonable policies and schemes 3 moreover the quantitative evaluation framework of spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements mainly relies on the combined application of geostatistical method entropy weight method and topsis model which has strong applicability and can be used to comprehensively analyze the spatial variability characteristics of other regions the heterogeneity and complexity of the spatial distribution of hydrometeorological elements and their attributes in the dqrb indicate that the hydrometeorological elements at different stations vary greatly furthermore the spatial variability caused by structural factors plays a dominant role which is mainly affected by the natural geographical environment of the study area such as topography temperature solar radiation etc the long term structural phenomena of these natural conditions lead to their spatial variability inevitably restricted by natural factors in addition the evaluation scores of the spatial variability have a great fluctuation after 1995 it shows that under the combined influence of climate change and human activities the spatial variability of regional hydrometeorological elements is relatively large moreover the evaluation score of the spatial variability in plain area is higher indicating that the plain area is more affected by natural and social factors the plain area has a large population and complex social environment while the mountain area is closer to the natural state indicating that the spatial variability is mainly affected by social factors such as human activities at the same time temperature and evaporation are more likely to show strong spatial variability than other hydrometeorological elements it shows that meteorological elements are more sensitive and easily affected by natural and social factors and then there is a strong spatial variability therefore more attention should be paid to the protection of water resources and ecological environment in plain area so as to avoid the influence of excessive human activities on the hydrological cycle and the strong spatial and temporal variability of regional hydrometeorological elements however there are several limitations in this study firstly when calculating the spatial variability of regionalized variables the results will be affected by the number of stations and their spatial distribution the less distribution of meteorological and hydrological stations in mountain area and the lack of groundwater gauging stations in the eastern plain area will have a certain impact on the results at the same time when evaluating the indexes of spatial variability there is a lack of comparison for building the numerical simulation model based on physical mechanisms to evaluate the spatial variability nonetheless the present study meets the established objectives and the results are reasonable and accurate the results would be more reliable and richer if these defects were taken into account the improvement of these limitations will be the next research work 5 conclusions in this study the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb is analyzed to explore the degree of spatial variability in plain and mountain areas the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the spatial variability precipitation temperature evaporation groundwater depth and runoff in plain and mountain areas all have moderate or strong spa moreover all the regionalized variables have spa in the range for the vac it can be seen from the nugget to sill ratio and weight that the spatial heterogeneity of hydrometeorological elements in plain and mountain areas is greatly affected by stp and the spatial variability caused by stp is dominant 2 the precipitation and temperature in plain area are isotropic in the directions of 45 and 135 and they are anisotropic in the directions of 0 and 90 meanwhile precipitation and runoff in mountain area are isotropic in the directions of 0 and 90 and anisotropic in the directions of 45 and 135 the evaporation and groundwater depth in plain area and the temperature and evaporation in mountain area are anisotropic in the selected four directions in the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb the variability caused by the vac and ani is the main variability form and the vai is the least likely to occur in the spatial variability 3 the evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements in plain and mountain areas are mainly concentrated between 0 4 and 0 8 with moderate or moderate strong spatial variability in particular the spatial variability of temperature is large the evaluation scores of the temperature in plain area and mountain area are 0 691 and 0 604 respectively which show moderate strong spatial variability furthermore the spatial variability of runoff is weak and the evaluation score is 0 223 in summary due to the influence of climate change and human activities the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in plain area is higher than that in mountain area meteorological elements such as temperature and evaporation are more likely to have strong spatial variability and should be paid special attention to by analyzing the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb it is helpful to deeply understand the regional hydrological cycle process and the change of characteristics and improve the ability to deal with hydrological variability and climate change at the same time it also has important guiding significance for the rational allocation of water resources and the coordinated development of regional social economy and ecological

2167,the spatial variability evaluation of hydrometeorological elements under the impact of climate change and human activities is important for the water utilization and management in the river basin in this study a case study is conducted in the daqing river basin dqrb of china the spatial variability index system is constructed in the dqrb and the spatial variability characteristics are comprehensively analyzed and evaluated by geostatistical method and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis model the results show that 1 the nugget to sill ratios of the models selected for different hydrometeorological elements in plain and mountain areas are all less than 75 indicating that the spatial structure of hydrometeorological elements has moderate or strong spatial autocorrelation spa moreover the spatial heterogeneity is strongly influenced by structural property stp 2 the variability is mainly caused by variability component vac and anisotropy ani and the variability intensity vai is the least likely to occur in the spatial variability 3 the hydrometeorological elements in plain and mountain areas are mainly characterized by moderate or moderate strong spatial variability meanwhile the temperature and evaporation in plain area are more likely to have strong spatial variability with comprehensive evaluation scores of 0 691 and 0 634 respectively it shows that the effect of regional climate change is significant and the plain area is more affected and should be paid more attention to this study can provide a new idea for quantitatively evaluating the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in other regions keywords spatial variability hydrometeorological elements index system geostatistical method topsis model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays climate change has become a concerning issue in human society gosling and arnell 2016 under the background of global climate change the temperature shows an increasing trend and the rising temperature plays a key role in precipitation and evaporation huang et al 2015 konapala et al 2020 meanwhile the change in precipitation and evaporation will lead to different degrees of changes in the hydrological cycle process yao et al 2009 wang and alimohammadi 2012 yao et al 2020 in addition human activities such as the construction of water conservancy projects and rapid urbanization will also have a significant impact on watershed underlying surface and hydrological processes hao et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 thus hydrometeorological elements in the basin will have different degrees of spatial variability resulting in a variety of extreme disaster events rainstorms drought high temperature etc which directly or indirectly threaten water security and human survival and development engel et al 2019 therefore it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in the basin which is helpful in correctly implementing relevant policies and measures to ensure the safety of ecosystems and water systems affected by natural factors such as climate change and topography and social factors such as human activities yang et al 2019 jehanzaib et al 2020 the evolution of hydrometeorological elements in the basin is complex and changeable this complex property is manifested not only on the time scale but also on the spatial scale lee et al 2019 this phenomenon is called the spatial and temporal variability of hydrometeorological elements zhou et al 2022 however at present the relevant studies focus on the temporal variability of hydrological or meteorological elements taye and willems 2013 toledo et al 2015 and there are relatively few studies on the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements it is very important to study the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements to analyze the changes in hydrological processes spatial variability theory perez martin et al 2014 zhou and liu 2018 is based on spatial statistics to study the spatial distribution and characteristics of natural phenomena with stp and rap the geostatistical method is based on regionalized variables and provides a basis for quantitative study of spatial variability with the help of the variogram marteau et al 2014 since its appearance in the 1960s geostatistics has been applied to many fields furthermore in previous studies on spatial variability gonga saholiariliva et al 2016 soulis et al 2020 the geostatistical method was mostly used to analyze the correlation and variability of spatial variability however there is a lack of an integrated spatial index system to quantify and comprehensively evaluate the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements the dqrb is located in the middle of the haihe river basin in china and xiongan new area is in the hinterland of the dqrb in recent years extreme hydrological events have occurred frequently in the basin runoff has dropped sharply groundwater overexploitation has been serious and the hydrometeorological elements have shown obvious spatial and temporal variability characteristics zeng et al 2017 jiao et al 2022 especially in the spatial region the characteristics in plain and mountain areas are significantly different it is urgent to identify the spatial variability characteristics of hydrometeorological elements and analyze the main variability factors and quantify the variability li and babovic 2019 therefore a case study is conducted in the dqrd the present study develops a spatial variability evaluation model considering multi dimensional information by integrating geostatistical method entropy weight method and topsis model into the general framework for quantifying spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in this study the novelty of the integrated framework can not only comprehensively identify the spatial variability index of hydrometeorological elements by constructing the index system but also quantitatively evaluate their spatial variability in the changing environment the objective is to construct the spatial variability index system according to the spatial variability characteristics of hydrometeorological elements in the basin and quantify their spatial variability 1 firstly the spatial factors are analyzed based on the geostatistics theory and the reasonable spatial variability index is determined moreover the spatial variability index system is constructed 2 the variogram and kriging interpolation method are used to quantify the spatial variability index and the entropy weight method is used to analyze the importance and impact of each index 3 finally combined with the topsis model the spatial variability index system is comprehensively evaluated and the characteristics and degrees of spatial variability are identified the integrated framework developed in this study provides an effective way to quantify the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the dqrb 113 39 117 34 e 38 23 40 102 n includes plain area and mountain area with a total area of 42972 km2 the plain area is distributed in the eastern region accounting for about 57 of the total watershed area the mountain area is in the west of the basin covering an area of about 18602 km2 tong et al 2021 the precipitation temperature evaporation runoff and groundwater depth from 1974 to 2020 are used among them the precipitation temperature and evaporation are mainly observed from 28 meteorological stations in plain area and 13 meteorological stations in mountain area the evaporation data is the observed values of evaporation pan the groundwater data in plain area mainly refers to baoding water resources bulletin involving 20 gauging stations the runoff data in mountain area is obtained from four hydrological stations fuping daomaguan zhongtangmei and zijinguan the location of the study area and the main stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 geostatistical method the geostatistical method requires variables to show spatial distribution and the variogram is usually used to effectively reveal the spatial structure correlation and characteristics of the variables lebrenz and bardossy 2017 the variogram is based on regionalized variables and can describe both the random and structural changes of regionalized variables the core of geostatistics is to analyze the relationship between spatial attributes and point distance among regionalized variables the formula is 1 γ x h 1 2 e z x z x h 2 where γ x h is the variogram h is the spatial space of sample points called step length z x is the measured value of the variable at point x z x h is the measured value of the variable at the distance h from the point x γ x h is a monotonically increasing function when the distance h exceeds a certain value γ x h will remain near a limit value and will not increase monotonically this phenomenon is called transition phenomenon this limit value is the sill value c 0 c when h tends to 0 lim γ x h c 0 is constant this phenomenon is called nugget effect c 0 is the nugget value furthermore kriging interpolation is the most used interpolation method in geostatistics plouffe et al 2015 in general kriging interpolation is used to estimate the local linear unbiased optimal estimation of regionalized variables at unsampled points by using the original data of regionalized variables and the structural characteristics of the variogram its formula is as follows 2 z x 0 i 1 n λ i z x i where z x 0 is the predicted value at x 0 z x i is the measured value at x i λ i is kriging weight coefficient n is the number of samples 2 2 2 entropy weight method the entropy weight method li et al 2022 was introduced by shannon which is an objective weight determination method in the field of statistics when the data is more dispersed and the entropy is smaller it is considered that the data contains more information so the weight is larger delgado and romero 2016 by judging the dispersion degree of various indexes the shannon entropy is calculated and the weights of different indexes are finally obtained assuming that there are m evaluation objects and n evaluation indexes the matrix of the original data x x ij m n can be expressed as 3 x x 11 x 1 n x m 1 x mn firstly the data of different indexes need to be normalized the max min normalization method is used and the positive indexes are normalized as 4 y ij x ij min x ij max x ij min x ij the negative indexes are normalized as 5 y ij max x ij x ij max x ij min x ij where x ij is the original matrix y ij is the normalized matrix min x ij and max x ij are the minimum and maximum values of the i th item on the j th index all values are between 0 and 1 through normalization and the direction of influence is consistent secondly the characteristic proportion p ij corresponding to the j th index in m items is calculated 6 p ij y ij i 1 m y ij the p ij is used to calculate the entropy p j and the characteristic difference coefficient g j of the j th index 7 p j 1 ln m i 1 m p ij ln p ij 8 g j 1 p j finally the weight w j corresponding to the j th index can be calculated by using the characteristic difference coefficient 9 w j g j j 1 n g j 2 2 3 topsis model the topsis model was proposed by hwang and yoon 1981 according to the closeness of the limited evaluation object and the idealized target by measuring the distance between the evaluation object and the optimal solution and the distance between the evaluation object and the worst solution the evaluation object is finally ranked yang et al 2020 the main calculation steps are as follows 1 standardize the original matrix x with m evaluation objects and n evaluation indexes to obtain the standardized matrix y 10 y y 11 y 1 n y m 1 y mn 2 calculate the optimal solution y and the worst solution y of different evaluation indexes in m objects that is the corresponding maximum and minimum values of each evaluation object the calculation formula is as follows 11 y y 1 y 2 y j y n max y 11 y 21 y m 1 max y 1 j y 2 j y mj max y 1 n y 2 n y mn 12 y y 1 y 2 y j y n min y 11 y 21 y m 1 min y 1 j y 2 j y mj min y 1 n y 2 n y mn 3 the weighted euclidean distance between the i th evaluation object and the optimal solution d i is calculated similarly the weighted euclidean distance between the i th evaluation object and the worst solution d i is determined 13 d i j 1 n w j y ij y j 2 14 d i j 1 n w j y ij y j 2 where w j is the weight of the j th index 4 finally the evaluation score c i of the i th evaluation object can be calculated by using equations 13 and 14 15 c i d i d i d i i 1 2 m according to the evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements the variability levels are divided into five levels the different levels are when the evaluation score is within the interval 0 0 2 it corresponds to no spatial variability in the interval 0 2 0 4 it has weak spatial variability in the interval 0 4 0 6 it has moderate spatial variability in the interval 0 6 0 8 it has moderate strong spatial variability in the interval 0 8 1 it has strong spatial variability 2 3 construction of spatial variability index system based on the characteristics of the variogram in geostatistics the spatial variability index system is constructed from four levels of vac spa ani and vai ① in terms of vac two indexes are selected stp and rap ② in terms of spa autocorrelation degree aud and autocorrelation range aur are selected as indexes ③ in the ani the ani in the four directions of 0 45 90 and 135 is selected the spatial variability index system of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb is established according to the selected indexes as shown in table 1 the meaning and quantification process of different indexes in the criterion layer first level index and index layer second level index are as follows 1 vac and vai the vac includes the variability due to stp and rap in the variogram the ratio of the nugget value c 0 to the sill value c 0 c nugget to sill ratio c 0 c 0 c is used to represent the rap of regionalized variables and the partial sill value c reflects the stp of regionalized variables the sill value reflects the vai of regionalized variables within the study range 2 spc in the spc the range a is used to reflect the aur and the nugget to sill ratio represents the aud if the ratio is less than 25 it shows strong spa the ratio is between 25 and 75 it has moderate spa when the ratio is greater than 75 the spa is very weak the larger the nugget to sill ratio is the more the spatial variability is caused by natural factors and the weaker the spa is on the contrary the spa is stronger 3 ani when the variability of regionalized variables is different in all directions there is ani ani is expressed by the ratio of the primary axis range a 1 to the secondary axis range a 2 the closer the ani ratio is to 1 it indicates that there is no ani in the regionalized variables on the contrary there is ani the four directions of 0 45 90 and 135 are selected to compare the sill values and range values of each direction upward to determine whether it belongs to ani finally according to the research idea of this study the framework of spatial variability evaluation of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb is shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 spatial variability analysis of hydrometeorological elements 3 1 1 spatial variability analysis in plain area the statistical characteristic values of hydrometeorological elements in plain area are shown in table 2 in which k s test is used to determine their normal distribution as shown in table 2 the maximum and minimum values of precipitation and groundwater depth in plain area are quite different indicating that the precipitation and groundwater depth vary greatly in addition the standard deviations of precipitation and evaporation are large indicating that the spatial differences of precipitation and evaporation in each station in the plain area are large the k s test is conducted for different hydrometeorological elements with the significance of 5 two tailed test as the standard since their test values are all less than the critical value 0 237 they obey the normal distribution therefore the geostatistical method can be used to analyze the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in plain area the variograms of hydrometeorological elements in plain area are calculated by geostatistical method the optimal fitting model and parameters are obtained by fitting the theoretical models gaussian exponential and spherical of variograms as shown in table 3 based on the principle that the root mean square rms is the minimum and the standard error of mean sem is the closest to 0 the optimal fitting models of different hydrometeorological elements are selected according to the parameters of different models in plain area table 3 the gaussian model is selected as the best fitting model for precipitation temperature and groundwater depth and the spherical model is selected as the best fitting model for evaporation when the models are selected cross validation is performed on the selected models to determine the overall accuracy of the spatial interpolation the cross validation indexes are shown in table 4 the criteria for the reasonableness of the fitted model and its parameters are as follows the mean error me and sem are close to 0 the root mean square error rmse is as small as possible the mean standard error mse is close to the rmse and the normalized root mean square error nrmse is close to 1 if the mse is greater than the rmse the predicted value is overestimated on the contrary the predicted value is underestimated as can be seen from table 4 the mse and me corresponding to the cross validation of spatial interpolation of hydrometeorological elements in plain area are close to 0 and the mse and rmse are roughly equal moreover the different nrmses are all greater than 1 but they are all close to 1 indicating that the predicted value is more accurate and slightly lower in summary the selections of fitting models and parameters for different hydrometeorological elements in plain area are generally reasonable 1 spc and vai as shown in table 3 for the aud the nugget to sill ratio of the selected model for precipitation in plain area is 9 3 which is less than 25 it indicates that the spatial structure of precipitation has strong spa at the same time the nugget to sill ratios of temperature evaporation and groundwater depth are all between 25 and 75 indicating that the spatial structure of other hydrometeorological elements in plain area has moderate spa for the aur the maximum range of evaporation is 104830 and the minimum range of groundwater depth is 0 51 within the range all the regionalized variables have autocorrelation and the spa gradually decreases with the increase of distance when the distance of spatial points exceeds the range value the regionalized variables no longer have spa 2 vac it can be seen from table 3 that in the variogram the nugget to sill ratio of precipitation in plain area is 9 3 the results show that the spatial heterogeneity caused by random factors accounts for 9 3 of the total spatial heterogeneity while the spatial heterogeneity caused by stp accounts for 90 7 of the total spatial variability therefore the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation in plain area is greatly influenced by the stp and hardly affected by the rap similarly the nugget to sill ratios of temperature evaporation and groundwater depth in plain area are 40 3 29 0 and 39 3 respectively it indicates that their spatial heterogeneity is more affected by stp than rap 3 ani according to the selected directions of 0 45 90 and 135 the ani ratio of each direction is calculated the results are shown in table 5 as can be seen from table 5 the ani ratio of regionalized variables of precipitation and temperature in plain area is close to 1 in the directions of 45 and 135 so there is almost no ani in the directions of 45 and 135 however the ani ratio is not close to 1 in the directions of 0 and 90 and there is ani in the directions of 0 and 90 therefore the spatial variability of regionalized variables in the directions of 0 and 90 is not only related to the distance but also related to the direction between stations in the directions of 45 and 135 there is only isotropy and the spatial variability in the corresponding directions is similar similarly for the evaporation and groundwater depth in plain area the ani ratios in the four directions are all significantly different from 1 therefore there is ani for regionalized variables in the selected directions it shows that the spatial variability of evaporation and groundwater depth in the selected directions is not only related to distance but also related to the direction between stations 3 1 2 spatial variability analysis in mountain area the characteristic values of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area are calculated and their normal distribution is tested the results are shown in table 6 the standard deviation of precipitation and evaporation in mountain area is larger indicating that the spatial difference of precipitation and evaporation in each station is larger at the 5 significant level the k s test values of precipitation evaporation and runoff are all less than the critical value 0 237 so they conform to the normal distribution the k s test value of temperature is greater than the critical value which does not obey the normal distribution but obeys the normal distribution after box cox transformation after the k s test the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area can be analyzed by geostatistical method according to the data of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area the corresponding variograms are calculated and the optimal fitting model is analyzed table 7 the model selection principle is similar to that of the plain area it can be seen from table 7 that in mountain area the spherical model is selected as the optimal model for precipitation the gaussian model is selected as the optimal model for evaporation and runoff and the exponential model is selected as the optimal model for temperature similarly cross validation is performed on the selected models and the cross validation values are shown in table 8 in table 8 the sem and the me of the cross validation of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area are close to 0 the mse and rmse are basically equal and the nrmse is close to 1 in general it meets the judging criteria therefore the selection of the fitting model and its parameters in mountain area is reasonable in addition the mse of temperature is larger than the rmse and the nrmse is less than 1 it shows that the predicted value of temperature in mountain area is overestimated similarly the predicted values of precipitation evaporation and runoff are underestimated however the corresponding nrmses are close to 1 the overall prediction error is small and the models are reasonable 1 spc and vai as can be seen from table 7 for the spc the nugget to sill ratio for the selected model of temperature is 0 indicating that the spatial structure of temperature in mountain area has strong spa similarly the spatial structure of precipitation evaporation and runoff in mountain area has moderate spa for the aur the range of temperature in mountain area is the largest and the range of runoff in mountain area is the smallest within the range the regional variables all have autocorrelation and the spa gradually decreases with the increase of distance 2 vac as shown in table 7 the nugget to sill ratios of precipitation and runoff in mountain area are 51 0 and 57 1 respectively indicating that their spatial heterogeneity is greatly affected by rap and less affected by stp the nugget to sill ratio of evaporation in mountain area is 30 0 indicating that the spatial heterogeneity is more influenced by stp than rap therefore the variability caused by the stp accounts for the main part of the spatial variability of evaporation in mountain area at the same time the spatial variability of temperature in mountain area is completely caused by stp 3 ani the ani ratios of hydrometeorological elements in different directions in mountain area are shown in table 9 for precipitation and runoff in mountain area the ani ratio of regionalized variables in the directions of 0 and 90 is close to 1 table 9 thus there is only isotropy in the directions of 0 and 90 with similar spatial variability in the corresponding directions however the ani ratio is not close to 1 in the directions of 45 and 135 where ani exists the spatial variability in the directions of 45 and 135 is not only related to distance but also the direction between stations similarly the ani ratios of temperature and evaporation in the directions of 0 45 90 and 135 are significantly different from 1 and the regionalized variables have ani in the four directions 3 2 spatial variability evaluation of hydrometeorological elements 3 2 1 spatial variability evaluation in plain area 3 2 1 1 importance analysis of different indexes in plain area according to the entropy weight method the weight of each index of the spatial variability in plain area is calculated and the results are shown in fig 3 1 among the first level indexes of hydrometeorological elements in plain area the ani has the largest weight and the vai has the smallest weight it shows that in the hydrometeorological elements in plain area the variability caused by ani is the main spatial variability form and the vai is the least likely to occur in the spatial variability meanwhile in precipitation and temperature the spatial variability caused by vac is also easy to occur in evaporation and groundwater depth the weight of variability caused by spc is also large which should be paid attention to 2 according to the weights of the second level indexes in the vac except for evaporation the stp of other hydrometeorological elements in plain area has a large weight it shows that the vac in the spatial variability is mainly caused by stp however the weight of rap in evaporation is 0 75 indicating that the vac is mainly caused by rap in the spc the aud of precipitation and temperature has a larger weight while the aur of evaporation and groundwater depth has a larger weight therefore in plain area precipitation and temperature are greatly affected by the aud while evaporation and groundwater depth are greatly affected by aur in the ani precipitation and temperature are mainly reflected in the direction of 0 evaporation is mainly manifested in the direction of 135 and groundwater depth is mainly expressed in the direction of 90 3 2 1 2 comprehensive evaluation of spatial variability in plain area the topsis model is used to comprehensively evaluate the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in plain area and the results are shown in fig 4 fig 4 illustrates that the evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements in plain area are mainly concentrated between 0 4 and 0 8 and only in a few years are at the levels of 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 1 it indicates that they have moderate or moderate strong spatial variability the spatial variability of precipitation in plain area is the smallest in 2004 with the lowest evaluation score of 0 359 meanwhile except for precipitation the evaluation scores of the temperature evaporation and groundwater depth in plain area are mostly greater than 0 6 especially for temperature and evaporation there are 37 years and 26 years with the evaluation scores greater than 0 6 in the statistical period respectively their annual mean evaluation scores are 0 691 and 0 634 which belong to a relatively strong degree of spatial variability the lowest score of temperature is 0 467 in 2010 and the lowest score of evaporation is 0 461 in 1985 which show moderate spatial variability although the spatial variability of temperature and evaporation in corresponding years is the smallest their evaluation scores are large in general the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in plain area is relatively strong furthermore the evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements in plain area change relatively uniformly before 1995 but fluctuate greatly after 1995 it shows that after 1995 with the development of the social economy the intensification of climate change and human activities the spatial difference of hydrometeorological elements in plain area is relatively large and the change of spatial variability is obvious 3 2 2 spatial variability evaluation in mountain area 3 2 2 1 importance analysis of different indexes in mountain area similarly the weights of spatial variability indexes in mountain area are calculated as shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that 1 among the first level indexes for precipitation and evaporation in mountain area the weights of vac and ani are larger and the weight of vai is the smallest in the temperature the weight of ani and spc is larger in the runoff the spc and vac have a larger weight it shows that the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area is mainly caused by vac and ani moreover the weight of vai in the first level indexes is the smallest indicating that it is the least important and least likely to occur in spatial variability 2 among the secondary indexes the stp of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area has a larger weight for the vac it shows that in the spatial variability the vac is mainly caused by stp and is relatively less affected by rap in precipitation and evaporation the weight of stp is larger which is 0 76 and 0 93 respectively in the spc except for precipitation the aur of temperature evaporation and runoff in mountain area has a larger weight therefore precipitation is greatly affected by the aud while other hydrometeorological elements are greatly affected by the aur in the ani precipitation and evaporation are mainly reflected in the direction of 0 and 135 temperature is mainly expressed in the direction of 45 and 90 and runoff is mainly performed in the direction of 0 and 45 3 2 2 2 comprehensive evaluation of spatial variability in mountain area the comprehensive evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area are shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 the spatial variability of precipitation in mountain area in 1994 is the largest with the highest evaluation score of 0 853 the evaluation scores of the precipitation are mainly concentrated between 0 4 and 0 6 and the average annual evaluation score is 0 479 which generally shows moderate spatial variability similarly the evaluation scores of the evaporation in mountain area are mainly at the level of 0 2 to 0 4 and only a few years are greater than 0 4 the average annual evaluation score of the evaporation is 0 367 which shows weak spatial variability similar to evaporation the evaluation scores of the spatial variability of runoff are also small with an average annual evaluation score of 0 223 thus the spatial variability of runoff is also weak however for temperature only in 2013 the evaluation score of the spatial variability is less than 0 4 which is 0 370 and most of them are between 0 6 and 0 8 the average annual evaluation score is 0 604 which is a moderate strong degree of spatial variability in summary the evaluation score of the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in mountain area is smaller than that in plain area and the overall spatial variability is smaller it shows that the mountain area is closer to the natural state while the hydrometeorological elements in plain area are more affected and disturbed by climate change and human activities and they are more prone to spatial variability 4 discussion accurate and reasonable spatial variability evaluation of hydrometeorological elements is an important basis for understanding the changes in hydrological processes which is conducive to regional sustainable development and sustainable water utilization however previous studies chang et al 2014 maier et al 2020 sang et al 2022 mostly focused on the spatial variability of individual hydrometeorological elements which was not holistically considered and did not involve the whole hydrological process in addition the evaluation index system of spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements is not perfect and there is a lack of effective quantitative evaluation means of spatial variability compared with previous studies the spatial variability index system constructed in this study can comprehensively quantify and evaluate the spatial variability of different hydrometeorological elements zhao et al 2015 alemayehu et al 2022 the main contributions of this study are 1 the spatial variability index system and evaluation model are constructed to reveal the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements which makes up for the deficiencies in the research index and variability evaluation of regional hydrometeorological elements over the years 2 the spatial variability characteristics and variability degree of main hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb are identified which can better guide the utilization and protection of water resources as well as the production and development of agriculture and animal husbandry and formulate reasonable policies and schemes 3 moreover the quantitative evaluation framework of spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements mainly relies on the combined application of geostatistical method entropy weight method and topsis model which has strong applicability and can be used to comprehensively analyze the spatial variability characteristics of other regions the heterogeneity and complexity of the spatial distribution of hydrometeorological elements and their attributes in the dqrb indicate that the hydrometeorological elements at different stations vary greatly furthermore the spatial variability caused by structural factors plays a dominant role which is mainly affected by the natural geographical environment of the study area such as topography temperature solar radiation etc the long term structural phenomena of these natural conditions lead to their spatial variability inevitably restricted by natural factors in addition the evaluation scores of the spatial variability have a great fluctuation after 1995 it shows that under the combined influence of climate change and human activities the spatial variability of regional hydrometeorological elements is relatively large moreover the evaluation score of the spatial variability in plain area is higher indicating that the plain area is more affected by natural and social factors the plain area has a large population and complex social environment while the mountain area is closer to the natural state indicating that the spatial variability is mainly affected by social factors such as human activities at the same time temperature and evaporation are more likely to show strong spatial variability than other hydrometeorological elements it shows that meteorological elements are more sensitive and easily affected by natural and social factors and then there is a strong spatial variability therefore more attention should be paid to the protection of water resources and ecological environment in plain area so as to avoid the influence of excessive human activities on the hydrological cycle and the strong spatial and temporal variability of regional hydrometeorological elements however there are several limitations in this study firstly when calculating the spatial variability of regionalized variables the results will be affected by the number of stations and their spatial distribution the less distribution of meteorological and hydrological stations in mountain area and the lack of groundwater gauging stations in the eastern plain area will have a certain impact on the results at the same time when evaluating the indexes of spatial variability there is a lack of comparison for building the numerical simulation model based on physical mechanisms to evaluate the spatial variability nonetheless the present study meets the established objectives and the results are reasonable and accurate the results would be more reliable and richer if these defects were taken into account the improvement of these limitations will be the next research work 5 conclusions in this study the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb is analyzed to explore the degree of spatial variability in plain and mountain areas the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the spatial variability precipitation temperature evaporation groundwater depth and runoff in plain and mountain areas all have moderate or strong spa moreover all the regionalized variables have spa in the range for the vac it can be seen from the nugget to sill ratio and weight that the spatial heterogeneity of hydrometeorological elements in plain and mountain areas is greatly affected by stp and the spatial variability caused by stp is dominant 2 the precipitation and temperature in plain area are isotropic in the directions of 45 and 135 and they are anisotropic in the directions of 0 and 90 meanwhile precipitation and runoff in mountain area are isotropic in the directions of 0 and 90 and anisotropic in the directions of 45 and 135 the evaporation and groundwater depth in plain area and the temperature and evaporation in mountain area are anisotropic in the selected four directions in the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb the variability caused by the vac and ani is the main variability form and the vai is the least likely to occur in the spatial variability 3 the evaluation scores of hydrometeorological elements in plain and mountain areas are mainly concentrated between 0 4 and 0 8 with moderate or moderate strong spatial variability in particular the spatial variability of temperature is large the evaluation scores of the temperature in plain area and mountain area are 0 691 and 0 604 respectively which show moderate strong spatial variability furthermore the spatial variability of runoff is weak and the evaluation score is 0 223 in summary due to the influence of climate change and human activities the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in plain area is higher than that in mountain area meteorological elements such as temperature and evaporation are more likely to have strong spatial variability and should be paid special attention to by analyzing the spatial variability of hydrometeorological elements in the dqrb it is helpful to deeply understand the regional hydrological cycle process and the change of characteristics and improve the ability to deal with hydrological variability and climate change at the same time it also has important guiding significance for the rational allocation of water resources and the coordinated development of regional social economy and ecological environment credit authorship contribution statement honglin xiao methodology formal analysis writing original draft validation writing review editing jinping zhang supervision writing review editing

2168,urban rivers have been proved to be the hot spots of atmospheric methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions however the rivers across rural urban interface which are undergoing significant environmental changes in the process of urbanization received little attention in this study we conducted seasonal investigations in two small suburban rivers in mountainous southwest china to clarify the spatial temporal characteristics of ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes in relation to watershed land use change and their potential controls the results showed that the small suburban rivers acted as strong ch4 and n2o emitters to atmosphere with averaged fluxes of 960 2 966 6 and 205 1 240 8 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and n2o presented a sharp increase and spatial variability when the rivers cross the rural urban interface such discontinuous spatial pattern of ch4 and n2o emission in river continuum were closely related to watershed land use and could be modeled as functions of the urban land use proportion the urban land proportion in the basins could explain 70 and 59 of the total spatial variations of ch4 and n2o emissions respectively stepwise multiple regression models smrm based on water environment parameters were established in our study and indicate that dtc nh4 no3 tp and conductivity play key controls on ch4 and n2o emissions in the two studied mountainous suburban rivers moreover smrm and urban land use based functions were tested to have good predictions based on constrained mountainous samples could provide a possible path to extrapolate ch4 and n2o emissions in mountainous urbanized rivers at the whole regional network scale we also found evidences for the sewage dominated tributary with abnormally high ch4 and n2o concentrations which was partially responsible for the sharp increase of ch4 and n2o fluxes in urban reaches the results of structural equation model provided strong evidence for direct and indirect controls of urban expansion on longitudinal differentiation of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions crossing rural urban interface we argued that ch4 and n2o emissions from rivers in the mountainous rural urban area are sensitive to the watershed urbanization and water pollution and suggested that land use management nutrient and organic matter control can be promising avenues to mitigate riverine ch4 and n2o emissions keywords ch4 and n2o watershed urbanization land use change sewage load spatial and seasonal variation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o are important greenhouse gases ghg in the atmosphere having approximately 34 times and 298 times global warming potential of co2 over a 100 yr period respectively ipcc 2021 inland waters have been proved to act as a significant source of atmospheric ch4 and n2o bastviken et al 2011 beaulieu et al 2011 saunois et al 2020 a latest study has pointed out that 41 or 53 of the global ch4 emissions could be attributed to aquatic ecosystems rosentreter et al 2021 ravishankara et al 2009 estimated that n2o emissions from inland waters also could contribute to 25 30 of total global n2o emissions throughout the 21st century therefore ch4 and n2o emissions from inland waters have been gained comprehensive attention rivers and streams act as pools of terrestrial carbon c and nitrogen n and the most active biogeochemical reactors playing the most important contribution to global aquatic ch4 and n2o budget marzadri et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 the total ch4 emission from global rivers and streams were recently estimated to be 28 43 tg yr 1 zheng et al 2022 equivalent to approximately 30 of the ch4 emissions from inland aquatic systems zheng et al 2022 meanwhile global rivers and streams could emit about 29 6 35 3 mean of 32 2 gg n2o yr 1 hu et al 2016 yao et al 2020 estimated that global riverine n2o emissions may even reach up to 291 3 58 6 gg yr 1 however the inherent sensibility of riverine ch4 and n2o dynamics to hydrology water quality topography and climate conditions strongly complicates the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of ch4 and n2o emissions from river systems borges et al 2015 campeau and del giorgio 2014 hu et al 2017 combined with severe disparity of data and more broad man made interference it showed obviously poor precision and considerable uncertainties in the estimation of ch4 and n2o emissions from rivers on global or regional scale marzadri et al 2021 saunois et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 therefore more regional observations with high spatial and temporal resolution are needed for a better understanding of the characteristics of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions under different environmental contexts especially for those rivers disturbed by human activities generally riverine n2o is produced as a byproduct of microbially mediated denitrification and nitrification of terrestrial nitrogen beaulieu et al 2011 marzadri et al 2021 yang and lei 2018 while ch4 derives from the degradation of organic matter in the anaerobic sediment via methanogenesis stanley et al 2016 wang et al 2018 it is generally assumed that organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen load within rivers are closely related to riverine ch4 and n2o yield chun et al 2020 lin et al 2022 however river ecosystem is a dynamic bioreactor with uncontrollable reaction conditions riverine ch4 and n2o dynamics are controlled by both macro and micro environmental factors including water quality parameters e g dissolved oxygen temperature organic matter and nutrients ho et al 2022 wang et al 2009 hydrology water depth flow velocity discharge and runoff cooper et al 2017 sawakuchi et al 2014 and comprehensive watershed environment e g land use and human activities alshboul et al 2016 yang and lei 2018 zhang et al 2020b beyond that anthropogenic wastewater effluents or lateral seepage from cities and nearby agriculture crop and discharge of groundwater with supersaturated ch4 n2o also have been considered as important point sources for inland water ch4 and n2o borges et al 2018 crawford and stanley 2016 jurado et al 2018 these uncertainties associated with environmental conditions and exogenous contribution can interfere with the relationships between internal carbon and nitrogen metabolism and the productions and emissions of ch4 and n2o underscoring the complexity of riverine ch4 and n2o dynamics as a result in most of previous studies fluvial internal carbon and nitrogen cycling rates may not provide an adequate explanation for the spatiotemporal variations in ch4 and n2o emissions alshboul et al 2016 li et al 2020 marescaux et al 2018 particularly in urbanizing watersheds anthropogenic perturbations can substantially dominate aquatic biogeochemical process through water pollution and land use change tang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 and thus perturb the spatiotemporal patterns and regulatory mechanisms of riverine ch4 and n2o fluxes li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 yang and lei 2018 although the influences of urban sprawl and resulting land use change on water quality runoff process and microbial processes have been studied extensively bellido et al 2011 ge et al 2020 jordan et al 1997 thais et al 2019 yang and lei 2018 clarifying the spatiotemporal uncertainty and potential human contribution in ch4 and n2o emissions in urban disturbed rivers are challenging some recent studies conducted in rivers draining in different watershed landscapes have identified that land use change which acts synthetic expression of environment heterogeneity and human activity in watershed is closely linked to riverine ch4 and n2o emissions and explains more of their heterogeneity in human influenced watershed tang et al 2021 tang et al 2023 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2022 yang and lei 2018 zhang et al 2020b spatial differentiation of fluvial ch4 and n2o fluxes in connection with watershed rural urban structure have been also found in a lowland river network of shanghai china yu et al 2013 yu et al 2017 moreover most studies highlighted urban inland water were significant hotspots of ch4 and n2o degassing compared to those draining in natural or agricultural landscape marescaux et al 2018 tang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b and then it may be expected that rivers flowing from natural to urban landscapes would show strongly spatial non continuity and erratic patterns in ch4 and n2o emissions due to increasing inputs of point or nonpoint source pollution and sewage leaks alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 however evidences about the spatial non continuity of ch4 and n2o emissions in a complete river continuum across rural urban interface and the relation with watershed land use are still seldom beaulieu et al 2010 jin et al 2018 moreover most of these studies were only conducted in lowland rivers hu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2013 yu et al 2017 the response of ch4 and n2o emissions from numerous small mountain rivers remains unclear because of their stronger turbulence and shorter residence time anyhow untangling the possible link between watershed land use change and ch4 and n2o emissions can not only provide a more macro perspective for exploring the key drivers on the heterogeneity in riverine greenhouse gases but also support the estimation of greenhouse gases inventory and low carbon land use management urbanization is the most important motivation driving region land use change and nowadays over 60 of land has been covered by urban annual reports on global ecosystem and environment observation 2021 given the close association of river ch4 and n2o dynamics with land use change impacts of global urban expansion are predicted to be particularly important for riverine ch4 and n2o emissions he et al 2017 herrero ortega et al 2019 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b and these impacts maybe more significant in the rural urban interface area suburban river traversing rural urban interface area which is undergoing partial urbanization process and featuring with high landscape heterogeneity can provide opportunities for exploring the correlation of spatial variation in riverine ch4 and n2o fluxes with watershed land use change particularly the investigations of these suburban river continuums are beneficial for predicting the potential impacts of urban expansion and land use change on spatial temporal variability of ch4 and n2o fluxes in the context of global change moreover given the difference in hydrologic process between lowland and mountainous area more studies should be conducted in the small suburban mountainous rivers to advance our understanding of riverine ch4 and n2o dynamics under different geography backgrounds under the background of the western development plan and construction of the yangtze river economic belt the mountainous areas in the upper reaches of the yangtze river in western china have experienced rapid urbanization in the process of urban expansion a large number of small natural rivers have been converted peri urban disturbed rivers with partial urbanized reaches in this study two small mountainous rivers located in the fringe of the chongqing municipality china were selected as rural urban interface representatives for seasonal field survey on the concentrations and diffusive emissions of ch4 and n2o in surface water in the past few years chongqing has the most rapid urbanization as the center of the yangtze river economic belt furthermore as a mountainous city rivers in chongqing are individualized with faster flow and stronger turbulence than those in flat areas the aims of this study are to 1 define the spatial and temporal variation patterns of ch4 and n2o emissions from suburban rivers 2 explore the relationship between riverine ch4 and n2o concentrations and emissions and watershed land use transformation during urban expansion and 3 examine key controlling factors and mechanism of the effect of land use change on riverine ch4 and n2o emissions we attempt to provide a rural urban interface model of riverine greenhouse gas effluxes and evaluate the potential human contribution to ch4 and n2o emissions in mountainous urban disturbed rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey region this study was conducted in the hou river hr 29 44 30 0 n 106 34 106 43 e a tributary of the jialing river and chaoyang river cyr 29 38 29 48 n 106 39 106 45 e a tributary of the yangtze river located in chongqing china fig 1 the basin area of hr and cyr are 358 km2 and 117 km2 and the total mainstream length are about 54 km and 31 km respectively both showing comparatively small watersheds the main landforms in the two watersheds consists of numerous mountain and valley with steep bank slopes and narrow riverbeds the study area is featured with a humid subtropical monsoon with warm rainy summer and cold dry winter the mean rainfall is about 1000 1400 mm most of which approximately 70 occurs in the wet season from may to october the annual average temperature is 18 3 c with a maximum and minimum of 41 0 c and 3 2 c respectively forest farmland and urban were the main land use types in our survey region fig 1b covering about 34 47 and 19 of the entire area respectively there were three important wastewater treatment plants adjacent to the two selected rivers fig 1b in this study we use the landsat tm etm images 30 m pixel as the data source to extract and classify land use type by arcgis 10 2 software to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of land cover in hr and cyr basin we divided the mainstream into at least 10 segments from upstream to downstream and extracted circumjacent land use data around each segment within 1 km radius proportions of urban land in hr and cyr basins increase about 10 times and 6 times respectively from upstream to downstream while forest and farmland proportion decrease rapidly fig 1c meanwhile the field survey found that there were some tributaries fed by the effluents of adjacent wastewater treatment plants interflowing into the downstream segments of hr and cr thus it can be seen the downstream of hr and cyr were seriously influenced by urban development while upstream were dominated by farmland or forest and almost impervious to urban 2 2 land use and sampling site design based on the characteristics of land use data of the two suburban basins we deployed 10 sampling sites along hr h1 h10 and 9 sites along cyr c1 c9 from upstream to downstream representing watershed land use change from rural to urban fig 1 here h1 h7 and c1 c6 represent the upper and middle reaches unaffected or slightly affected by urban land while h8 h9 and c7 c9 represent urban reaches furthermore to explore the influence of municipal sewage 4 sampling sites were established at the two sewage dominated tributaries of hr marked as hb1 hb2 hz1 and hz2 additional one site was set in the tributary of cyr marked as cz fig 1 finally totally 24 sampling sites were selected at each site we deployed 3 repeat samples in the center and both flanks of the rivers field measurements and water sample collections were carried out in september 2014 december 2014 march 2015 and june 2015 following the seasonal principle river flow velocity and discharge of hr ranged from 0 21 to 1 34 m s 1 average of 0 57 0 27 m s 1 and from 0 84 to 79 82 m3 s 1 average 17 21 17 24 m3 s 1 respectively in cyr river flow velocity and discharge ranged from 0 35 to 1 07 m s 1 average of 0 66 0 21 m s 1 and from 2 25 to 106 12 m3 s 1 average 23 11 20 41 m3 s 1 the average maximum flow velocity and discharge occurred in june 2 3 filed sampling during each sampling event we first collected 500 ml of surface water at 20 cm depth by a 1 l organic glass water sampler and stored in an acid washed 0 5 l high density polyethylene container to measure the water chemical parameters including the dissolved total carbon dtc dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic ammonium nitrogen nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp dissolved total phosphorus dtp sulphate so4 2 and orthophosphate po4 3 triplicate water samples were collected in each site resulting in a total of 288 samples whereafter we used the calibrated manta 2 multiparameter water quality probe analyzer eureka usa to determine in situ water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do ph conductivity con chlorophyll a chl a and turbidity turb with a precision of 0 01 c 0 01 mg l 1 0 01 units 0 1 μs cm 1 0 01 μg l 1 and 0 1 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu respectively in addition the ph electrode was calibrated prior to each measurement with buffers of 4 01 7 00 and 10 01 to ensure its precision of 0 01 units meanwhile a kestrel 2500 anemometer was used to measure the air temperature at air pressure and wind speed u at 1 m above the river surface furthermore we also measured the flow velocity river width and water depth at each sampling site using current meter laser rangefinders and depth meter respectively ch4 and n2o concentrations in this study were determined by the headspace balance method which has been widely employed in dissolved greenhouse gas measurement in fresh waters jin et al 2018 kampbell et al 1989 tang et al 2021 in each site extra water samples were collected by an airproof hydrophore and then we used a syringe to pump 100 ml water from the hydrophore and inject into a 200 ml aluminum foil gas bag directly which was fully vacuumed and promptly sealed without any atmospheric air after that 0 2 ml of saturated hgcl2 was injected into the gas bag to inhibit microbial activity meanwhile we collected 100 ml atmospheric gas samples at 1 m above the water surface and poured into another 100 ml aluminum lined gas bags for the determination of atmospheric ch4 and n2o background concentrations all the sampling campaigns were conducted during daytime and all the water samples were stored at 4 c until analysis within 3 days 2 4 analytical methods we used highly purified n2 as headspace supporting gas for determination of dissolved n2o and ch4 concentrations first 80 ml of highly purified n2 purity 99 99 was injected into the gas bag with 100 ml water sample to create headspace the gas sample bag was then shaken violently for 5 min to allow the gas to diffuse out and the ch4 and n2o to equilibrate between the headspace and water phase later 10 ml of the headspace gas was immediately transferred into a customized vacuum glass bottle with volume of 10 ml for gas composition analysis all the in situ gas samples and headspace samples were measured with ch4 and n2o by gas chromatography agilent7890a agilent co usa equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and flame ionization detector fid detailed operating conditions are shown in si the initial water samples were filtered through microfiltration membrane 0 45 μm millipore filter for the measurement of dtc doc dic no3 nh4 dtp and po4 3 concentrations dtc doc and dic were analyzed by miltin c2100stoc analyzer jena germany with a precision of 0 001 mg l 1 no3 and nh4 were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry method and salicylic acid spectrophotometry method respectively dtp measured by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry method ppams po4 3 concentrations were measured by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry method the initial water samples were used for tn and tp measurement through the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method and ppams respectively all the analysis procedures followed the china national standard method https www sac gov cn all the water chemistry data has been published in wang et al 2021b 2 5 data calculation the concentrations of dissolved ch4 and n2o were calculated using henry s law weiss 1974 the equations are as follows 1 c w c a v a α c a v w v w 2 α r t h 3 h h 0 e k 1 t 1 273 15 where cw is the concentration of dissolved ch4 or n2o µmol l 1 ca is ch4 and n2o concentrations in the headspace µmol l 1 va is the volume of headspace n2 in the gas bag 0 08 l vw is the volume of water in the gas bag 0 10 l α is the bunsen coefficient r is the gas constant 0 082057 l μatm μmol 1 k 1 h is the henry s solubility constant μmol l 1 atm 1 corrected based on field water temperature and h is the henry s constant at 298 15 k μmol l 1 atm 1 which is 1325 for ch4 and 24714 μmol l 1 atm 1 for n2o k is a temperature dependent constant k of 1750 k and 2675 k for ch4 and n2o respectively t is the kelvin temperature of water k ch4 and n2o diffusive fluxes of the sampled rivers were calculated via the classic thin boundary layer model tbl liss and slater 1974 based on that the gas transfer coefficient times the ch4 and n2o concentration gradient between water and atmosphere equilibrium and the calculation equation is expressed as follow 4 f k c w c 0 where f is the ch4 and n2o flux μmol m 2 d 1 k is the gas exchange coefficient m d 1 c0 is the atmospheric background concentration of ch4 and n2o the other parameters have the same meaning as the eq 1 gas transfer velocity k is generally thought to be mainly controlled by water turbulence that correlates with wind speed and hydrologic conditions flow velocity discharge and others raymond and cole 2001 so it has been generally parameterized using measured values of wind speed and or water turbulence raymond and cole 2001 there have been a series of empirical equations based on wind or hydrology for k prediction as shown in wang et al 2020 and raymond et al 2012 table s1 these models provide an opportunity for ch4 and n2o diffusion fluxes estimation when k values were not measured in this study the two suburban rivers are typical mountain streams with steep slopes fast flow velocities and small water surface thus the wind speed based models which are usually used in large rivers or lakes are obviously inapplicable in our system to reduce the uncertainties in the estimations of ch4 and n2o diffusive fluxes based on the tbl method hydrodynamic parameters based models propose by raymond et al 2012 m1 m6 in table s1 were employed for k calculation these models have been particularly recommended for k calculation in smaller streams and rivers raymond et al 2012 firstly we calculated k for each sampling site using the six hydrological models m1 m6 table s1 and finally averaged out a relatively modest value for error reduction data such as velocity discharge water depth and slope at each sampling point have been enumerated in the support material table s2 for comparison we also calculated k using other wind speed models m7 m8 and m9 and wind speed hydrological models m10 and m11 to assess the impact of the models on gas fluxes fig s1 the calculated k values by multi models in this study range of 6 21 25 8 m d 1 mean of 14 7 4 5 m d 1 are moderate to superior relative to the predictive value 0 24 24 m d 1 for streams by raymond et al 2012 and much higher than the wind speed based k 0 06 1 79 m d 1 fig s1 our k values were comparable but still high to k levels reported in five rivers of the mountains three gorges reservoir catchment 2 02 12 26 m d 1 tang et al 2021 and the small rivers in chongqing mean of 11 6 m d 1 li et al 2019 because of the steep slopes and fast flow velocities of our two mountain rivers relatively high k generated by hydrodynamic parameters based models is logical even so we also declare that the potential overestimation of ch4 and n2o diffusive fluxes in present study may exist more details of k calculation are shown in si 2 6 statistical analyses all initial data was standardized and calculated in microsoft excel 2019 microsoft corporation usa spss 23 0 chicago 1l usa was used to perform all the statistical analyses all data was tested for their normality before the statistical analyses and was log transformed as necessary to meet the assumption of normal distribution and homoscedasticity stevens 1946 correlation analysis was utilized to assess the relationships between riverine ch4 and n2o concentrations and water physical chemical parameters linear and nonlinear regressions were applied to establish the relationships of land use with gas fluxes we also carried out a series of simple linear regressions and stepwise multiple regressions smr to check the relations of ch4 and n2o concentrations fluxes with the auxiliary water quality parameters because of the dominant role of urbanization on water quality see more on this below the correlativity among water quality parameters was obviously predictable the situation is unfavorable to explore possible predictors for the ch4 and n2o concentrations meanwhile there may be a lot of information redundancy when we constructed prediction function of gases fluxes based on water quality parameters execution of smr can introduce the numerous auxiliary parameters into the model one by one and eliminate the redundant variables thus avoiding multicollinearity and obtaining a relatively simple model with fewer variables you and yan 2017 using the parameters calculated by stepwise multivariate regression we also conducted structural equation model sem for path purposes to better understand the direct and indirect relationships between the land use water environment and ch4 and n2o concentrations the chi squared degree of freedom ratio cmin df goodness fit index gfi comparative fit index cfi and normed fit index nfi were used to evaluate the successful fit of the model the sem was conducted using the spss amos 24 0 software a cmin df value 3 and by values of the other indices gfi cfi nfi close to 1 indicate a good fit all the illustrations were made in graphpad prism 8 3 results 3 1 watershed land use and water environment doc dtc nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the two rivers gradually increased from upstream to downstream and reached a peak in the urban segments table s3 nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in downstream urban segments increased about 2 5 times compared with those in non urban segments table s3 here we analyzed the relationships between watershed land use change and water environmental parameters the urban cover proportion showed significant negative relationship with do but positive relationship with conductivity the proportion of urban cover in watershed also showed significant positive relationship with tn tp and dtc and could explain 36 47 and 60 of their variations respectively fig 2 thus urban expansion is an important reason for increasing carbon nitrogen and phosphorus load of the suburban rivers 3 2 ch4 concentration and flux the dissolved ch4 concentration in the two suburban rivers ranged from 58 6 to 1950 4 nmol l 1 with an overall average of 398 6 415 4 nmol l 1 the variability of ch4 concentration showed so intense that varied three orders of magnitudes ch4 concentration in hr and cyr showed similar variation range of 58 6 1950 4 nmol l 1 and 67 4 1710 4 nmol l 1 respectively while the averaged ch4 concentration in hr 462 6 463 8 nmol l 1 was higher than that in cyr of 308 9 315 1 nmol l 1 ch4 concentration in all samples was approximately 36 4 300 times the gas concentration at equilibrium with the overlying atmosphere about 18 0 nmol l 1 the ch4 concentration in the two suburban rivers showed obviously downstream increasing particularly from the sites where the rivers flow into the urban area fig 3 the average ch4 concentration in the urban segments h8 h10 c7 c9 of hr and cyr were 781 4 470 9 nmol l 1 and 552 3 378 6 nmol l 1 respectively about 5 4 and 3 8 times higher than those in the upper and middle reaches segments which are unaffected or slightly affected by urban land fig 3 relatively low ch4 concentration were found in outlying segments dominated by forest and farming landscape 123 0 nmol l 1 of hr and 139 0 nmol l 1 of cyr moreover peak concentrations of ch4 were observed in the sewage dominated tributaries marked with hb and cz especially averaged ch4 in hz2 reached 1493 9 nmol l 1 in terms of temporal variation the two rivers showed similar seasonal patterns of ch4 concentration which were significantly higher in spring 571 3 483 6 nmol l 1 than the other three seasons fig 4 particularly both rivers showed generally low ch4 concentration in warm summer even being comparable to these found in cold winter averaged ch4 concentration in cyr in summer 203 9 nmol l 1 was even markedly lower than that in winter 291 7 nmol l 1 disobeying the temperature driven biogeochemistry pattern moreover ch4 concentration showed consistent seasonal variation patterns in urban and exurban reaches fig 4 compared with the non urban reach the seasonal variation of ch4 concentration in urban segments was much more intense fig 4 based on the boundary layer model the estimated ch4 fluxes from the two suburban rivers presented an overall mean of 960 2 966 6 µmol m 2 d 1 median 582 0 µmol m 2 d 1 ch4 fluxes in hr and cyr both showed much larger temporal and spatial uncertainty with variation range of 0 9 3917 0 µmol m 2 d 1and 21 5 3843 7 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively averaged ch4 flux in hr was 1069 2 1012 4 µmol m 2 d 1 slightly higher than that in cyr 807 6 876 0 µmol m 2 d 1 ch4 fluxes from downstream urban segments of hr and cyr reached up to 1842 3 888 8 µmol m 2 d 1and 1558 1 950 6 µmol m 2 d 1 5 7 times higher than those in upper reaches ch4 fluxes of the two rivers also showed an obviously increasing trend with the proportion of urban land use fig 3 3 3 n2o concentration and flux n2o concentration in the two sampling rivers varied in a wide range of two magnitudes from 2 7 to 592 1 nmol l 1 mean of 77 2 89 5 nmol l 1 and median of 42 3 nmol l 1 all samples showed oversaturated with n2o and about 23 times the water atmosphere equilibrium concentration hr had averaged n2o concentration of 96 9 105 1 nmol l 1 median 66 4 nmol l 1 higher than that in cyr of 49 8 49 5 nmol l 1 median 35 8 nmol l 1 similar to the variation in ch4 concentration n2o concentration also presented a strong spatial variability fig 5 n2o concentration ranged from 2 7 nmol l 1 to 105 1 nmol l 1 across the upper and middle segments of the two rivers mean of 33 1 26 6 nmol l 1 in hr and 19 4 12 7 nmol l 1 cyr and began a growth spurt after flowing into the urban area fig 5 in urban segments the averaged n2o concentration in hr and cyr were 160 6 115 2 nmol l 1and 95 3 49 1 nmol l 1 rose approximately 5 times compared with the exurban segments n2o concentration in segments which drained more forest landscape h4 h5 c1 c2 was a little lower than agricultural segments and observably lower than urban segments fig 5 clearly n2o concentration in both suburban rivers presented highly synchronous spatial variation with the proportion of urban land use around each sampling site furthermore n2o concentration in the sewage dominated tributaries of hr and cyr was much higher than those in the mainstreams fig 5 distinct seasonal variations in the n2o concentration were found in both suburban rivers with higher averages in autumn 103 3 122 6 nmol l 1 and spring 92 5 76 8 nmol l 1 than winter 71 1 88 0 nmol l 1 and summer 42 1 34 1 nmol l 1 fig 6 there was a consistent seasonal variation pattern of n2o concentration either in urban or non urban reaches fig 6 the calculated n2o flux in the two rivers ranged from 3 7 1513 6 µmol m 2 d 1 with an overall mean of 205 1 240 8 µmol m 2 d 1 as a net n2o emission source to the atmosphere except for a few sampling points n2o fluxes from the two suburban rivers increased from upstream to downstream along the urbanization gradients distinctly the urban reaches of hr with an average n2o flux of 419 0 311 0 µmol m 2 d 1 was 4 7 times higher than those in outlying reaches with a value of 88 8 83 1 µmol m 2 d 1 meanwhile n2o flux in cyr from urban reaches 272 129 9 µmol m 2 d 1 was 5 8 times higher than the exurban reaches 46 6 50 4 µmol m 2 d 1 it was noteworthy that the highest concentration and flux of n2o were both found at the sewage input point whatever the hr or the cyr 3 4 relationships between ch4 and n2o with water environmental parameters pearson correlation analysis showed that the dissolved ch4 and n2o concentrations were significantly related to most of the water environmental parameters including do con carbon and nutrients content p 0 01 table 1 there were significant positive correlations between doc dtc tn tp no3 nh4 and dtp and dissolved gas concentrations p 0 01 either in hr or cyr while dissolved ch4 and n2o concentrations had negative relationship with do particularly ch4 and n2o concentrations were both positively correlated with conductivity an important pollution indicator however there was no correlation of dissolved gas concentrations with wt turb chl a and so4 2 linear regressions showed that doc dtc and nutrients content in water could explain 26 41 and 24 47 of total variations in ch4 and n2o respectively fig 7 fig 8 conductivity acted as a powerful explainer for the variation in ch4 and n2o concentrations with determination coefficient of 0 50 and 0 36 respectively fig s2 furthermore among all the water chemical indicators dtc and nh4 had the strongest explanatory power for ch4 concentration with r2 0 4 p 0 001 tn no3 tp doc and dtc acted as the most powerful contributors to variations in n2o concentrations r2 0 4 p 0 001 smr were further used to establish predictive equations between ch4 and n2o concentrations and multiple water environmental parameters table 2 the determination coefficients of predictive equations using all data for ch4 and n2o were 0 70 and 0 73 respectively table 2 the change of the adjusted determination coefficients with variable entry was shown in fig 9 conductivity dtc and tp were the biggest contributors to the prediction equation of ch4 concentration while no3 dtc con and tp were the biggest contributors to the prediction equation of n2o 3 5 relationship between ch4 n2o concentrations and watershed land use we found that the annual averages of ch4 and n2o concentrations at each sampling site were significantly and positively correlated with the proportion of urban land use within a 1 km radius buffer zone fig 10 the urban land use proportion could explain 69 and 85 of total spatial variation in ch4 concentration in hr and cyr respectively and urban land use also could explain 62 82 of spatial variation in n2o concentration meanwhile we found relatively weak and negative relationships between ch4 n2o concentrations and forest and agriculture ratios fig s3 as shown in sems fig 11 and table 3 urbanization had a significant positive and direct impact on methane concentration with a direct effect of 0 265 and it also indirectly influenced the ch4 concentration by affecting con dtc tp nh4 with an indirect effect of 0 502 therefore the total effect of urbanization on the ch4 concentration was 0 767 the direct effects indirect effects and total effects of urban land use on n2o concentration was 0 04 0 685 and 0 681 respectively the indirect effects of urbanization on ch4 and n2o were considerably higher than the direct effects therefore urbanization indirectly dominated the concentrations of ch4 and n2o by changing the physicochemical parameters of river 4 discussion 4 1 intensity and variation of ch4 and n2o fluxes in the two mountainous suburban rivers it has been widely recognized that rivers and streams are potential ch4 and n2o emission sources borges et al 2015 marzadri et al 2021 rosentreter et al 2021 the two mountainous rivers in our study were in general supersaturated with ch4 and n2o relative to the water atmosphere equilibrium values indicating that the two rivers acted as net sources of ch4 and n2o to the atmosphere however compared to the averaged ch4 concentration from global rivers 1350 5160 nmo l 1 stanley et al 2016 our average values were much lower the observed ch4 and n2o concentrations were also lower than most previous reports from different types of rivers tables s4 and s5 even the highest ch4 and n2o concentrations in urban sections were also far lower than the levels previously reported in the similar sized urban rivers especially in the lowland ones hu et al 2017 jin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b limited reports in mountainous rivers also found comparatively low ch4 and n2o concentrations he et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ch4 and n2o productions in river are mainly controlled by the factors including anaerobic environment the accumulation of organic matter in sediments and the abundance of microorganism song et al 2022 stanley et al 2016 while rivers in mountain environment which had faster flow velocity and intense turbulence resulting in less organic material accumulation adequate aeration restricted microbial colonization and rapid degassing across water air surface raymond et al 2012 stanley et al 2016 these conditions are not conducive to the production and accumulation of ch4 and n2o nonetheless ch4 and n2o concentrations in urban reaches were much higher than those in the exurban reaches and most reports in natural rivers galantini et al 2021 hu et al 2017 affirming the enhancement of urban expansion on riverine greenhouse gases accumulation in mountainous rivers fig 3 our estimates of ch4 and n2o fluxes fell in the range of the reported values of many rivers around the world tables s4 and s5 the averaged ch4 fluxes in hr and cyr were also lower than the estimated global riverine mean value 8220 25500 µmol m 2 d 1 n 385 sites stanley et al 2016 and most of the urban rivers worldwide table s4 however ch4 fluxes in urban reaches were comparable to the sewage rivers in lowland tianjin hu et al 2017 and higher than those river networks of chongqing and shanghai metropolitans wang et al 2018 yu et al 2017 suggesting these urban reaches were ch4 emission hotspots in suburban rivers meanwhile n2o fluxes in our study located in medium high among global rivers table s5 average n2o fluxes in the two suburban rivers were also lower than most urbanized rivers but higher than non urbanized ones table s5 it is worth noting that the estimated n2o fluxes in urban reaches of hr and cyr were even higher than those heavily polluted urban rivers chang et al 2015 hu et al 2017 also acting as remarkable hotspots of n2o emissions we highlighted that mountainous suburban rivers are important but complicated and changeable sources of ch4 and n2o for local or regional greenhouse gas budgets in the context of continuous urban expansion ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes showed disproportionately high variability across upstream to downstream compare to their restricted drainage area fig 3 fig 5 the rangeability of ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes in this study exceeded more than three orders of magnitudes even beyond those found in some large river basins jin et al 2018 song et al 2022 upstill goddard et al 2017 the maximum ch4 concentration and fluxes that have been found in urban reaches were over 300 times that of the minimum in up and middle reaches showing non continuum shift fig 3 fig s4 similar finding was found in other rivers drained land areas with varied urbanization intensities tang et al 2021 obviously such strong heterogeneity can be attributed to the exogenous carbon and nitrogen load and municipal sewage inflow during watershed urban expansion through the perspective of longitudinal non continuum of water environment parameters table s3 figs s4 and s5 we highlighted that this huge variation in ch4 and n2o fluxes from suburbs to urban areas cannot be ignored it provides good evidences for that watershed urbanization can break the river continuum of ch4 and n2o biogeochemical process and then enhance the spatial heterogeneity and erratic patterns therefore the dynamic process of ch4 and n2o in rapidly urbanized areas of small watershed should be paid more attention 4 2 urban land use dominated the spatial pattern of river ch4 and n2o despite streams and rivers act as net ch4 and n2o emission source to the atmosphere variable basin environment hinders our ability to understand how local and longitudinal controls affect spatial patterns of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions and challenge the prediction and upscaling across large areas in our study it showed a clear association of fluvial ch4 and n2o concentrations with the land use change in the two suburban rivers fig 10 fig s3 xia et al 2022 found that riverine ch4 concentration changed dramatically with watershed landscapes from forest to urban yang and lei 2018 found a strong link between the concentrations and emissions of n2o and watershed land use in seven n enriched rivers draining urban rural and agricultural area similar observations were reported in some river networks under compounded artificial natural landscapes such as the chao lake basin zhang et al 2020b shanghai metropolitan area yu et al 2013 chongqing metropolitan area he et al 2017 however unlike these studies of regional river network our study in single river crossing rural urban interface exhibited a clearer spatial non continuity of ch4 and n2o concentrations from upstream to downstream and that such spatial non continuity was consistent with the distribution pattern of urban land use fig s4 and fig s5 until now there are few reports about the relation of ch4 and n2o fluxes and land use although it has been suggested that land used change can be the dominant power for riverine ch4 and n2o fluxes in human interfered watershed and should be incorporated into the model of global river ghg budget borges et al 2018 yu et al 2013 here we found watershed urban land proportion around sampling site could act as strong explainer for ch4 and n2o variability and serve as potential indicators fig 10 estimating fluvial ch4 and n2o concentrations using urban land proportion showed good consistency with the measured values fig 12 r2 0 83 and 0 63 other studies showed urban land use ratio within a radius of 0 5 1 km around sampling reach can explained 32 57 of the variations in riverine ch4 concentration tang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 meanwhile we integrated a dataset of ch4 n 227 and n2o n 200 concentrations from previous reports of urban disturbed rivers and streams in mountainous area and corresponding land use data fig s6 then we used the urban land proportion driven functions derived from our study to calculate a predicted dataset of riverine ch4 and n2o concentrations despite the obvious underestimation the predicted ch4 and n2o values presented a good linear relationship with the observed values fig 12 r2 0 50 and 0 39 indicating that the land use driven predictive models presented here could capture the variation in measured ch4 and n2o in urban disturbed mountain river systems however our empirical models presented poor predictive ability when ch4 and n2o concentrations exceeding 2000 nmol l 1and 200 nmol l 1 respectively fig 12 fig s6 these results implied the potential indicative functions of urban land use in riverine ch4 and n2o fluxes under constrained conditions in addition we also found that hydrological seasonality may influence the coupling relationships between urban land use and ch4 and n2o which were stronger in dry season than in wet season fig s7 with increased precipitation homogenization of upstream and downstream and strong dilution may weaken dependence of ch4 and n2o concentration on urban land use in urban reaches stanley et al 2016 therefore we suggest that both land use impacts and seasonal differences should be taken into account when modeling ch4 and n2o concentrations based on land use in human impacted mountain rivers farming land use has been known as a positive driver for riverine ch4 and n2o productions because more nutrients runoff from agricultural non point source pollution can nourish in situ catabolic processes borges et al 2018 qin et al 2020 however our findings fig s3 contradicted with most previous studies on agricultural basins borges et al 2018 ho et al 2022 song et al 2022 these conflicting results might be attributed to the stronger dominant role on ch4 and n2o spatial pattern of urban expansion than that of farming landscape similar founds have also been reported by tang et al 2021 and zhang et al 2020a in addition urban land had a large effect on river water quality at small scales e g reach or riparian scale than at large scales e g catchment scale whereas agricultural land displayed the opposite scale effects shi et al 2017 in our study water quality and ch4 and n2o emissions showed discontinuous increase in urban reaches table s3 fig 3 fig 5 indicating the local domination effect of urban activity meanwhile such negative correlation of farmland with ch4 and n2o may be also interpreted as that urban expansion occupied farmland but enhanced ch4 and n2o emissions from perspective of urban expansion despite lack of dynamic evidence conservatively it revealed that the influence of urbanization on riverine ch4 and n2o emissions far exceeds that of agriculture land in small mountain basin land use effects on riverine ch4 and n2o emissions should be carefully considered during urban management choices and ecological benefits assessment urban expansion and population agglomeration can result in the enrichment of organic carbon and nutrients in rivers via domestic effluent input thus fueling aquatic ecosystem carbon nitrogen metabolism and loss rosemond et al 2015 shi et al 2017 tang et al 2021 urban land proportion was closely associated with dtc tn tp and do fig 2 which then dominated the substrate and anaerobic conditions for in situ ch4 and n2o generations clear correlativity between concentrations of ch4 and n2o and water nutrients parameters table 1 fig 7 and fig 8 suggested that heavy pollution and nutrients enrichment were critical factors for the singularly high ch4 and n2o concentrations in urban river segments ho et al 2022 studied an urban river system in ecuador and observed a similar pattern of that the more polluted the sites were the higher dissolved ch4 and n2o concentrations were in addition land use can also influence endogenous generation mechanisms of ch4 and n2o via nutrients enrichment from the perspective of riverine microbial functional group ge et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 despite the lack of direct microbiological evidence we also supported water environment degradation due to urban expansion might act as primary mechanism for enhanced ch4 and n2o emissions it is worth noting that sewage discharging from waste water treatment plant wwtp is generally characterized as high ch4 and n2o contents alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 yoon et al 2017 and could directly contribute to ch4 and n2o concentrations in the urban rivers although this source cannot be differentiated from sewage fueled in situ microbial metabolism in our analysis the observed peak ch4 and n2o concentrations in our study all appeared in the locations fed by adjacent wwtp effluent fig 3 and fig 5 it was reported that ch4 concentration in wwtp effluents ranged from 27 17400 nmol l 1 average of 1200 2500 nmol l 1 in germany alshboul et al 2016 these concentrations are generally higher than the values in our urban reaches but consistent with averaged level found in the sewage dominated tributaries 1025 9 472 2 nmol l 1 indicating that wwtp effluents might be another contributors to the ch4 supersaturation in urbanized reaches moreover we also found ch4 and n2o concentrations in mainstream of the two suburban rivers presented growth spurt when the sewage dominated tributaries flowed in fig 3 fig 5 further confirming the worthy contribution of municipal sewage input to the discontinuous spatial variation in ch4 and n2o emissions along the river continuum in conclusion more and more researches have proposed that urban rivers were hotspots of ch4 and n2o fluxes tang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b watershed land use change during regional and global urbanization could be indirect dominant factor controlling the spatial variability of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions we highlighted that the small suburban rivers showed disproportionally high spatial variability in ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes compared with their limited channel length and basin areas as a result of watershed urban expansion and could be used as a good pattern system for studying the complex impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on river ch4 and n2o dynamic meanwhile discontinuous longitudinal differentiation of ch4 and n2o emission and related mechanisms dominated by land use also should be attached more attention 4 3 seasonal variability of ch4 and n2o and their determinants in this study remarkably higher concentrations of ch4 and n2o were observed in spring compared with the other three seasons figs 4 and 6 similar seasonal patterns were reported in the urbanized rivers including guadalete river burgos et al 2015 tuojia river zhang et al 2016 and rivers in chongqing metropolitan area wang et al 2018 however our seasonal patterns of ch4 and n2o were different from those records in many lowland rivers galantini et al 2021 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 hu et al 2017 as a result of different sensitivity to hydrology and watershed environment encalada et al 2019 mountain and lowland rivers might present different seasonal fluctuations in ch4 and n2o emissions temperature has been thought to be a primary factor influencing seasonal variability of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions since it can strongly regulate in stream microbial proliferation and metabolism beaulieu et al 2010 chun et al 2020 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 however temperature showed no relationship with ch4 and n2o concentrations in our study particularly ch4 and n2o concentrations observed in frigid winter were unnaturally comparable to and even higher than those in hot summer especially in urban reaches fig 4 and fig 6 similar patterns were also found in other mountainous rivers he et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and they attributed such contra seasonal variability to intensive rainfall and its consequent dilutive effect in summer the intensely dilutive effect on nutrients content in mountainous rivers has been widely reported duc et al 2010 and also presented in urban reaches of our study fig s8 meanwhile in mountainous area enhanced turbulence and re aeration during flooding event in rainy season limited the accumulation of dissolved gases in streams tang et al 2021 also supported low ch4 and n2o concentrations this explanation was evidenced by the higher flow velocity discharge and gas exchange coefficient in summer especially in urban sections fig s9 fig s10 on the other hand there was no pulse like increase in ch4 and n2o concentrations during the flooding season june indicating that longitudinal and lateral ch4 and n2o inputs from terrestrial soil and the tributary system might be less in our two small mountainous rivers borges et al 2019 impermeable substrate in urban area favored fast runoff confluence and low lateral inputs garnier et al 2013 nirmal rajkumar et al 2008 and thus leading more obvious dilutive effect on ch4 and n2o concentrations in urban reaches it also explained the more dramatic seasonal variation of ch4 and n2o emissions in urban reaches than that in exurban reaches fig 4 and fig 6 therefore despite higher temperatures in summer the dilutive effect due to rainfall and limited lateral inputs in our mountain basins caused the low ch4 and n2o concentrations the seasonal variations of ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes were predominantly controlled by the rainfall dilution effect while urban expansion would further enhance the temporal variation and complexity of ch4 and n2o emissions from suburban rivers 4 4 hydrochemical drivers of ch4 and n2o in two suburban rivers in this study the dissolved ch4 concentrations were significantly related to doc dtc tn tp no3 nh4 and dtp table 1 fig 7 similar results were found in the other urbanized river networks in chaohu lake basin xia et al 2022 zhang et al 2020b shanghai yu et al 2017 and chongqing tang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 organic carbon provides abundant carbon sources for in situ methanogenic bacteria propagation and production of ch4 jacinthe et al 2012 zhou et al 2018 meanwhile pierangeli et al 2021 suggested that heterotrophic decomposition of higher organic carbon in streams and related oxygen depletion could provide small molecule carbon compounds as electron acceptor for methane production and inhibit methane oxidizing bacteria activity respectively and then supporting higher ch4 concentration based on ch4 data of global rivers stanley et al 2016 also showed that methane concentration had significantly positive correlation with doc doc and toc were good indicators of riverine ch4 fluxes in the two suburban rivers at the same time nitrogen and phosphorus were also widely proved to be important factors affecting methane production benassi et al 2021 xing et al 2005 nitrogen and phosphorus load in urban reaches could remove the nutrients limiting of methanogens in water bodies and sediments ho et al 2022 liu and greaver 2009 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2022 besides ammonia oxidizing bacteria can compete with methane oxidizing bacteria for o2 in water column under abundant nh4 and thus inhibiting ch4 oxidation bodelier and steenbergh 2014 hu et al 2017 moreover increasing nitrogen and phosphorus load can also promote river eutrophication it suggested that algal accumulation would enhance benthic methanogenesis through decaying and providing small molecule organic matter schroll et al 2020 wang et al 2022a contributing to the high ch4 emissions in eutrophic reaches table s2 table 2 furthermore the positive correlation of nitrogen and phosphorus and ch4 concentration might be partly attributed to the fact that ch4 rich municipal sewage input in urban reaches can feed nutrients and dissolved ch4 simultaneously xia et al 2022 conductivity was included in all stepwise multiple regression models for ch4 concentrations also implying the synchronous change of ch4 concentration and ion content including nutrients ion as a result all nutrient parameters in our two suburban rivers crossing urban rural interface presented nearly identical contributions 26 41 to the variation of ch4 emissions it also implied that the relations of water quality parameters and ch4 and n2o dynamics in rivers might be controlled by not only the internal biogeochemical process but also the watershed urban expansion in rivers or streams n2o production mainly derives from denitrification autotrophic nitrification and anaerobic ammonification nitrification beaulieu et al 2011 liu and greaver 2009 quick et al 2019 anaerobic condition and abundant carbon and nutrients substrates intensely control n2o dynamic in natural waters beaulieu et al 2011 stow et al 2005 do con carbon and nutrients were significantly related to n2o concentration in this study being consistent with other studies he et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b it indicated pollution load increase and water quality degradation caused by urbanization can significantly promote the production of n2o in suburban rivers meanwhile the correlation between n2o concentration and inorganic n could indicate the importance of different n2o production ways for in situ n2o saturation obviously no3 and nh4 had the similar explanation for n2o concentration fig 8 suggesting n2o in this study might come from both denitrification and anaerobic ammonification nitrification in many rivers disturbed by cities denitrification was found to be the main pathway of n2o production li et al 2022 stow et al 2005 yang and lei 2018 while autotrophic nitrification and anaerobic ammonification nitrification have been widely found in polluted waters chun et al 2020 ho et al 2022 nirmal rajkumar et al 2008 when we only analyzed data of urban reaches no3 and nh4 still presented positive correlations with n2o concentration but no correlation of nh4 and n2o concentration were found when using exurban data fig s11 it indicated that n2o in exurban reaches may derived mainly from denitrification but these in urban reaches may originate from multitype process except denitrification low do and high nh4 in urban reaches would enhance n2o production via anaerobic ammonification nitrification progress hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 nguyen et al 2019 sanchez rodriguez et al 2022 in the future more molecular biological evidence for exploring the potential effect of urban expansion on in situ n2o produce way in suburban rivers should be investigated in this study we established two stepwise multiple regression models smrm for ch4 and n2o concentrations in suburban rivers respectively the two models ending up with similar sets of proxies suggested that both gases in our two suburban rivers were likely to be affected by similar mechanisms fig 9 this is also supported by the strong covariation between ch4 and n2o fig s12 and their close relation with urban land use fig 10 the results of the estimation of ch4 and n2o concentrations by these two models are basically consistent with the observed values fig s13 these results provide strong evidence that as a result of land use effect longitudinal differentiation of water physicochemical parameters can predict ch4 and n2o emissions well in river crossing rural urban interface furthermore the two models were tested using dataset from a series of surveys in the mountainous chongqing china gong et al 2018 he et al 2017 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2022b good linear correlations between the predicted and observed values were obtained fig s13 despite being limited by data representativeness considering that our two rivers are located in the subtropical mountains the models may be restricted to the mountainous urban rivers with high flow velocity and strong turbulence so their prediction ability for the lowland rivers with higher ch4 and n2o concentrations table s3 and s4 and rivers in tropical regions may be poor particularly the two smrms showed poor predictive power for ch4 concentrations when the observed values below 1700 nmol l 1 even so it emphasized that our stepwise multiple regression model can give us a possible path to extrapolate ch4 and n2o emissions at the whole regional network scale besides sem models indicated urbanization can not only indirectly dominate the concentrations of ch4 and n2o through water environment factors but also directly affect ch4 and n2o concentrations fig 11 table 3 nh4 tp dtc and conductivity played mediating effect between land use and ch4 and n2o emissions it could be attributed to the input of domestic sewage with high nutrients as well as high ch4 and n2o concentrations alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 li et al 2020 many previous studies highlighted that the effluent of wwtp was direct source of riverine ch4 and n2o alshboul et al 2016 masuda et al 2018 tang et al 2021 in our study sewage dominated tributaries had exceptionally high ch4 and n2o concentrations in hr watershed which further supported such viewpoints therefore our study confirmed the indirect dominance of ch4 and n2o by land use change as a result of urban expansion moreover the management of land use and control of nutrient and organic matter loading should be considered to mitigate aquatic ch4 and n2o emissions during urban expansion 5 conclusion this study investigated the spatial and temporal variations of ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes in two small mountainous suburban rivers located in chongqing china and identified the effect of watershed land use change and the consequent water environment alteration our findings suggested that the ch4 and n2o concentrations in the two suburban rivers exhibited disproportionately strong variability in comparison with their smaller watersheds the two suburban streams were persistent sources of atmospheric ch4 and n2o with overall mean fluxes of 960 2 966 6 µmol m 2 d 1 and 205 1 240 8 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and n2o showed a sharp increase when the rivers cross the rural urban interface such discontinuous spatial pattern of ch4 and n2o emissions in river continuum were shown to be closely related to watershed land use and could be modeled as functions of the urban land use proportion these prediction functions could explain more than half of the spatial variations of ch4 and n2o with limited mountainous samples we highlighted that watershed urban expansion played a crucial role in the spatial pattern of both ch4 and n2o emissions from rivers across urban rural interface smrm based on water environment parameters were established in our study and indicated that nh4 tp dtc and conductivity played key controls on ch4 and n2o emissions in the two mountainous suburban rivers moreover smrm was tested to have good predictive could provide a possible path to extrapolate ch4 and n2o emissions in mountainous urbanized rivers at the whole regional network scale the results of the structural equation model provided strong evidence for direct and indirect controls of urban expansion on longitudinal differentiation of ch4 and n2o in rivers crossing rural urban interface we argue that riverine ch4 and n2o emissions would be sensitive to the watershed urbanization and water pollution in the mountainous urban rural areas and suggest that land use management nutrient and organic matter control can be

2168,urban rivers have been proved to be the hot spots of atmospheric methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o emissions however the rivers across rural urban interface which are undergoing significant environmental changes in the process of urbanization received little attention in this study we conducted seasonal investigations in two small suburban rivers in mountainous southwest china to clarify the spatial temporal characteristics of ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes in relation to watershed land use change and their potential controls the results showed that the small suburban rivers acted as strong ch4 and n2o emitters to atmosphere with averaged fluxes of 960 2 966 6 and 205 1 240 8 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and n2o presented a sharp increase and spatial variability when the rivers cross the rural urban interface such discontinuous spatial pattern of ch4 and n2o emission in river continuum were closely related to watershed land use and could be modeled as functions of the urban land use proportion the urban land proportion in the basins could explain 70 and 59 of the total spatial variations of ch4 and n2o emissions respectively stepwise multiple regression models smrm based on water environment parameters were established in our study and indicate that dtc nh4 no3 tp and conductivity play key controls on ch4 and n2o emissions in the two studied mountainous suburban rivers moreover smrm and urban land use based functions were tested to have good predictions based on constrained mountainous samples could provide a possible path to extrapolate ch4 and n2o emissions in mountainous urbanized rivers at the whole regional network scale we also found evidences for the sewage dominated tributary with abnormally high ch4 and n2o concentrations which was partially responsible for the sharp increase of ch4 and n2o fluxes in urban reaches the results of structural equation model provided strong evidence for direct and indirect controls of urban expansion on longitudinal differentiation of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions crossing rural urban interface we argued that ch4 and n2o emissions from rivers in the mountainous rural urban area are sensitive to the watershed urbanization and water pollution and suggested that land use management nutrient and organic matter control can be promising avenues to mitigate riverine ch4 and n2o emissions keywords ch4 and n2o watershed urbanization land use change sewage load spatial and seasonal variation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o are important greenhouse gases ghg in the atmosphere having approximately 34 times and 298 times global warming potential of co2 over a 100 yr period respectively ipcc 2021 inland waters have been proved to act as a significant source of atmospheric ch4 and n2o bastviken et al 2011 beaulieu et al 2011 saunois et al 2020 a latest study has pointed out that 41 or 53 of the global ch4 emissions could be attributed to aquatic ecosystems rosentreter et al 2021 ravishankara et al 2009 estimated that n2o emissions from inland waters also could contribute to 25 30 of total global n2o emissions throughout the 21st century therefore ch4 and n2o emissions from inland waters have been gained comprehensive attention rivers and streams act as pools of terrestrial carbon c and nitrogen n and the most active biogeochemical reactors playing the most important contribution to global aquatic ch4 and n2o budget marzadri et al 2021 stanley et al 2016 the total ch4 emission from global rivers and streams were recently estimated to be 28 43 tg yr 1 zheng et al 2022 equivalent to approximately 30 of the ch4 emissions from inland aquatic systems zheng et al 2022 meanwhile global rivers and streams could emit about 29 6 35 3 mean of 32 2 gg n2o yr 1 hu et al 2016 yao et al 2020 estimated that global riverine n2o emissions may even reach up to 291 3 58 6 gg yr 1 however the inherent sensibility of riverine ch4 and n2o dynamics to hydrology water quality topography and climate conditions strongly complicates the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of ch4 and n2o emissions from river systems borges et al 2015 campeau and del giorgio 2014 hu et al 2017 combined with severe disparity of data and more broad man made interference it showed obviously poor precision and considerable uncertainties in the estimation of ch4 and n2o emissions from rivers on global or regional scale marzadri et al 2021 saunois et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 therefore more regional observations with high spatial and temporal resolution are needed for a better understanding of the characteristics of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions under different environmental contexts especially for those rivers disturbed by human activities generally riverine n2o is produced as a byproduct of microbially mediated denitrification and nitrification of terrestrial nitrogen beaulieu et al 2011 marzadri et al 2021 yang and lei 2018 while ch4 derives from the degradation of organic matter in the anaerobic sediment via methanogenesis stanley et al 2016 wang et al 2018 it is generally assumed that organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen load within rivers are closely related to riverine ch4 and n2o yield chun et al 2020 lin et al 2022 however river ecosystem is a dynamic bioreactor with uncontrollable reaction conditions riverine ch4 and n2o dynamics are controlled by both macro and micro environmental factors including water quality parameters e g dissolved oxygen temperature organic matter and nutrients ho et al 2022 wang et al 2009 hydrology water depth flow velocity discharge and runoff cooper et al 2017 sawakuchi et al 2014 and comprehensive watershed environment e g land use and human activities alshboul et al 2016 yang and lei 2018 zhang et al 2020b beyond that anthropogenic wastewater effluents or lateral seepage from cities and nearby agriculture crop and discharge of groundwater with supersaturated ch4 n2o also have been considered as important point sources for inland water ch4 and n2o borges et al 2018 crawford and stanley 2016 jurado et al 2018 these uncertainties associated with environmental conditions and exogenous contribution can interfere with the relationships between internal carbon and nitrogen metabolism and the productions and emissions of ch4 and n2o underscoring the complexity of riverine ch4 and n2o dynamics as a result in most of previous studies fluvial internal carbon and nitrogen cycling rates may not provide an adequate explanation for the spatiotemporal variations in ch4 and n2o emissions alshboul et al 2016 li et al 2020 marescaux et al 2018 particularly in urbanizing watersheds anthropogenic perturbations can substantially dominate aquatic biogeochemical process through water pollution and land use change tang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 and thus perturb the spatiotemporal patterns and regulatory mechanisms of riverine ch4 and n2o fluxes li et al 2020 wang et al 2018 yang and lei 2018 although the influences of urban sprawl and resulting land use change on water quality runoff process and microbial processes have been studied extensively bellido et al 2011 ge et al 2020 jordan et al 1997 thais et al 2019 yang and lei 2018 clarifying the spatiotemporal uncertainty and potential human contribution in ch4 and n2o emissions in urban disturbed rivers are challenging some recent studies conducted in rivers draining in different watershed landscapes have identified that land use change which acts synthetic expression of environment heterogeneity and human activity in watershed is closely linked to riverine ch4 and n2o emissions and explains more of their heterogeneity in human influenced watershed tang et al 2021 tang et al 2023 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2022 yang and lei 2018 zhang et al 2020b spatial differentiation of fluvial ch4 and n2o fluxes in connection with watershed rural urban structure have been also found in a lowland river network of shanghai china yu et al 2013 yu et al 2017 moreover most studies highlighted urban inland water were significant hotspots of ch4 and n2o degassing compared to those draining in natural or agricultural landscape marescaux et al 2018 tang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b and then it may be expected that rivers flowing from natural to urban landscapes would show strongly spatial non continuity and erratic patterns in ch4 and n2o emissions due to increasing inputs of point or nonpoint source pollution and sewage leaks alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 however evidences about the spatial non continuity of ch4 and n2o emissions in a complete river continuum across rural urban interface and the relation with watershed land use are still seldom beaulieu et al 2010 jin et al 2018 moreover most of these studies were only conducted in lowland rivers hu et al 2017 wang et al 2020 yu et al 2013 yu et al 2017 the response of ch4 and n2o emissions from numerous small mountain rivers remains unclear because of their stronger turbulence and shorter residence time anyhow untangling the possible link between watershed land use change and ch4 and n2o emissions can not only provide a more macro perspective for exploring the key drivers on the heterogeneity in riverine greenhouse gases but also support the estimation of greenhouse gases inventory and low carbon land use management urbanization is the most important motivation driving region land use change and nowadays over 60 of land has been covered by urban annual reports on global ecosystem and environment observation 2021 given the close association of river ch4 and n2o dynamics with land use change impacts of global urban expansion are predicted to be particularly important for riverine ch4 and n2o emissions he et al 2017 herrero ortega et al 2019 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2020 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b and these impacts maybe more significant in the rural urban interface area suburban river traversing rural urban interface area which is undergoing partial urbanization process and featuring with high landscape heterogeneity can provide opportunities for exploring the correlation of spatial variation in riverine ch4 and n2o fluxes with watershed land use change particularly the investigations of these suburban river continuums are beneficial for predicting the potential impacts of urban expansion and land use change on spatial temporal variability of ch4 and n2o fluxes in the context of global change moreover given the difference in hydrologic process between lowland and mountainous area more studies should be conducted in the small suburban mountainous rivers to advance our understanding of riverine ch4 and n2o dynamics under different geography backgrounds under the background of the western development plan and construction of the yangtze river economic belt the mountainous areas in the upper reaches of the yangtze river in western china have experienced rapid urbanization in the process of urban expansion a large number of small natural rivers have been converted peri urban disturbed rivers with partial urbanized reaches in this study two small mountainous rivers located in the fringe of the chongqing municipality china were selected as rural urban interface representatives for seasonal field survey on the concentrations and diffusive emissions of ch4 and n2o in surface water in the past few years chongqing has the most rapid urbanization as the center of the yangtze river economic belt furthermore as a mountainous city rivers in chongqing are individualized with faster flow and stronger turbulence than those in flat areas the aims of this study are to 1 define the spatial and temporal variation patterns of ch4 and n2o emissions from suburban rivers 2 explore the relationship between riverine ch4 and n2o concentrations and emissions and watershed land use transformation during urban expansion and 3 examine key controlling factors and mechanism of the effect of land use change on riverine ch4 and n2o emissions we attempt to provide a rural urban interface model of riverine greenhouse gas effluxes and evaluate the potential human contribution to ch4 and n2o emissions in mountainous urban disturbed rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey region this study was conducted in the hou river hr 29 44 30 0 n 106 34 106 43 e a tributary of the jialing river and chaoyang river cyr 29 38 29 48 n 106 39 106 45 e a tributary of the yangtze river located in chongqing china fig 1 the basin area of hr and cyr are 358 km2 and 117 km2 and the total mainstream length are about 54 km and 31 km respectively both showing comparatively small watersheds the main landforms in the two watersheds consists of numerous mountain and valley with steep bank slopes and narrow riverbeds the study area is featured with a humid subtropical monsoon with warm rainy summer and cold dry winter the mean rainfall is about 1000 1400 mm most of which approximately 70 occurs in the wet season from may to october the annual average temperature is 18 3 c with a maximum and minimum of 41 0 c and 3 2 c respectively forest farmland and urban were the main land use types in our survey region fig 1b covering about 34 47 and 19 of the entire area respectively there were three important wastewater treatment plants adjacent to the two selected rivers fig 1b in this study we use the landsat tm etm images 30 m pixel as the data source to extract and classify land use type by arcgis 10 2 software to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of land cover in hr and cyr basin we divided the mainstream into at least 10 segments from upstream to downstream and extracted circumjacent land use data around each segment within 1 km radius proportions of urban land in hr and cyr basins increase about 10 times and 6 times respectively from upstream to downstream while forest and farmland proportion decrease rapidly fig 1c meanwhile the field survey found that there were some tributaries fed by the effluents of adjacent wastewater treatment plants interflowing into the downstream segments of hr and cr thus it can be seen the downstream of hr and cyr were seriously influenced by urban development while upstream were dominated by farmland or forest and almost impervious to urban 2 2 land use and sampling site design based on the characteristics of land use data of the two suburban basins we deployed 10 sampling sites along hr h1 h10 and 9 sites along cyr c1 c9 from upstream to downstream representing watershed land use change from rural to urban fig 1 here h1 h7 and c1 c6 represent the upper and middle reaches unaffected or slightly affected by urban land while h8 h9 and c7 c9 represent urban reaches furthermore to explore the influence of municipal sewage 4 sampling sites were established at the two sewage dominated tributaries of hr marked as hb1 hb2 hz1 and hz2 additional one site was set in the tributary of cyr marked as cz fig 1 finally totally 24 sampling sites were selected at each site we deployed 3 repeat samples in the center and both flanks of the rivers field measurements and water sample collections were carried out in september 2014 december 2014 march 2015 and june 2015 following the seasonal principle river flow velocity and discharge of hr ranged from 0 21 to 1 34 m s 1 average of 0 57 0 27 m s 1 and from 0 84 to 79 82 m3 s 1 average 17 21 17 24 m3 s 1 respectively in cyr river flow velocity and discharge ranged from 0 35 to 1 07 m s 1 average of 0 66 0 21 m s 1 and from 2 25 to 106 12 m3 s 1 average 23 11 20 41 m3 s 1 the average maximum flow velocity and discharge occurred in june 2 3 filed sampling during each sampling event we first collected 500 ml of surface water at 20 cm depth by a 1 l organic glass water sampler and stored in an acid washed 0 5 l high density polyethylene container to measure the water chemical parameters including the dissolved total carbon dtc dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic ammonium nitrogen nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp dissolved total phosphorus dtp sulphate so4 2 and orthophosphate po4 3 triplicate water samples were collected in each site resulting in a total of 288 samples whereafter we used the calibrated manta 2 multiparameter water quality probe analyzer eureka usa to determine in situ water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do ph conductivity con chlorophyll a chl a and turbidity turb with a precision of 0 01 c 0 01 mg l 1 0 01 units 0 1 μs cm 1 0 01 μg l 1 and 0 1 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu respectively in addition the ph electrode was calibrated prior to each measurement with buffers of 4 01 7 00 and 10 01 to ensure its precision of 0 01 units meanwhile a kestrel 2500 anemometer was used to measure the air temperature at air pressure and wind speed u at 1 m above the river surface furthermore we also measured the flow velocity river width and water depth at each sampling site using current meter laser rangefinders and depth meter respectively ch4 and n2o concentrations in this study were determined by the headspace balance method which has been widely employed in dissolved greenhouse gas measurement in fresh waters jin et al 2018 kampbell et al 1989 tang et al 2021 in each site extra water samples were collected by an airproof hydrophore and then we used a syringe to pump 100 ml water from the hydrophore and inject into a 200 ml aluminum foil gas bag directly which was fully vacuumed and promptly sealed without any atmospheric air after that 0 2 ml of saturated hgcl2 was injected into the gas bag to inhibit microbial activity meanwhile we collected 100 ml atmospheric gas samples at 1 m above the water surface and poured into another 100 ml aluminum lined gas bags for the determination of atmospheric ch4 and n2o background concentrations all the sampling campaigns were conducted during daytime and all the water samples were stored at 4 c until analysis within 3 days 2 4 analytical methods we used highly purified n2 as headspace supporting gas for determination of dissolved n2o and ch4 concentrations first 80 ml of highly purified n2 purity 99 99 was injected into the gas bag with 100 ml water sample to create headspace the gas sample bag was then shaken violently for 5 min to allow the gas to diffuse out and the ch4 and n2o to equilibrate between the headspace and water phase later 10 ml of the headspace gas was immediately transferred into a customized vacuum glass bottle with volume of 10 ml for gas composition analysis all the in situ gas samples and headspace samples were measured with ch4 and n2o by gas chromatography agilent7890a agilent co usa equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and flame ionization detector fid detailed operating conditions are shown in si the initial water samples were filtered through microfiltration membrane 0 45 μm millipore filter for the measurement of dtc doc dic no3 nh4 dtp and po4 3 concentrations dtc doc and dic were analyzed by miltin c2100stoc analyzer jena germany with a precision of 0 001 mg l 1 no3 and nh4 were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry method and salicylic acid spectrophotometry method respectively dtp measured by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion and ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry method ppams po4 3 concentrations were measured by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry method the initial water samples were used for tn and tp measurement through the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method and ppams respectively all the analysis procedures followed the china national standard method https www sac gov cn all the water chemistry data has been published in wang et al 2021b 2 5 data calculation the concentrations of dissolved ch4 and n2o were calculated using henry s law weiss 1974 the equations are as follows 1 c w c a v a α c a v w v w 2 α r t h 3 h h 0 e k 1 t 1 273 15 where cw is the concentration of dissolved ch4 or n2o µmol l 1 ca is ch4 and n2o concentrations in the headspace µmol l 1 va is the volume of headspace n2 in the gas bag 0 08 l vw is the volume of water in the gas bag 0 10 l α is the bunsen coefficient r is the gas constant 0 082057 l μatm μmol 1 k 1 h is the henry s solubility constant μmol l 1 atm 1 corrected based on field water temperature and h is the henry s constant at 298 15 k μmol l 1 atm 1 which is 1325 for ch4 and 24714 μmol l 1 atm 1 for n2o k is a temperature dependent constant k of 1750 k and 2675 k for ch4 and n2o respectively t is the kelvin temperature of water k ch4 and n2o diffusive fluxes of the sampled rivers were calculated via the classic thin boundary layer model tbl liss and slater 1974 based on that the gas transfer coefficient times the ch4 and n2o concentration gradient between water and atmosphere equilibrium and the calculation equation is expressed as follow 4 f k c w c 0 where f is the ch4 and n2o flux μmol m 2 d 1 k is the gas exchange coefficient m d 1 c0 is the atmospheric background concentration of ch4 and n2o the other parameters have the same meaning as the eq 1 gas transfer velocity k is generally thought to be mainly controlled by water turbulence that correlates with wind speed and hydrologic conditions flow velocity discharge and others raymond and cole 2001 so it has been generally parameterized using measured values of wind speed and or water turbulence raymond and cole 2001 there have been a series of empirical equations based on wind or hydrology for k prediction as shown in wang et al 2020 and raymond et al 2012 table s1 these models provide an opportunity for ch4 and n2o diffusion fluxes estimation when k values were not measured in this study the two suburban rivers are typical mountain streams with steep slopes fast flow velocities and small water surface thus the wind speed based models which are usually used in large rivers or lakes are obviously inapplicable in our system to reduce the uncertainties in the estimations of ch4 and n2o diffusive fluxes based on the tbl method hydrodynamic parameters based models propose by raymond et al 2012 m1 m6 in table s1 were employed for k calculation these models have been particularly recommended for k calculation in smaller streams and rivers raymond et al 2012 firstly we calculated k for each sampling site using the six hydrological models m1 m6 table s1 and finally averaged out a relatively modest value for error reduction data such as velocity discharge water depth and slope at each sampling point have been enumerated in the support material table s2 for comparison we also calculated k using other wind speed models m7 m8 and m9 and wind speed hydrological models m10 and m11 to assess the impact of the models on gas fluxes fig s1 the calculated k values by multi models in this study range of 6 21 25 8 m d 1 mean of 14 7 4 5 m d 1 are moderate to superior relative to the predictive value 0 24 24 m d 1 for streams by raymond et al 2012 and much higher than the wind speed based k 0 06 1 79 m d 1 fig s1 our k values were comparable but still high to k levels reported in five rivers of the mountains three gorges reservoir catchment 2 02 12 26 m d 1 tang et al 2021 and the small rivers in chongqing mean of 11 6 m d 1 li et al 2019 because of the steep slopes and fast flow velocities of our two mountain rivers relatively high k generated by hydrodynamic parameters based models is logical even so we also declare that the potential overestimation of ch4 and n2o diffusive fluxes in present study may exist more details of k calculation are shown in si 2 6 statistical analyses all initial data was standardized and calculated in microsoft excel 2019 microsoft corporation usa spss 23 0 chicago 1l usa was used to perform all the statistical analyses all data was tested for their normality before the statistical analyses and was log transformed as necessary to meet the assumption of normal distribution and homoscedasticity stevens 1946 correlation analysis was utilized to assess the relationships between riverine ch4 and n2o concentrations and water physical chemical parameters linear and nonlinear regressions were applied to establish the relationships of land use with gas fluxes we also carried out a series of simple linear regressions and stepwise multiple regressions smr to check the relations of ch4 and n2o concentrations fluxes with the auxiliary water quality parameters because of the dominant role of urbanization on water quality see more on this below the correlativity among water quality parameters was obviously predictable the situation is unfavorable to explore possible predictors for the ch4 and n2o concentrations meanwhile there may be a lot of information redundancy when we constructed prediction function of gases fluxes based on water quality parameters execution of smr can introduce the numerous auxiliary parameters into the model one by one and eliminate the redundant variables thus avoiding multicollinearity and obtaining a relatively simple model with fewer variables you and yan 2017 using the parameters calculated by stepwise multivariate regression we also conducted structural equation model sem for path purposes to better understand the direct and indirect relationships between the land use water environment and ch4 and n2o concentrations the chi squared degree of freedom ratio cmin df goodness fit index gfi comparative fit index cfi and normed fit index nfi were used to evaluate the successful fit of the model the sem was conducted using the spss amos 24 0 software a cmin df value 3 and by values of the other indices gfi cfi nfi close to 1 indicate a good fit all the illustrations were made in graphpad prism 8 3 results 3 1 watershed land use and water environment doc dtc nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the two rivers gradually increased from upstream to downstream and reached a peak in the urban segments table s3 nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in downstream urban segments increased about 2 5 times compared with those in non urban segments table s3 here we analyzed the relationships between watershed land use change and water environmental parameters the urban cover proportion showed significant negative relationship with do but positive relationship with conductivity the proportion of urban cover in watershed also showed significant positive relationship with tn tp and dtc and could explain 36 47 and 60 of their variations respectively fig 2 thus urban expansion is an important reason for increasing carbon nitrogen and phosphorus load of the suburban rivers 3 2 ch4 concentration and flux the dissolved ch4 concentration in the two suburban rivers ranged from 58 6 to 1950 4 nmol l 1 with an overall average of 398 6 415 4 nmol l 1 the variability of ch4 concentration showed so intense that varied three orders of magnitudes ch4 concentration in hr and cyr showed similar variation range of 58 6 1950 4 nmol l 1 and 67 4 1710 4 nmol l 1 respectively while the averaged ch4 concentration in hr 462 6 463 8 nmol l 1 was higher than that in cyr of 308 9 315 1 nmol l 1 ch4 concentration in all samples was approximately 36 4 300 times the gas concentration at equilibrium with the overlying atmosphere about 18 0 nmol l 1 the ch4 concentration in the two suburban rivers showed obviously downstream increasing particularly from the sites where the rivers flow into the urban area fig 3 the average ch4 concentration in the urban segments h8 h10 c7 c9 of hr and cyr were 781 4 470 9 nmol l 1 and 552 3 378 6 nmol l 1 respectively about 5 4 and 3 8 times higher than those in the upper and middle reaches segments which are unaffected or slightly affected by urban land fig 3 relatively low ch4 concentration were found in outlying segments dominated by forest and farming landscape 123 0 nmol l 1 of hr and 139 0 nmol l 1 of cyr moreover peak concentrations of ch4 were observed in the sewage dominated tributaries marked with hb and cz especially averaged ch4 in hz2 reached 1493 9 nmol l 1 in terms of temporal variation the two rivers showed similar seasonal patterns of ch4 concentration which were significantly higher in spring 571 3 483 6 nmol l 1 than the other three seasons fig 4 particularly both rivers showed generally low ch4 concentration in warm summer even being comparable to these found in cold winter averaged ch4 concentration in cyr in summer 203 9 nmol l 1 was even markedly lower than that in winter 291 7 nmol l 1 disobeying the temperature driven biogeochemistry pattern moreover ch4 concentration showed consistent seasonal variation patterns in urban and exurban reaches fig 4 compared with the non urban reach the seasonal variation of ch4 concentration in urban segments was much more intense fig 4 based on the boundary layer model the estimated ch4 fluxes from the two suburban rivers presented an overall mean of 960 2 966 6 µmol m 2 d 1 median 582 0 µmol m 2 d 1 ch4 fluxes in hr and cyr both showed much larger temporal and spatial uncertainty with variation range of 0 9 3917 0 µmol m 2 d 1and 21 5 3843 7 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively averaged ch4 flux in hr was 1069 2 1012 4 µmol m 2 d 1 slightly higher than that in cyr 807 6 876 0 µmol m 2 d 1 ch4 fluxes from downstream urban segments of hr and cyr reached up to 1842 3 888 8 µmol m 2 d 1and 1558 1 950 6 µmol m 2 d 1 5 7 times higher than those in upper reaches ch4 fluxes of the two rivers also showed an obviously increasing trend with the proportion of urban land use fig 3 3 3 n2o concentration and flux n2o concentration in the two sampling rivers varied in a wide range of two magnitudes from 2 7 to 592 1 nmol l 1 mean of 77 2 89 5 nmol l 1 and median of 42 3 nmol l 1 all samples showed oversaturated with n2o and about 23 times the water atmosphere equilibrium concentration hr had averaged n2o concentration of 96 9 105 1 nmol l 1 median 66 4 nmol l 1 higher than that in cyr of 49 8 49 5 nmol l 1 median 35 8 nmol l 1 similar to the variation in ch4 concentration n2o concentration also presented a strong spatial variability fig 5 n2o concentration ranged from 2 7 nmol l 1 to 105 1 nmol l 1 across the upper and middle segments of the two rivers mean of 33 1 26 6 nmol l 1 in hr and 19 4 12 7 nmol l 1 cyr and began a growth spurt after flowing into the urban area fig 5 in urban segments the averaged n2o concentration in hr and cyr were 160 6 115 2 nmol l 1and 95 3 49 1 nmol l 1 rose approximately 5 times compared with the exurban segments n2o concentration in segments which drained more forest landscape h4 h5 c1 c2 was a little lower than agricultural segments and observably lower than urban segments fig 5 clearly n2o concentration in both suburban rivers presented highly synchronous spatial variation with the proportion of urban land use around each sampling site furthermore n2o concentration in the sewage dominated tributaries of hr and cyr was much higher than those in the mainstreams fig 5 distinct seasonal variations in the n2o concentration were found in both suburban rivers with higher averages in autumn 103 3 122 6 nmol l 1 and spring 92 5 76 8 nmol l 1 than winter 71 1 88 0 nmol l 1 and summer 42 1 34 1 nmol l 1 fig 6 there was a consistent seasonal variation pattern of n2o concentration either in urban or non urban reaches fig 6 the calculated n2o flux in the two rivers ranged from 3 7 1513 6 µmol m 2 d 1 with an overall mean of 205 1 240 8 µmol m 2 d 1 as a net n2o emission source to the atmosphere except for a few sampling points n2o fluxes from the two suburban rivers increased from upstream to downstream along the urbanization gradients distinctly the urban reaches of hr with an average n2o flux of 419 0 311 0 µmol m 2 d 1 was 4 7 times higher than those in outlying reaches with a value of 88 8 83 1 µmol m 2 d 1 meanwhile n2o flux in cyr from urban reaches 272 129 9 µmol m 2 d 1 was 5 8 times higher than the exurban reaches 46 6 50 4 µmol m 2 d 1 it was noteworthy that the highest concentration and flux of n2o were both found at the sewage input point whatever the hr or the cyr 3 4 relationships between ch4 and n2o with water environmental parameters pearson correlation analysis showed that the dissolved ch4 and n2o concentrations were significantly related to most of the water environmental parameters including do con carbon and nutrients content p 0 01 table 1 there were significant positive correlations between doc dtc tn tp no3 nh4 and dtp and dissolved gas concentrations p 0 01 either in hr or cyr while dissolved ch4 and n2o concentrations had negative relationship with do particularly ch4 and n2o concentrations were both positively correlated with conductivity an important pollution indicator however there was no correlation of dissolved gas concentrations with wt turb chl a and so4 2 linear regressions showed that doc dtc and nutrients content in water could explain 26 41 and 24 47 of total variations in ch4 and n2o respectively fig 7 fig 8 conductivity acted as a powerful explainer for the variation in ch4 and n2o concentrations with determination coefficient of 0 50 and 0 36 respectively fig s2 furthermore among all the water chemical indicators dtc and nh4 had the strongest explanatory power for ch4 concentration with r2 0 4 p 0 001 tn no3 tp doc and dtc acted as the most powerful contributors to variations in n2o concentrations r2 0 4 p 0 001 smr were further used to establish predictive equations between ch4 and n2o concentrations and multiple water environmental parameters table 2 the determination coefficients of predictive equations using all data for ch4 and n2o were 0 70 and 0 73 respectively table 2 the change of the adjusted determination coefficients with variable entry was shown in fig 9 conductivity dtc and tp were the biggest contributors to the prediction equation of ch4 concentration while no3 dtc con and tp were the biggest contributors to the prediction equation of n2o 3 5 relationship between ch4 n2o concentrations and watershed land use we found that the annual averages of ch4 and n2o concentrations at each sampling site were significantly and positively correlated with the proportion of urban land use within a 1 km radius buffer zone fig 10 the urban land use proportion could explain 69 and 85 of total spatial variation in ch4 concentration in hr and cyr respectively and urban land use also could explain 62 82 of spatial variation in n2o concentration meanwhile we found relatively weak and negative relationships between ch4 n2o concentrations and forest and agriculture ratios fig s3 as shown in sems fig 11 and table 3 urbanization had a significant positive and direct impact on methane concentration with a direct effect of 0 265 and it also indirectly influenced the ch4 concentration by affecting con dtc tp nh4 with an indirect effect of 0 502 therefore the total effect of urbanization on the ch4 concentration was 0 767 the direct effects indirect effects and total effects of urban land use on n2o concentration was 0 04 0 685 and 0 681 respectively the indirect effects of urbanization on ch4 and n2o were considerably higher than the direct effects therefore urbanization indirectly dominated the concentrations of ch4 and n2o by changing the physicochemical parameters of river 4 discussion 4 1 intensity and variation of ch4 and n2o fluxes in the two mountainous suburban rivers it has been widely recognized that rivers and streams are potential ch4 and n2o emission sources borges et al 2015 marzadri et al 2021 rosentreter et al 2021 the two mountainous rivers in our study were in general supersaturated with ch4 and n2o relative to the water atmosphere equilibrium values indicating that the two rivers acted as net sources of ch4 and n2o to the atmosphere however compared to the averaged ch4 concentration from global rivers 1350 5160 nmo l 1 stanley et al 2016 our average values were much lower the observed ch4 and n2o concentrations were also lower than most previous reports from different types of rivers tables s4 and s5 even the highest ch4 and n2o concentrations in urban sections were also far lower than the levels previously reported in the similar sized urban rivers especially in the lowland ones hu et al 2017 jin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b limited reports in mountainous rivers also found comparatively low ch4 and n2o concentrations he et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ch4 and n2o productions in river are mainly controlled by the factors including anaerobic environment the accumulation of organic matter in sediments and the abundance of microorganism song et al 2022 stanley et al 2016 while rivers in mountain environment which had faster flow velocity and intense turbulence resulting in less organic material accumulation adequate aeration restricted microbial colonization and rapid degassing across water air surface raymond et al 2012 stanley et al 2016 these conditions are not conducive to the production and accumulation of ch4 and n2o nonetheless ch4 and n2o concentrations in urban reaches were much higher than those in the exurban reaches and most reports in natural rivers galantini et al 2021 hu et al 2017 affirming the enhancement of urban expansion on riverine greenhouse gases accumulation in mountainous rivers fig 3 our estimates of ch4 and n2o fluxes fell in the range of the reported values of many rivers around the world tables s4 and s5 the averaged ch4 fluxes in hr and cyr were also lower than the estimated global riverine mean value 8220 25500 µmol m 2 d 1 n 385 sites stanley et al 2016 and most of the urban rivers worldwide table s4 however ch4 fluxes in urban reaches were comparable to the sewage rivers in lowland tianjin hu et al 2017 and higher than those river networks of chongqing and shanghai metropolitans wang et al 2018 yu et al 2017 suggesting these urban reaches were ch4 emission hotspots in suburban rivers meanwhile n2o fluxes in our study located in medium high among global rivers table s5 average n2o fluxes in the two suburban rivers were also lower than most urbanized rivers but higher than non urbanized ones table s5 it is worth noting that the estimated n2o fluxes in urban reaches of hr and cyr were even higher than those heavily polluted urban rivers chang et al 2015 hu et al 2017 also acting as remarkable hotspots of n2o emissions we highlighted that mountainous suburban rivers are important but complicated and changeable sources of ch4 and n2o for local or regional greenhouse gas budgets in the context of continuous urban expansion ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes showed disproportionately high variability across upstream to downstream compare to their restricted drainage area fig 3 fig 5 the rangeability of ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes in this study exceeded more than three orders of magnitudes even beyond those found in some large river basins jin et al 2018 song et al 2022 upstill goddard et al 2017 the maximum ch4 concentration and fluxes that have been found in urban reaches were over 300 times that of the minimum in up and middle reaches showing non continuum shift fig 3 fig s4 similar finding was found in other rivers drained land areas with varied urbanization intensities tang et al 2021 obviously such strong heterogeneity can be attributed to the exogenous carbon and nitrogen load and municipal sewage inflow during watershed urban expansion through the perspective of longitudinal non continuum of water environment parameters table s3 figs s4 and s5 we highlighted that this huge variation in ch4 and n2o fluxes from suburbs to urban areas cannot be ignored it provides good evidences for that watershed urbanization can break the river continuum of ch4 and n2o biogeochemical process and then enhance the spatial heterogeneity and erratic patterns therefore the dynamic process of ch4 and n2o in rapidly urbanized areas of small watershed should be paid more attention 4 2 urban land use dominated the spatial pattern of river ch4 and n2o despite streams and rivers act as net ch4 and n2o emission source to the atmosphere variable basin environment hinders our ability to understand how local and longitudinal controls affect spatial patterns of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions and challenge the prediction and upscaling across large areas in our study it showed a clear association of fluvial ch4 and n2o concentrations with the land use change in the two suburban rivers fig 10 fig s3 xia et al 2022 found that riverine ch4 concentration changed dramatically with watershed landscapes from forest to urban yang and lei 2018 found a strong link between the concentrations and emissions of n2o and watershed land use in seven n enriched rivers draining urban rural and agricultural area similar observations were reported in some river networks under compounded artificial natural landscapes such as the chao lake basin zhang et al 2020b shanghai metropolitan area yu et al 2013 chongqing metropolitan area he et al 2017 however unlike these studies of regional river network our study in single river crossing rural urban interface exhibited a clearer spatial non continuity of ch4 and n2o concentrations from upstream to downstream and that such spatial non continuity was consistent with the distribution pattern of urban land use fig s4 and fig s5 until now there are few reports about the relation of ch4 and n2o fluxes and land use although it has been suggested that land used change can be the dominant power for riverine ch4 and n2o fluxes in human interfered watershed and should be incorporated into the model of global river ghg budget borges et al 2018 yu et al 2013 here we found watershed urban land proportion around sampling site could act as strong explainer for ch4 and n2o variability and serve as potential indicators fig 10 estimating fluvial ch4 and n2o concentrations using urban land proportion showed good consistency with the measured values fig 12 r2 0 83 and 0 63 other studies showed urban land use ratio within a radius of 0 5 1 km around sampling reach can explained 32 57 of the variations in riverine ch4 concentration tang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 meanwhile we integrated a dataset of ch4 n 227 and n2o n 200 concentrations from previous reports of urban disturbed rivers and streams in mountainous area and corresponding land use data fig s6 then we used the urban land proportion driven functions derived from our study to calculate a predicted dataset of riverine ch4 and n2o concentrations despite the obvious underestimation the predicted ch4 and n2o values presented a good linear relationship with the observed values fig 12 r2 0 50 and 0 39 indicating that the land use driven predictive models presented here could capture the variation in measured ch4 and n2o in urban disturbed mountain river systems however our empirical models presented poor predictive ability when ch4 and n2o concentrations exceeding 2000 nmol l 1and 200 nmol l 1 respectively fig 12 fig s6 these results implied the potential indicative functions of urban land use in riverine ch4 and n2o fluxes under constrained conditions in addition we also found that hydrological seasonality may influence the coupling relationships between urban land use and ch4 and n2o which were stronger in dry season than in wet season fig s7 with increased precipitation homogenization of upstream and downstream and strong dilution may weaken dependence of ch4 and n2o concentration on urban land use in urban reaches stanley et al 2016 therefore we suggest that both land use impacts and seasonal differences should be taken into account when modeling ch4 and n2o concentrations based on land use in human impacted mountain rivers farming land use has been known as a positive driver for riverine ch4 and n2o productions because more nutrients runoff from agricultural non point source pollution can nourish in situ catabolic processes borges et al 2018 qin et al 2020 however our findings fig s3 contradicted with most previous studies on agricultural basins borges et al 2018 ho et al 2022 song et al 2022 these conflicting results might be attributed to the stronger dominant role on ch4 and n2o spatial pattern of urban expansion than that of farming landscape similar founds have also been reported by tang et al 2021 and zhang et al 2020a in addition urban land had a large effect on river water quality at small scales e g reach or riparian scale than at large scales e g catchment scale whereas agricultural land displayed the opposite scale effects shi et al 2017 in our study water quality and ch4 and n2o emissions showed discontinuous increase in urban reaches table s3 fig 3 fig 5 indicating the local domination effect of urban activity meanwhile such negative correlation of farmland with ch4 and n2o may be also interpreted as that urban expansion occupied farmland but enhanced ch4 and n2o emissions from perspective of urban expansion despite lack of dynamic evidence conservatively it revealed that the influence of urbanization on riverine ch4 and n2o emissions far exceeds that of agriculture land in small mountain basin land use effects on riverine ch4 and n2o emissions should be carefully considered during urban management choices and ecological benefits assessment urban expansion and population agglomeration can result in the enrichment of organic carbon and nutrients in rivers via domestic effluent input thus fueling aquatic ecosystem carbon nitrogen metabolism and loss rosemond et al 2015 shi et al 2017 tang et al 2021 urban land proportion was closely associated with dtc tn tp and do fig 2 which then dominated the substrate and anaerobic conditions for in situ ch4 and n2o generations clear correlativity between concentrations of ch4 and n2o and water nutrients parameters table 1 fig 7 and fig 8 suggested that heavy pollution and nutrients enrichment were critical factors for the singularly high ch4 and n2o concentrations in urban river segments ho et al 2022 studied an urban river system in ecuador and observed a similar pattern of that the more polluted the sites were the higher dissolved ch4 and n2o concentrations were in addition land use can also influence endogenous generation mechanisms of ch4 and n2o via nutrients enrichment from the perspective of riverine microbial functional group ge et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 despite the lack of direct microbiological evidence we also supported water environment degradation due to urban expansion might act as primary mechanism for enhanced ch4 and n2o emissions it is worth noting that sewage discharging from waste water treatment plant wwtp is generally characterized as high ch4 and n2o contents alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 yoon et al 2017 and could directly contribute to ch4 and n2o concentrations in the urban rivers although this source cannot be differentiated from sewage fueled in situ microbial metabolism in our analysis the observed peak ch4 and n2o concentrations in our study all appeared in the locations fed by adjacent wwtp effluent fig 3 and fig 5 it was reported that ch4 concentration in wwtp effluents ranged from 27 17400 nmol l 1 average of 1200 2500 nmol l 1 in germany alshboul et al 2016 these concentrations are generally higher than the values in our urban reaches but consistent with averaged level found in the sewage dominated tributaries 1025 9 472 2 nmol l 1 indicating that wwtp effluents might be another contributors to the ch4 supersaturation in urbanized reaches moreover we also found ch4 and n2o concentrations in mainstream of the two suburban rivers presented growth spurt when the sewage dominated tributaries flowed in fig 3 fig 5 further confirming the worthy contribution of municipal sewage input to the discontinuous spatial variation in ch4 and n2o emissions along the river continuum in conclusion more and more researches have proposed that urban rivers were hotspots of ch4 and n2o fluxes tang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b watershed land use change during regional and global urbanization could be indirect dominant factor controlling the spatial variability of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions we highlighted that the small suburban rivers showed disproportionally high spatial variability in ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes compared with their limited channel length and basin areas as a result of watershed urban expansion and could be used as a good pattern system for studying the complex impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on river ch4 and n2o dynamic meanwhile discontinuous longitudinal differentiation of ch4 and n2o emission and related mechanisms dominated by land use also should be attached more attention 4 3 seasonal variability of ch4 and n2o and their determinants in this study remarkably higher concentrations of ch4 and n2o were observed in spring compared with the other three seasons figs 4 and 6 similar seasonal patterns were reported in the urbanized rivers including guadalete river burgos et al 2015 tuojia river zhang et al 2016 and rivers in chongqing metropolitan area wang et al 2018 however our seasonal patterns of ch4 and n2o were different from those records in many lowland rivers galantini et al 2021 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 hu et al 2017 as a result of different sensitivity to hydrology and watershed environment encalada et al 2019 mountain and lowland rivers might present different seasonal fluctuations in ch4 and n2o emissions temperature has been thought to be a primary factor influencing seasonal variability of riverine ch4 and n2o emissions since it can strongly regulate in stream microbial proliferation and metabolism beaulieu et al 2010 chun et al 2020 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 however temperature showed no relationship with ch4 and n2o concentrations in our study particularly ch4 and n2o concentrations observed in frigid winter were unnaturally comparable to and even higher than those in hot summer especially in urban reaches fig 4 and fig 6 similar patterns were also found in other mountainous rivers he et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and they attributed such contra seasonal variability to intensive rainfall and its consequent dilutive effect in summer the intensely dilutive effect on nutrients content in mountainous rivers has been widely reported duc et al 2010 and also presented in urban reaches of our study fig s8 meanwhile in mountainous area enhanced turbulence and re aeration during flooding event in rainy season limited the accumulation of dissolved gases in streams tang et al 2021 also supported low ch4 and n2o concentrations this explanation was evidenced by the higher flow velocity discharge and gas exchange coefficient in summer especially in urban sections fig s9 fig s10 on the other hand there was no pulse like increase in ch4 and n2o concentrations during the flooding season june indicating that longitudinal and lateral ch4 and n2o inputs from terrestrial soil and the tributary system might be less in our two small mountainous rivers borges et al 2019 impermeable substrate in urban area favored fast runoff confluence and low lateral inputs garnier et al 2013 nirmal rajkumar et al 2008 and thus leading more obvious dilutive effect on ch4 and n2o concentrations in urban reaches it also explained the more dramatic seasonal variation of ch4 and n2o emissions in urban reaches than that in exurban reaches fig 4 and fig 6 therefore despite higher temperatures in summer the dilutive effect due to rainfall and limited lateral inputs in our mountain basins caused the low ch4 and n2o concentrations the seasonal variations of ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes were predominantly controlled by the rainfall dilution effect while urban expansion would further enhance the temporal variation and complexity of ch4 and n2o emissions from suburban rivers 4 4 hydrochemical drivers of ch4 and n2o in two suburban rivers in this study the dissolved ch4 concentrations were significantly related to doc dtc tn tp no3 nh4 and dtp table 1 fig 7 similar results were found in the other urbanized river networks in chaohu lake basin xia et al 2022 zhang et al 2020b shanghai yu et al 2017 and chongqing tang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 organic carbon provides abundant carbon sources for in situ methanogenic bacteria propagation and production of ch4 jacinthe et al 2012 zhou et al 2018 meanwhile pierangeli et al 2021 suggested that heterotrophic decomposition of higher organic carbon in streams and related oxygen depletion could provide small molecule carbon compounds as electron acceptor for methane production and inhibit methane oxidizing bacteria activity respectively and then supporting higher ch4 concentration based on ch4 data of global rivers stanley et al 2016 also showed that methane concentration had significantly positive correlation with doc doc and toc were good indicators of riverine ch4 fluxes in the two suburban rivers at the same time nitrogen and phosphorus were also widely proved to be important factors affecting methane production benassi et al 2021 xing et al 2005 nitrogen and phosphorus load in urban reaches could remove the nutrients limiting of methanogens in water bodies and sediments ho et al 2022 liu and greaver 2009 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2022 besides ammonia oxidizing bacteria can compete with methane oxidizing bacteria for o2 in water column under abundant nh4 and thus inhibiting ch4 oxidation bodelier and steenbergh 2014 hu et al 2017 moreover increasing nitrogen and phosphorus load can also promote river eutrophication it suggested that algal accumulation would enhance benthic methanogenesis through decaying and providing small molecule organic matter schroll et al 2020 wang et al 2022a contributing to the high ch4 emissions in eutrophic reaches table s2 table 2 furthermore the positive correlation of nitrogen and phosphorus and ch4 concentration might be partly attributed to the fact that ch4 rich municipal sewage input in urban reaches can feed nutrients and dissolved ch4 simultaneously xia et al 2022 conductivity was included in all stepwise multiple regression models for ch4 concentrations also implying the synchronous change of ch4 concentration and ion content including nutrients ion as a result all nutrient parameters in our two suburban rivers crossing urban rural interface presented nearly identical contributions 26 41 to the variation of ch4 emissions it also implied that the relations of water quality parameters and ch4 and n2o dynamics in rivers might be controlled by not only the internal biogeochemical process but also the watershed urban expansion in rivers or streams n2o production mainly derives from denitrification autotrophic nitrification and anaerobic ammonification nitrification beaulieu et al 2011 liu and greaver 2009 quick et al 2019 anaerobic condition and abundant carbon and nutrients substrates intensely control n2o dynamic in natural waters beaulieu et al 2011 stow et al 2005 do con carbon and nutrients were significantly related to n2o concentration in this study being consistent with other studies he et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b it indicated pollution load increase and water quality degradation caused by urbanization can significantly promote the production of n2o in suburban rivers meanwhile the correlation between n2o concentration and inorganic n could indicate the importance of different n2o production ways for in situ n2o saturation obviously no3 and nh4 had the similar explanation for n2o concentration fig 8 suggesting n2o in this study might come from both denitrification and anaerobic ammonification nitrification in many rivers disturbed by cities denitrification was found to be the main pathway of n2o production li et al 2022 stow et al 2005 yang and lei 2018 while autotrophic nitrification and anaerobic ammonification nitrification have been widely found in polluted waters chun et al 2020 ho et al 2022 nirmal rajkumar et al 2008 when we only analyzed data of urban reaches no3 and nh4 still presented positive correlations with n2o concentration but no correlation of nh4 and n2o concentration were found when using exurban data fig s11 it indicated that n2o in exurban reaches may derived mainly from denitrification but these in urban reaches may originate from multitype process except denitrification low do and high nh4 in urban reaches would enhance n2o production via anaerobic ammonification nitrification progress hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 nguyen et al 2019 sanchez rodriguez et al 2022 in the future more molecular biological evidence for exploring the potential effect of urban expansion on in situ n2o produce way in suburban rivers should be investigated in this study we established two stepwise multiple regression models smrm for ch4 and n2o concentrations in suburban rivers respectively the two models ending up with similar sets of proxies suggested that both gases in our two suburban rivers were likely to be affected by similar mechanisms fig 9 this is also supported by the strong covariation between ch4 and n2o fig s12 and their close relation with urban land use fig 10 the results of the estimation of ch4 and n2o concentrations by these two models are basically consistent with the observed values fig s13 these results provide strong evidence that as a result of land use effect longitudinal differentiation of water physicochemical parameters can predict ch4 and n2o emissions well in river crossing rural urban interface furthermore the two models were tested using dataset from a series of surveys in the mountainous chongqing china gong et al 2018 he et al 2017 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2022b good linear correlations between the predicted and observed values were obtained fig s13 despite being limited by data representativeness considering that our two rivers are located in the subtropical mountains the models may be restricted to the mountainous urban rivers with high flow velocity and strong turbulence so their prediction ability for the lowland rivers with higher ch4 and n2o concentrations table s3 and s4 and rivers in tropical regions may be poor particularly the two smrms showed poor predictive power for ch4 concentrations when the observed values below 1700 nmol l 1 even so it emphasized that our stepwise multiple regression model can give us a possible path to extrapolate ch4 and n2o emissions at the whole regional network scale besides sem models indicated urbanization can not only indirectly dominate the concentrations of ch4 and n2o through water environment factors but also directly affect ch4 and n2o concentrations fig 11 table 3 nh4 tp dtc and conductivity played mediating effect between land use and ch4 and n2o emissions it could be attributed to the input of domestic sewage with high nutrients as well as high ch4 and n2o concentrations alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 li et al 2020 many previous studies highlighted that the effluent of wwtp was direct source of riverine ch4 and n2o alshboul et al 2016 masuda et al 2018 tang et al 2021 in our study sewage dominated tributaries had exceptionally high ch4 and n2o concentrations in hr watershed which further supported such viewpoints therefore our study confirmed the indirect dominance of ch4 and n2o by land use change as a result of urban expansion moreover the management of land use and control of nutrient and organic matter loading should be considered to mitigate aquatic ch4 and n2o emissions during urban expansion 5 conclusion this study investigated the spatial and temporal variations of ch4 and n2o concentrations and fluxes in two small mountainous suburban rivers located in chongqing china and identified the effect of watershed land use change and the consequent water environment alteration our findings suggested that the ch4 and n2o concentrations in the two suburban rivers exhibited disproportionately strong variability in comparison with their smaller watersheds the two suburban streams were persistent sources of atmospheric ch4 and n2o with overall mean fluxes of 960 2 966 6 µmol m 2 d 1 and 205 1 240 8 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and n2o showed a sharp increase when the rivers cross the rural urban interface such discontinuous spatial pattern of ch4 and n2o emissions in river continuum were shown to be closely related to watershed land use and could be modeled as functions of the urban land use proportion these prediction functions could explain more than half of the spatial variations of ch4 and n2o with limited mountainous samples we highlighted that watershed urban expansion played a crucial role in the spatial pattern of both ch4 and n2o emissions from rivers across urban rural interface smrm based on water environment parameters were established in our study and indicated that nh4 tp dtc and conductivity played key controls on ch4 and n2o emissions in the two mountainous suburban rivers moreover smrm was tested to have good predictive could provide a possible path to extrapolate ch4 and n2o emissions in mountainous urbanized rivers at the whole regional network scale the results of the structural equation model provided strong evidence for direct and indirect controls of urban expansion on longitudinal differentiation of ch4 and n2o in rivers crossing rural urban interface we argue that riverine ch4 and n2o emissions would be sensitive to the watershed urbanization and water pollution in the mountainous urban rural areas and suggest that land use management nutrient and organic matter control can be promising avenues to mitigate riverine ch4 and n2o emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

2169,most watersheds around the world have been changing their natural flow patterns because of the coupled effects of climate change and human activities understanding the quantitative impacts of projected climate and human factors on future runoff variations is essential for adaptability assessment of water resource management especially at the seasonal scale where their intra annual changes are detected in this study an extended budyko framework that combines traditional elasticity and decomposition methods is developed to analyze future seasonal runoff variations the upper reach of the hanjiang river basin uhrb in china is used as a case study the case results are quantified and compared with the monthly abcd model using historical hydrometeorological observations over 1961 2020 and near future climate projections over 2031 2060 from the multi model ensemble of the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip3b we find that 1 human activities including the operation of the han to wei inter basin water transfer ibwt and reforestation projects have a substantial negative impact on runoff reduction in this region accounting for a proportion of 70 in energy limited seasons and 65 in water limited seasons and 2 the role of climate change projected by isimip3b will intensify in energy limited seasons especially under the high emission scenario with the increasing trend of effective precipitation additionally the performance of our extended budyko framework is sufficiently robust to parameter disturbance experiments indicating its applicability as an alternative for exploring future seasonal runoff variations keywords future runoff variations seasonal scale budyko type model abcd model climate change human activities data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction substantial climate change and extensive human activities are two main factors currently altering the hydrological cycle patterns around the world xia et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 climate change such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can affect hydrological runoff through runoff generation mechanisms human activities such as land use cover changes reservoir operations and water withdrawals regulate the spatial temporal distribution of water resources by directly disturbing hydrological processes over the last few decades research interest in analyzing regional runoff trends and quantitatively attributing their variations to climatic and anthropogenic drivers has considerably increased the time scale of runoff diagnostics has subsequently been improved from a coarse multi annual or annual scale donohue et al 2010 viola et al 2017 to a more recent seasonal scale he et al 2022b ji et al 2021 li et al 2020b since intra annual changes in hydro climatic variables and human activities are more common and can be accurately captured however these earlier studies mostly focused on known historical observations and ignored uncertain future projections climate and human induced hydrological evolution under plausible future scenarios remain to be explored which has profound implications for managing water resource systems in response to hydroclimatic variability bian et al 2021 osborne and lambert 2018 there are several types of practicable methods to perform such future runoff analyses as analogous to those used for historical runoff sun et al 2014 the first type is termed the dynamic hydrological modeling method jovanovic et al 2018 senent aparicio et al 2017 for areas where anthropogenic interventions are not expected to change much in the future the methods can use well calibrated hydrological models to project future runoff by perturbing future climate conditions and to measure the impact of a particular contributor climate or human on future runoff by changing some parameters of the contributor while fixing others the common hydrological models used for this purpose include the soil water assessment tool swat tian et al 2022 the variable infiltration capacity vic model bao et al 2012 and so on they usually provide the most comprehensive and reliable means of generating hydroclimatic outcomes under future scenarios in practice nevertheless hydrological models require a large amount of input information and involve many parameters to be calibrated which limits their application in many cases especially in data scarce basins the second type is the elasticity based method originally proposed by schaake 1990 elasticity based methods use some critical elasticity coefficients i e the sensitivity of runoff to variations of meteorological factors e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration relative humidity to project future runoff given expected climatic conditions the elasticity coefficients can be estimated by a nonparametric method sharifi et al 2021 or a budyko equation tang et al 2020 the theory of elasticity methods is based on the assumption that the variables are independent of each other even at a short seasonal timescale the third type is the conceptual water balance model based on the budyko model or its variants due to the model s simplicity it has been widely used in lots of literature to separate the effects of climate change and direct human activities on historical runoff li et al 2020b melo et al 2022 sharma and mondal 2022 xin et al 2019 in this method future runoff variations resulting from natural climatic variability can be considered a temporal shift of the watershed from historical to future climate conditions along the budyko hypothesis curve and the contribution assessment can still follow the previous decomposition strategy which directly decomposes the quantitative contribution into climate and direct human induced components roderick and farquhar 2011 sun et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge few attempts have been devoted to performing the analysis of future seasonal runoff variations with the above mentioned methods li et al 2020a employed the budyko based climate elasticity method with precipitation and temperature outputs from 18 global climate models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 to estimate the multi year average runoff of the upper heihe river basin in china in the future period they found that the challenge of elasticity methods for runoff attribution is to explicitly derive the elasticity coefficients of runoff to human activities melo et al 2022 demonstrated the decomposition method of the budyko framework was good at predicting annual trends in hydrological series and estimating future climate change impacts based on climate model projections but they also pointed out that it could not break down climate change impacts into those of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and others these studies are usually limited to a long term horizon of future periods where water storage changes in the water balance are negligible at the seasonal scale the effects of water storage changes that violate the steady state assumption deserve more attention hale et al 2022 this paper strives to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to future runoff variations at the seasonal scale to this end an extended budyko framework that combines traditional elasticity and decomposition methods is developed and compared with the performance of a representative hydrological model i e abcd the proposed framework is tested on the upper reach of china s hanjiang river basin where human intervention has been significant over the last decade yet is restricted by national policies that do not allow dramatic transformation in the future the reminder of this paper is laid out as follows

quantitative results of the specific case and section 5 of a detailed discussion follows finally section 6 ends up with the main conclusions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as the largest tributary of the yangtze river the hanjiang river has enormous hydrological and aquatic resources and is often divided into three parts the upper middle and lower reaches this study focuses on the upper hanjiang river basin uhrb which begins in the southern qinling mountains and terminates at the ankang hydrological station see fig 1 the uhrb stretches between 106 05 and 109 22 e in longitude and 31 41 and 34 11 n in latitude with a drainage area of 38 640 km2 and a main stream length of 426 km its annual average temperature is 15 c and the annual average precipitation is 850 mm characterized by high seasonal variability 70 80 of precipitation is concentrated from june to october during which rare rainstorms in the early summer and persistent rains in the autumn often lead to flood hazards at the outlet of the uhrb the annual average discharge is 568 8 m3 s and the runoff volume is about 17 9 billion m3 he et al 2022a to manage these unevenly distributed water resources the uhrb has experienced severe human intervention in the construction of extensive water infrastructure including a series of reservoirs and numerous ponds specifically the han to wei inter basin water transfer ibwt project was planned for 2014 to transfer hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water annually near the upstream reservoirs huangjinxia and sanhekou to support the sustainable socio economic development in the northern guanzhong plain the shiquan reservoir built in the early 1970s is mainly used for hydropower generation the downstream ankang reservoir commissioned in 1990 with a total storage capacity of 3 3 billion m3 undertakes a more refined operational task of hydropower generation and flood control as it is the last reservoir out of the basin 2 2 data the research dataset used in this study includes both historical observations and future projections historical meteorological records covered the period 1961 2020 and were collected from 11 stations throughout

information following the procedure outlined in fao 56 allen et al 1998 a time series of monthly average precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for the entire uhrb was then generated by the

methodology 3 1 identification of hydroclimatic seasonality before exploring seasonal patterns of hydroclimatic variables using the extended budyko hypothesis it is necessary to identify the energy limited and water limited seasons within one hydrological year ji et al 2021 xin et al 2019 typically seasonality is determined from monthly data for example water limited seasons can be determined by aggregating several consecutive water limited months in water limited months water availability in the basin comprises precipitation soil water and groundwater depletion but in energy limited months the basin storage is replenished by infiltrated precipitation to differentiate between energy limited and water limited months the concept of the monthly aridity index a m proposed by chen et al 2013 which is calculated from the ratio of monthly available energy to monthly available water is introduced here on a monthly scale available energy is represented by potential evapotranspiration and available water is represented by precipitation minus water storage dynamics saha et al 2020 however according to this definition energy limited months and water limited months may vary from year to year due to the interannual variability of a m to identify the constant energy and water limited months for a given watershed the average monthly aridity index is used following the formulation of eq 1 1 a m e p m p m δ s m where e p m and p m are averaged potential evapotranspiration and precipitation of the basin for the mth month over the years respectively δ s m is the monthly average storage change which can be estimated as the residual of the water balance closure given the available data of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff energy limited and water limited months can be identified according to a threshold value of a m 1 a m 1 for energy limited months and a m 1 for water limited months 3 2 extended budyko type model at the seasonal scale the budyko hypothesis berghuijs et al 2020 budyko 1974 is originally a semi empirical equation describing the steady state of the basin water balance on an annual or multi annual horizon to incorporate seasonal effects on the water balance the term effective precipitation p δ s chen et al 2013 wang 2012 referred to as available water in section 3 1 was developed to extend the budyko type model accordingly the seasonal aridity index is defined as the ratio of seasonal potential evapotranspiration to seasonal effective precipitation and the seasonal evapotranspiration ratio is defined as the ratio of seasonal evapotranspiration to seasonal effective precipitation the relationship between the seasonal evapotranspiration ratio and the seasonal aridity index in energy limited and water limited seasons can be modeled by two extended turc pike type budyko equations respectively chen et al 2013 choudhury 1999 2a e e p e δ s e 1 e pe p e δ s e φ e v e 1 v e 2b e w p w δ s w 1 e pw p w δ s w φ w v w 1 v w where v e and v w are the turc pike coefficients for energy limited and water limited seasons respectively representing the influence of other physical factors e g vegetation type hydraulic property and topography on the partition of precipitation which dominates the shape of the extended budyko curve φ e and φ w are the lower bounds of the seasonal aridity indices noting that the seasonal aridity index for a particular watershed may be a positive value or even higher than 1 in the water limited season a shift along the horizontal axis introduced in eq 2 to characterize a possible nonzero lower bound is rather necessary 3 2 1 seasonal budyko curve fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the distribution of seasonal evapotranspiration ratio versus seasonal aridity index to help explain the concept of seasonal budyko it usually has an extended budyko curve that represents the prechange period without significant human activities all points on the curve are assumed to have the same catchment properties v but different climatic conditions e p p δ s if the climate e p p δ s of a watershed becomes wetter or drier solely due to climate change the evapotranspiration ratio e p δ s will shift to a new state but still follow the budyko curve such as from the observed point a e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 e 1 p 1 δ s 1 in the prechange period in fig 2 to the hypothetical point b e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 in the future period once the climatic condition along the extended budyko curve is determined the partitioning of seasonal effective precipitation into runoff and evapotranspiration can be quantified however due to the synergistic effect of human activities the watershed climate would shift to another steady state i e point c e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 in the future period which has the same climatic condition as b but has a deviation in evapotranspiration ratio such behavior is reasonable because human intervention will inevitably redistribute runoff and evapotranspiration by e g altering the underlying surface properties 3 2 2 assessment of contribution to runoff variations from point a to point c the contributors to the runoff change can be identified and their regression relationship can be quantified the runoff change resulting from climate variability δ q c can be considered the difference between the runoff at points a and b with the underlying assumption of unchanged catchment properties it has both horizontal and vertical changes i e from e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 to e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the horizontal direction and from e 1 p 1 δ s 1 to e 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the vertical direction human induced runoff change δ q h caused by change in catchment properties or others moves the watershed along the vertical direction from e 2 p 2 δ s 2 to e 2 p 2 δ s 2 as illustrated in fig 2 the human induced runoff change between points b and c can be calculated using the decomposition method roderick and farquhar 2011 3 δ q h p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 thereafter we calculate δ q c by subtracting δ q h from the total streamflow change between a and c points δ q 4 δ q c δ q δ q h where δ q is the projected runoff difference between the future and prechange periods climate induced runoff changes can be further subdivided into two distinct components mainly caused by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration zhao et al 2014 traditionally the classical elasticity method allows estimating the relative contribution of these climatic variables to runoff variation from an analytical integration perspective andaryani et al 2021 although the contribution of the effective precipitation term of the seasonal budyko hypothesis is difficult to derive from the partial derivative from elasticity methods relative to the original precipitation term the potential evapotranspiration variable at the seasonal scale still follows the original elasticity equation in eq 5 which is assumed to be independent of precipitation and water storage dynamics 5 δ q e p c q e p δ e p where δ q e p c is the runoff change between two periods affected by the potential evapotranspiration change δ e p after removing δ q e p c the residual of climate induced runoff change is approximated as effective precipitation induced runoff change δ q r c 6 δ q r c δ q c δ q e p c given the time series of historical runoff and historical and future meteorological data the contribution estimation method tailored to future seasonal runoff variations can be summarized by the following steps 1 based on monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration series a lumped hydrological model abcd is used to derive actual evapotranspiration and water storage dynamics throughout the study period details on the abcd model are provided in section 3 3 2 the historical seasonal aridity index and evapotranspiration ratio for energy and water limited seasons are then calculated and the parameter combinations φ and v for different extended budyko curves in eq 2 are calibrated by fitting the relationship between the aridity index and evapotranspiration ratio 3 projected runoff and evapotranspiration ratios in the future period are obtained by the calibrated abcd model in the postchange period while the future evapotranspiration ratio only exposed to climate change is calculated using the budyko curve as a reference it is assumed here that future human activities will not experience significant changes compared to historical postchange period particularly in our uhrb case which retains the current operating patterns of hydraulic projects such as ibwt and reservoirs 4 the contributions of the three major components i e human induced potential evapotranspiration induced and effective precipitation induced respectively to runoff change are finally estimated to cope with the uncertainty of future climate scenarios the model outputs of each gcm are used individually to predict future runoff the ensemble and averaged quantitative results of repeating steps 1 4 are reported in section 4 4 and section 5 3 3 hydrological model abcd the conceptual model abcd proposed by thomas 1981 was used here to simulate the monthly hydrological conditions of the watershed built around the basic principle of water balance the model takes precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as inputs decomposes the water storage dynamics into changes in soil moisture and groundwater reserves and extracts outlet runoff and actual evapotranspiration as outputs it has been successfully applied to many watersheds with diverse climatic characteristics and land surface properties bai et al 2015 guo et al 2022 more detailed descriptions of it are given by sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 and zheng et al 2022 the model consists of four simple but valid parameters a b c and d parameter a varies from 0 to 1 and is the probability of runoff occurring before the soil water content is fully saturated parameter b is the upper limit of the sum of soil moisture storage and evapotranspiration parameter c is the proportion of streamflow from groundwater discharge and parameter d is the linear recession coefficient of groundwater storage on groundwater discharge into the stream channel these four parameters as well as the initial soil water storage s 0 between 0 and b were calibrated by a genetic algorithm ga in an attempt to find the globally optimal combination of their values the initial groundwater storage was determined by the method proposed by alley 1984 which set the initial groundwater storage to zero and simulated 1 year of monthly data prior to the beginning period of interest the kling gupta efficiency kge is used as an evaluation metric and the objective function is to maximize the kge value during the calibration period gupta et al 2009 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed runoff α is the ratio of standard deviations of the simulated and observed runoff and β is the ratio of mean values of observation and simulation the value of kge varies from to 1 with kge 1 implying a perfect fit between the simulated and observed series moreover a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is also used to evaluate the performance of the abcd model in this study two different sets of abcd model parameters for both the prechange and postchange periods are calibrated against their hydrometeorological observations respectively along with predicting future hydrometeorological series the abcd model can also facilitate another dynamic hydrological modeling approach to quantify the climate and human impacts on runoff change as a benchmark validation sun et al 2014 tian et al 2022 in this experiment the projected future runoff q fut is generated using the calibrated abcd parameters of the postchange period with the climate conditions of the future period and the prechange period is the baseline where the runoff q f u t 1 in the future period only subject to climate change is generated using the calibrated abcd parameters of the prechange period with the climate conditions of the future period human and climate induced runoff changes δ q h and δ q c in the future period are estimated below 8 δ q h q fut q f u t 1 9 δ q c δ q δ q h we use eq 10 like han et al 2019 to define the contributions of climate change and human activities as ic and ih the positive or negative contributions of ic and ih are consistent with the positive or negative signals of δ q c and δ q h respectively 10 i c δ q c δ q c δ q h 100 i h δ q h δ q c δ q h 100 it is worth emphasizing that the dynamic hydrological modeling approach can only roughly assess the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff changes where the effects of climate change cannot be decomposed as section 3 2 2 states 4 results 4 1 hydrological analysis of the main hydrometeorological factors the annual variation of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for the historical observations 1961 2020 and future ensemble projections 2031 2060 of the uhrb are drawn in fig 3 their 5 year moving averages over the historical period are marked as gray curves in the gray areas on the left sides of each subplot historical precipitation has no significant downward trend although it is diagnosed to have a changing rate of 0 33 mm year by the nonparametric mann kendall test farlie and kendall 1971 as shown in the right side of fig 3 a this trend is consistent with the ensemble average of isimip3b for future precipitation projections for 2031 2060 the ensemble intervals of future annual precipitation projections are enclosed by the minimum and maximum values of the five gcms where orange indicates the low emission scenario ssp126 blue ssp370 and purple ssp585 the uncertainty interval of the high emission scenario ssp585 is relatively narrow compared to those of the ssp126 and ssp370 scenarios even so the variability of future annual precipitation in ssp585 is still considerable with projections ranging for example from 713 to 1491 mm in 2040 to 798 885 mm in 2041 as for the annual potential evapotranspiration the historical series from the fao penman monteith calculation show a decreasing trend with a rate of 0 50 mm year its mann kendall tendency is significant at a significance level of p 0 05 the reliability of the isimip3b data is implicitly demonstrated by the trend curve which projects that future potential evapotranspiration will decrease to a certain extent compared to the past the average magnitude of the decline is about 60 mm mainly because air temperature which has a substantial impact on potential evapotranspiration is predicted to be an average of 1 2 c lower than the historical value in this region by most isimip gcms the ensemble intervals of potential evapotranspiration are smaller than those of precipitation for all three scenarios and the interannual fluctuations are not as dramatic the mann kendall operation was repeated for historical annual outflow series but was not visualized for brevity the slope of the 5 year moving average of the outflow observations is 2 64 mm year which is also significant at the p 0 05 level regarding the second function of mann kendall it allows for breakpoint analysis to identify the breakpoints of runoff it detected the breakpoint in the basin around 1990 another common pettitt test pettitt 1979 was also used to complement the breakpoint diagnosis whereby the breakpoint in 1990 was significant at p 0 05 this finding is consistent with the breakpoints suggested by sun et al 2014 and li et al 2020b for the same study region as a large number of human interventions were documented in the late 1980s including the converting cropland to forest or grassland project increases in socio economic water consumption and reservoir construction once the breakpoint was identified the entire historical period was split into two sub periods namely the prechange period from 1961 to 1989 and the postchange period from 1990 to 2020 4 2 performance of abcd simulation following the rule of 80 for calibration and 20 for validation commonly used in hydrological model simulations the historical period was divided into the calibration and validation periods that is from 1961 to 1983 calibration and 1984 to 1989 validation for the prechange period and from 1990 to 2014 calibration and 2015 to 2020 validation for the postchange period the monthly hydrological simulation process is presented in fig 4 the model s progress is reasonable as intuitively shown in fig 4 a and 4 c where the simulated and observed hydrographs follow similar patterns of runoff undulation the model is more adept at low flow simulations because the bottom left scatters low regime in fig 4 b and 4 d are closer to the 1 1 line than the top right high regime the model s performance can be further improved but it is not carried out in the following since it is not a concern for this paper the statistical results for all the considered hydrological indicators as well as the optimized parameters are given in table 2 for the prechange period the calibrated and validated kge values are up to 0 93 and 0 91 respectively corresponding to the combination values of r α β being 0 93 0 99 1 00 and 0 96 1 06 1 05 the calibrated and validated nse values are 0 85 and 0 91 respectively for the postchange period the calibrated kge and nse are 0 91 and 0 81 respectively and the validated kge and nse are 0 86 and 0 72 respectively indicating no over fitting of the hydrological model according to the watershed model evaluation guidelines suggested by moriasi et al 2007 the model is deemed satisfactory for simulating monthly discharge with nse greater than 0 65 and r 0 8 for the calibration and validation periods therefore the model is sufficiently reliable for estimating hydrological variations for budyko based analysis two sets of future projected runoff were subsequently obtained by using two different calibrated abcd models where the initial soil water storage for the future period that is insensitive to the overall simulation performance was assumed to be the average of the historical series at the beginning of each month of the year fig 5 depicts the probability distribution of future monthly runoff in the form of a violin plot for each month the shape of the violin is characterized by the kernel density estimation method with the left side natural condition playing a baseline role in fig 5 we find that the runoff uncertainty is significantly greater during the flood season than during the non flood season moreover the right side flood magnitude is subtly lower than the left side in june july and august while the opposite is true for december january and february this may result from the refined operations of cascade reservoirs which intercept instream runoff for flood control during the flood season but deplete reservoir storage for agricultural irrigation during the non flood season human activities do have some impact on this region 4 3 estimation results for budyko type parameters to determine the energy limited and water limited months defined in section 3 1 table 3 lists the statistic results of a m for different months in the uhrb region the a m values from july to november are less than 1 reflecting that there is more effective precipitation and relatively less evapotranspiration during this period it coincides with the double flood period i e summer and autumn floods in the region during which water resources exported from the basin are mainly in the form of effective precipitation converted into floods we designate july to november as the energy limited season and the other months within one hydrological year as the water limited season fig 6 a and 6 b display the relationship between the seasonal evapotranspiration ratio and the aridity index for different periods of the energy and water limited seasons respectively within each subplot the prechange series is marked with red dots and the postchange series with green dots for both seasons the red dots generally lie below the green ones showing an increase in the evapotranspiration ratio e p δ s and a decrease in runoff due to direct human interference these red scatters were further used to estimate the parameters φ and v in the seasonal budyko type equation eq 2 by the levenberg marquardt method table 4 summarizes the calibrated results of φ and v as well as the corresponding r 2 and rmse metric values we find that φ w is larger than φ e due to the drier water limited season compared to the energy limited season the rmse varies from 0 79 to 1 22 and all r 2 are higher than 0 94 the results demonstrate that the performance of the fitting curves is reasonable 4 4 impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff variations our proposed extended budyko type model was eventually applied to explore the effects of climate change and human activities on future seasonal runoff variations with the results of the abcd model serving as a comparison fig 7 presents the percentage results of all involved future scenarios where each subplot has results for five gcms to account for the uncertainty of future meteorological factors the results of the budyko type and abcd models are almost identical and they share analogous climate and human percentage partitions in most cases human activities are significant in the future scenarios even higher than 90 in the mpi ssp126 scenario during the energy limited season anthropogenic water transfer projects will inevitably reduce total outlet runoff while the critical precipitation and temperature factors of climate change will offset this reduction effect the average contribution of both is 68 14 and 31 86 in energy limited seasons and 65 16 and 34 84 in water limited seasons respectively meanwhile different gcms have different expectations for the quantitative assessment of runoff variations the minimum variance in gcm projections occurs in fig 7 c where the human induced percentage varies between 59 13 and 74 81 and the maximum variance occurs in fig 7 f varying between 44 87 and 76 85 in conclusion the main driver of future runoff variations in the region is human activities with consideration of various future uncertainties notably our budyko based method allows for further delineation of climate change impacts compared with the dynamic hydrological modeling approach as fig 7 shows that the stacked navy and blue bars indicating the effects of effective precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively in the budyko estimate are contrasted with the teal bar indicating the total impact of climate change in the abcd estimate due to the diverse outputs of the various gcms the magnitude of each climatic component is necessarily different across the 15 projections in most projection cases effective precipitation dominates over potential evapotranspiration because it is the exclusive source of runoff generation in this closed region potential evapotranspiration also plays a non negligible role particularly during energy limited seasons this is mainly attributed to reservoirs and ponds that directly store water during the flood periods the stored water potentially signifies a higher probability for evapotranspiration due to the larger water surface area in conjunction with the high temperature fig 8 explicitly shows the results of the deterministic assessment for each future scenario as well as for the historical postchange period in spite of the dramatic distribution of meteorological factors in the three future scenarios as shown in fig 3 the deterministic assessment of anthropogenic impacts varies modestly it also differs little from the postchange period which is depicted in fig 8 b as having a near square shape the high emission ssp585 scenario will reinforce the role of climate change during the energy limited season due to more extreme rainfall events for the low emission ssp126 scenario both impacts throughout the seasons are nearly identical to those in the postchange period suggesting that the strategic water management policies developed in the postchange period have a high degree of adaptability the medium emission ssp370 scenario balances the impacts of the two scenarios mentioned above 5 discussion the runoff evolution pattern of the uhrb is closely related to the reliability of the operation of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project and of downstream water resource allocation in recent years a large body of relevant literature has investigated the runoff regime in the basin sun et al 2014 explored the spatial variability of contributions of climate variation and human activities to historical annual runoff reduction in the uhrb by applying three alternative methods to four sub basins and found that climate variability was a greater contributor with its relative contribution decreasing from 83 in the upstream to 46 in the downstream li et al 2020b confirmed this finding at a seasonal scale and subsequently informed the local government of water resource planning and management recommendations based on this perspective however these studies focused on hydrological data collected before 2014 during which human activities were not so intensive since the ibwt project and the reforestation project became operational in 2014 we find that human activities have exerted a more dominant role in the recent past while it cannot be arbitrarily assumed that the ibwt project is the major player in human activities to reduce runoff annual water diversion of 500 million m3 via the ibwt 6 of the total uhrb outflow is bound to have a strong and direct impact whether the ibwt is dominant or others dominant in anthropogenic influences requires further investigation to be sure this heavily disturbed area is difficult to restore to its natural state and the water management policies developed during the postchange period benefiting from the flexible operating rules of adjustable reservoirs will be adaptive in the near future 2031 2060 this study takes full account of future climate uncertainty yet ignores the propagation of uncertainty in the model structures and parameters taking the perturbation of the budyko curve parameters as the first set of experiments we include all combinations of the budyko curve parameters in the uncertainty experiment as long as their fitted r 2 metrics are greater than 0 90 the distributions of the estimated errors regarding the contribution of human activities for each future scenario are then drawn as box plots in fig 9 a and 9 b the absolute values of most errors in all 1000 sets of experiments are below 3 5 a second set of similar experiments considering the uncertainty of the abcd model parameters was repeated in which the evaluation metrics of the experimental abcd were acceptable the errors ranges plotted in fig 9 c and 9 d remain between 3 5 3 5 further demonstrating that our abcd model simulations are sufficiently reliable in fact abcd is favored in many hydrological simulation studies because of its multiple advantages it takes only four parameters to capture actual watershed storage changes and evapotranspiration which matches the inputs required for the seasonal budyko hypothesis the model s performance has been validated thousands of times in regional watersheds around the world including on the chinese mainland he et al 2022b employed the monthly abcd model to conduct a systematic attribution assessment of annual and seasonal runoff change from 1960 to 2000 in 191 catchments across china certainly more state of the art development of it or other hydrological models can strengthen the arguments for the contribution of climate and human relevant factors to runoff variations in terms of the quantitative assessment of the contribution of each factor to runoff variations at the seasonal scale we developed an extended budyko framework that blended elasticity and decomposition methods because of the interdependence of precipitation and storage changes the runoff variations arising from the complex effective precipitation term are difficult to derive directly which implicitly incorporates the impact of future vegetation but can be approximated as the residual of the total runoff change after subtracting direct human induced and potential evapotranspiration induced runoff change here direct human impact merely considers differences in the partitioning behavior of effective precipitation under given climate conditions but excludes indirect human impacts that affect runoff by disturbing climate variability in future studies the development of other desirable analytical methods will be crucial to refining the budyko framework 6 conclusions climate change and human activities are two primary drivers of change in regional runoff regimes assessing their contribution to future runoff variations can help improve the understanding of long term water resource management especially at the seasonal scale where both have intra annual variability we develop an extended budyko framework in this study that combines traditional elasticity and decomposition methods to attribute future seasonal runoff variations of the uhrb in china the case results are quantified using historical observations over 1961 2020 and near future projections over 2031 2060 from the isimip3b project the major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 a flat trend in precipitation and a negative trend in potential evapotranspiration are expected during the study period accompanied by substantial uncertainty projected by isimip3b for the future period additionally the runoff from the basin outlet shows a decreasing trend and the consistency of the runoff is diagnosed as disrupted after 1990 2 our proposed extended budyko type framework can make full use of the information from the monthly hydrological model abcd to reveal climate and human induced impacts on seasonal runoff variations it shows that human activities have played an essential role in the reduction of uhrb runoff in both seasons since 2014 which is likely caused by the operation of the ibwt project and reforestation projects 3 under the high emission ssp585 future scenario the role of climatic change dominated by effective precipitation is projected by isimip3b to be reinforced during the energy limited season but even so all isimip3b future scenarios agree that human activities will maintain their vigorous role in both energy and water limited seasons as they do in the postchange period this suggests that the water management policies developed in the postchange period are adaptive credit authorship contribution statement shaokun he

2169,most watersheds around the world have been changing their natural flow patterns because of the coupled effects of climate change and human activities understanding the quantitative impacts of projected climate and human factors on future runoff variations is essential for adaptability assessment of water resource management especially at the seasonal scale where their intra annual changes are detected in this study an extended budyko framework that combines traditional elasticity and decomposition methods is developed to analyze future seasonal runoff variations the upper reach of the hanjiang river basin uhrb in china is used as a case study the case results are quantified and compared with the monthly abcd model using historical hydrometeorological observations over 1961 2020 and near future climate projections over 2031 2060 from the multi model ensemble of the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip3b we find that 1 human activities including the operation of the han to wei inter basin water transfer ibwt and reforestation projects have a substantial negative impact on runoff reduction in this region accounting for a proportion of 70 in energy limited seasons and 65 in water limited seasons and 2 the role of climate change projected by isimip3b will intensify in energy limited seasons especially under the high emission scenario with the increasing trend of effective precipitation additionally the performance of our extended budyko framework is sufficiently robust to parameter disturbance experiments indicating its applicability as an alternative for exploring future seasonal runoff variations keywords future runoff variations seasonal scale budyko type model abcd model climate change human activities data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction substantial climate change and extensive human activities are two main factors currently altering the hydrological cycle patterns around the world xia et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 climate change such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can affect hydrological runoff through runoff generation mechanisms human activities such as land use cover changes reservoir operations and water withdrawals regulate the spatial temporal distribution of water resources by directly disturbing hydrological processes over the last few decades research interest in analyzing regional runoff trends and quantitatively attributing their variations to climatic and anthropogenic drivers has considerably increased the time scale of runoff diagnostics has subsequently been improved from a coarse multi annual or annual scale donohue et al 2010 viola et al 2017 to a more recent seasonal scale he et al 2022b ji et al 2021 li et al 2020b since intra annual changes in hydro climatic variables and human activities are more common and can be accurately captured however these earlier studies mostly focused on known historical observations and ignored uncertain future projections climate and human induced hydrological evolution under plausible future scenarios remain to be explored which has profound implications for managing water resource systems in response to hydroclimatic variability bian et al 2021 osborne and lambert 2018 there are several types of practicable methods to perform such future runoff analyses as analogous to those used for historical runoff sun et al 2014 the first type is termed the dynamic hydrological modeling method jovanovic et al 2018 senent aparicio et al 2017 for areas where anthropogenic interventions are not expected to change much in the future the methods can use well calibrated hydrological models to project future runoff by perturbing future climate conditions and to measure the impact of a particular contributor climate or human on future runoff by changing some parameters of the contributor while fixing others the common hydrological models used for this purpose include the soil water assessment tool swat tian et al 2022 the variable infiltration capacity vic model bao et al 2012 and so on they usually provide the most comprehensive and reliable means of generating hydroclimatic outcomes under future scenarios in practice nevertheless hydrological models require a large amount of input information and involve many parameters to be calibrated which limits their application in many cases especially in data scarce basins the second type is the elasticity based method originally proposed by schaake 1990 elasticity based methods use some critical elasticity coefficients i e the sensitivity of runoff to variations of meteorological factors e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration relative humidity to project future runoff given expected climatic conditions the elasticity coefficients can be estimated by a nonparametric method sharifi et al 2021 or a budyko equation tang et al 2020 the theory of elasticity methods is based on the assumption that the variables are independent of each other even at a short seasonal timescale the third type is the conceptual water balance model based on the budyko model or its variants due to the model s simplicity it has been widely used in lots of literature to separate the effects of climate change and direct human activities on historical runoff li et al 2020b melo et al 2022 sharma and mondal 2022 xin et al 2019 in this method future runoff variations resulting from natural climatic variability can be considered a temporal shift of the watershed from historical to future climate conditions along the budyko hypothesis curve and the contribution assessment can still follow the previous decomposition strategy which directly decomposes the quantitative contribution into climate and direct human induced components roderick and farquhar 2011 sun et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge few attempts have been devoted to performing the analysis of future seasonal runoff variations with the above mentioned methods li et al 2020a employed the budyko based climate elasticity method with precipitation and temperature outputs from 18 global climate models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 to estimate the multi year average runoff of the upper heihe river basin in china in the future period they found that the challenge of elasticity methods for runoff attribution is to explicitly derive the elasticity coefficients of runoff to human activities melo et al 2022 demonstrated the decomposition method of the budyko framework was good at predicting annual trends in hydrological series and estimating future climate change impacts based on climate model projections but they also pointed out that it could not break down climate change impacts into those of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and others these studies are usually limited to a long term horizon of future periods where water storage changes in the water balance are negligible at the seasonal scale the effects of water storage changes that violate the steady state assumption deserve more attention hale et al 2022 this paper strives to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to future runoff variations at the seasonal scale to this end an extended budyko framework that combines traditional elasticity and decomposition methods is developed and compared with the performance of a representative hydrological model i e abcd the proposed framework is tested on the upper reach of china s hanjiang river basin where human intervention has been significant over the last decade yet is restricted by national policies that do not allow dramatic transformation in the future the reminder of this paper is laid out as follows section 2 briefly introduces the hydrological regime and available dataset of the study area section 3 presents the proposed methodology consisting of different components section 4 gives the quantitative results of the specific case and section 5 of a detailed discussion follows finally section 6 ends up with the main conclusions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as the largest tributary of the yangtze river the hanjiang river has enormous hydrological and aquatic resources and is often divided into three parts the upper middle and lower reaches this study focuses on the upper hanjiang river basin uhrb which begins in the southern qinling mountains and terminates at the ankang hydrological station see fig 1 the uhrb stretches between 106 05 and 109 22 e in longitude and 31 41 and 34 11 n in latitude with a drainage area of 38 640 km2 and a main stream length of 426 km its annual average temperature is 15 c and the annual average precipitation is 850 mm characterized by high seasonal variability 70 80 of precipitation is concentrated from june to october during which rare rainstorms in the early summer and persistent rains in the autumn often lead to flood hazards at the outlet of the uhrb the annual average discharge is 568 8 m3 s and the runoff volume is about 17 9 billion m3 he et al 2022a to manage these unevenly distributed water resources the uhrb has experienced severe human intervention in the construction of extensive water infrastructure including a series of reservoirs and numerous ponds specifically the han to wei inter basin water transfer ibwt project was planned for 2014 to transfer hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water annually near the upstream reservoirs huangjinxia and sanhekou to support the sustainable socio economic development in the northern guanzhong plain the shiquan reservoir built in the early 1970s is mainly used for hydropower generation the downstream ankang reservoir commissioned in 1990 with a total storage capacity of 3 3 billion m3 undertakes a more refined operational task of hydropower generation and flood control as it is the last reservoir out of the basin 2 2 data the research dataset used in this study includes both historical observations and future projections historical meteorological records covered the period 1961 2020 and were collected from 11 stations throughout the uhrb as shown in fig 1 the records include daily precipitation wind speed relative humidity sunshine duration and average minimum and maximum air temperatures which are archived at the china meteorological data sharing service center http data cma cn the historical potential evapotranspiration data was calculated using the penman monteith equation with the inputs of above meteorological information following the procedure outlined in fao 56 allen et al 1998 a time series of monthly average precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for the entire uhrb was then generated by the thiessen polygon method to explore the hydrometeorological response of this region hydrologically observed runoff at the outlet for the same historical period was obtained from the bureau of hydrology of the yangtze water resources commission of china https www cjh com cn as for future projections the bias corrected cmip6 climate forcing data e g precipitation air temperature from the inter

evaluation of isimip3b in historical climate simulations for this study area is provided in appendix a the isimip3b data have different combinations of shared socio economic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps scenarios including low emission scenario ssp126 ssp1 rcp2 6 mid emission scenario ssp370 ssp3 rcp7 0 and high emission scenario ssp585 ssp5 rcp8 5 each ssp scenario contains five gcms including mpi esm1 2 hr mpi ukesm1 0 ll uke gfdl esm4 gfd ipsl cm6a lr ips and mri esm2 0 mri although the predictions of individual gcms have significant deviations the use of an ensemble of multiple gcms can reduce this uncertainty coelho et al 2022 giuliani and castelletti 2016 gcms based isimip3b has shown good simulation performance in some regions yun et al 2021 table 1 lists general information on these representative gcms which were originally published in the cmip6 note that future potential evapotranspiration projections are obtained by a modified hargraves method liu et al 2022 because it has less uncertainty in estimation with fewer future climate variables compared to penman monteith and more information can be found in appendix b 3 methodology 3 1 identification of hydroclimatic seasonality before exploring seasonal patterns of hydroclimatic variables using the extended budyko hypothesis it is necessary to identify the energy limited and water limited seasons within one hydrological year ji et al 2021 xin et al 2019 typically seasonality is determined from monthly data for example water limited seasons can be determined by aggregating several consecutive water limited months in water limited months water availability in the basin comprises precipitation soil water and groundwater depletion but in energy limited months the basin storage is replenished by infiltrated precipitation to differentiate between energy limited and water limited months the concept of the monthly aridity index a m proposed by chen et al 2013 which is calculated from the ratio of monthly available energy to monthly available water is introduced here on a monthly scale available energy is represented by potential evapotranspiration and available water is represented by precipitation minus water storage dynamics saha et al 2020 however according to this definition energy limited months and water limited months may vary from year to year due to the interannual variability of a m to identify the constant energy and water limited months for a given watershed the average monthly aridity index is used following the formulation of eq 1 1 a m e p m p m δ s m where e p m and p m are averaged potential evapotranspiration and precipitation of the basin for the mth month over the years respectively δ s m is the monthly average storage change which can be estimated as the residual of the water balance closure given the available data of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff energy limited and water limited months can be identified according to a threshold value of a m 1 a m 1 for energy limited months and a m 1 for water limited months 3 2 extended budyko type model at the seasonal scale the budyko hypothesis berghuijs et al 2020 budyko 1974 is originally a semi empirical equation describing the steady state of the basin water balance on an annual or multi annual horizon to incorporate seasonal effects on the water balance the term effective precipitation p δ s chen et al 2013 wang 2012 referred to as available water in section 3 1 was developed to extend the budyko type model accordingly the seasonal aridity index is defined as the ratio of seasonal potential evapotranspiration to seasonal effective precipitation and the seasonal evapotranspiration ratio is defined as the ratio of seasonal evapotranspiration to seasonal effective precipitation the relationship between the seasonal evapotranspiration ratio and the seasonal aridity index in energy limited and water limited seasons can be modeled by two extended turc pike type budyko equations respectively chen et al 2013 choudhury 1999 2a e e p e δ s e 1 e pe p e δ s e φ e v e 1 v e 2b e w p w δ s w 1 e pw p w δ s w φ w v w 1 v w where v e and v w are the turc pike coefficients for energy limited and water limited seasons respectively representing the influence of other physical factors e g vegetation type hydraulic property and topography on the partition of precipitation which dominates the shape of the extended budyko curve φ e and φ w are the lower bounds of the seasonal aridity indices noting that the seasonal aridity index for a particular watershed may be a positive value or even higher than 1 in the water limited season a shift along the horizontal axis introduced in eq 2 to characterize a possible nonzero lower bound is rather necessary 3 2 1 seasonal budyko curve fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the distribution of seasonal evapotranspiration ratio versus seasonal aridity index to help explain the concept of seasonal budyko it usually has an extended budyko curve that represents the prechange period without significant human activities all points on the curve are assumed to have the same catchment properties v but different climatic conditions e p p δ s if the climate e p p δ s of a watershed becomes wetter or drier solely due to climate change the evapotranspiration ratio e p δ s will shift to a new state but still follow the budyko curve such as from the observed point a e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 e 1 p 1 δ s 1 in the prechange period in fig 2 to the hypothetical point b e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 in the future period once the climatic condition along the extended budyko curve is determined the partitioning of seasonal effective precipitation into runoff and evapotranspiration can be quantified however due to the synergistic effect of human activities the watershed climate would shift to another steady state i e point c e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 in the future period which has the same climatic condition as b but has a deviation in evapotranspiration ratio such behavior is reasonable because human intervention will inevitably redistribute runoff and evapotranspiration by e g altering the underlying surface properties 3 2 2 assessment of contribution to runoff variations from point a to point c the contributors to the runoff change can be identified and their regression relationship can be quantified the runoff change resulting from climate variability δ q c can be considered the difference between the runoff at points a and b with the underlying assumption of unchanged catchment properties it has both horizontal and vertical changes i e from e p 1 p 1 δ s 1 to e p 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the horizontal direction and from e 1 p 1 δ s 1 to e 2 p 2 δ s 2 along the vertical direction human induced runoff change δ q h caused by change in catchment properties or others moves the watershed along the vertical direction from e 2 p 2 δ s 2 to e 2 p 2 δ s 2 as illustrated in fig 2 the human induced runoff change between points b and c can be calculated using the decomposition method roderick and farquhar 2011 3 δ q h p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 e 2 p 2 δ s 2 thereafter we calculate δ q c by subtracting δ q h from the total streamflow change between a and c points δ q 4 δ q c δ q δ q h where δ q is the projected runoff difference between the future and prechange periods climate induced runoff changes can be further subdivided into two distinct components mainly caused by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration zhao et al 2014 traditionally the classical elasticity method allows estimating the relative contribution of these climatic variables to runoff variation from an analytical integration perspective andaryani et al 2021 although the contribution of the effective precipitation term of the seasonal budyko hypothesis is difficult to derive from the partial derivative from elasticity methods relative to the original precipitation term the potential evapotranspiration variable at the seasonal scale still follows the original elasticity equation in eq 5 which is assumed to be independent of precipitation and water storage dynamics 5 δ q e p c q e p δ e p where δ q e p c is the runoff change between two periods affected by the potential evapotranspiration change δ e p after removing δ q e p c the residual of climate induced runoff change is approximated as effective precipitation induced runoff change δ q r c 6 δ q r c δ q c δ q e p c given the time series of historical runoff and historical and future meteorological data the contribution estimation method tailored to future seasonal runoff variations can be summarized by the following steps 1 based on monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration series a lumped hydrological model abcd is used to derive actual evapotranspiration and water storage dynamics throughout the study period details on the abcd model are provided in section 3 3 2 the historical seasonal aridity index and evapotranspiration ratio for energy and water limited seasons are then calculated and the parameter combinations φ and v for different extended budyko curves in eq 2 are calibrated by fitting the relationship between the aridity index and evapotranspiration ratio 3 projected runoff and evapotranspiration ratios in the future period are obtained by the calibrated abcd model in the postchange period while the future evapotranspiration ratio only exposed to climate change is calculated using the budyko curve as a reference it is assumed here that future human activities will not experience significant changes compared to historical postchange period particularly in our uhrb case which retains the current operating patterns of hydraulic projects such as ibwt and reservoirs 4 the contributions of the three major components i e human induced potential evapotranspiration induced and effective precipitation induced respectively to runoff change are finally estimated to cope with the uncertainty of future climate scenarios the model outputs of each gcm are used individually to predict future runoff the ensemble and averaged quantitative results of repeating steps 1 4 are reported in section 4 4 and section 5 3 3 hydrological model abcd the conceptual model abcd proposed by thomas 1981 was used here to simulate the monthly hydrological conditions of the watershed built around the basic principle of water balance the model takes precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as inputs decomposes the water storage dynamics into changes in soil moisture and groundwater reserves and extracts outlet runoff and actual evapotranspiration as outputs it has been successfully applied to many watersheds with diverse climatic characteristics and land surface properties bai et al 2015 guo et al 2022 more detailed descriptions of it are given by sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 and zheng et al 2022 the model consists of four simple but valid parameters a b c and d parameter a varies from 0 to 1 and is the probability of runoff occurring before the soil water content is fully saturated parameter b is the upper limit of the sum of soil moisture storage and evapotranspiration parameter c is the proportion of streamflow from groundwater discharge and parameter d is the linear recession coefficient of groundwater storage on groundwater discharge into the stream channel these four parameters as well as the initial soil water storage s 0 between 0 and b were calibrated by a genetic algorithm ga in an attempt to find the globally optimal combination of their values the initial groundwater storage was determined by the method proposed by alley 1984 which set the initial groundwater storage to zero and simulated 1 year of monthly data prior to the beginning period of interest the kling gupta efficiency kge is used as an evaluation metric and the objective function is to maximize the kge value during the calibration period gupta et al 2009 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed runoff α is the ratio of standard deviations of the simulated and observed runoff and β is the ratio of mean values of observation and simulation the value of kge varies from to 1 with kge 1 implying a perfect fit between the simulated and observed series moreover a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is also used to evaluate the performance of the abcd model in this study two different sets of abcd model parameters for both the prechange and postchange periods are calibrated against their hydrometeorological observations respectively along with predicting future hydrometeorological series the abcd model can also facilitate another dynamic hydrological modeling approach to quantify the climate and human impacts on runoff change as a benchmark validation sun et al 2014 tian et al 2022 in this experiment the projected future runoff q fut is generated using the calibrated abcd parameters of the postchange period with the climate conditions of the future period and the prechange period is the baseline where the runoff q f u t 1 in the future period only subject to climate change is generated using the calibrated abcd parameters of the prechange period with the climate conditions of the future period human and climate induced runoff changes δ q h and δ q c in the future period are estimated below 8 δ q h q fut q f u t 1 9 δ q c δ q δ q h we use eq 10 like han et al 2019 to define the contributions of climate change and human activities as ic and ih the positive or negative contributions of ic and ih are consistent with the positive or negative signals of δ q c and δ q h respectively 10 i c δ q c δ q c δ q h 100 i h δ q h δ q c δ q h 100 it is worth emphasizing that the dynamic hydrological modeling approach can only roughly assess the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff changes where the effects of climate change cannot be decomposed as section 3 2 2 states 4 results 4 1 hydrological analysis of the main hydrometeorological factors the annual variation of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for the historical observations 1961 2020 and future ensemble projections 2031 2060 of the uhrb are drawn in fig 3 their 5 year moving averages over the historical period are marked as gray curves in the gray areas on the left sides of each subplot historical precipitation has no significant downward trend although it is diagnosed to have a changing rate of 0 33 mm year by the nonparametric mann kendall test farlie and kendall 1971 as shown in the right side of fig 3 a this trend is consistent with the ensemble average of isimip3b for future precipitation projections for 2031 2060 the ensemble intervals of future annual precipitation projections are enclosed by the minimum and maximum values of the five gcms where orange indicates the low emission scenario ssp126 blue ssp370 and purple ssp585 the uncertainty interval of the high emission scenario ssp585 is relatively narrow compared to those of the ssp126 and ssp370 scenarios even so the variability of future annual precipitation in ssp585 is still considerable with projections ranging for example from 713 to 1491 mm in 2040 to 798 885 mm in 2041 as for the annual potential evapotranspiration the historical series from the fao penman monteith calculation show a decreasing trend with a rate of 0 50 mm year its mann kendall tendency is significant at a significance level of p 0 05 the reliability of the isimip3b data is implicitly demonstrated by the trend curve which projects that future potential evapotranspiration will decrease to a certain extent compared to the past the average magnitude of the decline is about 60 mm mainly because air temperature which has a substantial impact on potential evapotranspiration is predicted to be an average of 1 2 c lower than the historical value in this region by most isimip gcms the ensemble intervals of potential evapotranspiration are smaller than those of precipitation for all three scenarios and the interannual fluctuations are not as dramatic the mann kendall operation was repeated for historical annual outflow series but was not visualized for brevity the slope of the 5 year moving average of the outflow observations is 2 64 mm year which is also significant at the p 0 05 level regarding the second function of mann kendall it allows for breakpoint analysis to identify the breakpoints of runoff it detected the breakpoint in the basin around 1990 another common pettitt test pettitt 1979 was also used to complement the breakpoint diagnosis whereby the breakpoint in 1990 was significant at p 0 05 this finding is consistent with the breakpoints suggested by sun et al 2014 and li et al 2020b for the same study region as a large number of human interventions were documented in the late 1980s including the converting cropland to forest or grassland project increases in socio economic water consumption and reservoir construction once the breakpoint was identified the entire historical period was split into two sub periods namely the prechange period from 1961 to 1989 and the postchange period from 1990 to 2020 4 2 performance of abcd simulation following the rule of 80 for calibration and 20 for validation commonly used in hydrological model simulations the historical period was divided into the calibration and validation periods that is from 1961 to 1983 calibration and 1984 to 1989 validation for the prechange period and from 1990 to 2014 calibration and 2015 to 2020 validation for the postchange period the monthly hydrological simulation process is presented in fig 4 the model s progress is reasonable as intuitively shown in fig 4 a and 4 c where the simulated and observed hydrographs follow similar patterns of runoff undulation the model is more adept at low flow simulations because the bottom left scatters low regime in fig 4 b and 4 d are closer to the 1 1 line than the top right high regime the model s performance can be further improved but it is not carried out in the following since it is not a concern for this paper the statistical results for all the considered hydrological indicators as well as the optimized parameters are given in table 2 for the prechange period the calibrated and validated kge values are up to 0 93 and 0 91 respectively corresponding to the combination values of r α β being 0 93 0 99 1 00 and 0 96 1 06 1 05 the calibrated and validated nse values are 0 85 and 0 91 respectively for the postchange period the calibrated kge and nse are 0 91 and 0 81 respectively and the validated kge and nse are 0 86 and 0 72 respectively indicating no over fitting of the hydrological model according to the watershed model evaluation guidelines suggested by moriasi et al 2007 the model is deemed satisfactory for simulating monthly discharge with nse greater than 0 65 and r 0 8 for the calibration and validation periods therefore the model is sufficiently reliable for estimating hydrological variations for budyko based analysis two sets of future projected runoff were subsequently obtained by using two different calibrated abcd models where the initial soil water storage for the future period that is insensitive to the overall simulation performance was assumed to be the average of the historical series at the beginning of each month of the year fig 5 depicts the probability distribution of future monthly runoff in the form of a violin plot for each month the shape of the violin is characterized by the kernel density estimation method with the left side natural condition playing a baseline role in fig 5 we find that the runoff uncertainty is significantly greater during the flood season than during the non flood season moreover the right side flood magnitude is subtly lower than the left side in june july and august while the opposite is true for december january and february this may result from the refined operations of cascade reservoirs which intercept instream runoff for flood control during the flood season but deplete reservoir storage for agricultural irrigation during the non flood season human activities do have some impact on this region 4 3 estimation results for budyko type parameters to determine the energy limited and water limited months defined in section 3 1 table 3 lists the statistic results of a m for different months in the uhrb region the a m values from july to november are less than 1 reflecting that there is more effective precipitation and relatively less evapotranspiration during this period it coincides with the double flood period i e summer and autumn floods in the region during which water resources exported from the basin are mainly in the form of effective precipitation converted into floods we designate july to november as the energy limited season and the other months within one hydrological year as the water limited season fig 6 a and 6 b display the relationship between the seasonal evapotranspiration ratio and the aridity index for different periods of the energy and water limited seasons respectively within each subplot the prechange series is marked with red dots and the postchange series with green dots for both seasons the red dots generally lie below the green ones showing an increase in the evapotranspiration ratio e p δ s and a decrease in runoff due to direct human interference these red scatters were further used to estimate the parameters φ and v in the seasonal budyko type equation eq 2 by the levenberg marquardt method table 4 summarizes the calibrated results of φ and v as well as the corresponding r 2 and rmse metric values we find that φ w is larger than φ e due to the drier water limited season compared to the energy limited season the rmse varies from 0 79 to 1 22 and all r 2 are higher than 0 94 the results demonstrate that the performance of the fitting curves is reasonable 4 4 impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff variations our proposed extended budyko type model was eventually applied to explore the effects of climate change and human activities on future seasonal runoff variations with the results of the abcd model serving as a comparison fig 7 presents the percentage results of all involved future scenarios where each subplot has results for five gcms to account for the uncertainty of future meteorological factors the results of the budyko type and abcd models are almost identical and they share analogous climate and human percentage partitions in most cases human activities are significant in the future scenarios even higher than 90 in the mpi ssp126 scenario during the energy limited season anthropogenic water transfer projects will inevitably reduce total outlet runoff while the critical precipitation and temperature factors of climate change will offset this reduction effect the average contribution of both is 68 14 and 31 86 in energy limited seasons and 65 16 and 34 84 in water limited seasons respectively meanwhile different gcms have different expectations for the quantitative assessment of runoff variations the minimum variance in gcm projections occurs in fig 7 c where the human induced percentage varies between 59 13 and 74 81 and the maximum variance occurs in fig 7 f varying between 44 87 and 76 85 in conclusion the main driver of future runoff variations in the region is human activities with consideration of various future uncertainties notably our budyko based method allows for further delineation of climate change impacts compared with the dynamic hydrological modeling approach as fig 7 shows that the stacked navy and blue bars indicating the effects of effective precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively in the budyko estimate are contrasted with the teal bar indicating the total impact of climate change in the abcd estimate due to the diverse outputs of the various gcms the magnitude of each climatic component is necessarily different across the 15 projections in most projection cases effective precipitation dominates over potential evapotranspiration because it is the exclusive source of runoff generation in this closed region potential evapotranspiration also plays a non negligible role particularly during energy limited seasons this is mainly attributed to reservoirs and ponds that directly store water during the flood periods the stored water potentially signifies a higher probability for evapotranspiration due to the larger water surface area in conjunction with the high temperature fig 8 explicitly shows the results of the deterministic assessment for each future scenario as well as for the historical postchange period in spite of the dramatic distribution of meteorological factors in the three future scenarios as shown in fig 3 the deterministic assessment of anthropogenic impacts varies modestly it also differs little from the postchange period which is depicted in fig 8 b as having a near square shape the high emission ssp585 scenario will reinforce the role of climate change during the energy limited season due to more extreme rainfall events for the low emission ssp126 scenario both impacts throughout the seasons are nearly identical to those in the postchange period suggesting that the strategic water management policies developed in the postchange period have a high degree of adaptability the medium emission ssp370 scenario balances the impacts of the two scenarios mentioned above 5 discussion the runoff evolution pattern of the uhrb is closely related to the reliability of the operation of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project and of downstream water resource allocation in recent years a large body of relevant literature has investigated the runoff regime in the basin sun et al 2014 explored the spatial variability of contributions of climate variation and human activities to historical annual runoff reduction in the uhrb by applying three alternative methods to four sub basins and found that climate variability was a greater contributor with its relative contribution decreasing from 83 in the upstream to 46 in the downstream li et al 2020b confirmed this finding at a seasonal scale and subsequently informed the local government of water resource planning and management recommendations based on this perspective however these studies focused on hydrological data collected before 2014 during which human activities were not so intensive since the ibwt project and the reforestation project became operational in 2014 we find that human activities have exerted a more dominant role in the recent past while it cannot be arbitrarily assumed that the ibwt project is the major player in human activities to reduce runoff annual water diversion of 500 million m3 via the ibwt 6 of the total uhrb outflow is bound to have a strong and direct impact whether the ibwt is dominant or others dominant in anthropogenic influences requires further investigation to be sure this heavily disturbed area is difficult to restore to its natural state and the water management policies developed during the postchange period benefiting from the flexible operating rules of adjustable reservoirs will be adaptive in the near future 2031 2060 this study takes full account of future climate uncertainty yet ignores the propagation of uncertainty in the model structures and parameters taking the perturbation of the budyko curve parameters as the first set of experiments we include all combinations of the budyko curve parameters in the uncertainty experiment as long as their fitted r 2 metrics are greater than 0 90 the distributions of the estimated errors regarding the contribution of human activities for each future scenario are then drawn as box plots in fig 9 a and 9 b the absolute values of most errors in all 1000 sets of experiments are below 3 5 a second set of similar experiments considering the uncertainty of the abcd model parameters was repeated in which the evaluation metrics of the experimental abcd were acceptable the errors ranges plotted in fig 9 c and 9 d remain between 3 5 3 5 further demonstrating that our abcd model simulations are sufficiently reliable in fact abcd is favored in many hydrological simulation studies because of its multiple advantages it takes only four parameters to capture actual watershed storage changes and evapotranspiration which matches the inputs required for the seasonal budyko hypothesis the model s performance has been validated thousands of times in regional watersheds around the world including on the chinese mainland he et al 2022b employed the monthly abcd model to conduct a systematic attribution assessment of annual and seasonal runoff change from 1960 to 2000 in 191 catchments across china certainly more state of the art development of it or other hydrological models can strengthen the arguments for the contribution of climate and human relevant factors to runoff variations in terms of the quantitative assessment of the contribution of each factor to runoff variations at the seasonal scale we developed an extended budyko framework that blended elasticity and decomposition methods because of the interdependence of precipitation and storage changes the runoff variations arising from the complex effective precipitation term are difficult to derive directly which implicitly incorporates the impact of future vegetation but can be approximated as the residual of the total runoff change after subtracting direct human induced and potential evapotranspiration induced runoff change here direct human impact merely considers differences in the partitioning behavior of effective precipitation under given climate conditions but excludes indirect human impacts that affect runoff by disturbing climate variability in future studies the development of other desirable analytical methods will be crucial to refining the budyko framework 6 conclusions climate change and human activities are two primary drivers of change in regional runoff regimes assessing their contribution to future runoff variations can help improve the understanding of long term water resource management especially at the seasonal scale where both have intra annual variability we develop an extended budyko framework in this study that combines traditional elasticity and decomposition methods to attribute future seasonal runoff variations of the uhrb in china the case results are quantified using historical observations over 1961 2020 and near future projections over 2031 2060 from the isimip3b project the major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 a flat trend in precipitation and a negative trend in potential evapotranspiration are expected during the study period accompanied by substantial uncertainty projected by isimip3b for the future period additionally the runoff from the basin outlet shows a decreasing trend and the consistency of the runoff is diagnosed as disrupted after 1990 2 our proposed extended budyko type framework can make full use of the information from the monthly hydrological model abcd to reveal climate and human induced impacts on seasonal runoff variations it shows that human activities have played an essential role in the reduction of uhrb runoff in both seasons since 2014 which is likely caused by the operation of the ibwt project and reforestation projects 3 under the high emission ssp585 future scenario the role of climatic change dominated by effective precipitation is projected by isimip3b to be reinforced during the energy limited season but even so all isimip3b future scenarios agree that human activities will maintain their vigorous role in both energy and water limited seasons as they do in the postchange period this suggests that the water management policies developed in the postchange period are adaptive credit authorship contribution statement shaokun he

historical climate bias assessment of isimip3b project precipitation and air temperature are two key climate variables in cmip6 future projections although the bias corrected cmip6 climate forcing data archived in the isimip3b project is demonstrated to be applicable to the global region in lots of literature a bias assessment of its historical climate simulation in our study area is still necessary its simulated ensemble interval and observation sequences for the historical period 1961 2014 are shown in fig a1 it can be found that the isimip3b simulated ensemble interval captures the magnitude and fluctuations of historical observations well indicating its availability in our uhrb case appendix b future potential evapotranspiration projection the fao penman monteith method as shown in eq a 1 for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration ep using meteorological data i e wind speed relative humidity sunshine duration and minimum and maximum air temperatures is considered the standard method driving the penman monteith model with historical climate observations allows for the accurate acquisition of historical sequences of ep a1 e p pm 0 408 δ r n g r 900 t

pressure deficit of the air δ represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship r is the psychrometric constant however the estimation of future potential evapotranspiration with eq a 1 has a large degree of uncertainty since it involves the projections of many climatic variables as an alternative ep can be estimated using the modified hargreaves equation liu et al 2022 a2 e p har 0 0023 t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 r a a3 e p a e p har b where tmean tmax and tmin are the daily average maximum and minimum air temperatures a and b are empirical coefficients which can be determined by regression analyses between monthly e p pm and e p har the regression relationship between monthly e p pm and e p har in the uhrb for the historical period 1961 2020 is shown in fig a2
