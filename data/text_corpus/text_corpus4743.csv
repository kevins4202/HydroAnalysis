the most serious erosion distributes as lines in the inlet and outlet straight sections the maximum erosion rate of the pipe wall increases from 1 87 10 6 kg m2 s without vibration to 3 20 10 5 kg m2 s with vibration of 2 mm and 80 hz which almost increases by 17 times the predicted service life of seawater pipeline reduces from 218 6 days without vibration to 12 8 days with vibration of 2 mm and 80 hz this study will provide references for the structural optimization design and erosion prevention of seawater pipeline of polar ship keywords vibration 90 elbow seawater ice two phase flow service life erosion model 1 introduction with the opening of the arctic channel the key technology of polar shipbuilding has become a hot spot in the global shipbuilding industry the arctic channel has the advantages of shortening course saving transit time and reducing emissions and fuel consumption relative to the traditional commercial routes such as the suez canal and the panama canal however when the arctic sea ice melts in summer a large number of small ice particles are inhaled into the seawater system of polar ship forming seawater ice two phase flow which is easy to cause erosion in seawater pipeline there are many researchers studying on the erosion of pipeline caused by liquid solid two phase flow the studies mainly focus on two aspects experimental test and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation to investigate the effect of different factors on the erosion caused by liquid solid two phase flow various experimental methods have been adopted such as jet impingement test mahdi et al 2014 slurry pot test desale et al 2005 coriolis erosion test xie et al 1999 and pipe loop test wood et al 2004 zeng et al 2014 blanchard et al 1984 used a mitre bend and bends with mean curvature radius pipe diameter r d of 1 5 and 5 for testing the erosion caused by water sand two phase flow the wear coefficient wear position and wear depth were studied they found that the maximum erosion angle was almost the same under different size particles and elbow properties bourgoyne 1989 used a diverter system to study the effect of sand rate velocity fluid type and fitting type on erosion rate of pipe wall and then proposed the equations for estimating the erosion rate in diverter systems meng and ludema 1995 found 33 key parameters affecting the erosion rate by conducting a detailed investigation of the previously developed erosion wear experiments wood et al 2004 used a pipe loop test to explore the erosion rate of the straight and curved ducts they found that the erosion of the outermost sidewall was more serious compared with the innermost wall and the bottom of the bend was significantly eroded zhang et al 2013 explored the correlation between the wall erosion and the hydrodynamics of fluid flow by designing a scouring experiment similar to a real pipe although experimental test is a good method to study the erosion of the pipeline it costs much money and time by the development of computer technology the specific physical parameters and flow structure of fluid solid two phase flow can be numerically simulated based on cfd method njobuenwu and fairweather 2012 parsi et al 2014 cfd method is the current popular trend to study the pipeline corrosion and erosion which is more convenient and economical than the experimental method chen et al 2006 predicted the relative erosion severity between the elbow and the plugged tee with water sand two phase flow using an erosion model wang et al 2014 studied the effect of stokes number on the erosion rate of 90 elbow based on no change of fluid flow particle diameter and flow parameters and found that high stokes number inconspicuously arise erosion on the side walls of the downstream straight pipe close to the bend exit due to the inadequate effect of the secondary flow although the erosion of the pipeline caused by liquid solid two phase flow has been widely studied there are few researches focusing on the erosion caused by seawater ice two phase flow currently the studies of pipeline erosion are mostly in the static case but this is not consistent with the actual situation during sailing the ship normally has natural vibrations at frequencies less than 80 hz as a result of the waves mechanical operation ice breaking and fluid pulsation wang et al 2007 fukasawa 2012 the effect of vibration on pipeline erosion cannot be neglected because the vibration changes the movement of solid particles resulting in more complicated pipe erosion although the pipe erosion caused by liquid solid two phase flow under vibration is important little work has been done yet in this paper we study the influence of ice particles on the erosion of 90 elbow pipe under different vibration conditions using the discrete particle model dpm and dynamic grid technology the vibration amplitudes of 1 mm and 2 mm and the vibration frequencies of 10 hz 20 hz 40 hz and 80 hz are chosen the results can be used for the structural optimization of the seawater pipeline system of polar ship and for the prevention of pipe erosion during its polar navigation 2 mathematical models the eulerian lagrangian approach is chosen for the seawater ice two phase flow the seawater is treated as a continuous phase and the ice is treated as a discrete phase the erosion rate of pipe wall is calculated by the solid particle erosion models since the concentration of ice is low the seawater ice two phase flow is regarded as an incompressible newtonian fluid with turbulence characteristics the governing equations are continuity equation momentum conservation equation and k ε turbulence model 2 1 continuous phase control equations the navier stokes equations are used the continuity equation and momentum equation are written as 1 ρ t ρ u 0 2 t ρ u ρ u u p τ ρ g s m where ρ is the seawater density u is the velocity vector p is the pressure s m is the momentum change τ

the continuous phase in the eulerian framework and the particle trajectory equation is solved for the discrete phase in the lagrangian framework njobuenwu and fairweather 2012 parsi et al 2014 shang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the trajectory equation heat transfer equation and mass transfer equation of the solid particles can be solved by integrating the discrete time steps then the particle velocity on the particle trajectories in each position can be calculated njobuenwu and fairweather 2012 parsi et al 2014 the equations are as follows 4 d u p d t f d u u p g ρ p ρ ρ p f v 5 f d 3 μ 4

and brown force 2 3 wall collision recovery equations ice particles rebound after impacting the wall which has a great influence on the movement of the trajectory the rebound coefficient equations can be used to show the whole collision process the velocity of ice particles is decomposed into the normal velocity and the tangential velocity the movement of a particle impacting the wall is shown in fig 1 the normal and tangential coefficients are expressed as follows grant and tabakoff 1975 7 ε n u p 2 u p 1 0 993 1 76 θ 1 56 θ 2 0 49 θ 3 ε t v p 2 v p 1 0 988 1 66 θ 2 11 θ 2 0 67 θ 3 where t and n are the normal and tangential respectively u p1 and u p2 are the normal velocity of the particle before and after impacting the wall respectively v p1 and v p2 are the tangential velocity of the particle before and after impacting the wall respectively θ is the impact angle 2 4 erosion model there are many factors leading to particle erosion such as particle characteristics impact speed impact angle flow velocity volume fraction and the shape of pipe considering the fluid dynamic characteristics and the shape of the bend we choose the ice particle erosion model from the literature grant and tabakoff 1975 this model has been applied to many other particles zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2014 so we assume that it can be applied to ice particle as well the model selected is given as

calculation unit b v is the function of the relative velocity and the value of 2 41 is used in this study c d p is the function of ice diameter b is the brinell hardness of ice and its value is 2 when the temperature is in the vicinity of the freezing point of seawater 2 5 wall vibration models the pipeline used in this study is the seawater pipeline of the yongshenglun polar ship fig 2 fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the seawater pipeline system of the polar ship the dotted lines in this figure are seawater pipes the vibration of seawater pipeline of ship is caused by internal and external factors internal factors are the internal pulsation of seawater flow caused by devices such as pumps and valves external factors are the mechanical equipment operation ice breaking and ship sloshing the excitation will be produced when the pressure and flow rate of seawater change if the frequency of the excitation coincides with the natural frequency of the pipeline the vibration of the pipeline will be intensified resulting in a great impact on the flow of internal particles paidoussis and li 1993 paidoussis and semler 1996 bi and hao 2016 ortiz vidal et al 2017 the partial vibration of the elbow is shown in fig 4 considering the characteristics of the actual vibration conditions the vibration of pipeline is simplified to the harmonic motion then the displacement velocity and acceleration of the vibration of pipeline are expressed as 11 y a sin ω t φ 12 v d y d t a ω cos ω t φ 13 a d v d t a ω 2 sin ω t φ where the initial phase angle of the intermittent vibration is 0 3 model establishment and parameter setting 3 1 pipeline parameters and meshing the commercial software ansys flunt is the cfd solver used for the numerical simulations according to the design rules of seawater pipeline system of polar ship the geometric model of the horizontal 90 bend is established as shown in fig 5 the diameter is 100 mm the length of the inflow section is 3 m the length of the outflow section is 2 m the radius of the bending section is 200 mm and the gravity direction is down by y axis when the value of y is 100 the first layer thickness of boundary is calculated as 1 2 mm because the dynamic grid is used the negative volume is prone to occur during the calculation process which requires high grid quality moreover the seawater ice two phase flow in the elbow is very complex and the erosion in the elbow caused by the impact of particles is very severe therefore the multiple grid encryption debugging is needed to avoid the negative volume 3 2 parameters according to the scientific investigation report and related information of the arctic field navigation in 2013 2015 provided by yongshenglun and the national standard design requirements of seawater system of ship the average salinity of arctic seawater is about 35 in summer the material of the seawater pipeline is carbon steel the physical properties of seawater and ice in the seawater pipeline at standard atmospheric pressure are shown in table 1 zhang 2013 zhao 2013 3 3 boundary conditions the turbulent flow of seawater is fully developed in the pipeline and the turbulent intensity can be calculated the initial velocity of ice particles are set as the same as that of seawater moreover it is assumed that ice particles are the spherical particles with 500 μm in diameter and they have the same properties the surface jet source at the entrance is used the interaction between the seawater and the ice particle caused by two way coupling is chosen and the interaction between two ice particles is ignored suzuki et al 2008 the standard wall function and non slip boundary condition are used for the wall the elastic reflection is chosen for the collision of ice particles on the wall but the momentum of the ice particle accordingly decreases the amount of the momentum reduction is determined by radial and normal bounce coefficients the exit is set as outflow and the particle state is set as escape the classic simple algorithm is used for the pressure velocity coupling and the second order upwind format is used for the others 3 4 vibration conditions normally the natural vibration frequency of seawater pipe is between 0 hz and 80 hz and the vibration amplitude is between 1 mm and 2 mm therefore in this study the vibration frequencies are selected as 0 hz 10 hz 20 hz 40 hz and 80 hz and the vibration amplitudes are selected as 1 mm and 2 mm then the c language is used to write the user defined function udf program compiling to fluent which defines the vibration of the pipeline the time step is set as 0 002 s and the flow time is set as 20 s the main udf subroutine of the vibration conditions is defined in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of vibration on wall erosion 4 1 1 no vibration fig 6 a shows the trajectories of ice particles in the elbow firstly the ice particles flow along the streamlines in the inlet straight pipe then several ice particles change their flow direction at the outside wall of the pipe bend due to the secondary flow afterwards they impact the inner side wall of the pipe bend and change their flow direction again fig 6b shows the change of two phase flow velocity in the elbow obviously the maximum velocity occurs at the inner side wall of the pipe bend fig 6c shows the wall erosion rate without vibration the erosion in the top of the pipe is larger than that in the bottom of the pipe moreover the most serious erosion appears in the top of the pipe bend under the ideal condition that is no vibration on seawater pipeline there is no external interference for seawater ice two phase flow in the pipeline because of gravity the ice flow has been fully developed and there is a clear stratification flow phenomenon in the inlet straight pipe previous experimental results doron and barnea 1993 also showed that the seawater ice two phase flow is between uniform flow and heterogeneous flow when the ice floating velocity exceeds the ice flow velocity the fluid state will change from suspended flow to moving bed and ice particles will appear obvious stratification then they gather in the upper layer which is prone to erode the top of the pipe moreover the ice particles have a good following behavior in the inlet straight pipe so there is less erosion in here comparing with the pipe bend in a previous study peng and cao 2016 the most severe erosion caused by water sand two phase flow occurs in the outside wall of the elbow which is inconsistent with the result in this study the possible reason is the difference in density between the sand and the ice 4 1 2 vibration amplitude of 1 mm fig 7 shows the velocity vectors of seawater ice two phase flow for the elbow with vibration amplitude of 1 mm as can be seen the velocity vectors of seawater ice two phase flow change when the vibration frequency changes when the vibration frequency is 10 hz the maximum flow velocity is 3 97 m s in the inlet straight pipe and pipe bend the flow velocity in the mainstream area is greater than that in the border area of the pipe when the seawater ice mixture flows from the inlet straight pipe into the pipe bend as a result of the local resistance the kinetic energy loss of the seawater is very large at the outside wall of the pipe bend and the flow velocity is obviously reduced so the momentum transfer between the particle and the wall is weakened at the inner wall of the pipe bend the number of the particle collision is large due to the rebound effect of particles however in the outlet straight pipe the flow velocity in the top region is greater than that in other regions probably due to the effect of the inertial force when the vibration frequency increases to 20 hz the maximum flow velocity almost doesn t change however the maximum flow velocity appears at the innermost side of the pipe bend when the vibration frequency increases to 40 hz the maximum flow velocity reaches 4 19 m s however it doesn t concentrate in a certain area in the elbow when the vibration frequency increases to 80 hz the maximum flow velocity reaches 6 27 m s and the distribution of the flow velocity is similar to that with vibration frequency of 40 hz fig 8 shows the erosion amount of the pipe wall with vibration amplitude of 1 mm comparing fig 8a with fig 6c we find that the most serious erosion area moves to the innermost side of the pipe bend when the pipe is subjected to the vibration with frequency of 10 hz note that the maximum erosion amount is only 4 72 10 5 kg at 20 hz which is much lower than that at 10 hz 7 30 10 5 kg although the most serious erosion appears at the innermost side of the pipe bend the erosion at both sides of the pipe wall of the entire elbow is serious as well the ice particles continuously impact the pipe wall and then move to both sides of the pipe wall increasing the wall erosion significantly when the vibration frequency increases to 40 hz the maximum erosion amount will increase up to 1 36 10 4 kg it is worthy of being mentioned that the most serious erosion doesn t appear in the pipe bend but appears at both sides of the inlet and outlet straight sections the possible reason is that the flow state changes in the elbow and ice particles are re distributed by the secondary flow when the vibration frequency increases to 80 hz the maximum erosion amount will increase up to 3 33 10 4 kg with the increase of the vibration frequency the intensity of the turbulence pulsation increases so the exchange rates of the mass momentum and energy between the near wall region and the mainstream region are accelerated leading to more serious erosion 4 1 3 vibration amplitude of 2 mm fig 9 shows the velocity vectors of seawater ice two phase flow for the elbow with vibration amplitude of 2 mm clearly for the same vibration frequency the flow velocity in the elbow with vibration amplitude of 2 mm is greater than that with vibration amplitude of 1 mm when comparing fig 9 with fig 7 moreover as the vibration frequency increases the maximum flow velocity increases it reaches 6 92 m s at 80 hz vibration frequency has a greater effect on the velocity change of the fluid while vibration amplitude has a greater effect on the velocity distribution of the fluid because the vibration frequency increases the wall movement speed is accelerated making the flow velocity of the fluid near the wall significantly increased fig 10 shows the erosion amount of the pipe wall with vibration amplitude of 2 mm clearly the pipe wall with larger vibration amplitude has larger erosion amount as a result of higher rebound coefficient and higher impact strength of ice particles comparing fig 10a with fig 8a we find that the most serious erosion area transfers to the lower part near the flow separation area of the elbow when the vibration amplitude is 2 mm it could be that the ice particle wall rebound phenomenon at the top of the pipe increases as the vibration intensity increases therefore the ice particles rush down to the bottom of the pipe by the secondary flow in the pipe bend causing serious erosion in this region this is also supported by fig 9 from fig 10b we can see that the upper side of the straight pipes is seriously eroded and the most severe erosion appear at the upper side wall of the flow separation region and the entrance of the inlet straight pipe as seen from fig 10c the most serious erosion area transfers to the lower inner side of the pipe bend in the meantime there is a serious linear erosion area at the bottom of the inlet straight section when the vibration frequency increases to 80 hz fig 10d the most serious erosion distributes as lines in the inlet and outlet straight sections the particle trajectory is affected by several factors such as the inertial force drag force and secondary flow when the vibration frequency is low the secondary flow plays a larger role on the pipe erosion so the most serious erosion area is at or near the pipe bend for the high vibration frequency the inertial force is greater than the drag force so the particles depart from the streamline and the particles impact is random resulting in serious erosion in the overall pipe 4 2 change laws of wall erosion rate fig 11 shows the change laws of the erosion rate of the pipe wall at different vibration frequencies 0 hz 10 hz 20 hz 40 hz and 80 hz as illustrated in fig 11a the average erosion rate of the pipe wall increases nearly linearly with increasing the vibration frequency for vibration amplitudes of 1 mm and 2 mm the average erosion rate at 2 mm is higher than that at 1 mm when the vibration frequency is the same however the change rate of the average erosion rate at 1 mm is more stable than that at 2 mm note that the average erosion rate increases more significantly between 10 hz and 20 hz similar to the average erosion rate the maximum erosion rate basically increases with increasing the vibration frequency for vibration amplitudes of 1 mm and 2 mm as shown in fig 11b the maximum erosion rate with vibration amplitude of 2 mm is substantially higher than that with vibration amplitude of 1 mm except for the vibration frequencies lower than 10 hz when the vibration frequency is 80 hz the maximum erosion rate with vibration amplitude of 2 mm is 3 4 10 5 kg m2 s which is almost twice as large as that with vibration amplitude of 1 mm note that there is a turning point between 10 hz and 20 hz for the maximum erosion rate when the vibration amplitude is 1 mm the maximum erosion rate reduces from 3 65 10 6 kg m2 s at 10 hz to 2 36 10 6 kg m2 s at 20 hz as mentioned above the maximum erosion amount at 20 hz is much lower than that at 10 hz 4 3 prediction of pipeline failure and preventive measures according to the commonly used seamless steel pipe wall thickness standard for marine pipe system the thickness of the steel seawater pipe wall is 9 mm when the nominal diameter is 100 mm if the erosion depth of pipe wall exceeds 50 of the wall thickness the pipeline will be failure which brings serious problems to the operation of ship the maximum erosion rate of pipe wall under different vibration conditions is obtained by simulation as shown in table 3 then the service life of the pipeline can be calculated by the following equations 14 m ρ w a l l d v ρ w a l l d s 1 2 δ 15 t m e r max 3600 24 where ρ wall is the density of wall m is the unit weight dv is the unit volume δ is the thickness of wall t is the predicted service life fig 12 shows the predicted service life of the pipeline for seawater ice two phase flow under different vibration conditions without vibration the predicted service life of the seawater pipeline containing ice particles is 218 6 days which is significantly shorter than that of the seawater pipeline containing no ice particles it could be that the ice particles continue to impact the wall during the flow in addition the impact strength of the ice at the pipe bend is reinforced by the secondary flow which causes more severe erosion of the pipe wall therefore the wall in the top and in the bend of the pipe should be plated with metal film to prevent the serious erosion caused by ice particles the overall trend of the predicted service life is declining with increasing the vibration frequency for the vibration amplitude of 1 mm however there is a turning point between 10 hz and 20 hz and the predicted service life increases from 112 0 days at 10 hz to 173 2 days at 20 hz this is consistent with the result of the maximum erosion rate as mentioned above the predicted service life decreases with increasing the vibration frequency when the vibration amplitude is 2 mm note that there is a sharp decline for the predicted service life in the range of 0 20 hz in addition the predicted service life of the seawater pipeline is reduced to 12 8 days with vibration frequency of 80 hz which is only one twentieth of that without vibration 5 conclusions the erosion area and erosion rate of the 90 elbow in the seawater pipeline of polar ship were simulated by the liquid solid two phase flow model dynamic grid technology and erosion model the following conclusions are obtained 1 without vibration the serious erosion appears at the top of the pipe bend with the vibration of 80 hz and 1 mm the serious erosion areas are at the inside of the pipe bend and at the inner wall close to the flow separation area of the pipe with the vibration of 80 hz and 2 mm the most serious erosion areas are distributed as lines in the inlet and outlet straight sections 2 both the average erosion rate and the maximum erosion rate of pipe wall increases with the increase of the vibration frequency and the vibration amplitude the average erosion rate increases from 3 78 10 7 kg m2 s without vibration to 7 33 10 6 kg m2 s at 2 mm and 80 hz the maximum erosion rate increases from 1 87 10 6 kg m2 s without vibration to 3 20 10 5 kg m2 s at 2 mm and 80 hz however there is a turning point between 10 hz and 20 hz for the maximum erosion rate when the vibration amplitude is 1 mm and it reduces from 3 65 10 6 kg m2 s at 10 hz to 2 36 10 6 kg m2 s at 20 hz 3 when the vibration frequency is constant the predicted service life is lower if the vibration amplitude is higher when the vibration amplitude is constant the predicted service life decreases with increasing the vibration frequency the predicted service life reduces from the initial 218 6 days to the minimum 12 8 days with vibration amplitude of 2 mm however there is a turning point between 10 hz and 20 hz when the vibration amplitude is 1 mm and the predicted service life increases from 112 0 days at 10 hz to 173 2 days at 20 hz

and n are the normal and tangential respectively u p1 and u p2 are the normal velocity of the particle before and after impacting the wall respectively v p1 and v p2 are the tangential velocity of the particle before and after impacting the wall respectively θ is the impact angle 2 4 erosion model there are many factors leading to particle erosion such as particle characteristics impact speed impact angle flow velocity volume fraction and the shape of pipe considering the fluid dynamic characteristics and the shape of the bend we choose the ice particle erosion model from the literature grant and tabakoff 1975 this model has been applied to many other particles zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2014 so we assume that it can be applied to ice particle as well the model selected is given as

particles impacting the wall m p is the mass flow rate of ice and its value is 2 kg s when the volume fraction of ice is 10 f θ is the function of the impact angle a face is the area of the wall calculation unit b v is the function of the relative velocity and the value of 2 41 is used in this study c d p is the function of ice diameter b is the brinell hardness of ice and its value is 2 when the temperature is in the vicinity of the freezing point of seawater 2 5 wall vibration models the pipeline used in this study is the seawater pipeline of the yongshenglun polar ship fig 2 fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the seawater pipeline system of the polar ship the dotted lines in this figure are seawater pipes the vibration of seawater pipeline of ship is caused by internal and external factors internal factors are the internal pulsation of seawater flow caused by devices such as pumps and valves external factors are the mechanical equipment operation ice breaking and ship sloshing the excitation will be produced when the pressure and flow rate of seawater change if the frequency of the excitation coincides with the natural frequency of the pipeline the vibration of the pipeline will be intensified resulting in a great impact on the flow of internal particles paidoussis and li 1993 paidoussis and semler 1996 bi and hao 2016 ortiz vidal et al 2017 the partial vibration of the elbow is shown in fig 4 considering the characteristics of the actual vibration conditions the vibration of pipeline is simplified to the harmonic motion then the displacement velocity and acceleration of the vibration of pipeline are expressed as 11 y a sin ω t φ 12 v d y d t a ω cos ω t φ 13 a d v d t a ω 2 sin ω t φ where the initial phase angle of the intermittent vibration is 0 3 model establishment and parameter setting 3 1 pipeline parameters and meshing the commercial software ansys flunt is the cfd solver used for the numerical simulations according to the design rules of seawater pipeline system of polar ship the geometric model of the horizontal 90 bend is established as shown in fig 5 the diameter is 100 mm the length of the inflow section is 3 m the length of the outflow section is 2 m the radius of the bending section is 200 mm and the gravity direction is down by y axis when the value of y is 100 the first layer thickness of boundary is calculated as 1 2 mm because the dynamic grid is used the negative volume is prone to occur during the calculation process which requires high grid quality moreover the seawater ice two phase flow in the elbow is very complex and the erosion in the elbow caused by the impact of particles is very severe therefore the multiple grid encryption debugging is needed to avoid the negative volume 3 2 parameters according to the scientific investigation report and related information of the arctic field navigation in 2013 2015 provided by yongshenglun and the national standard design requirements of seawater system of ship the average salinity of arctic seawater is about 35 in summer the material of the seawater pipeline is carbon steel the physical properties of seawater and ice in the seawater pipeline at standard atmospheric pressure are shown in table 1 zhang 2013 zhao 2013 3 3 boundary conditions the turbulent flow of seawater is fully developed in the pipeline and the turbulent intensity can be calculated the initial velocity of ice particles are set as the same as that of seawater moreover it is assumed that ice particles are the spherical particles with 500 μm in diameter and they have the same properties the surface jet source at the entrance is used the interaction between the seawater and the ice particle caused by two way coupling is chosen and the interaction between two ice particles is ignored suzuki et al 2008 the standard wall function and non slip boundary condition are used for the wall the elastic reflection is chosen for the collision of ice particles on the wall but the momentum of the ice particle accordingly decreases the amount of the momentum reduction is determined by radial and normal bounce coefficients the exit is set as outflow and the particle state is set as escape the classic simple algorithm is used for the pressure velocity coupling and the second order upwind format is used for the others 3 4 vibration conditions normally the natural vibration frequency of seawater pipe is between 0 hz and 80 hz and the vibration amplitude is between 1 mm and 2 mm therefore in this study the vibration frequencies are selected as 0 hz 10 hz 20 hz 40 hz and 80 hz and the vibration amplitudes are selected as 1 mm and 2 mm then the c language is used to write the user defined function udf program compiling to fluent which defines the vibration of the pipeline the time step is set as 0 002 s and the flow time is set as 20 s the main udf subroutine of the vibration conditions is defined in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of vibration on wall erosion 4 1 1 no vibration fig 6 a shows the trajectories of ice particles in the elbow firstly the ice particles flow along the streamlines in the inlet straight pipe then several ice particles change their flow direction at the outside wall of the pipe bend due to the secondary flow afterwards they impact the inner side wall of the pipe bend and change their flow direction again fig 6b shows the change of two phase flow velocity in the elbow obviously the maximum velocity occurs at the inner side wall of the pipe bend fig 6c shows the wall erosion rate without vibration the erosion in the top of the pipe is larger than that in the bottom of the pipe moreover the most serious erosion appears in the top of the pipe bend under the ideal condition that is no vibration on seawater pipeline there is no external interference for seawater ice two phase flow in the pipeline because of gravity the ice flow has been fully developed and there is a clear stratification flow phenomenon in the inlet straight pipe previous experimental results doron and barnea 1993 also showed that the seawater ice two phase flow is between uniform flow and heterogeneous flow when the ice floating velocity exceeds the ice flow velocity the fluid state will change from suspended flow to moving bed and ice particles will appear obvious stratification then they gather in the upper layer which is prone to erode the top of the pipe moreover the ice particles have a good following behavior in the inlet straight pipe so there is less erosion in here comparing with the pipe bend in a previous study peng and cao 2016 the most severe erosion caused by water sand two phase flow occurs in the outside wall of the elbow which is inconsistent with the result in this study the possible reason is the difference in density between the sand and the ice 4 1 2 vibration amplitude of 1 mm fig 7 shows the velocity vectors of seawater ice two phase flow for the elbow with vibration amplitude of 1 mm as can be seen the velocity vectors of seawater ice two phase flow change when the vibration frequency changes when the vibration frequency is 10 hz the maximum flow velocity is 3 97 m s in the inlet straight pipe and pipe bend the flow velocity in the mainstream area is greater than that in the border area of the pipe when the seawater ice mixture flows from the inlet straight pipe into the pipe bend as a result of the local resistance the kinetic energy loss of the seawater is very large at the outside wall of the pipe bend and the flow velocity is obviously reduced so the momentum transfer between the particle and the wall is weakened at the inner wall of the pipe bend the number of the particle collision is large due to the rebound effect of particles however in the outlet straight pipe the flow velocity in the top region is greater than that in other regions probably due to the effect of the inertial force when the vibration frequency increases to 20 hz the maximum flow velocity almost doesn t change however the maximum flow velocity appears at the innermost side of the pipe bend when the vibration frequency increases to 40 hz the maximum flow velocity reaches 4 19 m s however it doesn t concentrate in a certain area in the elbow when the vibration frequency increases to 80 hz the maximum flow velocity reaches 6 27 m s and the distribution of the flow velocity is similar to that with vibration frequency of 40 hz fig 8 shows the erosion amount of the pipe wall with vibration amplitude of 1 mm comparing fig 8a with fig 6c we find that the most serious erosion area moves to the innermost side of the pipe bend when the pipe is subjected to the vibration with frequency of 10 hz note that the maximum erosion amount is only 4 72 10 5 kg at 20 hz which is much lower than that at 10 hz 7 30 10 5 kg although the most serious erosion appears at the innermost side of the pipe bend the erosion at both sides of the pipe wall of the entire elbow is serious as well the ice particles continuously impact the pipe wall and then move to both sides of the pipe wall increasing the wall erosion significantly when the vibration frequency increases to 40 hz the maximum erosion amount will increase up to 1 36 10 4 kg it is worthy of being mentioned that the most serious erosion doesn t appear in the pipe bend but appears at both sides of the inlet and outlet straight sections the possible reason is that the flow state changes in the elbow and ice particles are re distributed by the secondary flow when the vibration frequency increases to 80 hz the maximum erosion amount will increase up to 3 33 10 4 kg with the increase of the vibration frequency the intensity of the turbulence pulsation increases so the exchange rates of the mass momentum and energy between the near wall region and the mainstream region are accelerated leading to more serious erosion 4 1 3 vibration amplitude of 2 mm fig 9 shows the velocity vectors of seawater ice two phase flow for the elbow with vibration amplitude of 2 mm clearly for the same vibration frequency the flow velocity in the elbow with vibration amplitude of 2 mm is greater than that with vibration amplitude of 1 mm when comparing fig 9 with fig 7 moreover as the vibration frequency increases the maximum flow velocity increases it reaches 6 92 m s at 80 hz vibration frequency has a greater effect on the velocity change of the fluid while vibration amplitude has a greater effect on the velocity distribution of the fluid because the vibration frequency increases the wall movement speed is accelerated making the flow velocity of the fluid near the wall significantly increased fig 10 shows the erosion amount of the pipe wall with vibration amplitude of 2 mm clearly the pipe wall with larger vibration amplitude has larger erosion amount as a result of higher rebound coefficient and higher impact strength of ice particles comparing fig 10a with fig 8a we find that the most serious erosion area transfers to the lower part near the flow separation area of the elbow when the vibration amplitude is 2 mm it could be that the ice particle wall rebound phenomenon at the top of the pipe increases as the vibration intensity increases therefore the ice particles rush down to the bottom of the pipe by the secondary flow in the pipe bend causing serious erosion in this region this is also supported by fig 9 from fig 10b we can see that the upper side of the straight pipes is seriously eroded and the most severe erosion appear at the upper side wall of the flow separation region and the entrance of the inlet straight pipe as seen from fig 10c the most serious erosion area transfers to the lower inner side of the pipe bend in the meantime there is a serious linear erosion area at the bottom of the inlet straight section when the vibration frequency increases to 80 hz fig 10d the most serious erosion distributes as lines in the inlet and outlet straight sections the particle trajectory is affected by several factors such as the inertial force drag force and secondary flow when the vibration frequency is low the secondary flow plays a larger role on the pipe erosion so the most serious erosion area is at or near the pipe bend for the high vibration frequency the inertial force is greater than the drag force so the particles depart from the streamline and the particles impact is random resulting in serious erosion in the overall pipe 4 2 change laws of wall erosion rate fig 11 shows the change laws of the erosion rate of the pipe wall at different vibration frequencies 0 hz 10 hz 20 hz 40 hz and 80 hz as illustrated in fig 11a the average erosion rate of the pipe wall increases nearly linearly with increasing the vibration frequency for vibration amplitudes of 1 mm and 2 mm the average erosion rate at 2 mm is higher than that at 1 mm when the vibration frequency is the same however the change rate of the average erosion rate at 1 mm is more stable than that at 2 mm note that the average erosion rate increases more significantly between 10 hz and 20 hz similar to the average erosion rate the maximum erosion rate basically increases with increasing the vibration frequency for vibration amplitudes of 1 mm and 2 mm as shown in fig 11b the maximum erosion rate with vibration amplitude of 2 mm is substantially higher than that with vibration amplitude of 1 mm except for the vibration frequencies lower than 10 hz when the vibration frequency is 80 hz the maximum erosion rate with vibration amplitude of 2 mm is 3 4 10 5 kg m2 s which is almost twice as large as that with vibration amplitude of 1 mm note that there is a turning point between 10 hz and 20 hz for the maximum erosion rate when the vibration amplitude is 1 mm the maximum erosion rate reduces from 3 65 10 6 kg m2 s at 10 hz to 2 36 10 6 kg m2 s at 20 hz as mentioned above the maximum erosion amount at 20 hz is much lower than that at 10 hz 4 3 prediction of pipeline failure and preventive measures according to the commonly used seamless steel pipe wall thickness standard for marine pipe system the thickness of the steel seawater pipe wall is 9 mm when the nominal diameter is 100 mm if the erosion depth of pipe wall exceeds 50 of the wall thickness the pipeline will be failure which brings serious problems to the operation of ship the maximum erosion rate of pipe wall under different vibration conditions is obtained by simulation as shown in table 3 then the service life of the pipeline can be calculated by the following equations 14 m ρ w a l l d v ρ w a l l d s 1 2 δ 15 t m e r max 3600 24 where ρ wall is the density of wall m is the unit weight dv is the unit volume δ is the thickness of wall t is the predicted service life fig 12 shows the predicted service life of the pipeline for seawater ice two phase flow under different vibration conditions without vibration the predicted service life of the seawater pipeline containing ice particles is 218 6 days which is significantly shorter than that of the seawater pipeline containing no ice particles it could be that the ice particles continue to impact the wall during the flow in addition the impact strength of the ice at the pipe bend is reinforced by the secondary flow which causes more severe erosion of the pipe wall therefore the wall in the top and in the bend of the pipe should be plated with metal film to prevent the serious erosion caused by ice particles the overall trend of the predicted service life is declining with increasing the vibration frequency for the vibration amplitude of 1 mm however there is a turning point between 10 hz and 20 hz and the predicted service life increases from 112 0 days at 10 hz to 173 2 days at 20 hz this is consistent with the result of the maximum erosion rate as mentioned above the predicted service life decreases with increasing the vibration frequency when the vibration amplitude is 2 mm note that there is a sharp decline for the predicted service life in the range of 0 20 hz in addition the predicted service life of the seawater pipeline is reduced to 12 8 days with vibration frequency of 80 hz which is only one twentieth of that without vibration 5 conclusions the erosion area and erosion rate of the 90 elbow in the seawater pipeline of polar ship were simulated by the liquid solid two phase flow model dynamic grid technology and erosion model the following conclusions are obtained 1 without vibration the serious erosion appears at the top of the pipe bend with the vibration of 80 hz and 1 mm the serious erosion areas are at the inside of the pipe bend and at the inner wall close to the flow separation area of the pipe with the vibration of 80 hz and 2 mm the most serious erosion areas are distributed as lines in the inlet and outlet straight sections 2 both the average erosion rate and the maximum erosion rate of pipe wall increases with the increase of the vibration frequency and the vibration amplitude the average erosion rate increases from 3 78 10 7 kg m2 s without vibration to 7 33 10 6 kg m2 s at 2 mm and 80 hz the maximum erosion rate increases from 1 87 10 6 kg m2 s without vibration to 3 20 10 5 kg m2 s at 2 mm and 80 hz however there is a turning point between 10 hz and 20 hz for the maximum erosion rate when the vibration amplitude is 1 mm and it reduces from 3 65 10 6 kg m2 s at 10 hz to 2 36 10 6 kg m2 s at 20 hz 3 when the vibration frequency is constant the predicted service life is lower if the vibration amplitude is higher when the vibration amplitude is constant the predicted service life decreases with increasing the vibration frequency the predicted service life reduces from the initial 218 6 days to the minimum 12 8 days with vibration amplitude of 2 mm however there is a turning point between 10 hz and 20 hz when the vibration amplitude is 1 mm and the predicted service life increases from 112 0 days at 10 hz to 173 2 days at 20 hz

vertical and lateral loads an attention has been recently concentrated on not only the ultimate capacity but also the deformation and stiffness of a bucket foundation a bucket foundation with an external skirt which will be called a modified bucket foundation for brevity combines an internal compartment with an external short skirted compartment recently the modified bucket foundation has been developed in order to increase the lateral ultimate capacity and decrease the rotation particularly in order to avoid resonances in the structure produced by winds and waves special attention has been focused on the stiffness of the modified bucket foundation parametric analyses of such short piles as bucket foundations have been performed for a variety of practical cases and most of them are related to homogeneous soils the integral equation method or the boundary element method bem given by banerjee and davies 1977 1978 and banerjee 1978 has been used to provide the numerical computer based solutions for circular piles in nonhomogeneous soils poulos 1979 poulos and davis 1980 chow 1987 zhang and small 2000 small and zhang 2002 and kitiyodom and matsumoto 2003 presented the solutions of circular pile foundations in nonhomogeneous soils using the numerical methods such as the finite element method fem and bem and the simplified analytical approaches the rigorous analytical approach ensures the boundary continuity and compatibility conditions of the displacement stress force rotation and moment for short piles such as bucket foundations and half space apirathvorakij and karasudhi 1980 investigated a rigorous analytical approach for the quasi static bending of a circular pile embedded in a saturated porous half space selvadurai and rajapakse 1985 studied a rigorous analytical method related to the axial lateral and rotational loadings of a rigid cylindrical inclusion embedded in an isotropic elastic half space rajapakse and shah 1987a 1987b 1989 presented a rigorous analytical method to solve an elastic circular bar embedded in an elastic half space subjected to longitudinal lateral and rotational loads it is assumed in a less rigorous analysis for a laterally loaded bucket foundation that the bucket foundation and soil each have one displacement component in the horizontal direction a less rigorous approach was presented by spillers and stoll 1964 to investigate the behavior of laterally loaded piles under static loading poulos and davis 1980 and poulos 1971a 1971b 1972 employed a finite difference method to analyze the behavior of vertically and laterally loaded single circular piles and pile groups randolph 1981 presented that the effect of variations in poisson s ratio on the deformation of a laterally loaded pile could be adequately represented by considering a parameter which is a modified shear modulus taking into account poisson s ratio using the variational calculus sun 1994 presented a numerical approach and parametric study for the calculation of soil and pile interaction under lateral loading guo and lee 2001 investigated the response of laterally loaded circular piles in homogeneous soil using the modified shear modulus proposed by randolph 1981 and the simplified stress field using the variational approach and the modified shear modulus proposed by randolph 1981 basu and salgado 2008 investigated the effect of poisson s ratio on the deformation of a laterally loaded rectangular pile in layered soil because the method proposed by guo and lee 2001 and basu and salgado 2008 incorporates the effect of poisson s ratio into the expression for the modified shear modulus it may be necessary that the effect of poisson s ratio and that of the original shear modulus on the horizontal deflection are investigated separately to evaluate each effect on the lateral behavior directly douglas and davis 1964 presented an analytical method for the rectangular rigid plate subjected to horizontal loads in homogeneous soil to analyze the behavior of circular piles subjected to lateral loads elahi et al 2010 and liyanapathirana and poulos 2010 proposed winkler type

bucket foundations in offshore wind turbine structures have been investigated because of its potential cost effectiveness and its advantages for environmental issues bucket foundations used in offshore wind turbine structures are exposed to heavy moment m and lateral h loads but relatively low vertical v loads much research has been carried out to provide mainly the various forms of yield

bransby 2007 gourvenec 2008 bransby and yun 2009 gourvenec and barnett 2011 these approaches have been focused on predicting the capacity of foundations subjected to combined loads and a few approaches have been used to predict behaviour before failure villalobos et al 2009 carried out the experiments on dry sand and investigated the pre failure behaviour using a work hardening plasticity

assessment of pullout load capacity of a bucket foundation in clay has been carried out through 3dda hirai 2017c therefore the present approach using 3dda is capable of predicting the response of a bucket foundation for a prototype scale as well as a small scale model test in the following presentation for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil an investigation is made to propose analytical solutions for lateral loads first the lateral stiffness coefficient along the skirt of the modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil employing the mindlin 1936 solution for a

of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch acting on the surface of a soil and the equivalent elastic modulus in the equivalent elastic method hirai 2008 fourth the vertical stress of a soil underneath the base of the modified bucket foundation subjected to vertical and moment loads is presented considering only compression and permitting no tension on the base fifth an envelope of the combined ultimate horizontal and moment load capacities of the modified bucket foundation in sand is investigated for the relationships between ultimate lateral and moment load capacities and aspect ratios internal and external skirt lengths to diameter comparison of the results calculated by the present method for the modified bucket foundations in sand is made between those obtained from experiments behavior of sand up to failure is investigated through the relationship between lateral loads strain and displacement and that between depth and lateral pressure 2 formulation of lateral responses of modified bucket foundation in order to obtain a solution for the values of vertical and horizontal pressures along a modified bucket foundation and vertical and horizontal displacements of the modified bucket foundation it is necessary to give expressions for vertical and lateral displacements of the modified bucket foundation and the soil at each element in terms of the unknown vertical and lateral pressures on the modified bucket foundation fig 1 a shows a modified bucket foundation subjected to a vertical load v lateral load h and moment load m on a lid of the modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil the present procedure uses the elastic moduli of young s modulus e sm and poisson s ratio ν sm and the length h sm of the mth layer in the n layers comprising the lid and nonhomogeneous soil where m 1 n and mb denotes the mb th soil layer beneath the base of the modified bucket foundation l and d b are the length from a soil surface and the diameter of the internal compartment respectively l s and d l are the length from the soil surface and the diameter of the external compartment and t l and t s are the thickness of the lid and that of both the internal and external skirts for the modified bucket foundation respectively fig 1 b shows a modified bucket foundation discretized into several elements the modified bucket foundation is discretized taking the nonhomogeneous soil into account and the v m m m and s m are the vertical force moment and shear force at the top of the mth discretized element respectively the p vm and p hm are vertical and lateral forces along the mth discretized element respectively fig 2 shows the basic geometry of a modified bucket foundation subjected to vertical lateral and moment loads in figs 1 and 2 r φ z is the circular cylindrical coordinate system and the related rectangular cartesian coordinate system x y z is such that the z axis is normal to the soil surface for the element k 1 with the base of the external compartment in the modified bucket foundation shown in fig 2 b the v k m k and s k which are the vertical force moment and shear force on the base of the k 1 th element respectively are expressed as follows v k v pk v nk m k m pk m nk and s k s pk s nk where the v pk m pk and s pk are the vertical force moment and shear force at the top of the kth element respectively and the v nk m nk and s nk are the vertical force moment and shear force on the base of the external compartment in the k 1 th element respectively for the mth element except the k 1 th element it is seen that v m v pm m m m pm and s m s pm in the following presentation the base of a modified bucket foundation is assumed to be represented as a hollow rigid cylindrical punch acting on the surface of a soil ignoring the skirt and surrounding soil depth 2 1 vertical stiffness coefficient on base of skirt of modified bucket foundation veletsos and tang 1987 presented the vertical stiffness coefficient using the comprehensive analysis made of the harmonic response of vertically excited massless rigid ring foundations on an elastic halfspace for a hollow rigid cylindrical punch on the surface of soil subjected to the vertical load hirai 2016b proposed a rigorous analytical solution based on an approach employing the fourier expansion and hankel integral transformation method this approach however contains complicated calculations to obtain the rigorous solution of the response for the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under vertical load therefore a less rigorous approach has been required to provide the solution of the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under vertical load easily for a hollow rigid cylindrical punch with internal and external diameters of d p and d n subjected to the vertical load v n as shown in fig 3 because it can be assumed that the vertical normal stress takes the singularities at the edges of r a p and r a n on the surface of the half space the normal stress σ z between a p r a n on z 0 may be assumed as follows 1 σ z r 0 r v n a 1 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a p r a n where a 1 is an unknown function determined by the equilibrium condition of the vertical load and is given as follows 2 a 1 2 π a n e q where e q is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind and q a n 2 a p 2 1 2 a n the distance r between the coordinates r φ of the point to which the vertical stress is applied and the x y coordinates a x 0 of the point where the vertical displacement is calculated on the soil surface z 0 can be expressed as follows 3 r a x 2 r 2 2 a x r cos φ 1 2 therefore the vertical displacement w on the soil surface is written as 4 w a x 1 ν 2 π g 0 2 π a p a n σ z r 0 r r d r d ϕ where g and ν are the shear modulus and poisson s ratio of a soil respectively substituting eq 1 into eq 4 the vertical displacement w on the surface of the half space is written as follows 5 w a x 1 ν v n π 2 g a n e q a p a n k s r 2 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a x r

of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch is reduced to the rigorous value of that for the rigid circular base as will be shown in 2 9 2 2 lateral stiffness coefficient on base of skirt of modified bucket foundation it would seem that a rigorous solution of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch subjected to the lateral load has not been presented it may be very difficult to obtain a rigorous solution of the response for the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under lateral load because the analytical procedure needs several complicated calculations therefore a less rigorous approach has been required to provide the solution of the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under lateral load for a hollow rigid cylindrical punch subjected to the lateral load h n as shown in fig 3 because it can be assumed that the shear stress takes the singularities at the edges of r a p and r a n on the surface of the half space the shear stress τ xz between a p r a n on z 0 may be assumed as follows 7 τ x z r 0 r h n a 2 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a p r a n where a 2 is an unknown function determined by the equilibrium condition of the lateral load and is given as follows 8 a 2 2 π a n e q therefore the lateral displacement u on the soil surface is written as 9 u a x 1 2 π g 0 2 π a p a n 1 r 1 ν r 2 sin 2 ϕ r 2 τ x z r 0 r d r d ϕ substituting eq 7 into eq 9 the lateral displacement u on the surface of the

substituting a p 0 into eq 12 the lateral stiffness coefficient k hn for the base of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch is reduced to the rigorous value of that for the rigid circular base as will be shown in 2 9 2 3 rocking stiffness coefficient on base of skirt of modified bucket foundation it seems that a rigorous solution of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch subjected to the moment has not been proposed it may be not easy to present a rigorous solution of the response for the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under moment because the analytical procedure necessitates several complicated calculations therefore a less rigorous approach has been required to provide the solution of the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under moment for a hollow rigid cylindrical punch subjected to the moment m n about the y axis as shown in fig 3 because it can be assumed that the vertical stress takes the singularities at the edges of r a p and r a n on the surface of the half space the vertical stress σ z between a p r a n on z 0 may be assumed as follows 13 σ z r 0 r 2 cos ϕ m n a 3 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a p r a n where a 3 is an unknown function determined by the equilibrium condition of the moment and is given as follows 14 a 3 π a n 2 a n 2 a p 2 e q a p 2 k q 3 therefore the vertical displacement w on the soil surface is written as 15 w a x 1 ν 2 π g 0 2 π a p a n σ z r 0 r r d r d

base of modified bucket foundation subjected to self weight as a vertical load increases the ultimate lateral capacities of a bucket foundation in a cohesionless soil usually increase in order to investigate the effect of the vertical load including the self weight on the lateral capacity of a modified bucket foundation it is necessary to provide the vertical stress of a soil beneath the base of the modified bucket foundation the vertical stress affects the stress dependent modulus of elasticity for a sand using the mindlin 1936 solution in the case of a vertical point load the normal stress σ z of a soil in the z direction produced by a uniform vertical traction p z due to the self weight w mbe of the external compartment in the modified bucket foundation is expressed in the following form 18 σ z h 0 2 π a b o a l o i σ r d r d ϕ p z where 19 p z w m b e π a l o 2 a b o 2 and σ i is the influence factor for the vertical stress produced by a vertical point load and is given by the mindlin 1936 solution as follows 20 i σ 1 8 π 1 ν 1 2 ν z 1 d 1 3 3 z 1 3 d 1 5 2 ν 1 z 1 d 2 3 3 z 2 3 4 ν z 2 h c c 5 h d 2 5 30 h c z 2 3 d 2 7 where 21 z 1 h c z 2 h c r 2 x 2 y 2 d 1

self weight w mbi of the internal compartment in the modified bucket foundation can be obtained from the forms similar to eqs 18 21 2 5 lateral stiffness coefficient along skirt of modified bucket foundation hirai 2012 presented a lateral stiffness coefficient along a circular pile employing the mindlin 1936 solution for a lateral load by making reference to equations given by hirai the lateral displacement at a depth of the soil which is adjacent to a bucket foundation with the diameter d b subjected to the horizontal pressure p h along the bucket foundation may be written as follows 22 u u h d b i h h p h h e s h where u is the lateral displacement of the soil h is the depth coordinate of the point at which the lateral displacement is evaluated as presented by prasad and chari 1999 the lateral pressure between a skirt and soil caused by external loads on a bucket foundation can be assumed to be the compression on one side such that p p h cos2ψ 0 ψ π 4 and p h p h d b where p is the lateral pressure dependent on the angle ψ and no tension on the other side in this case the parameter i h h is written as follows 23 i h h 2 0 l 0 π 4 i p h cos 2 ψ d ψ d c where ph i is the influence factor for the lateral displacement due to a lateral point load ψ is the angle related to the bucket section as shown in fig 2 d and c is the depth coordinate of the point where the lateral pressure

z 1 h c z 2 h c d 1 2 r 2 z 1 2 d 2 2 r 2 z 2 2 r d b sin ψ for the winkler soil model of the subgrade reaction analysis the relationship between the lateral pressure p h and the lateral displacement u at the depth h in nonhomogeneous soils subjected to lateral loads is assumed to be related as follows 26 p h k h h u where k h h is the modulus of subgrade reaction and varies with depth h using eqs 22 and 26 the lateral stiffness coefficient k h h along the skirt of a bucket foundation is written as follows 27 k h h d b k h h e s h i h h for a modified bucket foundation with both the internal diameter d b and the external one d l the lateral stiffness coefficient can be obtained using the equations similar to eqs 22 27 the vertical horizontal and rotational stiffnesses of internal and external soil plugs are much less than those of a suction caisson therefore the internal and external soil plugs are ignored in analysis related to the stiffness 2 6 lateral displacement of modified bucket foundation a modified bucket foundation subjected to a lateral force p h at the depth h is usually assumed to be governed by the beam equation as follows 28 e b i b d 4 u h d h 4 k h h u h 0 where e b i b e p i p e s i s is a combined bending stiffness of the modified bucket foundation and a trapped soil in which e p is the elastic modulus of the modified bucket foundation and i p and i s are the moment of inertia of the modified bucket foundation and that of the trapped soil respectively u h is the horizontal displacement of the modified bucket foundation in the x direction at the depth h and the lateral force is determined as 29 p h k h h u h by extending the solution for a homogeneous soil given by chang 1937 to produce that for multilayered soils the solution presented by hetenyi 1946 leads to that of eq 28 in the following recurrence equation 30 u m 1 θ m 1 m p m 1 s p m 1 f 1 m f 2 m β m f 3 m e p i p β m 2 f 4 m e p i p β m 3 4 β m f 4 m f 1 m f 2 m e p i p β m f 3

bucket foundation in the mth element respectively f rk and f hk are the rocking and lateral influence factors on the base of the external compartment respectively and f rmb and f hmb are the rocking and lateral influence factors on the base of the internal compartment respectively hardin and drnevich 1972 presented the shear modulus to describe the strain dependence of soil behavior according to hardin and drnevich 1972 the lateral stiffness coefficient k hγ dependent on the shear strain γ zx can be assumed as follows 32 k h γ h k h h 1 2000 γ z x in the case of a nonlinear relationship between lateral displacement and lateral load of a bucket foundation in sand taking into account the lateral stiffness coefficient k hγ dependent on the shear strain γ zx the procedure for solving eq 30 can adopt those presented by poulos and davis 1980 and hirai 2016a for analysis of piles subjected to lateral soil movements by solving eq 30 where k h h is replaced with k hγ h the displacement may be determined by which the horizontal force may be evaluated from eq 29 this force may now be compared with the specified yield capacities p y p y d b and p y p y d l with a yield pressure p y along internal and external compartments respectively at an element where the calculated force p h exceeds the yield capacity p y it is assumed in post yield that the lateral stiffness coefficient of a soil along a foundation can be reduced to k h h 100000 according to the broms 1964 solution for a short pile in a cohesionless soil a yield pressure can be written as follows 33 p y h 3 k p σ z where k p is the coefficient of the rankine passive pressure defined as 1 sinφ 1 sinφ φ is an angle of internal friction for the soil and σ z is an effective vertical overburden pressure 2 7 base response let us consider the boundary condition on the base of the internal compartment of a modified bucket foundation in eq 30 it may be assumed that the base of the bucket foundation subjected to lateral loads such as shear and moment loads is represented as a hollow rigid cylindrical punch acting on the surface of a soil ignoring the skirt of the bucket foundation the surrounding soil depth and the trapped soil in the bucket foundation therefore using eqs 7 and 12 the relationship between the horizontal displacement u mb in the x direction and the horizontal base load s mb and that between the horizontal pressure p hmb and the horizontal base load s mb on the hollow rigid circular base in a nonhomogeneous soil are assumed as follows 34 u m b f h m b s m b p h m b r s m b π d b e q r 2 a b i 2 a b o 2 r 2 1 2 where f hmb is the lateral influence factor and is expressed as 35 f h m b a b i a b o b 1 r 2 r 2 a b i 2 a b o 2 r 2 1 2 d r 2 π 2 g e a b o e q where g e is an equivalent shear modulus expressed by equivalent young s modulus e e hirai 2008 and equivalent poisson s ratio ν e of multilayered soils beneath the base of the modified bucket foundation which is defined as g e e e 2 1 ν e similarly using eqs 13 and 17 the relationship between the rotation θ mb and the moment load m mb about the y axis and that between the vertical pressure p rmb and the moment load m mb on the hollow rigid circular base in a nonhomogeneous soil are obtained as follows 36 θ m b f r m b m m b p r m b 3 r 2 cos ϕ m m b π a b o 2 a b o 2 a b i 2 e q a b i 2 k q r 2 a b i

the rocking and the lateral influence factors f rk and f hk on the base of the external compartment in the modified bucket foundation which appear in eq 31 the equations similar to eqs 34 37 can be obtained by replacing the values relating to the element mb 1 on the base of the internal compartment with those relating to the element k 1 on the base of the external compartment 2 8 vertical and shear stresses of soil underneath base of modified bucket foundation subjected to vertical lateral and moment loads for the base of the internal compartment of a modified bucket foundation subjected to a vertical load including the self weight v mb lateral load s mb and moment load m mb assuming that no tension is permitted and there is compression alone for the vertical stress σ z on the base the maximum vertical stress σ zmax and the average shear stress τ zxavg of a soil underneath the base of the internal compartment are calculated as follows 38 σ z max x n g y v m b τ z x a v g s m b a m b where 39 g y a x d a m m b e v m b where σ zmax is a maximum value of the vertical stress σ z on the internal base of the modified bucket foundation with a trapped soil x n is a distance between the neutral axis of the normal stress σ z and the edge of the modified bucket foundation where the σ zmax is produced g y is a geometrical moment of the effective area a on the internal base of the modified bucket foundation in the x coordinate defined from the neutral axis of the normal stress a mb is the area of the internal base of the modified bucket foundation with a trapped soil and e is an eccentricity because the diameter d b and the eccentricity e are specified values the distance x n of an unknown quantity is given as a solution of the following equation 40 x n d b 2 e g y i y where iy is the moment of inertia of the effective area a and is given by the following equation 41 i y a x 2 d a the ultimate base resistance on the base of an internal compartment for the vertical stress σ zu of a cohesionless soil can be evaluated from the bearing capacity theory hansen 1970 as 42 σ z u 0 5 γ d b n γ s γ σ b v n q s q where γ is the soil buoyant unit weight n γ and n q are the bearing capacity factors s γ and s q are revised factors meyerhof 1951 de beer 1970 and it is assumed that s γ 0 75 and s q 1 tanφ and σ bv is the effective vertical stress in a soil at the level of the base of the internal compartment the ultimate base resistance on the base of an internal compartment for the shear stress τ zxu of a cohesionless soil can be evaluated as 43 τ z x u tan ϕ v m b a m b for the base of the external compartment of the modified bucket foundation subjected to a vertical load including the self weight v nk lateral load s nk and moment load m nk the maximum vertical

external compartment for the vertical stress σ zu of a cohesionless soil can be assumed as 44 σ z u 0 5 γ d l d b n γ s γ σ b v n q s q the ultimate base resistance on the base of an external compartment for the shear stress τ zxu of a cohesionless soil can be evaluated as 45 τ z x u tan ϕ v n k a n k where a nk is the area of the base in the external compartment the lateral stiffness coefficient k hγ is assumed to obey eq 32 by solving eq 30 where k h h is replaced with k hγ h the displacement may be determined by which the vertical and shear stresses on the base of the internal compartment may be evaluated from eq 38 similarly the vertical and shear stresses on the base of the external compartment may be calculated these obtained quantities can now be compared with the specified ultimate values given by eqs 42 45 at an element where the calculated value exceeds an ultimate base resistance it is assumed that the lateral stiffness coefficient of a soil under the base of a foundation can be reduced to k h h 100000 2 9 vertical lateral and rocking stiffness coefficients of rigid circular base the stiffness coefficients wolf 1994 for several loading conditions have been used generally in elastodynamics the normalized vertical stiffness coefficient f v is defined as the ratio of the vertical stiffness coefficient k vn of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch to the one k v0 of surface foundation with the rigid circular base i e f v k vn k v0 the vertical stiffness coefficient k v0 of surface foundation with the rigid circular base is written as k v0 e s d n 1 ν

the lateral behavior of a modified bucket foundation subjected to vertical lateral and moment loads it may be of interest to compare the results produced by the less rigorous method presented here with those obtained from the rigorous method proposed earlier fig 3 shows the relationships between the radius ratio a p a n and the normalized vertical horizontal and rocking stiffness coefficients of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch on the surface of a homogeneous soil in the case where a representative calculation coordinate is specified as a x a p a n 2 as the radius ratio a p a n increases the stiffness coefficients each decrease gradually and tend to decrease rapidly with approach to the radius ratio of 1 0 for the vertical stiffness coefficient the less rigorous solution is in good agreement with the rigorous solutions presented by veletsos and tang 1987 and hirai 2016b although the rigorous solutions of the horizontal and rocking stiffness coefficients have not been proposed these coefficients obtained from the less rigorous approach take the trends similar to the vertical stiffness coefficient the vertical and rocking stiffness coefficients are independent of poisson s ratio and the horizontal stiffness coefficient produced by the less rigorous approach is dependent on poisson s ratio li et al 2015 conducted experiments of modified bucket foundations in sand and presented the ultimate lateral and moment load capacities by using fea the dimensions and parameters of the modified bucket foundation used here are the same as those adopted by li et al the buoyant unit weight of steel is γsteel 68 kn m3 and the elastic modulus is e l 210 gpa the soil parameters for the sand are specified as follows the buoyant unit weight γ 10 2 kn m3 and poisson s ratio ν s 0 25 for a dense sand achmus et al 2013 presented that the oedometric stiffness parameter κ 500 600 the oedometric stiffness parameter λ 0 55 0 6 the internal friction angle φ 37 5 40 0 and e s κσ at σ

internal compartment under the external compartment in a modified bucket foundation the relative density and the stresses may be affected by installation process the increases of the relative density and the vertical stress due to the installation process are taken into account in determining the oedometric stiffness parameters and the internal friction angle of a soil the other parameters used here are the same as those presented by li et al 2015 the following analysis adopts twenty one elements to discretize a suction caisson as shown in figs 1 and 2 it has been assumed that the point where the load pile head displacement curve becomes straight or substantially straight is generally taken as the ultimate lateral load chari and meyerhof 1983 prasad and chari 1999 however it may be difficult to determine precisely an ultimate point showing the ultimate lateral load at the pile head because yield and failure of a soil occur both along the skirt and on the base of a bucket foundation with increase of the vertical lateral and moment loads and the global stiffness of the foundation decreases due to local yield and failure of the soil therefore it may be convenient to use the shear strain of a soil adjacent to the pile head as a measure of deformation which can be related with ultimate load capacities of a bucket foundation tokimatsu and yoshimi 1984 presented that the magnitude of the shear strain in a sand can be used as a parameter in ultimate criterion of the sand in liquefaction it may be reasonable to adopt the shear strain as a parameter in the ultimate capacity criterion of a soil architectural institute of japan 2001 a point in three dimensional space composed of the vertical horizontal and moment load components applied to a foundation can be designated as an ultimate state where the shear strain of a soil produced by the combined loads reaches a specified limiting value as mentioned above it may be difficult to determine an ultimate point from a load displacement curve this leads to the two cases to be considered one is a case where a point where the load displacement curve becomes straight or substantially straight is taken as an ultimate lateral load and it is assumed for this that the shear strain equals 0 02 another is a case with a point where a large value observed in the load displacement curve is taken as an ultimate lateral load and it is assumed for this that the shear strain is 0 04 a bucket foundation where the lateral and moment loads are applied may be treated as a rigid pile because the lateral displacement u of a pile element is assumed to be identical with that of the soil element adjacent to the pile element it can be postulated that the absolute value of the shear strain γ zxh du dz produced by the lateral pressure p h in the soil adjacent to the rigid pile is the same as that of the rotation angle θ du dz of the rigid pile because the horizontal and moment loads applied to a bucket foundation are usually much larger than the vertical load acting on the foundation the investigation for the effect of a vertical load except the self weight of a bucket foundation on ultimate load capacities will be out of consideration in what follows fig 4 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil as the moment load increases in the case of the ratio m hd b 2 5 the shear strain increases nonlinearly the lateral pressure calculated for the shear strain γzx 0 04 reaches a maximum value at a depth near z l 0 3 the results from the present method are in good agreement with the experimental data given by li et al 2015 overall fig 5 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil the moment capacity in the case of l s 0 03 m is greater than that in the case of no external skirt of l s 0 the lateral pressure takes a maximum value at a depth near z l 0 4 in the case of l s 0 03 m the results from the present method are similar to the experimental data overall fig 6 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil the moment capacity in the case of l s 0 09 m is greater than that in the case of l s 0 06 m the lateral pressure at a depth near z l 0 4 in the case of l s 0 09 m is less than that in the case of l s 0 06 m the results from the present method are similar to the experimental data overall fig 7 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a modified bucket foundation with a larger external diameter d l in a nonhomogeneous soil the moment capacity in the case of l s 0 03 m is greater than that in the case of no external skirt of l s 0 the distribution of the lateral pressure for l s 0 03 m is similar to that for l s 0 except a depth near z l 0 4 compared with the results shown in fig 5 the present case with a larger external diameter takes a greater moment capacity the results from the present method are similar to the experimental data overall fig 8 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a modified bucket foundation with a larger external diameter d l in a nonhomogeneous soil the moment capacity in the case of l s 0 09 m is greater than that in the case of l s 0 06 m the lateral pressures in the cases of l s 0 06 and 0 09 m are a little different from those in the cases of l s 0 0 and 0 03 m shown in fig 7 compared with the results shown in fig 6 the present case with a larger external diameter takes a greater moment capacity the results from the present method are similar to the experimental data overall it is found from figs 4 8 that as the diameter and length of the external compartment increase the moment load capacity increases and the difference between the lateral pressures each is insignificant fig 9 shows relationships between ultimate lateral and moment load capacities for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil in the case where an ultimate shear strain takes an absolute value of 0 02 non dimensionalised ultimate capacities on an ultimate envelope are presented on the ultimate points p1 p9 as the horizontal load acting on the foundation and the moment applying in the direction different from the horizontal load increase the foundation exhibits a greater resistance poulos and davis 1980 obtained a solution of ultimate lateral capacities for horizontal and moment loadings for a rigid free head pile in a soil by considering equilibrium of horizontal forces and moments by using the strain hardening plasticity theory villalobos et al 2009 and ibsen et al 2014a b presented the relationships between the ultimate vertical lateral and moment load capacities the non dimensional ultimate envelopes predicted here are broadly similar to those obtained by poulos and davis 1980 villalobos et al 2009 and ibsen et al 2014a b fig 10 shows relationships between ultimate lateral and moment load capacities for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil in the case where an ultimate shear strain takes an absolute value of 0 02 non dimensionalised ultimate capacities on an ultimate envelope are presented on the ultimate points p1 p9 as the horizontal load acting on the foundation and the moment applying in the direction different from the horizontal load increase the foundation exhibits a greater resistance compared with the results shown in fig 9 a modified bucket foundation comprising a larger external diameter and a short skirt takes greater lateral and moment load capacities fig 11 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and lateral displacement for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil for the ultimate points p1 p5 shown in fig 9 the top and tip of a bucket foundation mean the depth z 0 and z l respectively as the absolute values of the moment loads for p1 2 4 5 and the lateral load for p3 increase the lateral displacements at top increase gradually and tend to increase rapidly near ultimate states at each tip the lateral displacements for p1 p3 and those for p4 and p5 decrease and increase respectively and that for p5 increases suddenly near an ultimate state fig 12 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and lateral displacement for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil for the ultimate points p6 p9 shown in fig 9 as the absolute values of the moment loads increase the lateral displacements at tip increase gradually and tend to increase rapidly near ultimate states at each top the lateral displacements decrease or increase according to the loading level and that for p6 tends to decrease suddenly near an ultimate state fig 13 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and shear strain for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil as the absolute values of the moment loads and the lateral load increase for p1 2 4 9 and p3 respectively the shear strains increase and decrease for p1 p5 and p6 p9 respectively the shear strain for p5 and that for p6 suddenly increases and decreases respectively near ultimate states fig 14 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and lateral displacement for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil for the ultimate points p1 p5 shown in fig 10 as the absolute values of the moment loads and the lateral load increase for p1 2 4 5 and p3 respectively the lateral displacements at top increase gradually and tend to increase rapidly near ultimate states at each tip the lateral displacements for p1 p3 and those for p4 and p5 decrease and increase respectively and those for p4 and p5 decrease suddenly near ultimate states fig 15 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and lateral displacement for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil for the ultimate points p6 p9 shown in fig 10 as the absolute values of the moment loads increase the lateral displacements at tip increase gradually and tend to increase rapidly near ultimate states at each top the lateral displacements decrease or increase according to the loading level and that for p6 tends to decrease suddenly near an ultimate state fig 16 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and shear strain for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil as the absolute values of the moment loads and the lateral load increase for p1 2 4 9 and p3 respectively the shear strains increase and decrease for p1 p5 and p6 p9 respectively the shear strain for p5 and that for p6 suddenly increases and decreases respectively near ultimate states it is found from the calculated results shown in figs 11 16 that it may be difficult to determine rigorously an ultimate point representing the ultimate lateral and moment loads of a modified bucket foundation the global stiffness of the modified bucket foundation decreases gradually due to the local lateral yield of a soil along both internal and external skirts and the local compressive and shear yields of the soil under both bases of internal and external compartments with increase of the lateral and moment loads this is the reason why the shear strain of a soil adjacent to a modified bucket foundation is adopted as a measure of deformation connected with ultimate load capacities of the modified bucket

vertical and lateral loads an attention has been recently concentrated on not only the ultimate capacity but also the deformation and stiffness of a bucket foundation a bucket foundation with an external skirt which will be called a modified bucket foundation for brevity combines an internal compartment with an external short skirted compartment recently the modified bucket foundation has been developed in order to increase the lateral ultimate capacity and decrease the rotation particularly in order to avoid resonances in the structure produced by winds and waves special attention has been focused on the stiffness of the modified bucket foundation parametric analyses of such short piles as bucket foundations have been performed for a variety of practical cases and most of them are related to homogeneous soils the integral equation method or the boundary element method bem given by banerjee and davies 1977 1978 and banerjee 1978 has been used to provide the numerical computer based solutions for circular piles in nonhomogeneous soils poulos 1979 poulos and davis 1980 chow 1987 zhang and small 2000 small and zhang 2002 and kitiyodom and matsumoto 2003 presented the solutions of circular pile foundations in nonhomogeneous soils using the numerical methods such as the finite element method fem and bem and the simplified analytical approaches the rigorous analytical approach ensures the boundary continuity and compatibility conditions of the displacement stress force rotation and moment for short piles such as bucket foundations and half space apirathvorakij and karasudhi 1980 investigated a rigorous analytical approach for the quasi static bending of a circular pile embedded in a saturated porous half space selvadurai and rajapakse 1985 studied a rigorous analytical method related to the axial lateral and rotational loadings of a rigid cylindrical inclusion embedded in an isotropic elastic half space rajapakse and shah 1987a 1987b 1989 presented a rigorous analytical method to solve an elastic circular bar embedded in an elastic half space subjected to longitudinal lateral and rotational loads it is assumed in a less rigorous analysis for a laterally loaded bucket foundation that the bucket foundation and soil each have one displacement component in the horizontal direction a less rigorous approach was presented by spillers and stoll 1964 to investigate the behavior of laterally loaded piles under static loading poulos and davis 1980 and poulos 1971a 1971b 1972 employed a finite difference method to analyze the behavior of vertically and laterally loaded single circular piles and pile groups randolph 1981 presented that the effect of variations in poisson s ratio on the deformation of a laterally loaded pile

investigated the effect of poisson s ratio on the deformation of a laterally loaded rectangular pile in layered soil because the method proposed by guo and lee 2001 and basu and salgado 2008 incorporates the effect of poisson s ratio into the expression for the modified shear modulus it may be necessary that the effect of poisson s ratio and that of the original shear modulus on the horizontal deflection are investigated separately to evaluate each effect on the lateral behavior directly douglas and davis 1964 presented an analytical method for the rectangular rigid plate

sand up to failure is investigated through the relationship between lateral loads strain and displacement and that between depth and lateral pressure 2 formulation of lateral responses of modified bucket foundation in order to obtain a solution for the values of vertical and horizontal pressures along a modified bucket foundation and vertical and horizontal displacements of the modified bucket foundation it is necessary to give expressions for vertical and lateral displacements of the modified bucket foundation and the soil at each element in terms of the unknown vertical and lateral pressures on the modified bucket foundation fig 1 a shows a modified bucket foundation subjected to a vertical load v lateral load h and moment load m on a lid of the modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil the present procedure uses the elastic moduli of young s modulus e sm and poisson s ratio ν sm and the length h sm of the mth layer in the n layers comprising the lid and nonhomogeneous soil where m 1 n and mb denotes the mb th soil layer beneath the base of the modified bucket foundation l and d b are the length from a soil surface and the diameter of the internal compartment respectively l s and d l are the length from the soil surface and the diameter of the external compartment and t l and t s are the thickness of the lid and that of both the internal and external skirts for the modified bucket foundation respectively fig 1 b shows a modified bucket foundation discretized into several elements the modified bucket foundation is discretized taking the nonhomogeneous soil into account and the v m m m and s m are the vertical force moment and shear force at the top of the mth discretized element respectively the p vm and p hm are vertical and lateral

circular cylindrical coordinate system and the related rectangular cartesian coordinate system x y z is such that the z axis is normal to the soil surface for the element k 1 with the base of the external compartment in the modified bucket foundation shown in fig 2 b the v k m k and s k which are the vertical force moment and shear force on the base of the k 1 th element respectively are expressed as follows v k v pk v nk m k m pk m nk and s k s pk s nk where the v pk m pk and s pk are the vertical force moment and shear force at the top of the kth element respectively and the v nk m nk and s nk are the vertical force moment and shear force on the base of the external compartment in the k 1 th element respectively for the mth element except the k 1 th element it is seen that v m v pm m m m pm and s m s pm in the following presentation the base of a modified bucket foundation is assumed to be represented as a hollow rigid cylindrical punch acting on the surface of a soil ignoring the skirt and surrounding soil depth 2 1 vertical stiffness coefficient on base of skirt of modified bucket foundation veletsos and tang 1987 presented the vertical stiffness coefficient using the comprehensive analysis made of the harmonic response of vertically excited massless rigid ring foundations on an elastic halfspace for a hollow rigid cylindrical punch on the surface of soil subjected to the vertical load hirai 2016b proposed a rigorous analytical solution based on an approach employing the fourier expansion and hankel integral transformation method this approach however contains complicated calculations to obtain the rigorous solution of the response for the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under vertical load therefore a less rigorous approach has been required to provide the solution of the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under vertical load easily for a hollow rigid cylindrical punch with internal and external diameters of d p and d n subjected to the vertical load v n as shown in fig 3 because it can be assumed that the vertical normal stress takes the singularities at the edges of r a p and r a n on the surface of the half space the normal stress σ z between a p r a n on z 0 may be assumed as follows 1 σ z r 0 r v n a 1 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a p r a n where a 1 is an unknown function determined by the equilibrium condition of the vertical load and is given as follows 2 a 1 2 π a n e q where e q is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind and q a n 2 a p 2 1 2 a n the distance r between the coordinates r φ of the point to which the vertical stress is applied and the x y coordinates a x 0 of the point where the vertical displacement is calculated on the soil surface z 0 can be expressed as follows 3 r a x 2 r 2 2 a x r cos φ 1 2 therefore the vertical displacement w on the soil surface is written as 4 w a x 1 ν 2 π g 0 2 π a p a n σ z r 0 r r d r d ϕ where g and ν are the shear modulus and poisson s ratio of a soil respectively substituting eq 1 into eq 4 the vertical displacement w on the surface of the half space is written as follows 5 w a x 1 ν v n π 2 g a n e q a p a n k s r 2 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a x r d r where k s is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and s 2 a x r 1 2 a x r because the vertical stiffness coefficient for the base of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch k vn is defined as k vn v n w a x it follows from eq 5 that 6 k v n π 2 g a n e q 1 ν a p a n k s r 2 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a x r d r 1 substituting a p 0 into eq 6 the vertical stiffness coefficient k vn for the base of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch is reduced to the rigorous value of that for the rigid circular base as will be shown in 2 9 2 2 lateral stiffness coefficient on base of skirt of modified bucket foundation it would seem that a rigorous solution of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch subjected to the lateral load has not been presented it may be very difficult to obtain a rigorous solution of the response for the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under lateral load because the analytical procedure needs several complicated calculations therefore a less rigorous approach has been required to provide the solution of the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under lateral load for a hollow rigid cylindrical punch subjected to the lateral load h n as shown in fig 3 because it can be assumed that the shear stress takes the singularities at the edges of r a p and r a n on the surface of the half space the shear stress τ xz between a p r a n on z 0 may be assumed as follows 7 τ x z r 0 r h n a 2 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a p r a n where a 2 is an unknown function determined by the equilibrium condition of the lateral load and is given as follows 8 a 2 2 π a n e q therefore the lateral displacement u on the soil surface is written as 9 u a x 1 2 π g 0 2 π a p a n 1 r 1 ν r 2 sin 2 ϕ r 2 τ x z r 0 r d r d ϕ substituting eq 7 into eq 9 the lateral displacement u on the surface of the half space is written as follows 10 u a x h n 2 π 2 g a n e q a p a n b 1 r 2 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 d r where 11 b 1 1 a x r 2 ν a x 2 r 2 a x 2 k s ν a x r a x 2 e s because the lateral stiffness coefficient for the base of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch k hn is defined as k hn h n u a x it follows from eq 10 that 12 k h n 2 π 2 g a n e q a p a n b 1 r 2 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 d r 1 substituting a p 0 into eq 12 the lateral stiffness coefficient k hn for the base of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch is reduced to the rigorous value of that for the rigid circular base as will be shown in 2 9 2 3 rocking stiffness coefficient on base of skirt of modified bucket foundation it seems that a rigorous solution of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch subjected to the moment has not been proposed it may be not easy to present a rigorous solution of the response for the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under moment because the analytical procedure necessitates several complicated calculations therefore a less rigorous approach has been required to provide the solution of the hollow rigid cylindrical punch under moment for a hollow rigid cylindrical punch subjected to the moment m n about the y axis as shown in fig 3 because it can be assumed that the vertical stress takes the singularities at the edges of r a p and r a n on the surface of the half space the vertical stress σ z between a p r a n on z 0 may be assumed as follows 13 σ z r 0 r 2 cos ϕ m n a 3 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a p r a n where a 3 is an unknown function determined by the equilibrium condition of the moment and is given as follows 14 a 3 π a n 2 a n 2 a p 2 e q a p 2 k q 3 therefore the vertical displacement w on the soil surface is written as 15 w a x 1 ν 2 π g 0 2 π a p a n σ z r 0 r r d r d ϕ substituting eq 13 into eq 15 the vertical displacement w on the surface of the half space is written as follows 16 w a x 1 ν m n π g a x a 3 a p a n a x r 2 e s a x 2 r 2 k s r 2 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r

point a x it follows from eq 16 that 17 k r n π g a x 2 a 3 1 ν a p a n a x 2 r 2 k s a x r 2 e s r 2 r 2 a p 2 a n 2 r 2 1 2 a x r d r 1 substituting a p 0 into eq 17 the rocking stiffness coefficient k rn for the base of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch is reduced to the rigorous value of that for the rigid circular base as will be shown in 2 9 2 4 vertical stress of soil underneath base of modified bucket foundation subjected to self weight as a vertical load increases the ultimate lateral capacities of a bucket foundation in a cohesionless soil usually increase in order to investigate the effect of the vertical load including the self weight on the lateral capacity of a modified bucket foundation it is necessary to provide the vertical stress of a soil beneath the base of the modified bucket foundation the vertical stress affects the stress dependent modulus of elasticity for a sand using the mindlin 1936 solution in the case of a vertical point load the normal stress σ z of a soil in the z direction produced by a uniform vertical traction p z due to the self weight w mbe of the external compartment in the modified bucket foundation is expressed in the following form 18 σ z h 0 2 π a b o a l o i σ r d r d ϕ p z where 19 p z w m b e π a l o 2 a b o 2 and σ i is the influence factor for the vertical stress produced by a vertical point load and is given by the mindlin 1936 solution as follows 20 i σ 1 8 π 1 ν 1 2 ν z 1 d 1 3 3 z 1 3 d 1 5 2 ν 1 z 1 d 2 3 3 z 2 3 4 ν z 2 h c c 5 h d 2 5 30 h c z 2 3 d 2 7 where 21 z 1 h c z 2 h c r 2 x 2 y 2 d 1 2 r 2 z 1 2 d 2 2 r 2 z 2 2 where the depth coordinates h z and c l s for the present case the normal stress σ z of a soil in the z direction produced by a uniform vertical traction p z due to the self weight w mbi of the internal compartment in the modified bucket foundation can be obtained from the forms similar to eqs 18 21 2 5 lateral stiffness coefficient along skirt of modified bucket foundation hirai 2012 presented a lateral stiffness coefficient along a circular pile employing the mindlin 1936 solution for a lateral load by making reference to equations given by hirai the lateral displacement at a depth of the soil which is adjacent to a bucket foundation with the diameter d b subjected to the horizontal pressure p h along the bucket foundation may be written as follows 22 u u h d b i h h p h h e s h where u is the lateral displacement of the soil h is the depth coordinate of the point at which the lateral displacement is evaluated as presented by prasad and chari 1999 the lateral pressure between a skirt and soil caused by external loads on a bucket foundation can be assumed to be the compression on one side such that p p h cos2ψ 0 ψ π 4 and p h p h d b where p is the lateral pressure dependent on the angle ψ and no tension on the other side in this case the parameter i h h is written as follows 23 i h h 2 0 l 0 π 4 i p h cos 2 ψ d ψ d c where ph i is the influence factor for the lateral displacement due to a lateral point load ψ is the angle related to the bucket section as shown in fig 2 d and c is the depth coordinate of the point where the lateral pressure is applied and ph i is given by the mindlin solution as follows 24 i p h 1 ν 8 π 1 ν 3 4 ν d 1 1 d 2 x 2 d 1 3 3 4 ν x 2 d 2 3 2 c h d 2 3 1 3 x 2 d 2 2 4 1 ν 1 2 ν d 2 h c 1 x 2 d 2 d 2 h c where 25 z 1 h c z 2 h c d 1 2 r 2 z 1 2 d 2 2 r 2 z 2 2 r d b sin ψ for the winkler soil model of the subgrade reaction analysis the relationship between the lateral pressure p h and the lateral displacement u at the depth h in nonhomogeneous soils subjected to lateral loads is assumed to be related as follows 26 p h k h h u where k h h is the modulus of subgrade reaction and varies with depth h using eqs 22 and 26 the lateral stiffness coefficient k h h along the skirt of a bucket foundation is written as follows 27 k h h d b k h h e s h i h h for a modified bucket foundation with both the internal diameter d b and the external one d l the lateral stiffness coefficient can be obtained using the equations similar to eqs 22 27 the vertical horizontal and rotational stiffnesses of internal and external soil plugs are much less than those of a suction caisson therefore the internal and external soil plugs are ignored in analysis related to the stiffness 2 6 lateral displacement of modified bucket foundation a modified bucket foundation subjected to a lateral force p h at the depth h is usually assumed to be governed by the beam equation as follows 28 e b i b d 4 u h d h 4 k h h u h 0 where e b i b e p i p e s i s is a combined bending stiffness of the modified bucket foundation and a trapped soil in which e p is the elastic modulus of the modified bucket foundation and i p and i s are the moment of inertia of the modified bucket foundation and that of the trapped soil respectively u h is the horizontal displacement of the modified bucket foundation in the x direction at the depth h and the lateral force is determined as 29 p h k h h u h by extending the solution for a homogeneous soil given by chang 1937 to produce that for multilayered soils the solution presented by hetenyi 1946 leads to that of eq 28 in the following recurrence equation 30 u m 1 θ m 1 m p m 1 s p m 1 f 1 m f 2 m β m f 3 m e p i p β m 2 f 4 m e p i p β m 3 4 β m f 4 m f 1 m f 2 m e p i p β m f 3

bucket foundation in the mth element respectively f rk and f hk are the rocking and lateral influence factors on the base of the external compartment respectively and f rmb and f hmb are the rocking and lateral influence factors on the base of the internal compartment respectively hardin and drnevich 1972 presented the shear modulus to describe the strain dependence of soil behavior according to hardin and drnevich 1972 the lateral stiffness coefficient k hγ dependent on the shear strain γ zx can be assumed as follows 32 k h γ h k h h 1 2000 γ z x in the case of a nonlinear relationship between lateral displacement and lateral load of a bucket foundation in sand taking into account the lateral stiffness coefficient k hγ dependent on the shear strain γ zx the procedure for solving eq 30 can adopt those presented by poulos and davis 1980 and hirai 2016a for analysis of piles subjected to lateral soil movements by solving eq 30 where k h h is replaced with k hγ h the displacement may be determined by which the horizontal force may be evaluated from eq 29 this force may now be compared with the specified yield capacities p y p y d b and p y p y d l with a yield pressure p y along internal and external compartments respectively at an element where the calculated force p h exceeds the yield capacity p y it is assumed in post yield that the lateral stiffness coefficient of a soil along a foundation can be reduced to k h h 100000 according to the broms 1964 solution for a short pile in a cohesionless soil a yield pressure can be written as follows 33 p y h 3 k p σ z where k p is the coefficient of the rankine passive pressure defined as 1 sinφ 1 sinφ φ is an angle of internal friction for the soil and σ z is an effective vertical overburden pressure 2 7 base response let us consider the boundary condition on the base of the internal compartment of a modified bucket foundation in eq 30 it may be assumed that the base of the bucket foundation subjected to lateral loads such as shear and moment loads is represented as a hollow rigid cylindrical punch acting on the surface of a soil ignoring the skirt of the bucket foundation the surrounding soil depth and the trapped soil in the bucket foundation therefore using eqs 7 and 12 the relationship between the horizontal displacement u mb in the x direction and the horizontal base load s mb and that between the horizontal pressure p hmb and the horizontal base load s mb on the hollow rigid circular base in a nonhomogeneous soil are assumed as follows 34 u m b f h m b s m b p h m b r s m b π d b e

obtained by replacing the values relating to the element mb 1 on the base of the internal compartment with those relating to the element k 1 on the base of the external compartment 2 8 vertical and shear stresses of soil underneath base of modified bucket foundation subjected to vertical lateral and moment loads for the base of the internal compartment of a modified bucket foundation subjected to a vertical load including the self weight v mb lateral load s mb and moment load m mb assuming that no tension is permitted and there is compression alone for the vertical stress σ z on the base the maximum vertical stress σ zmax and the average shear stress τ zxavg of a soil underneath the base of the internal compartment are calculated as follows 38 σ z max x n g y v m b τ z x a v g s m b a

where iy is the moment of inertia of the effective area a and is given by the following equation 41 i y a x 2 d a the ultimate base resistance on the base of an internal compartment for the vertical

compartment for the shear stress τ zxu of a cohesionless soil can be evaluated as 45 τ z x u tan ϕ v n k a n k where a nk is the area of the base in the external compartment the lateral stiffness coefficient k hγ is assumed to obey eq 32 by solving eq 30 where k h h is replaced with k hγ h the displacement may be determined by which the vertical and shear stresses on the base of the internal compartment may be evaluated from eq 38 similarly the vertical and shear stresses on the base of the external compartment may be calculated these obtained quantities can now be compared with the specified ultimate values given by eqs 42 45 at an element where the calculated value exceeds an ultimate base resistance it is assumed that the lateral stiffness coefficient of a soil under the base of a foundation can be reduced to k h h 100000 2 9 vertical lateral and rocking stiffness coefficients of rigid circular base the stiffness coefficients wolf 1994 for several loading conditions have

the lateral behavior of a modified bucket foundation subjected to vertical lateral and moment loads it may be of interest to compare the results produced by the less rigorous method presented here with those obtained from the rigorous method proposed earlier fig 3 shows the relationships between the radius ratio a p a n and the normalized vertical horizontal and rocking stiffness coefficients of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch on the surface of a homogeneous soil in the case where a representative calculation coordinate is specified as a x a p a n 2 as the radius ratio a p a n increases the stiffness coefficients each decrease gradually and tend to decrease rapidly with approach to the radius ratio of 1 0 for the vertical stiffness coefficient the less rigorous solution is in good agreement with the rigorous solutions presented by veletsos and tang 1987 and hirai 2016b although the rigorous solutions of the horizontal and rocking stiffness coefficients have not been proposed these coefficients obtained from the less rigorous approach take the trends similar to the vertical stiffness coefficient the vertical and rocking stiffness coefficients are independent of poisson s ratio and the horizontal stiffness coefficient produced by the less rigorous approach is dependent on poisson s ratio li et al 2015 conducted experiments of modified bucket foundations in sand and presented the ultimate lateral and moment load capacities by using fea the dimensions and parameters of the modified bucket foundation used here are the same as those adopted by li et al the buoyant unit weight of steel is γsteel 68 kn m3 and the elastic modulus is e l 210 gpa the soil parameters for the sand are specified as follows the buoyant unit weight γ 10 2 kn m3 and poisson s ratio ν s 0

internal compartment under the external compartment in a modified bucket foundation the relative density and the stresses may be affected by installation process the increases of the relative density and the vertical stress due to the installation process are taken into account in determining the oedometric stiffness parameters and the internal friction angle of a soil the other parameters used here are the same as those presented by li et al 2015 the following analysis adopts twenty one elements to discretize a suction caisson as shown in figs 1 and 2 it has been assumed that the point where the load pile head displacement curve becomes straight or substantially straight is generally taken as the ultimate lateral load chari and meyerhof 1983 prasad and chari 1999 however it may be difficult to determine precisely an ultimate point showing the ultimate lateral load at the pile head because yield and failure of a soil occur both along the skirt and on the base of a bucket foundation with increase of the vertical lateral and moment loads and the global stiffness of the foundation decreases due to local yield and failure of the soil therefore it may be convenient to use the shear strain of a soil adjacent to the pile head as a measure of deformation which can be related with ultimate load capacities of a bucket foundation tokimatsu and yoshimi 1984 presented that the magnitude of the shear strain in a sand can be used as a parameter in ultimate criterion of the sand in liquefaction it may be reasonable to adopt the shear strain as a parameter in the ultimate capacity criterion of a soil architectural institute of japan 2001 a point in three dimensional space composed of the vertical horizontal and moment load components applied to a foundation can be designated as an ultimate state where the shear strain of a soil produced by the combined loads reaches a specified limiting value as mentioned above it may be difficult to determine an ultimate point from a load displacement curve this leads to the two cases to be considered one is a case where a point where the load displacement curve becomes straight or substantially straight is taken as an ultimate lateral load and it is assumed for this that the shear strain equals 0 02 another is a case with a point where a large value observed in the load displacement curve is taken as an ultimate lateral load and it is assumed for this that the shear strain is 0 04 a bucket foundation where the lateral and moment loads are applied may be treated as a rigid pile because the lateral displacement u of a pile element is assumed to be identical with that of the soil element adjacent to the pile element it can be postulated that the absolute value of the shear strain γ zxh du dz produced by the lateral pressure p h in the soil adjacent to the rigid pile is the same as that of the rotation angle θ du dz of the rigid pile because the horizontal and moment loads applied to a bucket foundation are usually much larger than the vertical load acting on the foundation the investigation for the effect of a vertical load except the self weight of a bucket foundation on ultimate load capacities will be out of consideration in what follows fig 4 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil as the moment load increases in the case of the ratio m hd b 2 5 the shear strain increases nonlinearly the lateral pressure calculated for the shear strain γzx 0 04 reaches a maximum value at a depth near z l 0 3 the results from the present method are in good agreement with the experimental data given by li et al 2015 overall fig 5 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil the moment capacity in the case of l s 0 03 m is greater than that in the case of no external skirt of l s 0 the lateral pressure takes a maximum value at a depth near z l 0 4 in the case of l s 0 03 m the results from the present method are similar to the experimental data overall fig 6 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil the moment capacity in the case of l s 0 09 m is greater than that in the case of l s 0 06 m the lateral pressure at a depth near z l 0 4 in the case of l s 0 09 m is less than that in the case of l s 0 06 m the results from the present method are similar to the experimental data overall fig 7 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a modified bucket foundation with a larger external diameter d l in a nonhomogeneous soil the moment capacity in the case of l s 0 03 m is greater than that in the case of no external skirt of l s 0 the distribution of the lateral pressure for l s 0 03 m is similar to that for l s 0 except a depth near z l 0 4 compared with the results shown in fig 5 the present case with a larger external diameter takes a greater moment capacity the results from the present method are similar to the experimental data overall fig 8 shows relationships between moment and shear strain and those between lateral pressure and depth for a modified bucket foundation with a larger external diameter d l in a nonhomogeneous soil the moment capacity in the case of l s 0 09 m is greater than that in the case of l s 0 06 m the lateral pressures in the cases of l s 0 06 and 0 09 m are a little different from those in the cases of l s 0 0 and 0 03 m shown in fig 7 compared with the results shown in fig 6 the present case with a larger external diameter takes a greater moment capacity the results from the present method are similar to the experimental data overall it is found from figs 4 8 that as the diameter and length of the external compartment increase the moment load capacity increases and the difference between the lateral pressures each is insignificant fig 9 shows relationships between ultimate lateral and moment load capacities for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil in the case where an ultimate shear strain takes an absolute value of 0 02 non dimensionalised ultimate capacities on an ultimate envelope are presented on the ultimate points p1 p9 as the horizontal load acting on the foundation and the moment applying in the direction different from the horizontal load increase the foundation exhibits a greater resistance poulos and davis 1980 obtained a solution of ultimate lateral capacities for horizontal and moment loadings for a rigid free head pile in a soil by considering equilibrium of horizontal forces and moments by using the strain hardening plasticity theory villalobos et al 2009 and ibsen et al 2014a b presented the relationships between the ultimate vertical lateral and moment load capacities the non dimensional ultimate envelopes predicted here are broadly similar to those obtained by poulos and davis 1980 villalobos et al 2009 and ibsen et al 2014a b fig 10 shows relationships between ultimate lateral and moment load capacities for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil in the case where an ultimate shear strain takes an absolute value of 0 02 non dimensionalised ultimate capacities on an ultimate envelope are presented on the ultimate points p1 p9 as the horizontal load acting on the foundation and the moment applying in the direction different from the horizontal load increase the foundation exhibits a greater resistance compared with the results shown in fig 9 a modified bucket foundation comprising a larger external diameter and a short skirt takes greater lateral and moment load capacities fig 11 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and lateral displacement for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil for the ultimate points p1 p5 shown in fig 9 the top and tip of a bucket foundation mean the depth z 0 and z l respectively as the absolute values of the moment loads for p1 2 4 5 and the lateral load for p3 increase the lateral displacements at top increase gradually and tend to increase rapidly near ultimate states at each tip the lateral displacements for p1 p3 and those for p4 and p5 decrease and increase respectively and that for p5 increases suddenly near an ultimate state fig 12 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and lateral displacement for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil for the ultimate points p6 p9 shown in fig 9 as the absolute values of the moment loads increase the lateral displacements at tip increase gradually and tend to increase rapidly near ultimate states at each top the lateral displacements decrease or increase according to the loading level and that for p6 tends to decrease suddenly near an ultimate state fig 13 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and shear strain for a bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil as the absolute values of the moment loads and the lateral load increase for p1 2 4 9 and p3 respectively the shear strains increase and decrease for p1 p5 and p6 p9 respectively the shear strain for p5 and that for p6 suddenly increases and decreases respectively near ultimate states fig 14 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and lateral displacement for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil for the ultimate points p1 p5 shown in fig 10 as the absolute values of the moment loads and the lateral load increase for p1 2 4 5 and p3 respectively the lateral displacements at top increase gradually and tend to increase rapidly near ultimate states at each tip the lateral displacements for p1 p3 and those for p4 and p5 decrease and increase respectively and those for p4 and p5 decrease suddenly near ultimate states fig 15 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and lateral displacement for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil for the ultimate points p6 p9 shown in fig 10 as the absolute values of the moment loads increase the lateral displacements at tip increase gradually and tend to increase rapidly near ultimate states at each top the lateral displacements decrease or increase according to the loading level and that for p6 tends to decrease suddenly near an ultimate state fig 16 shows relationships between lateral and moment loads and shear strain for a modified bucket foundation in a nonhomogeneous soil as the absolute values of the moment loads and the lateral load increase for p1 2 4 9 and p3 respectively the shear strains increase and decrease for p1 p5 and p6 p9 respectively the shear strain for p5 and that for p6 suddenly increases and decreases respectively near ultimate states it is found from the calculated results shown in figs 11 16 that it may be difficult to determine rigorously an ultimate point representing the ultimate lateral and moment loads of a modified bucket foundation the global stiffness of the modified bucket foundation decreases gradually due to the local lateral yield of a soil along both internal and external skirts and the local compressive and shear yields of the soil under both bases of internal and external compartments with increase of the lateral and moment loads this is the reason why the shear strain of a soil adjacent to a modified bucket foundation is adopted as a measure of deformation connected with ultimate load capacities of the modified bucket foundation fig 17 shows relationships between z l and the lateral pressure p for a bucket foundation in a sand for an ultimate state with an absolute value 0 02 of the shear strain γzx as the horizontal load acting on the foundation and the moment applying in the direction different from the horizontal load increase the lateral pressure along the depth tends to increase up to a limiting value p y 3k p σ z fig 18 shows relationships between z l and the displacement ratio u d b for bucket foundation in a sand for an ultimate state with an absolute value 0 02 of the shear strain γzx as the horizontal load acting on the foundation and the moment applying in the direction different from the horizontal load increase the lateral translation increases and the rocking motion takes the ultimate shear strain of 0 02 and that of 0 02 for p1 p5 and for p6 p9 respectively as shown in fig 13 fig 19 shows relationships between z l and the lateral pressure p for a modified bucket foundation in a sand for an ultimate state with an absolute value γzx 0 02 of the shear strain as the horizontal load acting on the foundation and the moment applying in the direction different from the horizontal load increase the lateral pressure along the depth tends to increase up to a limiting value p y 3k p σ z where because the self weight of the external compartment is taken into account in calculation of the effective vertical overburden pressure σ z the limiting value p y 3k p σ z of a modified bucket foundation is greater than that of a bucket foundation fig 20 shows relationships between z l and the displacement ratio u d b for a modified bucket foundation in a sand for an ultimate state with an absolute value γzx 0 02 of the shear strain as the horizontal load acting on the foundation and the moment applying in the direction different from the horizontal load increase the lateral translation increases and the rocking motion takes the ultimate shear strain of 0 02 and that of 0 02 for p1 p5 and for p6 p9 respectively as shown in fig 16 4 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn from the present investigation 1 the lateral stiffness coefficient along the skirt of a modified bucket foundation in nonhomogeneous soils employing the mindlin solution for a lateral load is presented 2 the relationship between horizontal displacement rotation moment and shear force of the modified bucket foundation subjected to lateral and moment loads in nonhomogeneous soils is obtainable in the form of the recurrence equation 3 the vertical lateral and rocking stiffness coefficients on the base of the modified bucket foundation are presented considering the solutions of a hollow rigid cylindrical punch acting on the surface of a soil and the equivalent elastic modulus in the equivalent elastic method 4 the vertical stress of a soil underneath the base of the modified bucket foundation subjected to vertical and moment loads is presented considering only compression and permitting no tension on the base 5 for the relationships between ultimate lateral and moment load capacities and the aspect ratios internal and external skirt lengths to diameter the comparison of results calculated by the present method for modified bucket foundations in sand has shown good agreement with those obtained from experiments 6 an ultimate envelope of the combined ultimate horizontal and moment load capacities of modified bucket foundations in sand is presented and the ultimate envelope is broadly similar to those obtained from the literatures 7 the deformation of sand is investigated up to failure specified with an ultimate shear strain produced by applied loads behavior of sand up to failure is clarified from the relationship between lateral loads strain and displacement and that between depth and lateral pressure 
23717,added resistance in short and long regular head waves for four different ship types was systematically and extensively investigated using reynold averaged navier stokes solvers computations which included ship motions and added resistance were validated against scale model test measurements effects of ship speed skin friction wave steepness ship type as well as wave radiation and wave diffraction on added resistance were analyzed keywords added resistance in waves ship motions computational fluid dynamics physical tests wave steepness added friction resistance in waves ship types 1 introduction the installed power of a ship is usually defined by the contractual agreed design speed the design speed needs to be proven by the shipyard during sea trials the environmental conditions contractually specified for these sea trials usually represent nearly ideal fair weather conditions the prevailing wind speed does not exceed two on the beaufort scale and the significant wave height of the seaway is stipulated at less than 0 5 m the disadvantage of this approach is that a ship is optimized for conditions it may hardly ever experience and the so called sea margin is generally considered to be independent of ship size or type this may lead to both underpowered smaller and overpowered larger ships operating in the same sea areas due to size dependent ship responses increasing operational costs and business competition led ship operators to critically scrutinize the fuel consumption of their fleet and consequently ships are requested to be designed and optimized for operational conditions therefore it stands to reason to challenge and possibly adapt current design procedures to optimize ships for near service operational conditions thus prediction of the added resistance of ships in waves is of high practical interest naturally therefore a considerable amount of research effort has been devoted to this problem the techniques used to predict added resistance can be classified in two main categories namely far field methods based on considering the diffracted and radiated wave energy and momentum flux at infinity and near field methods based on direct integration of the steady second order hydrodynamic pressure acting on the wetted ship surface maruo 1957 introduced the first far field approach which was later extended by maruo 1960 1963 and joosen 1966 boese 1970 developed the first near field direct pressure integration method albeit by considering a highly simplified pressure distribution gerritsma and beukelman 1972 introduced the radiated energy approach which basically followed maruo s far field approach evaluating the above approaches ström tejsen et al 1973 found large discrepancies between the numerical results and comparative model test measurements using ship motions obtained from the strip theory of salvesen et al 1970 salvesen 1978 obtained satisfactory predictions by applying gerritsma and beukelman s method thereby confirming the importance of accurate ship motion predictions to reliably estimate added resistance in waves by introducing a simplified added resistance formula to model the complicated interaction of diffracted waves and the steady flow around the ship faltinsen et al 1980 presented a more accurate potential theory near field direct pressure integration approach in this way they validated their results even for short waves recently liu et al 2011 used a well established frequency domain panel method and a new hybrid time domain rankine source green function method to predict the added resistance in waves by obtaining first order velocity potentials and kochin functions terms necessary to compute added resistance according to maruo s far field method they used a wide range of case studies to validate their results and concluded that their method is satisfactory to predict added resistance of ships in waves the recently developed three dimensional rankine panel method accounts for the interaction of the linear periodic wave induced flow with the nonlinear steady flow caused by the ship s forward speed in calm water taking into account nonlinear free surface conditions and dynamic squat söding et al 2012 in this method added resistance in waves is obtained by pressure integration kashiwagi et al 2010 also investigated the prediction accuracy of added resistance in short waves when forward speed is present and attributed inaccuracies to hydrodynamic nonlinear effects added resistance in waves was investigated by many researchers using potential theory kim and kim 2011 kim et al 2012 lyu and el moctar 2017 duan and li 2013 guo and steen 2011 kuroda et al 2008 seo et al 2013 2014 sportelli and huijsmans 2012 turnock et al 2014 and söding et al 2014 while boundary element methods based on rankine sources are efficient and therefore predominantly used to screen relevant wave scenarios for design issues computational fluid dynamics cfd methods based on the numerical solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans or euler equations are increasingly applied to account for nonlinearities braking waves etc they demonstrated their ability to provide results of comparable accuracy to model test measurements in many problems of ship hydrodynamics larsson et al 2010 oberhagemann et al 2012 el moctar 2001 el moctar et al 2011 2016a schellin and el moctar 2007 carrica et al 2011 however their applications to added resistance predictions are still rare although such methods might in principle directly address also the problem of power increase in irregular waves both long waves and the correspondingly large ship motions and short waves which contribute to the added resistance through diffraction should be resolved simultaneously which increases significantly the required grid size and computational time therefore the application of cfd methods to the added resistance problem has been limited so far mainly to regular wave situations in a restricted range of wave frequencies el moctar et al 2016b ley et al 2014 sadat hosseini et al 2013 simonsen et al 2013 the present investigation employed rans based field methods to systematically investigate added resistance in short and long regular head waves for four selected ship types namely a medium size cruise ship a post panamax containership a tanker and a wigley hull computations which included ship motions were validated against scale model test measurements particular emphasis was placed on the following research questions how accurate and reliable are reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers to predict wave added resistance and how are the results influenced by discretization errors how does ship speed influence the added resistance in waves how does friction affect the added resistance in waves how does the radiation and diffraction problem interact in a nonlinear regime can they be considered separately how do wave height and wave steepness affect the added resistance in waves and does the assumption of the quadratic dependence on wave amplitude also hold in steep waves 2 numerical method we document only a brief overview of the numerical methods used a detailed description can be found in ferziger and peric 2002 and muzaferija and peric 1999 the in house modified interdymfoam openfoam 2011 2016 and the comet cd adapco 2011 reynolds averaged navier stockes rans solvers were employed to compute the flow surrounding the subject ships in calm water and in waves both solvers use the finite volume method fvm to solve the conservation equations the solution domain is divided into control volumes cv for which the rans equations are solved in integral form for an incompressible isothermal and viscous

discretizes time derivatives using constant time steps specifically the implicit three time level in comet and the crank nicholson method in openfoam ferziger and peric 2002 to obtain a dedicated pressure equation the mass equation is converted into a poisson equation used for pressure correction of the velocity field the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm implemented in comet provides an implicit coupling between pressure and velocity ferziger and peric 2002 at each time step outer iterations correct pressures and velocities iteratively software openfoam employs the pimple algorithm combination piso simple openfoam 2016 to simulate a floating body at a free water surface a two phase flow needs to be modeled the solvers use the interface capturing volume of fluid vof technique which has proven to be suitable for handling complex free surface phenomena muzaferija and peric 1999 it introduces an additional transport equation to compute the spatial distribution of scalar volume fraction α in the fluid domain fraction α describes the fluid properties specifically effective density and viscosity in each control volume the effective fluid density ρ e f f is defined as follows 4 ρ e f f α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r where ρ w a t e r and ρ a i r are the densities of water and air respectively viscosity is computed in the same manner

solver coupled implicitly with rans equations brunswig and el moctar 2004 el moctar et al 2017 accordingly a mesh morphing algorithm deforms the numerical grid to move ships in the computational domain oberhagemann and el moctar 2007 the two equation k ε and k ω s s t turbulence models are used to close the system of equations menter 1994 for the turbulent boundary layer shear stresses on the hull are determined using logarithmic wall functions 3 selected test cases to cover a wide range of practical needs we investigated the phenomenon of wave added resistance for a wide range of conventional ship types as well as for a well known test case fig 1 specifically our studies were performed for a modern medium size cruise ship ley et al 2014 valanto and hong 2015 a post panamax 14000 teu containership referred to as the duisburg test case dtc el moctar et al 2010 el moctar et al 2016b sprenger et al 2016 the medium size moeri tanker kvlcc2 simman 2008 and the well known wigley hull journée 2003 fig 1 shows their hull shapes beside the ship length the block coefficient varied significantly as it may have a significant influence on wave added resistance extensive model tests in calm water and in waves were performed for all test cases the hamburg ship model basin hsva valanto and hong 2015 performed model test for the cruise ship the norwegian marine technology research institute marintek sprenger et al 2016 and the sva potsdam nietzschmann 2010 for the containership the maritime ocean engineering research institute moeri for the tanker and the technical university delft for the wigley hull table 1 summarizes main particulars of the four ships and table 2 the associated tests conditions the physical models of the cruise ship and the containership were moored with soft springs in a diamond shaped or rectangular frame respectively which was towed at constant speed these setups schematically shown in fig 2 held the models captive and allowed them to move in surge heave and pitch transducers attached to the springs measured towing forces the tanker kvlcc2 and the wigley hull were free to heave and pitch all other degrees of freedom were suppressed 4 computational procedure determining the wave added resistance r a w of a ship comprises three steps first the calm water resistance r t for each specific ship speed is computed second the averaged longitudinal force in waves f x is determined the ships were free to heave and pitch all other degrees of freedom were suppressed third the wave added resistance is calculated by subtracting the calm water resistance from the time averaged longitudinal force in waves these steps always performed in the same way determine the frictional part of added resistance for this procedure it is essential to use the same numerical grids and test setups for all computations in calm water as well as in waves to minimize possible errors caused by spatial and temporal discretization model test scale effects and iterative computational techniques the typical sample time history of computed longitudinal force presented in fig 3 was performed for model scale conditions on a numerical grid consisting of 3 2 10 6 control volumes and it relied on a time step of 0 005s whereby the courant number on average was less than 0 5 in this fig the oscillating solid line identifies the total longitudinal force the dashed line the calm water longitudinal force and the dash dotted line the time averaged longitudinal force the difference between dashed and dash dotted line is equal to the added resistance in waves here the tested ship was the wigley hull advancing at constant forward speed corresponding to a froude number of f n 0 3 in regular 0 06 m high head waves corresponding to a wave length ratio of λ w l 1 9 where λ w is wave length and l is ship length between perpendiculars the time averaged longitudinal force in waves as well as the ship motion amplitudes were obtained by performing a fourier

rather than target values therefore amplitudes of undisturbed waves next to a ship s bow were monitored in all simulations the calm water resistance coefficient c t reads as follows 8 c t r t 0 5 ρ v 2 s w where r t is calm water resistance ρ is water density v is ship speed and s w is wetted hull surface as model tests are not suited to predict the frictional resistance component for ships it is common practice to rely on the ittc 57 guidelines hadler 1958 ittc 2008 to specify a ships frictional resistance coefficient as follows 9 c f 0 075 log r e 2 2 with the reynolds number r e v l ν ν being kinematic viscosity of water and l ship length between perpendiculars frictional resistance r f then reads as follows 10 r f c f 0 5 ρ v 2 s w response amplitude operators are plotted against the dimensionless wave frequency ω defined as follows 11 ω l λ w computations were performed on unstructured grids consisting of hexahedral control volumes dimensions of the computational domain were orientated to the length of the ship models the inlet boundary was located at least one model length ahead of the models forward perpendicular to reduce the free running length of incident waves the outlet boundary at least three model lengths behind the models aft perpendicular to avoid wave reflection the side boundaries two and a half model lengths to port and starboard of the models central symmetry plane the bottom at two model lengths below the calm water surface and the top at one model length above the calm water surface to illustrate fig 4 shows the computational fluid domain for the cruise ship to accurately resolve the wave pattern and the incident wave field grids were locally refined in the vicinity of the free surface and in areas surrounding the hull to dampen incident and hull induced waves the control volumes were smoothly stretched towards the outlet boundaries to properly account for the boundary layer on the hull surface prism layers were included and wall functions applied the grids used comprised between 1 6 10 6 and 20 0 10 6 control volumes for the entire flow domain at inlet boundaries velocities volume fractions turbulent kinetic energies and dissipation rates were specified the hull surface was defined as no slip walls at outlet and top boundaries hydrostatic boundary conditions were specified the origin of the inertial frames was located on the ships base line at their aft perpendiculars the origin of the ship fixed reference frames was situated at the ships center of gravity fig 5 shows wave patterns in calm water left and in incoming waves right for the containership computed on the same numerical grid obviously the ship induced wave pattern is more pronounced in waves furthermore waves were damped behind the model to avoid wave reflection to reduce uncertainties related to discretization errors all computations were performed on the same grid using the same numerical setup in short waves numerical damping made it impossible to attain the specified wave amplitude however in waves longer than 0 6 times ship length λ w l 0 6 deviations between target and actual wave amplitude were nearly zero percent therefore actually computed wave amplitudes of undisturbed waves next to a ship s bow were monitored in all simulations and these amplitudes were used for normalization rather than as target values fig 6 exemplarily depicts target and actual wave amplitudes for the wave length λ w l 0 3 for the tanker in wave lengths up to λ w l 0 6 table 3 lists the percentage deviations of actual wave amplitudes from their target values deviations in longer waves were negligibly small 5 discretization errors to investigate the influence of spatial and temporal discretization on wave added resistance grid studies for all ships were performed advancing in calm water as well as in waves hereto grids were refined systematically by multiplying the grids base size in all directions by a factor of about 1 7 then for each ship a coarse a medium and a fine grid comprising 1 6 10 6 to 7 5 10 6 control volumes extending over both port and starboard sides were generated for the containership additional computations were conducted on a very fine grid comprising 20 10 6 control volumes to minimize the influence of turbulence modeling and wall functions the non dimensional wall distance y on hulls wetted surfaces was kept constant for all grids at a mean value of approximately 80 fig 7 depicts this situation for the containership at f n 0 20 for the containership and the cruise ship fig 8 plots computed total and frictional calm water resistance coefficients c t and c f versus the total numbers of control volumes frictional resistance coefficients remain nearly constant whereas total resistance coefficients decrease with increasing number of control volumes the reason for this is numerical diffusion which influenced the viscous pressure resistance and decreased on finer grids fig 9 plots the computed wave added resistance coefficients c a w obtained on different sized grids versus wave length to ship length ratio λ w l as well as normalized wave frequency l λ w 1 2 the coarse grid comprised about 1 6 10 6 control volumes the medium grid about 3 2 10 6 control volumes the fine grid about 7 5 10 6 control volumes depending on a grid s spatial discretization waves were damped especially the short waves to account for this damping we performed computations using the computed instead of the target wave height the relatively small deviations between coefficients computed on different sized grids led us to conclude that the spatial discretization did not significantly influence the normalized added resistance coefficient as long as the actual computed wave height was used for normalization part of this study was recently published by sigmund and el moctar 2017 6 results all computations were performed at model scale on the medium sized numerical grid which comprised about 3 2 million control volumes the time step in computations corresponded to an average courant number of 0 5 table 4 summarizes the resulting calm water resistance expressed in its normalized form as coefficient c t obtained from computations and experimental measurements for the four ship types advancing at constant forward speeds this table also lists the associated froude number f n as well as the percentage deviation between computed and measured values these deviations are less than five percent i e they are small and therefore deemed sufficiently accurate to carry on with our computations of the wave added resistance fig 10 presents time histories of computed and experimentally measured heave and pitch motions for the containership in regular head waves the solid line identifies computed motions the dotted line experimentally measured motions these motions are nearly harmonic and generally their amplitudes and phase angles compare favorably to measurements the deviation between computed and measured amplitudes is less than 2 although not shown here the corresponding time histories for the other three ships were similar however in the shortest waves measured motions for these other ship typed were not always harmonic figs 11 13 presents time histories and mean values of computed longitudinal force f x for the four investigated ships advancing at constant forward speed in calm water as well as in short intermediately long and long regular head waves directly above each individual graph are listed the associated wave length to ship length ratio λ w l the froude number f n and the wave height h w a dashed line identifies the force in calm water a solid fluctuating line the total longitudinal force in waves and a dash dotted line the mean force in waves the difference between dashed and dash dotted lines defines the wave added resistance this difference is largest in fig 12 for all ships that is the non dimensional wave added resistance attains its maximum as expected in waves of length equal to ship length i e when λ w l is unity this is so because at this wave length radiated waves contribute most to the added resistance at this wave length and the relative motion between hull and water surface is largest it is seen that in short waves nonlinearities of longitudinal force for the cruise ship and the containership are especially pronounced see figs 11 and 12 it is these ships that are characterized by higher bow flare angles for the tanker in short waves low oscillation frequencies are superposed on the encounter frequencies the mean values were calculated considering these low oscillation frequencies 6 1 effects of heave and pitch motions on added resistance in waves the added resistance in moderate long waves is dominated by radiation hence accurate prediction of motions was required the comparative response amplitude operators of heave left and pitch right motions shown in fig 14 demonstrate the generally fair agreement between computations and measurements the maximum value of the response operator is slightly shifted towards longer waves for the blunt ship i e the tanker computed heave motions in the range of wave length λ w l 0 9 deviate noticeably from measured motion responses of the cruise ship we then computed heave and pitch motions using a rankine source boundary element method bem soeding et al 2014 lyu and el moctar 2017 bem and rans show similar tendency see fig 14 top the unexpected deviations between computed and measured heave motions in the range of the above mentioned wave length cannot be explained and might be due to uncertainties related to the measured heave motions not only the motion amplitudes but also their phase angles between incident head waves and the particular motions influenced the wave induced added resistance kashiwagi et al 2010 fig 15 plots these phase angles against wave parameters ω and λ w l for the tanker experimental measurements were available for comparison for the containership and the cruise ship computed results obtained from a boundary element method lyu and el moctar 2017 or from rans simulations generally measurements and computed results correlate favorably as expected in short waves the phase angle between wave and heave motion is nearly zero in long waves λ w l 2 this phase angle is close to 90deg in the range of waves where the added resistance attains peak values λ w l 1 phase angles notably are around 50deg the only exception is the phase angle of the tanker s heave motion here relative motions between the ship s bow and the wave elevation were largest this caused pressures acting at the ship s bow to increase thereby leading to a distinctly higher added resistance thus in the vicinity of peak values of the added resistance a distinct correlation existed between phase angle and wave induced added resistance in short waves λ w l 0 6 it was impossible to identify clear trends for none of the ships although some of these phase angles were large the associated motion amplitudes were small the comparable normalized quadratic response amplitude operators of the added resistance in regular head waves shown in fig 16 as plots of the added resistance coefficients c a w demonstrate here also the generally favorable agreement between computations and measurements nonlinear effects in short λ w l 0 3 and steep waves are seen to be more pronounced and often these waves are not harmonic computational techniques that account for these nonlinear effects are important for an accurate prognosis boundary element methods are efficient and offer a good compromise between accuracy and computer time however they may be unable to represent entirely these nonlinear phenomena in short waves the agreement between computations and measurements is especially favorable here wave diffraction dominates and the wave radiation part of the added resistance is nearly negligibly small the increase of the normalized added resistance in shorter waves is well predicted by the computations as mentioned above the added resistance in short waves is of practical relevance for larger longer ships because large ships operate under such conditions most of the time however it is appropriate to point out that in very short waves e g λ w l 0 2 and less the absolute value of the added resistance is relatively small compared to for example the calm water resistance all added resistance coefficients show a significant peak in the range of wave length equal to ship length here ship motions and consequently radiation forces are highest in the range of peak values for the cruise ship the added resistance coefficient is slightly overestimated this is due to the relatively larger deviations between computed and measured ship motions see fig 14 at wave frequencies where radiation is dominant fig 17 compares the added resistance coefficients of the four investigated ship types at similar froude numbers for the two slender ships cruise ship and containership the added resistance in short waves is similar for the tanker characterized by a relatively large block coefficient the added resistance coefficient increases in shorter waves and its peak value shifts towards longer waves 6 2 effects of ship speed on added resistance in waves to investigate effects of ship speed on the wave added resistance heave and pitch motion and wave added resistance were computed at various forward speeds albeit only for the cruise ship and the containership for the cruise ship computations were performed at full scale speeds of 15 and 21 kts corresponding to froude numbers of 0 16 and 0 22 respectively for the containership at 6 and 16 kts corresponding to froude number of 0 05 and 0 14 respectively the comparative response amplitude operators of heave left and pitch right motions shown in fig 18 demonstrate the generally fair agreement between computations and measurements it is seen that pitch motions are nearly unaffected by ship speed in contrast with heave motions in the range of wave length equal to ship length this is not the case in this range of wave lengths heave motions are distinctly less at slower ship speeds this is reflected by the associated added resistance coefficients for these two ships presented in fig 19 as expected at slower ship speeds the added resistance in waves is less this effect is more pronounced at peak values of the added resistance coefficient and in long waves where radiation is dominant in short waves where diffraction is dominant the effect of ship speed on the added resistance is moderate 6 3 effects of viscosity on added resistance in waves it is assumed that the wave added resistance is driven by pressure forces and hence can be extrapolated using froude similarity söding 1982 traditional methods such as physical tests and potential theory based methods cannot be used to investigate viscous effects in the present work the frictional added resistance was determined by subtracting the calm water friction force from the mean friction force in waves fig 20 shows computed and measured total added resistance together with the computed frictional component of the added resistance including its percentage of the total added resistance for all investigated ships the non dimensional added frictional resistance increases with decreasing short wave lengths it can be seen that especially in short waves viscous effects on added resistance are significant for all ships at their peaks the frictional part contributes about 5 to total the added resistance in waves in short waves e g λ w l 0 2 the frictional part may exceed 20 of the total value to better understand these results computed representative shear stress distributions on the hulls of the containership and tanker advancing at constant forward speed in calm water and in waves are shown in fig 21 the orbital velocities in waves caused the molecular and turbulent shear stresses to increase and led to higher frictional forces acting on the wetted hulls high shear stresses marked by dark areas in fig 21 are noticeable underneath the wave crests beyond that the viscous pressure distribution in waves may contribute however we did not investigate this phenomenon because it was impossible to readily separate viscous and wave induced pressures as mentioned above all computations so far were performed at model scale however viscous effects depend strongly on reynolds number therefore we performed computations in short waves for the cruise ship based on reynolds numbers corresponding to full scale conditions and also selected a mean dimensionless wall distance of y 1000 for these computations fig 22 shows measured and computed coefficients of the total and frictional added resistance at model scale ms and full scale fs of the containership at f n 0 14 in regular head waves as expected the added frictional resistance is smaller at full scale than at model scale its contribution is roughly half that at model scale consequently the frictional component of the added resistance is overestimated when predictions are based on computations at model scale nevertheless this component is still significant and should not be neglected at this stage let us point out that in short waves the total amount of added resistance is relatively small in some instances it only amounts to a few percent of calm water resistance for a ship at service speed that is in waves the viscous part of the added resistance may note contribute substantially in the total resistance calm water and added resistance in waves nevertheless these viscous effects may still be useful e g to correct the more efficient potential theory based added resistance predictions 6 4 effects of wave steepness on added resistance in waves until now we assumed that the added resistance in waves depends quadratically on wave height söding 1982 however ships operate in waves of variable steepness thus the question arose in what way this assumption is valid to resolve this issue we computed the added resistance in waves for the containership and the tanker in waves of different steepness here defined as wave height divided by wave length for these two ships advancing in head waves of different steepness fig 23 plots our results together with experimental measurements in terms of added resistance coefficients plotted against wave length and normalized wave frequency for the cases investigated a distinct dependence of added resistance on wave steepness can be observed at their peaks added resistance coefficients decrease with increasing wave steepness in this range of wave lengths radiation is dominant and nonlinear effects are moderate in short waves nonlinear effects are important and diffraction is dominant the distinct influence of wave steepness on the added resistance coefficient becomes noticeable in wave lengths that are shorter than one half ship length λ w l 0 5 that is as waves get shorter the influence of wave steepness increases the slope of the added resistance coefficient as wave frequency increases gets distinctly larger with greater wave steepness the influence of wave steepness on added resistance is more pronounced for the full bodied tanker than for the relatively slender containership in wave lengths of λ w l 0 28 increasing the wave steepness from 2 1 to 3 5 causes a 35 2 increase of the added resistance coefficient for the containership in waves of this same length e g when λ w l 0 28 increasing the wave steepness from 0 6 to 1 9 causes a 201 increase of the added resistance coefficient for the tanker an experimental study performed by yasukawa et al 2016 shows similar trends most of the literature dealing with computational and experimental investigations of added resistance does not specify wave steepness and one aim of ours was to demonstrate its importance in this regard a comparison between computations and experimental measurements of added resistance especially for ships advancing in short waves is meaningful only for waves of the same wave steepness 6 5 interaction between radiation and diffraction forces often potential flow methods separate wave induced forces into radiation and diffraction this simplifies the solution and is expedient for linear problems regarding added resistance in waves here we investigated the interaction between radiation and diffraction to quantify these interactions we determined diffraction and radiation forces separately for the four investigated ship types to this end we performed three different computations first we computed total added resistance in waves second we determined added resistance of the fixed ships advancing with constant forward speed in incoming head waves diffraction third we obtained added resistance of the moving ships advancing in calm water by prescribing the computed motions obtained in the first step radiation fig 24 plots computed and measured total resistance as well as the associated computed radiation and diffraction forces against wave length to ship length ratios as well as against normalized wave frequencies although interaction between radiation and diffraction is more pronounced in long waves it vanished almost completely in short waves as was expected in long waves e g when λ w l 1 the radiation part of added resistance becomes significant and the diffraction part is only moderately influenced by waves nevertheless interaction between radiation and diffraction was important in short waves e g when λ w l 0 50 radiation forces are nearly zero and diffraction forces depend only moderately on wave frequency thus in short waves diffraction forces match total added resistance consequently the radiation part of the added resistance coefficients display a significant peak in the range of large motion response e g when λ w l these findings were found to be valid for all ships at all froude numbers the interaction between radiation and diffraction was addressed and discussed by kashiwagi et al 2010 7 conclusions predicting wave added resistance of ships remains challenging nevertheless the practical relevance of this subject motivated systematic investigations in the use of advanced numerical methods to analyze added resistance of ships in waves initially we investigated dicretization errors then based on the outcome we identified spatial and time dependent discretizations suitable for simulations furthermore we introduced appropriate numerical methods to predict the added resistance in waves two findings were important on the one hand computations of calm water resistance as well as added resistance in waves should be carried out on the same numerical grid on the other hand the added resistance should be normalized always against the actual wave amplitude not the targeted wave amplitude ship motions and the added resistance in waves were computed for the four ship types and compared to experimental model test measurements generally computations and measurements correlated favorably this was also so for added resistances in short and long waves thereby demonstrating that the methods based on solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations were capable of predicting reliable wave induced first and higher order responses such as ship motions and added resistance in waves respectively results showed that radiation forces were affected more strongly by ship speed than diffraction forces thus peaks of added resistance coefficients were less pronounced at lower ship speeds by subtracting frictional resistance in calm water from frictional resistance in waves the frictional added resistance was determined computations showed that in short waves friction accounted for a significant part of the total added resistance namely of 20 or even more however full scale computations showed that this effect was less pronounced at full scale diffraction and radiation forces at different frequencies were investigated whereby diffraction forces were obtained by restraining the ship in waves and the radiation forces by prescribing the motions of the ship in calm water in long waves the sum of diffraction and radiation forces did not match the total resistance i e the interaction of these two force components had to be accounted for in short waves the diffraction part of total resistance was dominant as almost no ship motions were induced generally the assumption of a quadratic correlation between wave height and added resistance was confirmed for ships advancing in waves of moderate to long wave lengths however this assumption did not hold for ships advancing in short waves because in short waves diffraction was dominant acknowledgments the research was supported by the german federal ministry of economic affairs under contract 03sx339b and energy and by the european union under

23717,added resistance in short and long regular head waves for four different ship types was systematically and extensively investigated using reynold averaged navier stokes solvers computations which included ship motions and added resistance were validated against scale model test measurements effects of ship speed skin friction wave steepness ship type as well as wave radiation and wave diffraction on added resistance were analyzed keywords added resistance in waves ship motions computational fluid dynamics physical tests wave steepness added friction resistance in waves ship types 1 introduction the installed power of a ship is usually defined by the contractual agreed design speed the design speed needs to be proven by the shipyard during sea trials the environmental conditions contractually specified for these sea trials usually represent nearly ideal fair weather conditions the prevailing wind speed does not exceed two on the beaufort scale and the significant wave height of the seaway is stipulated at less than 0 5 m the disadvantage of this approach is that a ship is optimized for conditions it may hardly ever experience and the so called sea margin is generally considered to be independent of ship size or type this may lead to both underpowered smaller and overpowered larger ships operating in the same sea areas due to size dependent ship responses increasing operational costs and business competition led ship operators to critically scrutinize the fuel consumption of their fleet and consequently ships are requested to be designed and optimized for operational conditions therefore it stands to reason to challenge and possibly adapt current design procedures to optimize ships for near service operational conditions thus prediction of the added resistance of ships in waves is of high practical interest naturally therefore a considerable amount of research effort has been devoted to this problem the techniques used to predict added resistance can be classified in two main categories namely far field methods based on considering the diffracted and radiated wave energy and momentum flux at infinity and near field methods based on direct integration of the steady second order hydrodynamic pressure acting on the wetted ship surface maruo 1957 introduced the first far field approach which was later extended by maruo 1960 1963 and joosen 1966 boese 1970 developed the first near field direct pressure integration method albeit by considering a highly simplified pressure distribution gerritsma and beukelman 1972 introduced the radiated energy approach which basically followed maruo s far field approach evaluating the above approaches ström tejsen et al 1973 found large discrepancies between the numerical results and comparative model test measurements using ship motions obtained from the strip theory of salvesen et al 1970 salvesen 1978 obtained satisfactory predictions by applying gerritsma and beukelman s method thereby confirming the importance of accurate ship motion predictions to reliably estimate added resistance in waves by introducing a simplified added resistance formula to model the complicated interaction of diffracted waves and the steady flow around the ship faltinsen et al 1980 presented a more accurate potential theory near field direct pressure integration approach in this way they validated their results even for short waves recently liu et al 2011 used a well established frequency domain panel method and a new hybrid time domain rankine source green function method to predict the added resistance in waves by obtaining first order velocity potentials and kochin functions terms necessary to compute added resistance according to maruo s far field method they used a wide range of case studies to validate their results and concluded that their method is satisfactory to predict added resistance of ships in waves the recently developed three dimensional rankine panel method accounts for the interaction of the linear periodic wave induced flow with the nonlinear steady flow caused by the ship s forward speed in calm water taking into account nonlinear free surface conditions and dynamic squat söding et al 2012 in this method added resistance in waves is obtained by pressure integration kashiwagi et al 2010 also investigated the prediction accuracy of added resistance in short waves when forward speed is present and attributed inaccuracies to hydrodynamic nonlinear effects added resistance in waves was investigated by many researchers using potential theory kim and kim 2011 kim et al 2012 lyu and el moctar 2017 duan and li 2013 guo and steen 2011 kuroda et al 2008 seo et al 2013 2014 sportelli and huijsmans 2012 turnock et al 2014 and söding et al 2014 while boundary element methods based on rankine sources are efficient and therefore predominantly used to screen relevant wave scenarios for design issues computational fluid dynamics cfd methods based on the numerical solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans or euler equations are increasingly applied to account for nonlinearities braking waves etc they demonstrated their ability to provide results of comparable accuracy to model test measurements in many problems of ship hydrodynamics larsson et al 2010 oberhagemann et al 2012 el moctar 2001 el moctar et al 2011 2016a schellin and el moctar 2007 carrica et al 2011 however their applications to added resistance predictions are still rare although such methods might in principle directly address also the problem of power increase in irregular waves both long waves and the correspondingly large ship motions and short waves which contribute to the added resistance through diffraction should be resolved simultaneously which increases significantly the required grid size and computational time therefore the application of cfd methods to the added resistance problem has been limited so far mainly to regular wave situations in a restricted range of wave frequencies el moctar et al 2016b ley et al 2014 sadat hosseini et al 2013 simonsen et al 2013 the present investigation employed rans based field methods to systematically investigate added resistance in short and long regular head waves for four selected ship types namely a medium size cruise ship a post panamax containership a tanker and a wigley hull computations which included ship motions were validated against scale model test measurements particular emphasis was placed on the following research questions how accurate and reliable are reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solvers to predict wave added resistance and how are the results influenced by discretization errors how does ship speed influence the added resistance in waves how does friction affect the added resistance in waves how does the radiation and diffraction problem interact in a nonlinear regime can they be considered separately how do wave height and wave steepness affect the added resistance in waves and does the assumption of the quadratic dependence on wave amplitude also hold in steep waves 2 numerical method we document only a brief overview of the numerical methods used a detailed description can be found in ferziger and peric 2002 and muzaferija and peric 1999 the in house modified interdymfoam openfoam 2011 2016 and the comet cd adapco 2011 reynolds averaged navier stockes rans solvers were employed to compute the flow surrounding the subject ships in calm water and in waves both solvers use the finite volume method fvm to solve the conservation equations the solution domain is divided into control volumes cv for which the rans equations are solved in integral form for an incompressible isothermal and viscous

openfoam employs the pimple algorithm combination piso simple openfoam 2016 to simulate a floating body at a free water surface a two phase flow needs to be modeled the solvers use the interface capturing volume of fluid vof technique which has proven to be suitable for handling complex free surface phenomena muzaferija and peric 1999 it introduces an additional transport equation to compute the spatial distribution of scalar volume fraction α in the fluid domain fraction α describes the fluid properties specifically effective density and viscosity in each control volume the effective fluid density ρ e f f is defined as follows 4 ρ e f f α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r where ρ w a t e r and ρ a i r are the densities of water and air respectively viscosity is computed in the same manner

solver coupled implicitly with rans equations brunswig and el moctar 2004 el moctar et al 2017 accordingly a mesh morphing algorithm deforms the numerical grid to move ships in the computational domain oberhagemann and el moctar 2007 the two equation k ε and k ω s s t turbulence models are used to close the system of equations menter 1994 for the turbulent boundary layer shear stresses on the hull are determined using logarithmic wall functions 3 selected test cases to cover a wide range of practical needs we investigated the phenomenon of wave added resistance for a wide range of conventional ship types as well as for a well known test case fig 1 specifically our studies were performed for a modern medium size cruise ship ley et al 2014 valanto and hong 2015 a post panamax 14000 teu containership referred to as the duisburg test case dtc el moctar et al 2010 el moctar et al 2016b sprenger et al 2016 the medium size moeri tanker kvlcc2 simman 2008 and the well known wigley hull journée 2003 fig 1 shows their hull shapes beside the ship length the block coefficient varied significantly as it may have a significant influence on wave added resistance extensive model tests in calm water and in waves were performed for all test cases the hamburg ship model basin hsva valanto and hong 2015 performed model test for the cruise ship the norwegian marine technology research institute marintek sprenger et al 2016 and the sva potsdam nietzschmann 2010 for the containership the maritime ocean engineering research institute moeri for the tanker and the technical university delft for the wigley hull table 1 summarizes main particulars of the four ships and table 2 the associated tests conditions the physical models of the cruise ship and the containership were moored with soft springs in a diamond shaped or rectangular frame respectively which was towed at constant speed these setups schematically shown in fig 2 held the models captive and allowed them to move in surge heave and pitch transducers attached to the springs measured towing forces the tanker kvlcc2 and the wigley hull were free to heave and pitch all other degrees of freedom were suppressed 4 computational procedure determining the wave added resistance r a w of a ship comprises three steps first the calm water resistance r t for each specific ship speed is computed second the averaged longitudinal force in waves f x is determined the ships were free to heave and pitch all other degrees of freedom were suppressed third the wave added resistance is calculated by subtracting the calm water resistance from the time averaged longitudinal force in waves these steps always performed in the same way determine the frictional part of added resistance for this procedure it is essential to use the same numerical grids and test setups for all computations in calm water as well as in waves to minimize possible errors caused by spatial and temporal discretization model test scale effects and iterative computational techniques the typical sample time history of computed longitudinal force presented in fig 3 was performed for model scale conditions on a numerical grid consisting of 3 2 10 6 control volumes and it relied on a time step of 0 005s whereby the courant number on average was less than 0 5 in this fig the oscillating solid line identifies the total longitudinal force the dashed line the calm water longitudinal force and the dash dotted line the time averaged longitudinal force the difference between dashed and dash dotted line is equal to the added resistance in waves here the tested ship was the wigley hull advancing at constant forward speed corresponding to a froude number of f n 0 3 in regular 0 06 m high head waves corresponding to a wave length ratio of λ w l 1 9 where λ w is wave length and l is ship length between perpendiculars the time averaged longitudinal force in waves as well as the ship motion amplitudes were obtained by performing a fourier analysis of the time histories for selected time windows containing multiple encounter periods see fig 11 below computed and measured values of resistance amplitudes were normalized as follows 5 c a w

rather than target values therefore amplitudes of undisturbed waves next to a ship s bow were monitored in all simulations the calm water resistance coefficient c t reads as follows 8 c t r t 0 5 ρ v 2 s w where r t is calm water resistance ρ is water density v is ship speed and s w is wetted hull surface as model tests are not suited to predict the frictional resistance component for ships it is

the dimensionless wave frequency ω defined as follows 11 ω l λ w computations were performed on unstructured grids consisting of hexahedral control volumes dimensions of the computational domain were orientated to the length of the ship models the inlet boundary was located at least one model length ahead of the models forward perpendicular to reduce the free running length of incident waves the outlet boundary at least three model lengths behind the models aft perpendicular to avoid wave reflection the side boundaries two and a half model lengths to port and starboard of the models central symmetry plane the bottom at two model lengths below the calm water surface and the top at one model length above the calm water surface to illustrate fig 4 shows the computational fluid domain for the cruise ship to accurately resolve the wave pattern and the incident wave field grids were locally refined in the vicinity of the free surface and in areas surrounding the hull to dampen incident and hull induced waves the control volumes were smoothly stretched towards the outlet boundaries to properly account for the boundary layer on the hull surface prism layers were included and wall functions applied the grids used comprised between 1 6 10 6 and 20 0 10 6 control volumes for the entire flow domain at inlet boundaries velocities volume fractions turbulent kinetic energies and dissipation rates were specified the hull surface was defined as no slip walls at outlet and top boundaries hydrostatic boundary conditions were specified the origin of the inertial frames was located on the ships base line at their aft perpendiculars the origin of the ship fixed reference frames was situated at the ships center of gravity fig 5 shows wave patterns in calm water left and in incoming waves right for the containership computed on the same numerical grid obviously the ship induced wave pattern is more pronounced in waves furthermore waves were damped behind the model to avoid wave reflection to reduce uncertainties related to discretization errors all computations were performed on the same grid using the same numerical setup in short waves numerical damping made it impossible to attain the specified wave amplitude however in waves longer than 0 6 times ship length λ w l 0 6 deviations between target and actual wave amplitude were nearly zero percent therefore actually computed wave amplitudes of undisturbed waves next to a ship s bow were monitored in all simulations and these amplitudes were used for normalization rather than as target values fig 6 exemplarily depicts target and actual wave amplitudes for the wave length λ w l 0 3 for the tanker in wave lengths up to λ w l 0 6 table 3 lists the percentage deviations of actual wave amplitudes from their target values deviations in longer waves were negligibly small 5 discretization errors to investigate the influence of spatial and temporal discretization on wave added resistance grid studies for all ships were performed advancing in calm water as well as in waves hereto grids were refined systematically by multiplying the grids base size in all directions by a factor of about 1 7 then for each ship a coarse a medium and a fine grid comprising 1 6 10 6 to 7 5 10 6 control volumes extending over both port and starboard sides were generated for the containership additional computations were conducted on a very fine grid comprising 20 10 6 control volumes to minimize the influence of turbulence modeling and wall functions the non dimensional wall distance y on hulls wetted surfaces was kept constant for all grids at a mean value of approximately 80 fig 7 depicts this situation for the containership at f n 0 20 for the containership and the cruise ship fig 8 plots computed total and frictional calm water resistance coefficients c t and c f versus the total numbers of control volumes frictional resistance coefficients remain nearly constant whereas total resistance coefficients decrease with increasing number of control volumes the reason for this is numerical diffusion which influenced the viscous pressure resistance and decreased on finer grids fig 9 plots the computed wave added resistance coefficients c a w obtained on different sized grids versus wave length to ship length ratio λ w l as well as normalized wave frequency l λ w 1 2 the coarse grid comprised about 1 6 10 6 control volumes the medium grid about 3 2 10 6 control volumes the fine grid about 7 5 10 6 control volumes depending on a grid s spatial discretization waves were damped especially the short waves to account for this damping we performed computations using the computed instead of the target wave height the relatively small deviations between coefficients computed on different sized grids led us to conclude that the spatial discretization did not significantly influence the normalized added resistance coefficient as long as the actual computed wave height was used for normalization part of this study was recently published by sigmund and el moctar 2017 6 results all computations were performed at model scale on the medium sized numerical grid which comprised about 3 2 million control volumes the time step in computations corresponded to an average courant number of 0 5 table 4 summarizes the resulting calm water resistance expressed in its normalized form as coefficient c t obtained from computations and experimental measurements for the four ship types advancing at constant forward speeds this table also lists the associated froude number f n as well as the percentage deviation between computed and measured values these deviations are less than five percent i e they are small and therefore deemed sufficiently accurate to carry on with our computations of the wave added resistance fig 10 presents time histories of computed and experimentally measured heave and pitch motions for the containership in regular head waves the solid line identifies computed motions the dotted line experimentally measured motions these motions are nearly harmonic and generally their amplitudes and phase angles compare favorably to measurements the deviation between computed and measured amplitudes is less than 2 although not shown here the corresponding time histories for the other three ships were similar however in the shortest waves measured motions for these other ship typed were not always harmonic figs 11 13 presents time histories and mean values of computed longitudinal force f x for the four investigated ships advancing at constant forward speed in calm water as well as in short intermediately long and long regular head waves directly above each individual graph are listed the associated wave length to ship length ratio λ w l the froude number f n and the wave height h w a dashed line identifies the force in calm water a solid fluctuating line the total longitudinal force in waves and a dash dotted line the mean force in waves the difference between dashed and dash dotted lines defines the wave added resistance this difference is largest in fig 12 for all ships that is the non dimensional wave added resistance attains its maximum as expected in waves of length equal to ship length i e when λ w l is unity this is so because at this wave length radiated waves contribute most to the added resistance at this wave length and the relative motion between hull and water surface is largest it is seen that in short waves nonlinearities of longitudinal force for the cruise ship and the containership are especially pronounced see figs 11 and 12 it is these ships that are characterized by higher bow flare angles for the tanker in short waves low oscillation frequencies are superposed on the encounter frequencies the mean values were calculated considering these low oscillation frequencies 6 1 effects of heave and pitch motions on added resistance in waves the added resistance in moderate long waves is dominated by radiation hence accurate prediction of motions was required the comparative response amplitude operators of heave left and pitch right motions shown in fig 14 demonstrate the generally fair agreement between computations and measurements the maximum value of the response operator is slightly shifted towards longer waves for the blunt ship i e the tanker computed heave motions in the range of wave length λ w l 0 9 deviate noticeably from measured motion responses of the cruise ship we then computed heave and pitch motions using a rankine source boundary element method bem soeding et al 2014 lyu and el moctar 2017 bem and rans show similar tendency see fig 14 top the unexpected deviations between computed and measured heave motions in the range of the above mentioned wave length cannot be explained and might be due to uncertainties related to the measured heave motions not only the motion amplitudes but also their phase angles between incident head waves and the particular motions influenced the wave induced added resistance kashiwagi et al 2010 fig 15 plots these phase angles against wave parameters ω and λ w l for the tanker experimental measurements were available for comparison for the containership and the cruise ship computed results obtained from a boundary element method lyu and el moctar 2017 or from rans simulations generally measurements and computed results correlate favorably as expected in short waves the phase angle between wave and heave motion is nearly zero in long waves λ w l 2 this phase angle is close to 90deg in the range of waves where the added resistance attains peak values λ w l 1 phase angles notably are around 50deg the only exception is the phase angle of the tanker s heave motion here relative motions between the ship s bow and the wave elevation were largest this caused pressures acting at the ship s bow to increase thereby leading to a distinctly higher added resistance thus in the vicinity of peak values of the added resistance a distinct correlation existed between phase angle and wave induced added resistance in short waves λ w l 0 6 it was impossible to identify clear trends for none of the ships although some of these phase angles were large the associated motion amplitudes were small the comparable normalized quadratic response amplitude operators of the added resistance in regular head waves shown in fig 16 as plots of the added resistance coefficients c a w demonstrate here also the generally favorable agreement between computations and measurements nonlinear effects in short λ w l 0 3 and steep waves are seen to be more pronounced and often these waves are not harmonic computational techniques that account for these nonlinear effects are important for an accurate prognosis boundary element methods are efficient and offer a good compromise between accuracy and computer time however they may be unable to represent entirely these nonlinear phenomena in short waves the agreement between computations and measurements is especially favorable here wave diffraction dominates and the wave radiation part of the added resistance is nearly negligibly small the increase of the normalized added resistance in shorter waves is well predicted by the computations as mentioned above the added resistance in short waves is of practical relevance for larger longer ships because large ships operate under such conditions most of the time however it is appropriate to point out that in very short waves e g λ w l 0 2 and less the absolute value of the added resistance is relatively small compared to for example the calm water resistance all added resistance coefficients show a significant peak in the range of wave length equal to ship length here ship motions and consequently radiation forces are highest in the range of peak values for the cruise ship the added resistance coefficient is slightly overestimated this is due to the relatively larger deviations between computed and measured ship motions see fig 14 at wave frequencies where radiation is dominant fig 17 compares the added resistance coefficients of the four investigated ship types at similar froude numbers for the two slender ships cruise ship and containership the added resistance in short waves is similar for the tanker characterized by a relatively large block coefficient the added resistance coefficient increases in shorter waves and its peak value shifts towards longer waves 6 2 effects of ship speed on added resistance in waves to investigate effects of ship speed on the wave added resistance heave and pitch motion and wave added resistance were computed at various forward speeds albeit only for the cruise ship and the containership for the cruise ship computations were performed at full scale speeds of 15 and 21 kts corresponding to froude numbers of 0 16 and 0 22 respectively for the containership at 6 and 16 kts corresponding to froude number of 0 05 and 0 14 respectively the comparative response amplitude operators of heave left and pitch right motions shown in fig 18 demonstrate the generally fair agreement between computations and measurements it is seen that pitch motions are nearly unaffected by ship speed in contrast with heave motions in the range of wave length equal to ship length this is not the case in this range of wave lengths heave motions are distinctly less at slower ship speeds this is reflected by the associated added resistance coefficients for these two ships presented in fig 19 as expected at slower ship speeds the added resistance in waves is less this effect is more pronounced at peak values of the added resistance coefficient and in long waves where radiation is dominant in short waves where diffraction is dominant the effect of ship speed on the added resistance is moderate 6 3 effects of viscosity on added resistance in waves it is assumed that the wave added resistance is driven by pressure forces and hence can be extrapolated using froude similarity söding 1982 traditional methods such as physical tests and potential theory based methods cannot be used to investigate viscous effects in the present work the frictional added resistance was determined by subtracting the calm water friction force from the mean friction force in waves fig 20 shows computed and measured total added resistance together with the computed frictional component of the added resistance including its percentage of the total added resistance for all investigated ships the non dimensional added frictional resistance increases with decreasing short wave lengths it can be seen that especially in short waves viscous effects on added resistance are significant for all ships at their peaks the frictional part contributes about 5 to total the added resistance in waves in short waves e g λ w l 0 2 the frictional part may exceed 20 of the total value to better understand these results computed representative shear stress distributions on the hulls of the containership and tanker advancing at constant forward speed in calm water and in waves are shown in fig 21 the orbital velocities in waves caused the molecular and turbulent shear stresses to increase and led to higher frictional forces acting on the wetted hulls high shear stresses marked by dark areas in fig 21 are noticeable underneath the wave crests beyond that the viscous pressure distribution in waves may contribute however we did not investigate this phenomenon because it was impossible to readily separate viscous and wave induced pressures as mentioned above all computations so far were performed at model scale however viscous effects depend strongly on reynolds number therefore we performed computations in short waves for the cruise ship based on reynolds numbers corresponding to full scale conditions and also selected a mean dimensionless wall distance of y 1000 for these computations fig 22 shows measured and computed coefficients of the total and frictional added resistance at model scale ms and full scale fs of the containership at f n 0 14 in regular head waves as expected the added frictional resistance is smaller at full scale than at model scale its contribution is roughly half that at model scale consequently the frictional component of the added resistance is overestimated when predictions are based on computations at model scale nevertheless this component is still significant and should not be neglected at this stage let us point out that in short waves the total amount of added resistance is relatively small in some instances it only amounts to a few percent of calm water resistance for a ship at service speed that is in waves the viscous part of the added resistance may note contribute substantially in the total resistance calm water and added resistance in waves nevertheless these viscous effects may still be useful e g to correct the more efficient potential theory based added resistance predictions 6 4 effects of wave steepness on added resistance in waves until now we assumed that the added resistance in waves depends quadratically on wave height söding 1982 however ships operate in waves of variable steepness thus the question arose in what way this assumption is valid to resolve this issue we computed the added resistance in waves for the containership and the tanker in waves of different steepness here defined as wave height divided by wave length for these two ships advancing in head waves of different steepness fig 23 plots our results together with experimental measurements in terms of added resistance coefficients plotted against wave length and normalized wave frequency for the cases investigated a distinct dependence of added resistance on wave steepness can be observed at their peaks added resistance coefficients decrease with increasing wave steepness in this range of wave lengths radiation is dominant and nonlinear effects are moderate in short waves nonlinear effects are important and diffraction is dominant the distinct influence of wave steepness on the added resistance coefficient becomes noticeable in wave lengths that are shorter than one half ship length λ w l 0 5 that is as waves get shorter the influence of wave steepness increases the slope of the added resistance coefficient as wave frequency increases gets distinctly larger with greater wave steepness the influence of wave steepness on added resistance is more pronounced for the full bodied tanker than for the relatively slender containership in wave lengths of λ w l 0 28 increasing the wave steepness from 2 1 to 3 5 causes a 35 2 increase of the added resistance coefficient for the containership in waves of this same length e g when λ w l 0 28 increasing the wave steepness from 0 6 to 1 9 causes a 201 increase of the added resistance coefficient for the tanker an experimental study performed by yasukawa et al 2016 shows similar trends most of the literature dealing with computational and experimental investigations of added resistance does not specify wave steepness and one aim of ours was to demonstrate its importance in this regard a comparison between computations and experimental measurements of added resistance especially for ships advancing in short waves is meaningful only for waves of the same wave steepness 6 5 interaction between radiation and diffraction forces often potential flow methods separate wave induced forces into radiation and diffraction this simplifies the solution and is expedient for linear problems regarding added resistance in waves here we investigated the interaction between radiation and diffraction to quantify these interactions we determined diffraction and radiation forces separately for the four investigated ship types to this end we performed three different computations first we computed total added resistance in waves second we determined added resistance of the fixed ships advancing with constant forward speed in incoming head waves diffraction third we obtained added resistance of the moving ships advancing in calm water by prescribing the computed motions obtained in the first step radiation fig 24 plots computed and measured total resistance as well as the associated computed radiation and diffraction forces against wave length to ship length ratios as well as against normalized wave frequencies although interaction between radiation and diffraction is more pronounced in long waves it vanished almost completely in short waves as was expected in long waves e g when λ w l 1 the radiation part of added resistance becomes significant and the diffraction part is only moderately influenced by waves nevertheless interaction between radiation and diffraction was important in short waves e g when λ w l 0 50 radiation forces are nearly zero and diffraction forces depend only moderately on wave frequency thus in short waves diffraction forces match total added resistance consequently the radiation part of the added resistance coefficients display a significant peak in the range of large motion response e g when λ w l these findings were found to be valid for all ships at all froude numbers the interaction between radiation and diffraction was addressed and discussed by kashiwagi et al 2010 7 conclusions predicting wave added resistance of ships remains challenging nevertheless the practical relevance of this subject motivated systematic investigations in the use of advanced numerical methods to analyze added resistance of ships in waves initially we investigated dicretization errors then based on the outcome we identified spatial and time dependent discretizations suitable for simulations furthermore we introduced appropriate numerical methods to predict the added resistance in waves two findings were important on the one hand computations of calm water resistance as well as added resistance in waves should be carried out on the same numerical grid on the other hand the added resistance should be normalized always against the actual wave amplitude not the targeted wave amplitude ship motions and the added resistance in waves were computed for the four ship types and compared to experimental model test measurements generally computations and measurements correlated favorably this was also so for added resistances in short and long waves thereby demonstrating that the methods based on solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations were capable of predicting reliable wave induced first and higher order responses such as ship motions and added resistance in waves respectively results showed that radiation forces were affected more strongly by ship speed than diffraction forces thus peaks of added resistance coefficients were less pronounced at lower ship speeds by subtracting frictional resistance in calm water from frictional resistance in waves the frictional added resistance was determined computations showed that in short waves friction accounted for a significant part of the total added resistance namely of 20 or even more however full scale computations showed that this effect was less pronounced at full scale diffraction and radiation forces at different frequencies were investigated whereby diffraction forces were obtained by restraining the ship in waves and the radiation forces by prescribing the motions of the ship in calm water in long waves the sum of diffraction and radiation forces did not match the total resistance i e the interaction of these two force components had to be accounted for in short waves the diffraction part of total resistance was dominant as almost no ship motions were induced generally the assumption of a quadratic correlation between wave height and added resistance was confirmed for ships advancing in waves of moderate to long wave lengths however this assumption did not hold for ships advancing in short waves because in short waves diffraction was dominant acknowledgments the research was supported by the german federal ministry of economic affairs under contract 03sx339b and energy and by the european union under

23718,the computational fluid dynamics cfd method was applied to study the dynamics of damaged ship during flooding and sinking process in which the air compression effect was taken into account the studied case was a ship s compartment with bottom damage sinking into calm water to investigate the air flow effect the compartment was set to be fully ventilated partially ventilated and airtight for different cases in the numerical simulation the air was treated as ideal gas the volume of fluid method was adopted to capture the air and water interface the shear stress transport model was employed for turbulence modelling the technique of dynamic layering mesh was used to deal with the ship sinking motion all the numerical schemes were implemented with the cfd solver ansys fluent the benchmarking results were presented and discussed including the time and gird dependence studies the turbulent model against the laminar model the air compressible model against the incompressible model and the computation against the model test the effect of air flow on water flooding and ship sinking was also analysed keywords damaged ship flooding sinking air compression cfd 1 introduction when a ship is damaged the sea water floods into the damaged compartment and subsequently flows to other compartments through the internal openings the interactive dynamics between the floodwater and damaged ship is very complex it becomes even more complex if the floodable compartment is not fully ventilated on one hand the entrapped air could impede floodwater spreading uniformly over the internal compartments in such case the ship may capsize in a short time due to highly asymmetric distribution of internal water on the other hand the entrapped air could slow the flooding progression and consequently prevent the ship sinking rapidly hence the inclusion of air compressibility is required for the study of damaged ship s stability and survivability since the 1980s a variety of numerical methods have been developed to calculate the damaged ship dynamics by different researchers spouge 1986 vassalos and turan 1994 spanos and papanikolaou 2001 kong 2009 rodrigues and guedes soares 2015 manderbacka and ruponen 2016 but only a few methods accounted for the air compression effect based on the quasi static assumption palazzi and de kat 2004 developed a numerical method to simulate the flooding process of a damaged frigate with different ventilation conditions in their study the flow rate through an opening was governed by the modified bernoulli s equation the internal water was assumed to settle down instantaneously with a horizontal surface the air behaviour obeyed boyle s law the comparison between computational and experimental results confirmed that the accuracy of computation model was improved when the air compression effect was included however large discrepancy between the two results was still observed to improve the performance of quasi static model ruponen 2007 proposed a pressure correction method to calculate the volume of floodwater implicitly yet the determination of discharge coefficient needs to make use of other means such as model test stening et al 2011 or computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation ruponen et al 2012 the improved model was successfully applied to simulate the progressive flooding of a damaged barge with airtight compartment arrangement its performance was further validated in the flooding test of an attack craft equipped with small ventilation pipes ruponen et al 2013 a simplified version of ruponen s method was developed by dankowski 2013 to enhance the computational efficiency further modification is proposed by lee 2015 to improve numerical stability and accuracy in general the quasi static flooding model can yield satisfactory results in the intermediate and final flooding stages but it lacks the ability to reproduce the transient phenomenon in the initial stage to model the flooding and damaged ship dynamics intrinsically the cfd method has been applied to relevant study in the past decade for the case where the air compression is negligible the cfd method is capable of modelling the floodwater dynamics strasser 2010 gao 2012 zhang et al 2013 sadat hosseini et al 2016 bašić et al 2017 if the air compression effect is crucial for the flooding process coupling the velocity pressure and density fields in the computation encounters difficulty cho et al 2006 hashimoto et al 2011 shen 2012 to avoid unphysical solution the air was normally treated as incompressible or even ignored in the cfd simulation but the numerical error shown in the previous study gao et al 2011 cast doubt on such practical treatment or simplification for the cfd model itself its reliability can be guaranteed only if the contribution to the numerical error is clarified thus taking air compressibility into account is essential for flooding simulation to minimize the uncertainty of numerical results especially in case of transient flooding with large amplitude motion of ship in this study the cfd method which is based on solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the volume of fluid vof method and the dynamic mesh technique was used to simulate a damaged ship s compartment flooding and sinking in calm water the air was treated as compressible fluid so as to account for different ventilation conditions the grid and time dependence tests were first conducted then the numerical results were compared with the experimental data the air flow effect on the motion of floodwater and damaged ship was also investigated it is shown that the adopted mathematical model and numerical schemes are effective to predict the interactive dynamics between the air water and ship during transient flooding process 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations of fluid motion the present method considers the air and water as compressible and incompressible fluids

constant 2 2 governing equations of rigid body motion the body motion in the present study involves a ship s compartment vertically sinking in calm water only one degree of freedom dof of the moving body i e heave motion is considered in the numerical simulation the heave motion of rigid body is determined by solving the following equations 19 m v 3 f 3 20 f 3 s b τ 31 n 1 τ 32 n 2 τ 33 n 3 p n 3 d s m g 3 where m denotes the mass of the body v 3 is the vertical velocity of the body f 3 is the vertical resultant force acting on the body s b denotes the body surface 2 3 numerical method the commercial cfd solver fluent 12 0 ansys fluent 2008 is employed to solve the governing equations of fluid motion they are discretised by the finite volume method on a collocated grid the euler implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretisation of flow variables except for fluid volume fraction which is discretised in an explicit manner the convective terms in eqs 2 3 6 and 7 are discretised by the second order upwind scheme eq 17 is solved using the geometry reconstruction scheme the flow behaviour in the near wall region is model using a wall treatment which switches automatically from the viscous sublayer formulation to the wall function depending on the grid size the simple algorithm is employed for pressure velocity coupling once the flow properties are solved by the above numerical method the vertical resultant force acting on the body can be evaluated from eq 20 then the vertical velocity of body is obtained by integrating eq 19 over time with an explicit method gao et al 2011 and the body displacement is determined in a same way the corresponding algorithm is implemented in fluent utilizing the user define function a combined dynamic mesh strategy is used to handle the mesh update according to the heave motion of body the computational domain is divided into three regions as shown in fig 1 the region 1 undergoes the same translational motion of the body so that the mesh in this region is moved without geometrical and topological change the regions 2 and 3 are kept static but their boundaries adjacent to the region 1 moves vertically as a result adding or removing layers of cells adjacent to the moving boundaries is needed in the regions 2 and 3 the dynamic layering technique is employed to deal with such mesh operation the adopted dynamic mesh strategy can ensures optimum mesh quality in the whole fluid domain throughout the computation and low computational cost in the mesh update procedure 3 results and discussions 3 1 description of studied cases zhang et al 2013 conducted a series of model tests to study the sinking process of a damaged ship s compartment in calm water two u shaped compartments which suffer from bottom damage and side damage respectively were constructed for model test in our study the compartment with bottom damage is selected for the numerical simulation the sketch of the compartment is shown in fig 2 its main dimension is 0 35 m in length 0 17 m in breadth and 0 11 m in height the wall thickness is 0 01 m a circular damaged opening with diameter of 0 09 m is located at the bottom center six ventilation holes with diameter of 0 015 m are opened along the center line of the top in zhangs model test the size of water tank was 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m the still water height was 0 4 m the compartment was initially hung above the calm water and kept to contact the still water surface with its bottom as shown in fig 3 then the compartment was released and sank vertically into water the motion of the compartment was measured using a high speed motion analysis system the above mentioned compartment sinking case is used as benchmarking test of present computation model described in section 2 in addition the ventilation holes on the compartment top are partially or totally removed in our numerical simulations to investigate the air flow effect on the sinking and flooding process all the computations are performed on a workstation equipped with 20 core processor intel xeon 2 4 ghz 3 2 benchmarking study for the validation purpose the present method is first applied to simulate the sinking process of the damaged compartment illustrated in section 3 1 the size of numerical tank for simulation is 0 5 m in length 0 5 m in breadth and 0 6 m in height on the top boundary of the tank the pressure is set to be the atmospheric pressure the no slip wall boundary condition is imposed on the other boundaries according to the dynamic mesh strategy depicted in section 2 3 the computational domain is divided into three regions as shown in fig 4 the region 1 includes the damaged compartment and its adjacent area the mesh in this region moves in the same motion of the compartment the regions 2 and 3 are kept static their mesh is updated by the dynamic layering technique three meshes namely g1 g2 and g3 described in table 1 are generated for the validation test fig 5 shows the mesh arrangement of g1 it is observed that the structured mesh nearly covers the computational domain except for a small number of areas adjacent to the damaged opening and ventilation holes in the region 1 the sizes of element in the x y and z directions are around 0 005 m in the regions 2 and 3 the element sizes in both the x and y directions are around 0 005 m it varies in the z direction and becomes larger as the distance from the region 1 increases the expansion factors are 1 2 and 1 03 for the regions 2 and 3 respectively compared to the mesh g1 the mesh for g2 inside the compartment area is refined the corresponding element sizes in the x y and z directions are reduced to 0 0025 m in other areas the mesh arrangement is kept same for the mesh g3 the meshes inside and outside the compartments area are both refined i e the element sizes in the x y and z directions are around 0 0025 m in the region 1 in the regions 2 and 3 the mesh arrangement is similar to that for the mesh g1 the present simulations confirm that the values of y plus which measures the distance from the wall to the centroid of the first element are less than 150 for the three meshes the total numbers of elements for the meshes g1 g2 and g3 are approximately 0 87 million 1 24 million and 5 81 million respectively as mentioned in section 2 3 the geometry reconstruction scheme is used to solve the fluid volume fraction explicitly to ensure computational stability it requires the cell courant number to be less than 1 0 moreover a small time step is necessary for simulation involving coupled motion between fluid and body to reduce numerical dissipation to investigate the influence of time step on the computation accuracy three settings of time step namely t1 t2 and t3 are tested in the present study for each setting the time step is automatically adjusted to keep the cell courant number within the limit of 1 0 beside this limitation the maximum time steps are set to be 0 001 s 0 0005 s and 0 00025 s for t1 t2 and t3 respectively the mesh g1 listed in table 1 is employed in the time dependence study it takes 25 46 and 83 cpu hours to complete a 2 s simulation for the time step setting t1 t2 and t3 respectively the comparison of the computed heave motions of compartment is shown in fig 6 it is clear that the sinking of compartment shows oscillatory characteristic at 2 s the sinkage exceeds 0 11 m which means that the compartment is completely submerged the results computed with the three settings of time step agree well before 1 5 s after that the differences between results computed with t1 and those computed with smaller time steps become larger and larger while the results computed with t2 and t3 are still in good agreement the maximum and average errors between results computed with t1 and t3 are 8 9 and 3 1 respectively while those between results computed with t2 and t3 are 4 7 and 1 8 respectively the above comparisons demonstrate that t2 can ensure acceptable numerical accuracy with relatively lower computational cost hence the time step setting t2 is adopted for all the remaining computations in addition to the time step the mesh arrangement inside the compartment and near the free surface has significant influence on the computation accuracy the three meshes listed in table 1 are used for the grid dependence investigation it takes 46 135 and 664 cpu hours to complete a 2 s simulation for the meshes g1 g2 and g3 respectively fig 7 shows the comparisons of the computed heave motion of compartment the results computed with different mesh arrangements are nearly identical before 0 6 s after that the deviations between computed results become obvious but the three results still coincide reasonably well the maximum and average errors between results computed with the meshes g1 and g3 are 5 4 and 2 3 respectively while those between results computed with the meshes g2 and g3 are 2 3 and 1 1 respectively fig 8 compares the computed water motion at the longitudinal center plane of compartment using the meshes g1 and g3 it is shown that the internal free surface profile is more complex than the external one compared to the mesh g1 the mesh g3 can retain more detail of free surface profile inside the compartment outside the compartment the free surface profiles obtained with the two meshes are similar the above investigation indicates that the grid resolution of the mesh g1 suffices for the compartment motion prediction but smears the free surface profile inside the compartment moderately it is reasonable to increase the grid resolution inside the compartment the use of the mesh g2 can reduce computational cost notably and still achieve numerical accuracy in the same level as the mesh g3 thus the mesh g2 is employed for the rest of simulations with the use of the time step setting t2 and the mesh arrangement g2 the present numerical results are verified by the model test data fig 9 shows the comparison of the compartment s vertical velocities obtained by computation and model test it is apparent that the compartment sinks rapidly once it is released after the sinking velocity reaches a maximum value it starts to decay and oscillate its oscillatory amplitude and period predicted in the numerical simulation are generally consistent with the experimental counterparts if the oscillatory amplitude of velocity is used for error evaluation the maximum and average errors between the computed and experimental results are 31 6 and 14 8 fig 10 compares the compartment and water motions obtained by the present method and model test at the beginning the water floods drastically into the compartment then the floodwater spreads over the compartment with strongly non linear behaviour such as climbing overturning and breaking as the internal water accumulates the generating and collapsing of air bubbles are observed after the compartment is filled the internal water would flow out through the top ventilation holes additionally the heave motion of compartment results in free surface undulation outside the compartment when the compartment completely sinks the water over the compartment bounces notably compared to the model test records the above phenomena are generally reproduced in the numerical simulation the deviation between the computed and measured heave motions suggests that further investigation of factors which may contribute to numerical error is necessary for computational model itself the numerical error may stem from the turbulence modelling and the air compressibility modelling to examine these two factors two additional simulations which are based on the laminar flow model and the incompressible flow model respectively are performed the two newly computed results are compared with the result presented previously fig 11 shows the comparisons of the compartment s heave motion obtained with different computational models firstly the results obtained with the turbulent and laminar models are nearly identical it indicates that the flow in the studied case is dominated by the inertial and pressure forces as expected thus the influence of turbulence modelling on the accuracy of heave motion prediction is limited secondly the incompressible flow model can yield reasonable results before the submergence of compartment after the compartment is submerged the compression effect of the entrapped air becomes significant in such case the improper modelling of air flow causes computation divergence at around 1 88 s the comparison demonstrates that the adopted compressible model for air flow is effective regardless of the transient state of air the benchmarking study shows that the adopted computational model the time step setting t2 and the mesh arrangement g2 is reliable for numerical simulation of present studied case 3 3 air flow effect on flooding and sinking after the validity of present method is verified it is then applied to study the effect of air flow inside the damaged compartment on flooding and sinking process three ventilation conditions are taken into account the first condition is that the six ventilation holes at the compartment top are effective as shown in fig 2 since the ratio of the total area of air vents to the area of damaged opening is larger than 10 this condition can be considered as fully ventilated imo 2013 the second condition is that only one middle ventilation hole is effective while the other five holes are shut down the third condition is that all the ventilation holes are shut down these three cases represent the compartment being in fully ventilated partially ventilated and airtight conditions respectively the meshes for the three cases are generated according to the mesh arrangement g2 described in section 3 2 the three meshes are almost identical in the whole computational domain except for the domain of ventilation hole the total numbers of element for each case is about 1 24 million the time step setting t2 described in section 3 2 is adopted the simulations for the fully ventilated partially ventilated and airtight cases terminate at around 4 5 s 5 0 s and 5 0 s respectively when the process of compartment flooding and sinking is stable it takes 293 192 and 135 cpu hours to complete the simulations respectively the comparisons of the computed heave motion of compartment for different ventilation conditions are shown in fig 12 where six vents one vent and no vent denote the fully ventilated partially ventilated and airtight cases respectively for the two cases with ventilation the compartment sinking motions are oscillatory before the sinkages of compartment reach 0 11 m after the compartments are totally submerged they sink steadily towards the tank bottom the compartment sinking process for the fully ventilated case is much faster than that for the partially ventilated case at the end of simulations the sinkages of compartment for the two cases are approximately 0 35 m and 0 16 m respectively for the airtight case the compartment does not sink vertically instead it oscillates about its equilibrium floating position meanwhile the motion amplitude decays slowly fig 13 illustrates the influence of the above three ventilation conditions on the compartment flooding and sinking during the first period of the compartment s heave motion the illustrations are recorded at the transverse center plane of compartment it is observed that the amplitudes of compartment motion decrease as the number of air vent decreases the free surface profiles outside the compartment are similar for the three cases the major differences between the three cases are the floodwater motion through the damaged opening and inside the compartment for the six vents case the water flows drastically into the compartment through the damaged opening the internal water motion is violent for the one vent case the water ingress and its behaviour inside the compartment appear to be mitigated by the entrapped air in comparison with the fully ventilated case for the no vent case the entrapped air completely prohibits water flooding the external water can get across the damaged opening but it is unable to flow into the compartment indeed as a combined result of hydraulic pressure and internal air pressure the water flows in and out alternately and frequently fig 14 compares the time histories of pressure inside the compartment for the three ventilation conditions the pressure is monitored at the center of the compartment top and is referred to the atmospheric pressure for the six vents case the pressure is close to zero before the floodwater contacts with the compartment top during this stage the air compression effect is negligible the peak appearing around 1 68 s corresponds to the submergence of ventilation holes after 2 5 s the pressure increases steadily and is dominated by the hydrostatic component for the one vent case the visible non zero value of pressure at the initial stage indicates that the air inside the compartment is compressed notably after 3 5 s the compartment is completely submerged the pressure increases smoothly as the compartment further sinks for the no vent case the pressure oscillates with high frequency and large amplitude before 1 0 s such pressure oscillation is related to the floodwater behaviour in the vicinity of the damaged opening as explained previously after 1 5 s the oscillation frequency and amplitude decreases the average value of pressure is approximately 350 pa the primary frequency of pressure oscillation coincides with the frequency of heave motion of the compartment fig 15 shows the comparison of the water flow rate through the damaged opening for different ventilation conditions the magnitude of flow rate mainly depends on the difference of pressures inside and outside the compartment as well as the compartment motion for the six vents case the internal air can instantaneously escape from the compartment so the flow rate rises rapidly at the beginning of flooding the fluctuation of flow rate in the later stage is related to the oscillating motion of compartment and the water wave behaviour inside the compartment once the compartment is submerged the pressure inside the compartment is generally equal to the external pressure consequently the flow rate drops remarkably at the period between 1 6 s and 1 8 s after 2 4 s as the sinking motion of compartment tends to be stable the flow rate becomes steady and relatively small for the one vent case the flooding process slows down due to the blockage effect of the entrapped air but the characteristic of flow rate varying with the compartment sinking is similar to that in the fully ventilated case for the case without ventilation although the flow rate oscillates notably with high frequency especially before 1 0 s its average value is zero for the whole process the result indicates that the entrapped air blocks the damaged opening and completely prevents water flowing into the compartment 4 conclusion a rans solver combing with the vof method and the technique of dynamic layering mesh is applied to simulate the flooding and sinking process of a damaged compartment in which the air compression effect is taken into account the test case in the benchmarking is simulated using different time step settings mesh arrangements and computational models to investigate the factors possibly affecting the numerical results it is found that the compartment motion flow behaviour inside the compartment and external free surface profile predicted by the present method are satisfactory in comparison with the experimental data a variable time step which keeps the cell courant number being less than 1 0 and is simultaneously limited within a maximum value can ensure numerical stability and accuracy for the flooding simulation with large amplitude motion of body the compressible flow model for air phase based on the simple algorithm is effective to deal with the air compressibility for a wide range of compression states the effect of air flow on the compartment flooding and sinking is analysed based on numerical simulations for the partially ventilated case the entrapped air significantly impedes water ingress and consequently delays the time to flood and time to sink in comparison with the results of fully ventilated case for the case with no ventilation the entrapped air completely prevents water flooding into the compartment the damaged compartment floats up and down about its equilibrium position as it is in intact condition for the case of real ship sinking at least 4 dof motion i e sway heave roll and pitch should be considered in the numerical simulation to perform such simulation a more elaborate strategy for mesh update based on the dynamic layering mesh technique is being developed in addition further benchmarking test of present numerical method is needed emphasis will be given on the ship flooding scenario with the occurrence of serious compression of air the influence of scale effect when performing such simulation will be also investigated in the future work acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51609186

23718,the computational fluid dynamics cfd method was applied to study the dynamics of damaged ship during flooding and sinking process in which the air compression effect was taken into account the studied case was a ship s compartment with bottom damage sinking into calm water to investigate the air flow effect the compartment was set to be fully ventilated partially ventilated and airtight for different cases in the numerical simulation the air was treated as ideal gas the volume of fluid method was adopted to capture the air and water interface the shear stress transport model was employed for turbulence modelling the technique of dynamic layering mesh was used to deal with the ship sinking motion all the numerical schemes were implemented with the cfd solver ansys fluent the benchmarking results were presented and discussed including the time and gird dependence studies the turbulent model against the laminar model the air compressible model against the incompressible model and the computation against the model test the effect of air flow on water flooding and ship sinking was also analysed keywords damaged ship flooding sinking air compression cfd 1 introduction when a ship is damaged the sea water floods into the damaged compartment and subsequently flows to other compartments through the internal openings the interactive dynamics between the floodwater and damaged ship is very complex it becomes even more complex if the floodable compartment is not fully ventilated on one hand the entrapped air could impede floodwater spreading uniformly over the internal compartments in such case the ship may capsize in a short time due to highly asymmetric distribution of internal water on the other hand the entrapped air could slow the flooding progression and consequently prevent the ship sinking rapidly hence the inclusion of air compressibility is required for the study of damaged ship s stability and survivability since the 1980s a variety of numerical methods have been developed to calculate the damaged ship dynamics by different researchers spouge 1986 vassalos and turan 1994 spanos and papanikolaou 2001 kong 2009 rodrigues and guedes soares 2015 manderbacka and ruponen 2016 but only a few methods accounted for the air compression effect based on the quasi static assumption palazzi and de kat 2004 developed a numerical method to simulate the flooding process of a damaged frigate with different ventilation conditions in their study the flow rate through an opening was governed by the modified bernoulli s equation the internal water was assumed to settle down instantaneously with a horizontal surface the air behaviour obeyed boyle s law the comparison between computational and experimental results confirmed that the accuracy of computation model was improved when the air compression effect was included however large discrepancy between the two results was still observed to improve the performance of quasi static model ruponen 2007 proposed a pressure correction method to calculate the volume of floodwater implicitly yet the determination of discharge coefficient needs to make use of other means such as model test stening et al 2011 or computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation ruponen et al 2012 the improved model was successfully applied to simulate the progressive flooding of a damaged barge with airtight compartment arrangement its performance was further validated in the flooding test of an attack craft equipped with small ventilation pipes ruponen et al 2013 a simplified version of ruponen s method was developed by dankowski 2013 to enhance the computational efficiency further modification is proposed by lee 2015 to improve numerical stability and accuracy in general the quasi static flooding model can yield satisfactory results in the intermediate and final flooding stages but it lacks the ability to reproduce the transient phenomenon in the initial stage to model the flooding and damaged ship dynamics intrinsically the cfd method has been applied to relevant study in the past decade for the case where the air compression is negligible the cfd method is capable of modelling the floodwater dynamics strasser 2010 gao 2012 zhang et al 2013 sadat hosseini et al 2016 bašić et al 2017 if the air compression effect is crucial for the flooding process coupling the velocity pressure and density fields in the computation encounters difficulty cho et al 2006 hashimoto et al 2011 shen 2012 to avoid unphysical solution the air was normally treated as incompressible or even ignored in the cfd simulation but the numerical error shown in the previous study gao et al 2011 cast doubt on such practical treatment or simplification for the cfd model itself its reliability can be guaranteed only if the contribution to the numerical error is clarified thus taking air compressibility into account is essential for flooding simulation to minimize the uncertainty of numerical results especially in case of transient flooding with large amplitude motion of ship in this study the cfd method which is based on solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the volume of fluid vof method and the dynamic mesh technique was used to simulate a damaged ship s compartment flooding and sinking in calm water the air was treated as compressible fluid so as to account for different ventilation conditions the grid and time dependence tests were first conducted then the numerical results were compared with the experimental data the air flow effect on the motion of floodwater and damaged ship was also investigated it is shown that the adopted mathematical model and numerical schemes are effective to predict the interactive dynamics between the air water and ship during transient flooding process 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations of fluid motion the present method considers the air and water as compressible and incompressible fluids

constant 2 2 governing equations of rigid body motion the body motion in the present study involves a ship s compartment vertically sinking in calm water only one degree of freedom dof of the moving body i e heave motion is considered in the numerical simulation the heave motion of rigid body is determined by solving the following equations 19 m v 3 f 3 20 f 3 s b τ 31 n 1 τ 32 n 2 τ 33 n 3 p n 3

commercial cfd solver fluent 12 0 ansys fluent 2008 is employed to solve the governing equations of fluid motion they are discretised by the finite volume method on a collocated grid the euler implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretisation of flow variables except for fluid volume fraction which is discretised in an explicit manner the convective terms in eqs 2 3 6 and 7 are discretised by the second order upwind scheme eq 17 is solved using the geometry reconstruction scheme the flow behaviour in the near wall region is model using a wall treatment which switches automatically from the viscous sublayer formulation to the wall function depending on the grid size the simple algorithm is employed for pressure velocity coupling once the flow properties are solved by the above numerical method the vertical resultant force acting on the body can be evaluated from eq 20 then the vertical velocity of body is obtained by integrating eq 19 over time with an explicit method gao et al 2011 and the body displacement is determined in a same way the corresponding algorithm is implemented in fluent utilizing the user define function a combined dynamic mesh strategy is used to handle the mesh update according to the heave motion of body the computational domain is divided into three regions as shown in fig 1 the region 1 undergoes the same translational motion of the body so that the mesh in this region is moved without geometrical and topological change the regions 2 and 3 are kept static but their boundaries adjacent to the region 1 moves vertically as a result adding or removing layers of cells adjacent to the moving boundaries is needed in the regions 2 and 3 the dynamic layering technique is employed to deal with such mesh operation the adopted dynamic mesh strategy can ensures optimum mesh quality in the whole fluid domain throughout the computation and low computational cost in the mesh update procedure 3 results and discussions 3 1 description of studied cases zhang et al 2013 conducted a series of model tests to study the sinking process of a damaged ship s compartment in calm water two u shaped compartments which suffer from bottom damage and side damage respectively were constructed for model test in our study the compartment with bottom damage is selected for the numerical simulation the sketch of the compartment is shown in fig 2 its main dimension is 0 35 m in length 0 17 m in breadth and 0 11 m in height the wall thickness is 0 01 m a circular damaged opening with diameter of 0 09 m is located at the bottom center six ventilation holes with diameter of 0 015 m are opened along the center line of the top in zhangs model test the size of water tank was 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m the still water height was 0 4 m the compartment was initially hung above the calm water and kept to contact the still water surface with its bottom as shown in fig 3 then the compartment was released and sank vertically into water the motion of the compartment was measured using a high speed motion analysis system the above mentioned compartment sinking case is used as benchmarking test of present computation model described in section 2 in addition the ventilation holes on the compartment top are partially or totally removed in our numerical simulations to investigate the air flow effect on the sinking and flooding process all the computations are performed on a workstation equipped with 20 core processor intel xeon 2 4 ghz 3 2 benchmarking study for the validation purpose the present method is first applied to simulate the sinking process of the damaged compartment illustrated in section 3 1 the size of numerical tank for simulation is 0 5 m in length 0 5 m in breadth and 0 6 m in height on the top boundary of the tank the pressure is set to be the atmospheric pressure the no slip wall boundary condition is imposed on the other boundaries according to the dynamic mesh strategy depicted in section 2 3 the computational domain is divided into three regions as shown in fig 4 the region 1 includes the damaged compartment and its adjacent area the mesh in this region moves in the same motion of the compartment the regions 2 and 3 are kept static their mesh is updated by the dynamic layering technique three meshes namely g1 g2 and g3 described in table 1 are generated for the validation test fig 5 shows the mesh arrangement of g1 it is observed that the structured mesh nearly covers the computational domain except for a small number of areas adjacent to the damaged opening and ventilation holes in the region 1 the sizes of element in the x y and z directions are around 0 005 m in the regions 2 and 3 the element sizes in both the x and y directions are around 0 005 m it varies in the z direction and becomes larger as the distance from the region 1 increases the expansion factors are 1 2 and 1 03 for the regions 2 and 3 respectively compared to the mesh g1 the mesh for g2 inside the compartment area is refined the corresponding element sizes in the x y and z directions are reduced to 0 0025 m in other areas the mesh arrangement is kept same for the mesh g3 the meshes inside and outside the compartments area are both refined i e the element sizes in the x y and z directions are around 0 0025 m in the region 1 in the regions 2 and 3 the mesh arrangement is similar to that for the mesh g1 the present simulations confirm that the values of y plus which measures the distance from the wall to the centroid of the first element are less than 150 for the three meshes the total numbers of elements for the meshes g1 g2 and g3 are approximately 0 87 million 1 24 million and 5 81 million respectively as mentioned in section 2 3 the geometry reconstruction scheme is used to solve the fluid volume fraction explicitly to ensure computational stability it requires the cell courant number to be less than 1 0 moreover a small time step is necessary for simulation involving coupled motion between fluid and body to reduce numerical dissipation to investigate the influence of time step on the computation accuracy three settings of time step namely t1 t2 and t3 are tested in the present study for each setting the time step is automatically adjusted to keep the cell courant number within the limit of 1 0 beside this limitation the maximum time steps are set to be 0 001 s 0 0005 s and 0 00025 s for t1 t2 and t3 respectively the mesh g1 listed in table 1 is employed in the time dependence study it takes 25 46 and 83 cpu hours to complete a 2 s simulation for the time step setting t1 t2 and t3 respectively the comparison of the computed heave motions of compartment is shown in fig 6 it is clear that the sinking of compartment shows oscillatory characteristic at 2 s the sinkage exceeds 0 11 m which means that the compartment is completely submerged the results computed with the three settings of time step agree well before 1 5 s after that the differences between results computed with t1 and those computed with smaller time steps become larger and larger while the results computed with t2 and t3 are still in good agreement the maximum and average errors between results computed with t1 and t3 are 8 9 and 3 1 respectively while those between results computed with t2 and t3 are 4 7 and 1 8 respectively the above comparisons demonstrate that t2 can ensure acceptable numerical accuracy with relatively lower computational cost hence the time step setting t2 is adopted for all the remaining computations in addition to the time step the mesh arrangement inside the compartment and near the free surface has significant influence on the computation accuracy the three meshes listed in table 1 are used for the grid dependence investigation it takes 46 135 and 664 cpu hours to complete a 2 s simulation for the meshes g1 g2 and g3 respectively fig 7 shows the comparisons of the computed heave motion of compartment the results computed with different mesh arrangements are nearly identical before 0 6 s after that the deviations between computed results become obvious but the three results still coincide reasonably well the maximum and average errors between results computed with the meshes g1 and g3 are 5 4 and 2 3 respectively while those between results computed with the meshes g2 and g3 are 2 3 and 1 1 respectively fig 8 compares the computed water motion at the longitudinal center plane of compartment using the meshes g1 and g3 it is shown that the internal free surface profile is more complex than the external one compared to the mesh g1 the mesh g3 can retain more detail of free surface profile inside the compartment outside the compartment the free surface profiles obtained with the two meshes are similar the above investigation indicates that the grid resolution of the mesh g1 suffices for the compartment motion prediction but smears the free surface profile inside the compartment moderately it is reasonable to increase the grid resolution inside the compartment the use of the mesh g2 can reduce computational cost notably and still achieve numerical accuracy in the same level as the mesh g3 thus the mesh g2 is employed for the rest of simulations with the use of the time step setting t2 and the mesh arrangement g2 the present numerical results are verified by the model test data fig 9 shows the comparison of the compartment s vertical velocities obtained by computation and model test it is apparent that the compartment sinks rapidly once it is released after the sinking velocity reaches a maximum value it starts to decay and oscillate its oscillatory amplitude and period predicted in the numerical simulation are generally consistent with the experimental counterparts if the oscillatory amplitude of velocity is used for error evaluation the maximum and average errors between the computed and experimental results are 31 6 and 14 8 fig 10 compares the compartment and water motions obtained by the present method and model test at the beginning the water floods drastically into the compartment then the floodwater spreads over the compartment with strongly non linear behaviour such as climbing overturning and breaking as the internal water accumulates the generating and collapsing of air bubbles are observed after the compartment is filled the internal water would flow out through the top ventilation holes additionally the heave motion of compartment results in free surface undulation outside the compartment when the compartment completely sinks the water over

the compartment is submerged the compression effect of the entrapped air becomes significant in such case the improper modelling of air flow causes computation divergence at around 1 88 s the comparison demonstrates that the adopted compressible model for air flow is effective regardless of the transient state of air the benchmarking study shows that the adopted computational model the time step setting t2 and the mesh arrangement g2 is reliable for numerical simulation of present studied case 3 3 air flow effect on flooding and sinking after the validity of present method is verified it is then applied to study the effect of air flow inside the damaged compartment on flooding and sinking process three ventilation conditions are taken into account the first condition is that the six ventilation holes at the compartment top are effective as shown in fig 2 since the ratio of the total area of air vents to the area of damaged opening is larger than 10 this condition can be considered as fully ventilated imo 2013 the second condition is that only one middle ventilation hole is effective while the other five holes are shut down the third condition is that all the ventilation holes are shut down these three cases represent the compartment being in fully ventilated partially ventilated and airtight conditions respectively the meshes for the three cases are

terminate at around 4 5 s 5 0 s and 5 0 s respectively when the process of compartment flooding and sinking is stable it takes 293 192 and 135 cpu hours to complete the simulations respectively the comparisons of the computed heave motion of compartment for different ventilation conditions are shown in fig 12 where six vents one vent and no vent denote the fully ventilated partially ventilated and airtight cases respectively for the two cases with ventilation the compartment sinking motions are oscillatory before the sinkages of compartment reach 0 11 m after the compartments are totally submerged they sink steadily towards the tank bottom the compartment sinking process for the fully ventilated case is much faster than that for the partially ventilated case at the end of simulations the sinkages of compartment for the two cases are approximately 0 35 m and 0 16 m respectively for the airtight case the compartment does not sink vertically instead it oscillates about its equilibrium floating position meanwhile the motion amplitude decays slowly fig 13 illustrates the influence of the above three ventilation conditions on the compartment flooding and sinking during the first period of the compartment s heave motion the illustrations are recorded at the transverse center plane of compartment it is observed that the amplitudes of compartment motion decrease as the number of air vent decreases the free surface profiles outside the compartment are similar for the three cases the major differences between the three cases are the floodwater motion through the

completely prohibits water flooding the external water can get across the damaged opening but it is unable to flow into the compartment indeed as a combined result of hydraulic pressure and internal air pressure the water flows in and out alternately and frequently fig 14 compares the time histories of pressure inside the compartment for the three ventilation conditions the pressure is monitored at the center of the compartment top and is referred to the atmospheric pressure for the six vents case the pressure is close to zero before the floodwater contacts with the compartment top during this stage the air compression effect is negligible the peak appearing around 1 68 s corresponds to the submergence of ventilation holes after 2 5 s the pressure increases steadily and is dominated by the hydrostatic component for the one vent case the visible non zero value of pressure at the initial stage indicates that the air inside the compartment is compressed notably after 3 5 s the compartment is completely submerged the pressure increases smoothly as the compartment further sinks for the no vent case the pressure oscillates with high frequency and large amplitude before 1 0 s such pressure oscillation is related to the floodwater behaviour in the vicinity of the damaged opening as explained previously after 1 5 s the oscillation frequency and amplitude decreases the average value of pressure is approximately 350 pa the primary frequency of pressure oscillation coincides with the frequency of heave motion of the compartment fig 15 shows the comparison of the water flow rate through the damaged opening for different ventilation conditions the magnitude of flow rate mainly depends on the difference of pressures inside and outside the compartment as well as the compartment motion for the six vents case the internal air can instantaneously escape from the compartment so the flow rate rises rapidly at the beginning of flooding the fluctuation of flow rate in the later stage is related to the oscillating motion of compartment and the water wave behaviour inside the compartment once the compartment is submerged the pressure inside the compartment is generally equal to the external pressure consequently the flow rate drops remarkably at the period between 1 6 s and 1 8 s after 2 4 s as the sinking motion of compartment tends to be stable the flow rate becomes steady and relatively small for the one vent case the flooding process slows down due to the blockage effect of the entrapped air but the characteristic of flow rate varying with the compartment sinking is similar to that in the fully ventilated case for the case without ventilation although the flow rate oscillates notably with high frequency especially before 1 0 s its average value is zero for the whole process the result indicates that the entrapped air blocks the damaged opening and completely prevents water flowing into the compartment 4 conclusion a rans solver combing with the vof method and the technique of dynamic layering mesh is applied to simulate the flooding and sinking process of a damaged compartment in which the air compression effect is taken into account the test case in the benchmarking is simulated using different time step settings mesh arrangements and computational models to investigate the factors possibly affecting the numerical results it is found that the compartment motion flow behaviour inside the compartment and external free surface profile predicted by the present method are satisfactory in comparison with the experimental data a variable time step which keeps the cell courant number being less than 1 0 and is simultaneously limited within a maximum value can ensure numerical stability and accuracy for the flooding simulation with large amplitude motion of body the compressible flow model for air phase based on the simple algorithm is effective to deal with the air compressibility for a wide range of compression states the effect of air flow on the compartment flooding and sinking is analysed based on numerical simulations for the partially ventilated case the entrapped air significantly impedes water ingress and consequently delays the time to flood and time to sink in comparison with the results of fully ventilated case for the case with no ventilation the entrapped air completely prevents water flooding into the compartment the damaged compartment floats up and down about its equilibrium position as it is in intact condition for the case of real ship sinking at least 4 dof motion i e sway heave roll and pitch should be considered in the numerical simulation to perform such simulation a more elaborate strategy for mesh update based on the dynamic layering mesh technique is being developed in addition further benchmarking test of present numerical method is needed emphasis will be given on the ship flooding scenario with the occurrence of serious compression of air the influence of scale effect when performing such simulation will be also investigated in the future work acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51609186

23719,while monopile foundation is widely used at sandy site in europe it is designed and constructed in intertidal zone used only in china so far comparing with sandy site intertidal site typically has different geological and environmental conditions due to upper layer consisting of soft marine clay and daily tide movement which may lead to considerable difference in long term behavior of monopile in order to investigate the cyclic lateral behavior of monopile constructed in intertidal zone several scaled model tests were conducted the scaled monopile soil system contained in situ soil from intertidal zone was tested with a new designed loading device under static and cyclic lateral load behavior of monopile soil system was obtained and analyzed which includes assessment of cyclic

development during 2014 nearly 92 offshore wind turbine had been constructed in european countries gwec 2014 meanwhile china had ranked fifth with installed capacity reaching 669 9 mw in 2014 he et al 2016 although monopile is used widely in europe due to site condition and limitation of installation equipment first offshore wind farm dong hai bridge wind farm constructed in china used high rise pile group foundation in the meantime a unique compromise design by using monopile in intertidal zone was developed rapidly korsnes 2014 in 2014 intertidal wind turbine iwt in china reached 56 69 of installed capacity which used monopile in general cwea 2014 in current guidelines for offshore wind turbine owt requirements of serviceability limit state sls typically dominate the whole design arany et al 2015 for assessment of lateral behavior of owt during sls effects of cyclic loading should be considered with cautious to evaluate accumulated deformation and nature frequency change arany et al 2017 at present available design standards e g api 2014 american petroleum institute 2014a american petroleum institute 2014b dnv gl as 2016 only provide simplified p y curve methods to assess the influence of cyclic effect on lateral behavior for owt during sls the api code which is based on analysis works from matlock 1970 and reese and welch 1975 recommends considering cyclic effect by scaling maximum ultimate lateral resistance down by a factor of 0 72 within a specific depth for clayey site case after that matlock 1979 bhattacharya et al 2006 proposed a modification by changing the factor from 0 72 to 0 5 to account for cyclic effect however available studies show a considerable difference between measured and recommended p y curves e g murff and hamilton 1993 jeanjean 2009 doherty and gavin 2011a gilbert et al 2015 in addition observation in model tests with owt in clayey foundation also shows that stiffness of p y curve also consider as stiffness of pile soil system tends to decrease in shallow depth and leads to an observable zone of soil softening at soil surface around pile e g lombardi et al 2013 hamiltong and murff 1995 zhang et al 2011 zakeri et al 2015 although conventional p y method from api code has been questioned by many researchers no generally accepted design procedure yet exists estimation of lateral capacity of iwt during sls remains using p y curve method suggested by api in the present state of the art similar to owt iwt is slender columns with a heavy mass on top and therefore is dynamically sensitive structure however comparing with rigid monopile in sandy foundation leblanc et al 2010a doherty et al 2012 ahmed and hawlader 2016 monopile installed in intertidal area behaves mostly as flexible pile soil system with large embedded length besides intertidal site typically contains soft sensitive clayey soil at the top of foundation in general e g di et al 2013 which could lead to unexpected cyclic degradation of pile soil system under cyclic loading furthermore environmental load of iwt is different from owt in hydro dynamic analysis due to daily tide movement which could also induce severe scour around foundation therefore using p y curve method to estimate lateral behavior of iwt remains questionable and requires further verification this paper focuses on assessing the cumulative behavior of monopile installed in intertidal like foundation subjected to one way cyclic lateral load a series of 1 g model tests were conducted to investigate the behavior of long fixed bottom pile in overconsolidated marine clay subjected to cyclic lateral load one static and three cyclic tests were carried out individually with the same pile soil condition static test was conducted to study the static behavior of pile soil system three cyclic tests with different load levels were designed to study the behavior of system under different serviceability state in addition cyclic model tests were carried out by using a new designed loading device cooperating with different sensors and markers to achieve above goals main objectives focus on a assess the ability of p y model suggested by matlock 1970 using in the discussed situation b estimate cyclic effect on system stiffness and relevant influence parameters c investigate and evaluate the occurrence of soil softening zone ssz and gapping effect during cyclic test based on presented studies some conclusions related to the validity of existing guidance are provided 2 background of iwt and model test in order to explain the difference between iwt and owt installed in sandy site a brief introduction of iwt is presented at first china has three main resource types of wind power 1 onshore type 2 offshore intertidal type 3 offshore medium to deep water type li 2010 last two types are mainstreams for offshore wind power in china as shown in fig 1 as defined by china energy bureau and the state oceanic administration intertidal zone is the area between low and high tide marks along the shoreline and with water depths below 10 m see fig 2 it is a unique designation used only in china so far and these areas are mainly located in shandong jiangsu and zhejiang province as shown in fig 1 compared with wind turbine in medium deep offshore area intertidal wind power has considerable advantage in costs of installation and maintenance which leads to advantage in electricity price since 2014 electricity price of intertidal and offshore wind power are 0 75 and 0 85 chinese yuan respectively national development and reform commission 2014 geological condition of intertidal zone in china had been discussed by some researchers e g li et al 2000 fan et al 2004 typical geological condition of intertidal zone contains a considerable thickness of silt clay or mud in upper layer with undrained shear strength less than 15 kpa cai et al 2010 a potential intertidal wind farm located in zhejiang province was selected as prototype for the model test the maximum value of high tide level reaches 5 59 m in this area while minimum low tide level is 3 16 m soil profiles of the site are shown in fig 3 and table 1 as soft marine clay mainly distributed in shallow depth piled foundation in this site requires a relatively long embedded length to provide enough lateral resistance for iwt poulos and hull 1989 suggested a criterion to estimate critical length l c of laterally loaded piles embedded length of pile less than l c 3 may be considered as rigid pile 1 l c 4 44 e p i p e s 0 25 where e p i p is bending stiffness of pile e s is young s modulus of soil suppose there is a prototype iwt installed in the discussed area monopile with bending modulus of 210 gpa diameter of 5 m wall thickness of 5 cm and length of 50 m would be appropriate for this case average young s modulus of soil around pile is typically less than 10 mpa therefore l c is less than 56 m with rough estimation and pile with embedded length of 50 m larger than l c 3 18 m should be considered as flexible pile in contrast monopile installed in sand is typically rigid with slenderness ratio embedded length to outer diameter values less than 10 e g achmus et al 2009a peng et al 2011 a number of researchers have postulated that the pile response and failure mechanism depends on the flexibility of the pile itself e g budhu and davies 1987 doherty and gavin 2011b failure mode of short rigid pile is rigid body rotation while for long flexible pile is formation of plastic hinge broms 1964 besides stiffness of monopile installed in sand was observed to increase as a result of cyclic loading leblanc et al 2010b in contrast stiffness of monopile installed in clay degraded with the number of cycles bhattacharya et al 2013a therefore model test with flexible monopile installed in soft marine clay under cyclic lateral load would have considerable difference from those of stiff monopile installed in sand 3 experimental setup in order to study the cyclic deformation and stiffness degradation behavior of iwt with monopile a series model tests were conducted tests were carried out on a scaled pile soil model subjected to static and cyclic lateral load 3 1 similitude relationships as in situ iwt involves complex aerodynamic and hydrodynamic response coupling with structure pile soil interaction no physical modeling technique can simultaneously satisfy all similarity at a single scale therefore it is suitable to study the underlying mechanics physics of the problem based on the model tests recognizing that not all the interactions can be scaled accurately in a particular test lombardi et al 2013 in this work the following parameters are considered important for designing model test a requirement for similarity of cyclic degradation behavior of soil so in situ marine soil was used in the model test to capture the cyclic behavior b requirement for similarity of inputting load with small amplitude large cycle numbers and low frequency a new designed loading device was fabricated and validated which can output stable cyclic lateral load with required amplitude frequency and cycle numbers c requirement for similarity of flexibility of pile soil system model foundation was designed with two layers which contained a sand layer at bottom and a marine soil layer at top model pile was fixed into steel base and then embedded in sand layer therefore pile toe was fixed with negligible rotation and lateral deflection which could simulate boundary condition exceeding the critical length of flexible pile dimensions of prototype and model pile soil system are shown in table 2 and geometrical scale λ is 100 respectively some inherent drawback should be noted that a soil structure in situ stress field and cyclic behavior e g threshold shear strain degradation of shear modulus of soil could not fulfill similarity required by scaling law besides similarity of model soil is controlled by undrained shear strength c u where the target c u should be equivalent to the c u of in situ soil however due to remodeling and saturation c u of model soil is slightly less than that in in situ condition b environmental load is simplified as one way cyclic load with different load levels and same frequency other influence factors such as type of cyclic loading rate and frequency of cyclic loading loading direction are beyond the scope of presented model tests c pile soil system in model test is designed as flexible pile while pile slenderness is not fully conserved d saturated soil condition during the whole test could not conserve daily tide movement at in situ site however it is believed that presented model tests could still capture some cyclic characteristics of in situ condition and be of value to propose 3 2 sample preparation 3 2 1 model pile model pile was fabricated from a hollow circular pvc tube with an outer diameter of 50 mm and a wall thickness of 5 mm total length of the pile was 1000 mm with embedded length of 700 mm model pile was pre punched for installing strain gauges elastic modulus and bending stiffness of pre punched model pile was test as 3 8 gpa and 0 4 kn m2 respectively total 10 pairs of strain gauges were preset along the outer surface of pile with an interval of 50 mm waterproof work of strain gaguages were conducted and checked before each test see fig 4 3 2 2 model soil model soils contained two layers a a sand layer at the bottom b upper layer with silt clay contain mud sampled from in situ site which was remolded and saturated soil profile eventually consisted of a layer of remolded marine clay in situ silt clay contain mud with thickness of 600 mm and a layer of sand with thickness of 200 mm the sand layer acted as a base drainage layer and provided fixation for pile toe pile was fixed in steel base at pile toe see fig 8 a as influence of cyclic load applied to pile mainly concentrated on shallow depth load induced pore water pressure should be negligible in sand layer marine clay used in test was remolded and saturated before each test so vane shear tests were carried out to measure the exact undrained shear strength of model soil see fig 5 results from vane shear tests are shown in fig 6 note s1 refers to static test c1 c2 and c3 refer to cyclic tests it is shown that presented four tests have similar soil strength which could be considered as same condition 3 2 3 model set up 1 g model tests were carried out in a strongbox at the key laboratory of high speed railway engineering ministry of education in southwest jiaotong university the strongbox has an internal dimension of 100 cm long 100 cm wide and 90 cm deep the sketch of test is shown in fig 7 a model pile was installed into sand layer for 100 mm besides both static and cyclic lateral load were applied at the position 200 mm above the mudline two types of monitor systems were used in static and cyclic tests individually in static test a load cell and a linear variable differential transformer lvdt were attached to the loading device to monitor the load deflection behavior of model pile besides strain gauges were preset along the outer surface of model pile to obtain the static p y curve at different depth in cyclic tests additional monitor devices were preset around pile as shown in fig 7 b and c including pore water pressure meter in soil and laser displacement meter ldm combined with markers at soil surface it should be noted that steel sheet and steel nail were used as markers in cyclic tests thin steel sheets were partial inserted into soil surface see steel sheet in fig 7 b and c one ldm was point to pile head near mudline to measure the deflection of pile point a in fig 7 b in addition two ldms were point to steel sheets to measure their lateral deflection during cyclic tests steel nails were partial inserted into soil and a recording camera was used to monitor the deflection of steel nails during cyclic tests as thin steel sheet and steel nail are relatively stiff it is assumed that lateral deflection of above markers is equivalent to soil at the same position therefore the deformation of soil surface during cyclic load could be obtained indirectly to prepare the test sample in cyclic tests following steps were carried out 1 sand was filled in the strongbox and compacted to the thickness of 100 mm at first and then steel base was placed at the center of strongbox model pile preset with strain gauges was inserted into steel base see fig 8 a and sand was filled in the strongbox and compacted to another thickness of 100 mm to provide fixation for pile toe 2 marine soil was remolded and saturated before each test after that marine soil was put into the strongbox and eventually reached the thickness of 600 mm see fig 8 b during filling the marine soil pore water pressure meters were installed at the designed position see fig 7 b consolidation was conducted by applying a constant pressure at a rigid lid placed at the soil surface for 1 day as constrained modulus e s and permeability coefficient k of test soil is approximately 8 mpa and 10 9 m s coefficient of consolidation c v is 8 10 7 m2 s based on consolidation theory lambe and whitman 1969 non dimensional time factor t t c v t h 2 equals to 0 768 and average consolidation ratio u is approximately 90 after one day consolidation once consolidation was complete masses placed at the soil surface were removed to create the overconsolidated soil sample finally van shear test was carried at the position closed to the edge of strongbox to avoid disturbance to cyclic test 3 after sample preparation steel sheets and steel nails were placed on the soil surface as shown in fig 7 c ldms were fixed at the edge of strongbox and pointed to pile head and steel sheets as shown in fig 7 b finally loading device was connected to model pile at designed position see fig 9 3 3 loading device the static loading used in the static test was applied through a servo controlled hydraulic actuator load cell and lvdt were attached to the actuator rod to measure the load deflection behavior of pile in contrast cyclic test requires inputting load representing the main characteristics of offshore loading conditions the consideration of a single wave or wind gust could not possibly represent the offshore loading conditions since aerodynamic and hydrodynamic conditions are irregular and stochastic in nature situation could be more sophisticated by considering daily tide movement for iwt and the structure will be subject to billions of load cycles e g 108 suggested by achmus et al 2009b of different magnitude during its lifetime therefore it is typical to simplify the environmental loading as a uniform harmonic cyclic shear stress in the scaled model test scaled model test which used different loading device to input simplified cyclic loading can be divided into two categories 1 studying the dynamic behavior of foundation including resonance problem e g lombardi et al 2013 nikitas et al 2016 guo et al 2015 yu et al 2015 2 studying the cumulative behavior of foundation including accumulated deformation and cyclic p y curve problems e g roesen et al 2012 peralta and achmus 2010 leblanc et al 2010a for studying the cumulative behavior of foundation in presented model test loading device needs high reliability and stability to apply cyclic lateral load to model pile therefore this paper presents a new designed loading device to apply steady cyclic lateral load to model pile as shown in fig 10 a loading device contains three main parts 1 power part 2 driving part 3 steel frame the working principle of this loading device is based on the moment balance of mass on the track mass m2 is lined to spring at one side and motor at another side while operating the motor m2 is forced two way moving in a controllable range on the track due to moment balance at the rotation point in fig 10 c track is then forced to rotate and apply load to pile as m1 and m2 in fig 10 a can be made with different weight variable amplitude and frequency of cyclic load can be applied to the model pile after manufactured the device validation work was proposed comparison between desired input and actual output load is shown in fig 11 it is proved that the device is capable of outputting steady cyclic loading 3 4 test program typical design situations for offshore wind turbine include 1 ultimate limit states uls 2 fatigue limit states fls 3 accidental limit states als 4 serviceability limit states sls the uls uses non degraded soil parameters while other limit states use cyclically degraded soil properties for design feld and waegter 2002 besides dnv gl as 2016 suggests that for offshore monopoles one of the tolerances is specified which is an upper limit for the accumulated permanent rotation of the pile head due to the history of sls loads applied to the monopile throughout the design life in order to quantify the effect of cyclic loading in sls situation different loading conditions are designed in the model tests leblanc et al 2010a suggested applying cyclic load with amplitude proportional of the static capacity the cyclic load ratio is defined as follows 2 ξ f c f u s c where f c is cyclic load f usc is ultimate static capacity therefore a static test was performed at first to determine the ultimate static capacity f usc after that three cyclic tests were performed under cyclic loading with amplitude proportional to f usc the test programs are summarized in table 3 4 summary of the test results 4 1 static response 4 1 1 load deflection behavior one static test was carried out at first while applied lateral load increased with 15 n per step ultimate lateral capacity ulc can be estimated by using the criterion suggested by broms 1960 which assumed the ultimate conditions appeared at deflections corresponding to 20 of pile diameter d for small diameter driven piles so the model pile was pushed laterally until reaching lateral deflection of 0 2d figs 12 14 show the results in static test load deflection curve for static test is shown in fig 12 measured lateral deflection of pile is normalized by dividing the value with pile diameter as shown in fig 12 fusc is approximately 100 n deflection along pile during static test is shown in fig 13 rotation point of pile deflection is close to 25 cm 5d below the soil surface moment along the pile is shown in fig 13 which shows that the moment increase with the amplitude of applied lateral load furthermore it is showed that moment reaches maximum at the depth near 25 cm 5d below the soil surface as shown in figs 13 and 14 deformation of pile in mainly constrains in the upper part of model pile the failure model is close to the formation of plastic hinge so the model pile can be defined as flexible pile which fulfills the target pile slenderness 4 1 2 static p y curves derivation of p y curves used methods suggested by yang and liang 2006 3 m z e i ε c 4 p d 2 m d z 2 5 y m e i d z 2 where c is outer radius of the pile ei is bending stiffness of the pile ε is strain value measured for a particular depth z along the pile embedment length p is soil reaction y is displacement of pile derivations of p y curves involve follow steps first bending moment is calculated by using eq 3 to obtain the scatter moment data along pile then p y data at different depth are obtained by using eqs 4 and 5 it should be noted that double integration in eq 5 requires two boundary conditions in this case one boundary condition is pile toe with zero displacement and another boundary condition is obtained from the displacement measured at pile head by using ldm point a in fig 7 b comparison between calculated and suggested p y curves are shown in fig 15 it should be noted that most of the measured data do not reach a plateau corresponding to the ultimate soil reaction it can be observed that test data reveal similar stiffness to api curves at shallow depth 1d however results of p y curves at 2d and 3d show that p y curves from api tend to underestimate the lateral resistance which is consistent with the observation from other researchers murff and hamilton 1993 jeanjean 2009 kim et al 2009 kim et al 2011 gilbert et al 2015 difference in static p y curve may be contributed to soil type and overconsolidation of marine soil besides this may also be understood that increase in soil reaction is probably due to additional component of soil reactions which is introduced by pile rotation in addition to the simple lateral translational mode of deformation implicit in the matlock s and reese s p y curve theory lam 2013 4 2 cyclic response 4 2 1 estimation of accumulation displacement in cyclic tests c1 c2 and c3 pure one way lateral load was applied to the pile with maximum amplitude of 0 3 0 45 and 0 6 times of fusc normalized load deflection curves are measured at pile head point a in fig 7 b which are shown in fig 16 fig 16 shows the average deformation of pile head in three cyclic tests it is observed that test pile develops most accumulated displacement within first 1000 cycles after that increase rate of displacement tends to degrade to negligible values and finally reaches a plateau in last cycles therefore load deflection behavior in three tests can be defined as shakedown or alternating plasticity responses difference between above two responses depends on deflection of pile may stabilize after a number of cycles while dissipation still occurs swane 1983 levy et al 2009 detail discussion is proposed in section 4 2 3 combined with cyclic p y behavior it is also showed in fig 16 that load deflection curve requires more load cycles to reach a plateau with larger amplitude of cyclic load which indicates that cyclic load level could affect the increase rate of accumulation displacement at pile head matlock 1970 reported that equilibrium response of deflections was attained in less than 100 cycles dunnavant and o neill 1989 observed that the pile head displacements stabilize within 200 cycles in the case of submerged stiff clays results in fig 16 have slightly difference with those from above researcher which may contribute to difference in inherent cyclic behavior of soils blue dashed lines in fig 16 refer to the deformation under same load level in static test it is observed that deformation in all three cyclic tests exceed the value in static test in addition deflection of model pile in test c3 exceeds the value in static condition with the least load cycles which indicates that cyclic load level has an obvious effect on accumulated deformation of pile furthermore as noted by dnv 1992 veritas 1992 tests in both clay and sand have shown that long term loads can give deformation 2 to 3 times greater than for short term static conditions the increase will be greater with higher stress level comparison in fig 16 shows that ratios of steady cyclic deformation to static deformation d c d s for three tests are 1 2448 1 3053 and 1 5468 which is consistent with the suggestion from dnv 1992 accumulation of permanent displacements for a cyclic laterally loaded pile has usually been described either by means of logarithmic law or power law e g for the case of pile installed in sand verdure et al 2003 long and vanneste 1994 for the case of pile installed in clay khemakhem et al 2012 therefore the following formulation is employed to estimate the pile head displacements the fitting results are shown in fig 16 with dashed red lines 6 y n α y 0 1 a e n k where y n is lateral displacement of n th cycle y o is lateral displacement induced by static load with same amplitude n is load cycle α a and k is empirical factors shown in table 4 4 2 2 degradation of cyclic stiffness it was reported by several researchers bhattacharya et al 2013b zhang et al 2011 that piled foundation installed in clay could become softer under cyclic loading therefore cyclic stiffness of pile soil system is analyzed with its load deflection behavior normalized load deflection curves measured at pile head are shown in fig 17 fig 17 shows the total normalized resistance h ldc u versus normalized lateral displacement in three cyclic tests h is imposed horizontal load at pile l is embedded length d is pile diameter and c u is average undrained shear strength of soil it is observed that hysteresis loops of pile soil system show translation and rotation under cyclic loading especially for fig 17 c which implies the system accumulates with plastic deformation and stiffness degradation with load cycle increase it is also observed that amplitude and number of cycles have obvious influence on the change law of hysteresis loops with load cycles in order to estimate stiffness degradation in three cyclic tests two kinds of secant stiffness of hysteresis loop are analyzed and given in fig 18 a fig 18 b and c show relationships of absolute secant stiffness ass and cyclic secant stiffness css changing with load cycles in three cyclic tests which is defined in fig 18 a s c is stiffness of n th cycle of load deflection curve s c0 is stiffness of 1 th cycle of load deflection curve as shown in fig 18 c css has a considerable degradation in initial cycles and gradually decrease in subsequent cycles in three cyclic tests css decrease about 10 40 percent within the first 1000 cycles of cyclic load gilbert et al 2015 observed a similar reduction in css for about 20 30 percent in model test with pile installed in kaolinite and gulf of mexico marine clay under constant target tilt at pile head it is also shown in fig 18 b and c that cyclic load with larger amplitude leads to more degradation in both ass and css this observation can be linked to load deflection behavior at pile head shown in fig 16 while larger load level induces more deformation at pile head besides this phenomenon can also be linked to the stress strain behavior of clayey soil the stiffness and strength of clayey soil decrease when it subjects to cyclic load inducing deformation exceeded threshold shear strain in undrained condition mortezaie and vucetic 2016 both iwt and owt are frequency sensitive structures as shown in fig 19 nature frequency of owt is typically designed within soft stiff range dnv 2002 suggests that the natural frequency of the wind turbine should be at least 10 away from the 1 p and 2 p 3 p frequencies where 1 p and 2p 3 p refer to rotor frequency and blade passing frequency hence natural frequency of owt is limited to a relative small range and sensitive to external disturbance malhotra 2007 reported that for a typical monopile lowering the natural frequency of the foundation by a small amount 5 8 will have a dramatic effect on fatigue as css represents the stiffness of pile soil system it can be linked to the natural frequency of owt indirectly wang et al 2016 reported a rough estimation of influence of stiffness degradation on natural frequency it is showed that with soil stiffness decrease 10 50 during load cycles natural frequency of the foundation could decrease nearly 4 6 6 6 as shown in fig 18 c css decreases nearly 40 after 5000 load cycles in test c3 which indicates that there may be a considerable decrease in the natural frequency because iwt in china mainly located in the area suffering from extreme event such as seasonal typhoon environmental load during extreme event could exceed design load even wind turbine stop operating results in fig 18 imply that even iwt remain acceptable lateral deformation under cyclic load with high load level decrease of system stiffness could lead to dramatic change in natural frequency and which may cause the system vulnerable to potential resonance 4 2 3 cyclic p y curves in order to analyze the cyclic p y curves a brief review of p y curves for soft clay is presented at first api rp2a adopted the soft clay criterion developed by matlock 1970 based on four lateral load tests on a 12 75 inch diameter 323 85 mm steel pipe pile at two soft clay sites in texas that had been ponded to simulate offshore conditions besides p y curves formulated for cyclic loading conditions are based on field tests with fewer than 200 cycles as shown in fig 20 matlock 1970 takes cyclic effect into account by reducing maximum soil resistance after the deformation of pile reaching three times of y c which is defined as 2 5 ε 50 d the value which refers to average normal strain in the direction of pile movement in the soil around the pile kagawa and kraft 1980 was used by matlock 1970 following the concept originally proposed by skempton 1951 for footing settlement problems value of ε 50 is varied for different soil and had been discussed by sullivan et al 1980 ebrahimian and nazari 2013 it is also implied from fig 20 that cyclic effect only corresponds to ε 50 and pile diameter however results from triaxial test show that clayey soil could have considerable difference in cyclic behavior due to internal soil properties and external loading condition e g matasovic and vucetic 1995 mortezaie and vucetic 2013 mortezaie and vucetic 2016 in order to estimate the influence factors of cyclic p y curve backbone curve of cyclic p y curves at different depth are shown in fig 21 as shown in fig 16 increase of deformation at pile head mainly concentrates within the first 1000 cycles therefore p y curves at three stages are chosen to illustrate in fig 21 which includes a 0 10 cycles initial stage b 100 110 cycles developing stage c 1000 1010 cycles stabilized stage as shown in fig 21 p y curves from test c1 behave in an elastic manner with no observable change in hysteric loop in contrast observable degradations are occurred in stiffness and hysteric loop in test c2 and c3 therefore as discussed in 4 2 1 load deflection behavior of test c1 can be defined as shakedown response while test c2 and c3 can be defined as alternating plasticity or plastic shakedown response besides there is an observable degradation of stiffness as load cycles increasing from 1 to 10 to 1000 1010 cyclic load with larger amplitude induced more development of damping and plasticity at the same depth as noted by matlock 1970 deterioration in resistance caused by cyclic loading is most severe at shallow depths it can be observed that degradation of p y curves mainly concentrate on shallow depth 1d which is consistent with the suggestion from matlock in addition to ε 50 and pile diameter above results indicate that cyclic effect on p y curves are affected by load cycles load level and depth comparison between measured and suggested p y curves is shown in fig 22 it should be noted that y c equals to 2 5 ε 50 d and skempton 1951 suggested value of ε 50 for soft clay equal to 0 02 so y c is equivalent to 0 0025 m for the discussed case as shown in fig 22 measured cyclic p y curves exhibit decrease of soil reaction when the deformation of pile is smaller than three times of y c comparing with static condition at the same load level decrease of soil reaction in measured p y curves can be estimated by using reduction factor showed in table 5 as shown in table 5 decrease of soil reaction is directly linked to load level and depth cyclic p y curves from matlock 1970 imply that if the shear strains do not exceed the elastic limit of the soil lateral deformation less than 3 y c no degradation should occur however as shown in fig 22 degradation of soil reaction occurs even though deformation is smaller than 3 y c this observation is consistent with the test results from jeanjean 2009 note that this phenomenon is not reported but can be observed from the reported data and gilbert et al 2015 besides results from jeanjean 2009 indicated that both static and cyclic p y curves from model test were stiffer than those from matlock which is not consistent with the static test results in presented test this difference could be contributed to 1 test condition and soil type 2 static p y curves from jeanjean 2009 were far stiffer than those from matlock even cyclic load causing some degradation it still turned out to be slightly stiffer than cyclic p y curves from matlock test results from gilbert et al 2015 indicated that matlock 1970 p y curves tend to underestimate the lateral resistance for all three types of test bed with normal moderately and heavily overconsolidated clay besides secant stiffness was observed decreasing between 20 and 30 percent in both normally consolidated and overconsolidated clay and observed in both kaolin and gulf of mexico marine clay it should be noted that matlock 1970 method is suggest for soft normally consolidated clay while model soil in the presents tests is overconsolidated marine clay so difference in p y curves could be induced by ocr of soil however it is still not clear that whether influence of ocr on p y curves is negligible for marine clay used in the presented test therefore further studies are required 4 2 4 pore water pressure induced by cyclic load four pore water pressure meters were preset near pile as shown in figs 7 b and 23 these sensors were designed to measure of pore water pressure pwp accumulated in so called near field and free field ashour and norris 2003 position of p1 is 350 mm under soil surface 7d which is close to inflection point of bending moment in static test position of p2 is 200 mm under soil surface 4d which is close to maximum value of bending moment in static test position of p3 is 50 mm under soil surface 1d and close to pile position of p4 is 50 mm under soil surface and 50 mm 1d away from pile which is directly under the steel sheet at soil surface pwp induced by cyclic load in test c3 is shown in fig 24 normalized pwp is calculated using follow equation 7 δ u n δ u n σ v c where δ u n is normalized pwp δ u n is measured pwp σ v c is overburden vertical stress it can be observed that pwp in p1 decrease in about first 1000 cycles and turns to increase till 5000 cycles this can be linked to deflection at pile head because deflection of pile at the position same as p1 become steady after 1000 cycles of load negative pwp keep decreasing as position of p1 is at the back of pile moving direction negative pwp may be the result of suction stresses developing during the test similar phenomenon had been reported by bauer and kempfert 2016 pwp in p2 keeps accumulating during the whole cyclic test even deflection at pile head becoming steady this may be understood that position of p2 is 4d away beneath the ground surface and test soil with low permeability could not drain during the test in addition increase rate of pwp in p2 becomes slight declining after deflection at pile head reaching plateau it should be noted that pwp in p1 and p2 shows different behavior this may contributed to that pwp in p1 and p2 were induced by suction and pressure from pile movement and negative pwp may dissipate easier as static pore water field was positive during the test pwp in p3 and p4 have a similar trend with accumulation of pwp in less than 1000 cycles and then become steady in the rest of loading cycles besides oscillating and decreasing of pwp in p3 may be linked to the opening of gap furthermore maximum pwp in p4 is less than pwp in p3 which indicates that influence of cyclic load is degraded nearly 17 through 1d range it can be noted that accumulation of pwp at shallow depth can be linked to gradually stabilize of deflection at pile head this highlights the importance of considering the coupling effects between soil stress and pwp in design nevertheless pwp in p2 and p1 are sophisticated to fully understand and could be linked to permeability and position corresponding to the movement direction of pile due to limited and scattered pwp sensors in present tests further studies are required 4 2 5 evolution of soil surface gap and soil softening zone ssz around pile in clayey foundation had been reported by other researchers as discussed in introduction section it is a macro phenomenon induced by partial failure of lateral loaded pile soil system which is typically occurring in clayey foundation comparing with subsidence in sandy foundation however formation and estimation method of gap and ssz are not yet clearly discussed in literature zhang et al 2011 suggested that reduction in pile soil stiffness is caused by opening of a gap near soil surface which provides a pathway for free water to pass down the pile surface kagawa and kraft 1980 suggested that more than 70 of the pile displacement concentrated in soil mass within 1d in the presented tests ldms and two types of markers are used to measure the evolution of soil surface fig 25 a and b show that the gap alternatively opens and closes while squeezing the entrapped water and forcing it upward it can be seen from fig 25 c that there is an obvious upheaval at the front of pile and opening of gap at the back of pile after test above observations indicate that opening of gap is corresponding to the number of cyclic cycles which may be linked to the degradation of soil stiffness and dissipation of pwp discussed in the former section besides some observable crack was formed at the two sides of pile and extended to the direction perpendicular to applied cyclic load this may be linked to the shear tendency induced by pile movement at these sides smith 1987 in addition it is observed from fig 25 d and e that the gap eventually formed about 2d in depth and 9 mm in wide after test as the depth of gap gradually exceeds the depth installed pore water pressure meter at p3 see fig 23 change of drainage pathway could be linked to the oscillating of pwp measured at p3 fig 26 shows the picture recorded by camera during one load cycle as shown in fig 26 a and b markers beyond the range of 1d show negligible deflection during one load cycle in contrast deflection of markers steel nail located at 30 to load direction was observed with negligible deformation measured deflection of two steel sheets in test c3 is shown in fig 27 which is assumed equivalent to the deflection of soil as show in fig 27 measured deflection at two points keep increasing in first two hundred cycles and then reach a steady plateau changing of deflection at point b and c are consistent with the value measured at pile head in addition it is also showed that more than 80 of deflection concentrating in soil mass within 1d which is slightly larger than the value suggested by kagawa and kraft 1980 due to one way cyclic loading maximum deflection in point c is about 80 of that in point b difference between deflection at point b and c reflects the tilting of ssz which is consistent with the phenomenon observed in fig 25 c 5 conclusion and discussion this paper has reported a series of 1 g model tests estimated response of flexible pile embedded in overconsolidated soft marine clay and subjected to static and cyclic lateral load a new designed loading device was applied in cyclic test to output steady lateral load one static and three cyclic tests with various load levels were carried out in same test condition different sensors and markers were preset in the test model to measure the responses including cyclic deflection at pile head degradation of system stiffness cyclic p y curves pore water pressure in soil and forming of soil softening zone key observations from presented tests are as follow 1 lateral deflection at pile head develops most accumulated displacement within first 1000 cycles while displacement of test under larger load level requires more cycles to reach steady plateau in addition cyclic loading induces about 1 2 1 5 times of displacement at pile head comparing with same amplitude of static load furthermore lateral deflection at pile head can be fitted with presented formulation which considers effect of loading cycles and displacement in static condition 2 cyclic load with amplitude corresponding to 30 60 of uls induces degradation of system stiffness about 10 40 percent in first 1000 cycles while larger load level induces more degradation of stiffness 3 static p y derived from the test is consistent with that suggested by matlock 1970 with slightly stiffer behavior however measured cyclic p y curves become softer than suggested p y curves even deformation do not exceed elastic limit 3 y c suggested by matlock besides cyclic reduction factor for soil reaction which is linked to load level and depth are presented based on test results from static and cyclic tests 4 observation in test c3 shows that pwp at shallow depth p3 and p4 shows similar behavior to displacement at pile head which increases mainly in first 1000 cycles and reaches steady in the rest cycles in addition comparison of p3 and p4 shows that maximum pwp decrease about 67 within 1d range in the same direction with cyclic load 5 observation of makers at soil surface shows that cyclic load mainly induces observable deformation in soil mass within 1d range in the same direction as applied load measured displacement of steel sheets by using ldm indicates that more than 80 of deflections concentrating in soil mass within 1d difference between deflections at two steel sheets reflects tilting of soil softening zone which can explain the formation of upheaval and gap in soil after test observed results are mainly discussed with the cyclic effect on lateral response of pile in overconsolidated marine clay results from presented four tests indicate that available design method may underestimate cyclic lateral response of monopile installed in this type of site it is important to note that wind turbine is typically a system combined with three main parts 1 blades rotor and nacelle 2 tower and transition piece 3 monopile while blades tower and transition piece contribute most load to the system resistance of the system is provided only by pile soil interaction normal operation of a wind turbine mainly depends on working condition of blade rotor nacelle part which requires reasonable and controllable permanent deformation displacement criteria suggested by dnv gl as 2016 therefore comprehensive study of wind turbine should consider both system disturbance and resistance in the same time which requires analysis of fluid structure interaction including coupling of aerodynamic hydrodynamic and pile soil interaction it should be noted that presented model tests only focus on reproducing the pile soil interaction of monopile foundation however coupling of environmental load with upper systems such as blade rotor nacelle and tower transition parts is neglected in the presented tests as suggested by gl 2005 changing of system stiffness and damping induced by cyclic load is contributed mostly to foundation part therefore test results could be used to assess most part of cyclic effect on system load deflection behavior and they also foreshadow potential approaches to the re assessment of cyclic p y behavior

23719,while monopile foundation is widely used at sandy site in europe it is designed and constructed in intertidal zone used only in china so far comparing with sandy site intertidal site typically has different geological and environmental conditions due to upper layer consisting of soft marine clay and daily tide movement which may lead to considerable difference in long term behavior of monopile in order to investigate the cyclic lateral behavior of monopile constructed in intertidal zone several scaled model tests were conducted the scaled monopile soil system contained in situ soil from intertidal zone was tested with a new designed loading device under static and cyclic lateral load behavior of monopile soil system was obtained and analyzed which includes assessment of cyclic deformation at pile head estimation of static and cyclic p y curves dissipation behavior of pore water pressure evaluation of gapping effect and soil softening zone discussion and suggestion for

development during 2014 nearly 92 offshore wind turbine had been constructed in european countries gwec 2014 meanwhile china had ranked fifth with installed capacity reaching 669 9 mw in 2014 he et al 2016 although monopile is used widely in europe due to site condition and limitation of installation equipment first offshore wind farm dong hai bridge wind farm constructed in china used high rise pile group foundation in the meantime a unique compromise design by using monopile in intertidal zone was developed rapidly korsnes 2014 in 2014 intertidal wind turbine iwt in china reached 56 69 of installed capacity which used monopile in general cwea 2014 in current guidelines for offshore wind turbine owt requirements of serviceability limit state sls typically dominate the whole design arany et al 2015 for assessment of lateral behavior of owt during sls effects of cyclic loading should be considered with cautious to evaluate accumulated deformation and nature frequency change arany et al 2017 at present available design standards e g api 2014 american petroleum institute 2014a american petroleum institute 2014b dnv gl as 2016 only provide simplified p y curve methods to assess the influence of cyclic effect on lateral behavior for owt during sls the api code which is based on analysis works from matlock 1970 and reese and welch 1975 recommends considering cyclic effect by scaling maximum ultimate lateral resistance down by a factor of 0 72 within a specific depth for clayey site case after that matlock 1979 bhattacharya et al 2006 proposed a modification by changing the factor from 0 72 to 0 5 to account for cyclic effect however available studies show a considerable difference between measured and recommended p y curves e g murff and hamilton 1993 jeanjean 2009 doherty and gavin 2011a gilbert et al 2015 in addition observation in model tests with owt in clayey foundation also shows that stiffness of p y curve also consider as stiffness of pile soil system tends to decrease in shallow depth and leads to an observable zone of soil softening at soil surface around pile e g lombardi et al 2013 hamiltong and murff 1995 zhang et al 2011 zakeri et al 2015 although conventional p y method from api code has been questioned by many researchers no generally accepted design procedure yet exists estimation of lateral capacity of iwt during sls remains using p y curve method suggested by api in the present state of the art similar to owt iwt is slender columns with a heavy mass on top and therefore is dynamically sensitive structure however comparing with rigid monopile in sandy foundation leblanc et al 2010a doherty et al 2012 ahmed and hawlader 2016 monopile installed in intertidal area behaves mostly as flexible pile soil system with large embedded length besides intertidal site typically contains soft sensitive clayey soil at the top of foundation in general e g di et al 2013 which could lead to unexpected cyclic degradation of pile soil system under cyclic loading furthermore environmental load of iwt is different from owt in hydro dynamic analysis due to daily tide movement which could also induce severe scour around foundation therefore using p y curve method to estimate lateral behavior of iwt remains questionable and requires further verification this paper focuses on assessing the cumulative behavior of monopile installed in intertidal like foundation subjected to one way cyclic lateral load a series of 1 g model tests were conducted to investigate the behavior of long fixed bottom pile in overconsolidated marine clay subjected to cyclic lateral load one static and three cyclic tests were carried out individually with the same pile soil condition static test was conducted to study the static behavior of pile soil system three cyclic tests with different load levels were designed to study the behavior of system under different serviceability state in addition cyclic model tests were carried out by using a new designed loading device cooperating with different sensors and markers to achieve above goals main objectives focus on a assess the ability of p y model suggested by matlock 1970 using in the discussed situation b estimate cyclic effect on system stiffness and relevant influence parameters c investigate and evaluate the occurrence of soil softening zone ssz and gapping effect during cyclic test based on presented studies some conclusions related to the validity of existing guidance are provided 2 background of iwt and model test in order to explain the difference between iwt and owt installed in sandy site a brief introduction of iwt is presented at first china has three main resource types of wind power 1 onshore type 2 offshore intertidal type 3 offshore medium to deep water type li 2010 last two types are mainstreams for offshore wind power in china as shown in fig 1 as defined by china energy bureau and the state oceanic administration intertidal zone is the area between low and high tide marks along the shoreline and with water depths below 10 m see fig 2 it is a unique designation used only in china so far and these areas are mainly located in shandong jiangsu and zhejiang province as shown in fig 1 compared with wind turbine in medium deep offshore area intertidal wind power has considerable advantage in costs of installation and maintenance which leads to advantage in electricity price since 2014 electricity price of intertidal and offshore wind power are 0 75 and 0 85 chinese yuan respectively national development and reform commission 2014 geological condition of intertidal zone in china had been discussed by some researchers e g li et al 2000 fan et al 2004 typical geological condition of intertidal zone contains a considerable thickness of silt clay or mud in upper layer with undrained shear strength less than 15 kpa cai et al 2010 a potential intertidal wind farm located in zhejiang province was selected as prototype for the model test the maximum value of high tide level reaches 5 59 m in this area while minimum low tide level is 3 16 m soil profiles of the site are shown in fig 3 and table 1 as soft marine clay mainly distributed in shallow depth piled foundation in this site requires a relatively long embedded length to provide enough lateral resistance for iwt poulos and hull 1989 suggested a criterion to estimate critical length l c of laterally loaded piles embedded length of pile less than l c 3 may be considered as rigid pile 1 l c 4 44 e p i p e s 0 25 where e p i p is bending stiffness of pile e s is young s modulus of soil suppose there is a prototype iwt installed in the discussed area monopile with bending modulus of 210 gpa diameter of 5 m wall thickness of 5 cm and length of 50 m would be appropriate for this case average young s modulus of soil around pile is typically less than 10 mpa therefore l c is less than 56 m with rough estimation and pile with embedded length of 50 m larger than l c 3 18 m should be considered as flexible pile in contrast monopile installed in sand is typically rigid with slenderness ratio embedded length to outer diameter values less than 10 e g achmus et al 2009a peng et al 2011 a number of researchers have postulated that the pile response and failure mechanism depends on the flexibility of the pile itself e g budhu and davies 1987 doherty and gavin 2011b failure mode of short rigid pile is rigid body rotation while for long flexible pile is formation of plastic hinge broms 1964 besides stiffness of monopile installed in sand was observed to increase as a result of cyclic loading leblanc et al 2010b in contrast stiffness of monopile installed in clay degraded with the number of cycles bhattacharya et al 2013a therefore model test with flexible monopile installed in soft marine clay under cyclic lateral load would have considerable difference from those of stiff monopile installed in sand 3 experimental setup in order to study the cyclic deformation and stiffness degradation behavior of iwt with monopile a series model tests were conducted tests were carried out on a scaled pile soil model subjected to static and cyclic lateral load 3 1 similitude relationships as in situ iwt involves complex aerodynamic and hydrodynamic response coupling with structure pile soil interaction no physical modeling technique can simultaneously satisfy all similarity at a single scale therefore it is suitable to study the underlying mechanics physics of the problem based on the model tests recognizing that not all the interactions can be scaled accurately in a particular test lombardi et al 2013 in this work the following parameters are considered important for designing model test a requirement for similarity of cyclic degradation behavior of soil so in situ marine soil was used in the model test to capture the cyclic behavior b requirement for similarity of inputting load with small amplitude large cycle numbers and low frequency a new designed loading device was fabricated and validated which can output stable cyclic lateral load with required amplitude frequency and cycle numbers c requirement for similarity of flexibility of pile soil system model foundation was designed with two layers which contained a sand layer at bottom and a marine soil layer at top model pile was fixed into steel base and then embedded in sand layer therefore pile toe was fixed with negligible rotation and lateral deflection which could simulate boundary condition exceeding the critical length of flexible pile dimensions of prototype and model pile soil system are shown in table 2 and geometrical scale λ is 100 respectively some inherent drawback should be noted that a soil structure in situ stress field and cyclic behavior e g threshold shear strain degradation of shear modulus of soil could not fulfill similarity required by scaling law besides similarity of model soil is controlled by undrained shear strength c u where the target c u should be equivalent to the c u of in situ soil however due to remodeling and saturation c u of model soil is slightly less than that in in situ condition b environmental load is simplified as one way cyclic load with different load levels and same frequency other influence factors such as type of cyclic loading rate and frequency of cyclic loading loading direction are beyond the scope of presented model tests c pile soil system in model test is designed as flexible pile while pile slenderness is not fully conserved d saturated soil condition during the whole test could not conserve daily tide movement at in situ site however it is believed that presented model tests could still capture some cyclic characteristics of in situ condition and be of value to propose 3 2 sample preparation 3 2 1 model pile model pile was fabricated from a hollow circular pvc tube with an outer diameter of 50 mm and a wall thickness of 5 mm total length of the pile was 1000 mm with embedded length of 700 mm model pile was pre punched for installing strain gauges elastic modulus and bending stiffness of pre punched model pile was test as 3 8 gpa and 0 4 kn m2 respectively total 10 pairs of strain gauges were preset along the outer surface of pile with an interval of 50 mm waterproof work of strain gaguages were conducted and checked before each test see fig 4 3 2 2 model soil model soils contained two layers a a sand layer at the bottom b upper layer with silt clay contain mud sampled from in situ site which was remolded and saturated soil profile eventually consisted of a layer of remolded marine clay in situ silt clay contain mud with thickness of 600 mm and a layer of sand with thickness of 200 mm the sand layer acted as a base drainage layer and provided fixation for pile toe pile was fixed in steel base at pile toe see fig 8 a as influence of cyclic load applied to pile mainly concentrated on shallow depth load induced pore water pressure should be negligible in sand layer marine clay used in test was remolded and saturated before each test so vane shear tests were carried out to measure the exact undrained shear strength of model soil see fig 5 results from vane shear tests are shown in fig 6 note s1 refers to static test c1 c2 and c3 refer to cyclic tests it is shown that presented four tests have similar soil strength which could be considered as same condition 3 2 3 model set up 1 g model tests were carried out in a strongbox at the key laboratory of high speed railway engineering ministry of education in southwest jiaotong university the strongbox has an internal dimension of 100 cm long 100 cm wide and 90 cm deep the sketch of test is shown in fig 7 a model pile was installed into sand layer for 100 mm besides both static and cyclic lateral load were applied at the position 200 mm above the mudline two types of monitor systems were used in static and cyclic tests individually in static test a load cell and a linear variable differential transformer lvdt were attached to the loading device to monitor the load deflection behavior of model pile besides strain gauges were preset along the outer surface of model pile to obtain the static p y curve at different depth in cyclic tests additional monitor devices were preset around pile as shown in fig 7 b and c including pore water pressure meter in soil and laser displacement meter ldm combined with markers at soil surface it should be noted that steel sheet and steel nail were used as markers in cyclic tests thin steel sheets were partial inserted into soil surface see steel sheet in fig 7 b and c one ldm was point to pile head near mudline to measure the deflection of pile point a in fig 7 b in addition two ldms were point to steel sheets to measure their lateral deflection during cyclic tests steel nails were partial inserted into soil and a recording camera was used to monitor the deflection of steel nails during cyclic tests as thin steel sheet and steel nail are relatively stiff it is assumed that lateral deflection of above markers is equivalent to soil at the same position therefore the deformation of soil surface during cyclic load could be obtained indirectly to prepare the test sample in cyclic tests following steps were carried out 1 sand was filled in the strongbox and compacted to the thickness of 100 mm at first and then steel base was placed at the center of strongbox model pile preset with strain gauges was inserted into steel base see fig 8 a and sand was filled in the strongbox and compacted to another thickness of 100 mm to provide fixation for pile toe 2 marine soil was remolded and saturated before each test after that marine soil was put into the strongbox and eventually reached the thickness of 600 mm see fig 8 b during filling the marine soil pore water pressure meters were installed at the designed position see fig 7 b consolidation was conducted by applying a constant pressure at a rigid lid placed at the soil surface for 1 day as constrained modulus e s and permeability coefficient k of test soil is approximately 8 mpa and 10 9 m s coefficient of consolidation c v is 8 10 7 m2 s based on consolidation theory lambe and whitman 1969 non dimensional time factor t t c v t h 2 equals to 0 768 and average consolidation ratio u is approximately 90 after one day consolidation once consolidation was complete masses placed at the soil surface were removed to create the overconsolidated soil sample finally van shear test was carried at the position closed to the edge of strongbox to avoid disturbance to cyclic test 3 after sample preparation steel sheets and steel nails were placed on the soil surface as shown in fig 7 c ldms were fixed at the edge of strongbox and pointed to pile head and steel sheets as shown in fig 7 b finally loading device was connected to model pile at designed position see fig 9 3 3 loading device the static loading used in the static test was applied through a servo controlled hydraulic actuator load cell and lvdt were attached to the actuator rod to measure the load deflection behavior of pile in contrast cyclic test requires inputting load representing the main characteristics of offshore loading conditions the consideration of a single wave or wind gust could not possibly represent the offshore loading conditions since aerodynamic and hydrodynamic conditions are irregular and stochastic in nature situation could be more sophisticated by considering daily tide movement for iwt and the structure will be subject to billions of load cycles e g 108 suggested by achmus et al 2009b of different magnitude during its lifetime therefore it is typical to simplify the environmental loading as a uniform harmonic cyclic shear stress in the scaled model test scaled model test which used different loading device to input simplified cyclic loading can be divided into two categories 1 studying the dynamic behavior of foundation including resonance problem e g lombardi et al 2013 nikitas et al 2016 guo et al 2015 yu et al 2015 2 studying the cumulative behavior of foundation including accumulated deformation and cyclic p y curve problems e g roesen et al 2012 peralta and achmus 2010 leblanc et al 2010a for studying the cumulative behavior of foundation in presented model test loading device needs high reliability and stability to apply cyclic lateral load to model pile therefore this paper presents a new designed loading device to apply steady cyclic lateral load to model pile as shown in fig 10 a loading device contains three main parts 1 power part 2 driving part 3 steel frame the working principle of this loading device is based on the moment balance of mass on the track mass m2 is lined to spring at one side and motor at another side while operating the motor m2 is forced two way moving in a controllable range on the track due to moment balance at the rotation point in fig 10 c track is then forced to rotate and apply load to pile as m1 and m2 in fig 10 a can be made with different weight variable amplitude and frequency of cyclic load can be applied to the model pile after manufactured the device validation work was proposed comparison between desired input and actual output load is shown in fig 11 it is proved that the device is capable of outputting steady cyclic loading 3 4 test program typical design situations for offshore wind turbine include 1 ultimate limit states uls 2 fatigue limit states fls 3 accidental limit states als 4 serviceability limit states sls the uls uses non degraded soil parameters while other limit states use cyclically degraded soil properties for design feld and waegter 2002 besides dnv gl as 2016 suggests that for offshore monopoles one of the tolerances is specified which is an upper limit for the accumulated permanent rotation of the pile head due to the history of sls loads applied to the monopile throughout the design life in order to quantify the effect of cyclic loading in sls situation different loading conditions are designed in the model tests leblanc et al 2010a suggested applying cyclic load with amplitude proportional of the static capacity the cyclic load ratio is defined as follows 2 ξ f c f u s c where f c is cyclic load f usc is ultimate static capacity therefore a static test was performed at first to determine the ultimate static capacity f usc after that three cyclic tests were performed under cyclic loading with amplitude proportional to f usc the test programs are summarized in table 3 4 summary of the test results 4 1 static response 4 1 1 load deflection behavior one static test was carried out at first while applied lateral load increased with 15 n per step ultimate lateral capacity ulc can be estimated by using the criterion suggested by broms 1960 which assumed the ultimate conditions appeared at deflections corresponding to 20 of pile diameter d for small diameter driven piles so the model pile was pushed laterally until reaching lateral deflection of 0 2d figs 12 14 show the results in static test load deflection curve for static test is shown in fig 12 measured lateral deflection of pile is normalized by dividing the value with pile diameter as shown in fig 12 fusc is approximately 100 n deflection along pile during static test is shown in fig 13 rotation point of pile deflection is close to 25 cm 5d below the soil surface moment along the pile is shown in fig 13 which shows that the moment increase with the amplitude of applied lateral load furthermore it is showed that moment reaches maximum at the depth near 25 cm 5d below the soil surface as shown in figs 13 and 14 deformation of pile in mainly constrains in the upper part of model pile the failure model is close to the formation of plastic hinge so the model pile can be defined as flexible pile which fulfills the target pile slenderness 4 1 2 static p y curves derivation

using eq 3 to obtain the scatter moment data along pile then p y data at different depth are obtained by using eqs 4 and 5 it should be noted that double integration in eq 5 requires two boundary conditions in this case one boundary condition is pile toe with zero displacement and another boundary condition is obtained from the displacement measured at pile head by using ldm point a in fig 7 b comparison between calculated and suggested p y curves are shown in fig 15 it should be noted that most of the measured data do not reach a plateau corresponding to the ultimate soil reaction it can be observed that test data reveal similar stiffness to api curves at shallow depth 1d however results of p y curves at 2d and 3d show that p y curves from api tend to underestimate the lateral resistance which is consistent with the observation from other researchers murff and hamilton 1993 jeanjean 2009 kim et al 2009 kim et al 2011 gilbert et al 2015 difference in static p y curve may be contributed to soil type and overconsolidation of marine soil besides this may also be understood that increase in soil reaction is probably due to additional component of soil reactions which is introduced by pile rotation in addition to the simple lateral translational mode of deformation implicit in the matlock s and reese s p y curve theory lam 2013 4 2 cyclic response 4 2 1 estimation of accumulation displacement in cyclic tests c1 c2 and c3 pure one way lateral load was applied to the pile with maximum amplitude of 0 3 0 45 and 0 6 times of fusc normalized load deflection curves are measured at pile head point a in fig 7 b which are shown in fig 16 fig 16 shows the average deformation of pile head in three cyclic tests it is observed that test pile develops most accumulated displacement within first 1000 cycles after that increase rate of displacement tends to degrade to negligible values and finally reaches a plateau in last cycles therefore load deflection behavior in three tests can be defined as shakedown or alternating plasticity responses difference between above two responses depends on deflection of pile may stabilize after a number of cycles while dissipation still occurs swane 1983 levy et al 2009 detail discussion is proposed in section 4 2 3 combined with cyclic p y behavior it is also showed in fig 16 that load deflection curve requires more load cycles to reach a plateau with larger amplitude of cyclic load which indicates that cyclic load level could affect the increase rate of accumulation displacement at pile head matlock 1970 reported that equilibrium response of deflections was attained in less than 100 cycles dunnavant and o neill 1989 observed that the pile head displacements stabilize within 200 cycles in the case of submerged stiff clays results in fig 16 have slightly difference with those from above researcher which may contribute to difference in inherent cyclic behavior of soils blue dashed lines in fig 16 refer to the deformation under same load level in static test it is observed that deformation in all three cyclic tests exceed the value in static test in addition deflection of model pile in test c3 exceeds the value in static condition with the least load cycles which indicates that cyclic load level has an obvious effect on accumulated deformation of pile furthermore as noted by dnv 1992 veritas 1992 tests in both clay and sand have shown that long term loads can give deformation 2 to 3 times greater than for short term static conditions the increase will be greater with higher stress level comparison in fig 16 shows that ratios of steady cyclic deformation to static deformation d c d s for three tests are 1 2448 1 3053 and 1 5468 which is consistent with the suggestion from dnv 1992 accumulation of permanent displacements for a cyclic laterally loaded pile has usually been described either by means of logarithmic law or power law e g for the case of pile installed in sand verdure et al 2003 long and vanneste 1994 for the case of pile installed in clay khemakhem et al 2012 therefore the following formulation is employed to estimate the pile head displacements the fitting results are shown in fig 16 with dashed red lines 6 y n α y 0 1 a e n k where y n is lateral displacement of n th cycle y o is lateral displacement induced by static load with same amplitude n is load cycle α a and k is empirical factors shown in table 4 4 2 2 degradation of cyclic stiffness it was reported by several researchers bhattacharya et al 2013b zhang et al 2011 that piled foundation installed in clay could become softer under cyclic loading therefore cyclic stiffness of pile soil system is analyzed with its load deflection behavior normalized load deflection curves measured at pile head are shown in fig 17 fig 17 shows the total normalized resistance h ldc u versus normalized lateral displacement in three cyclic tests h is imposed horizontal load at pile l is embedded length d is pile diameter and c u is average undrained shear strength of soil it is observed that hysteresis loops of pile soil system show translation and rotation under cyclic loading especially for fig 17 c which implies the system accumulates with plastic deformation and stiffness degradation with load cycle increase it is also observed that amplitude and number of cycles have obvious influence on the change law of hysteresis loops with load cycles in order to estimate stiffness degradation in three cyclic tests two kinds of secant stiffness of hysteresis loop are analyzed and given in fig 18 a fig 18 b and c show relationships of absolute secant stiffness ass and cyclic secant stiffness css changing with load cycles in three cyclic tests which is defined in fig 18 a s c is stiffness of n th cycle of load deflection curve s c0 is stiffness of 1 th cycle of load deflection curve as shown in fig 18 c css has a considerable degradation in initial cycles and gradually decrease in subsequent cycles in three cyclic tests css decrease about 10 40 percent within the first 1000 cycles of cyclic load gilbert et al 2015 observed a similar reduction in css for about 20 30 percent in model test with pile installed in kaolinite and gulf of mexico marine clay under constant target tilt at pile head it is also shown in fig 18 b and c that cyclic load with larger amplitude leads to more degradation in both ass and css this observation can be linked to load deflection behavior at pile head shown in fig 16 while larger load level induces more deformation at pile head besides this phenomenon can also be linked to the stress strain behavior of clayey soil the stiffness and strength of clayey soil decrease when it subjects to cyclic load inducing deformation exceeded threshold shear strain in undrained condition mortezaie and vucetic 2016 both iwt and owt are frequency sensitive structures as shown in fig 19 nature frequency of owt is typically designed within soft stiff range dnv 2002 suggests that the natural frequency of the wind turbine should be at least 10 away from the 1 p and 2 p 3 p frequencies where 1 p and 2p 3 p refer to rotor frequency and blade passing frequency hence natural frequency of owt is limited to a relative small range and sensitive to external disturbance malhotra 2007 reported that for a typical monopile lowering the natural frequency of the foundation by a small amount 5 8 will have a dramatic effect on fatigue as css represents the stiffness of pile soil system it can be linked to the natural frequency of owt indirectly wang et al 2016 reported a rough estimation of influence of stiffness degradation on natural frequency it is showed that with soil stiffness decrease 10 50 during load cycles natural frequency of the foundation could decrease nearly 4 6 6 6 as shown in fig 18 c css decreases nearly 40 after 5000 load cycles in test c3 which indicates that there may be a considerable decrease in the natural frequency because iwt in china mainly located in the area suffering from extreme event such as seasonal typhoon environmental load during extreme event could exceed design load even wind turbine stop operating results in fig 18 imply that even iwt remain acceptable lateral deformation under cyclic load with high load level decrease of system stiffness could lead to dramatic change in natural frequency and which may cause the system vulnerable to potential resonance 4 2 3 cyclic p y curves in order to analyze the cyclic p y curves a brief review of p y curves for soft clay is presented at first api rp2a adopted the soft clay criterion developed by matlock 1970 based on four lateral load tests on a 12 75 inch diameter 323 85 mm steel pipe pile at two soft clay sites in texas that had been ponded to simulate offshore conditions besides p y curves formulated for cyclic loading conditions are based on field tests with fewer than 200 cycles as shown in fig 20 matlock 1970 takes cyclic effect into account by reducing maximum soil resistance after the deformation of pile reaching three times of y c which is defined as 2 5 ε 50 d the value which refers to average normal strain in the direction of pile movement in the soil around the pile kagawa and kraft 1980 was used by matlock 1970 following the concept originally proposed by skempton 1951 for footing settlement problems value of ε 50 is varied for different soil and had been discussed by sullivan et al 1980 ebrahimian and nazari 2013 it is also implied from fig 20 that cyclic effect only corresponds to ε 50 and pile diameter however results from triaxial test show that clayey soil could have considerable difference in cyclic behavior due to internal soil properties and external loading condition e g matasovic and vucetic 1995 mortezaie and vucetic 2013 mortezaie and vucetic 2016 in order to estimate the influence factors of cyclic p y curve backbone curve of cyclic p y curves at different depth are shown in fig 21 as shown in fig 16 increase of deformation at pile head mainly concentrates within the first 1000 cycles therefore p y curves at three stages are chosen to illustrate in fig 21 which includes a 0 10 cycles initial stage b 100 110 cycles developing stage c 1000 1010 cycles stabilized stage as shown in fig 21 p y curves from test c1 behave in an elastic manner with no observable change in hysteric loop in contrast observable degradations are occurred in stiffness and hysteric loop in test c2 and c3 therefore as discussed in 4 2 1 load deflection behavior of test c1 can be defined as shakedown response while test c2 and c3 can be defined as alternating plasticity or plastic shakedown response besides there is an observable degradation of stiffness as load cycles increasing from 1 to 10 to 1000 1010 cyclic load with larger amplitude induced more development of damping and plasticity at the same depth as noted by matlock 1970 deterioration in resistance caused by cyclic loading is most severe at shallow depths it can be observed that degradation of p y curves mainly concentrate on shallow depth 1d which is consistent with the suggestion from matlock in addition to ε 50 and pile diameter above results indicate that cyclic effect on p y curves are affected by load cycles load level and depth comparison between measured and suggested p y curves is shown in fig 22 it should be noted that y c equals to 2 5 ε 50 d and skempton 1951 suggested value of ε 50 for soft clay equal to 0 02 so y c is equivalent to 0 0025 m for the discussed case as shown in fig 22 measured cyclic p y curves exhibit decrease of soil reaction when the deformation of pile is smaller than three times of y c comparing with static condition at the same load level decrease of soil reaction in measured p y curves can be estimated by using reduction factor showed in table 5 as shown in table 5 decrease of soil reaction is directly linked to load level and depth cyclic p y curves from matlock 1970 imply that if the shear strains do not exceed the elastic limit of the soil lateral deformation less than 3 y c no degradation should occur however as shown in fig 22 degradation of soil reaction occurs even though deformation is smaller than 3 y c this observation is consistent with the test results from jeanjean 2009 note that this phenomenon is not reported but can be observed from the reported data and gilbert et al 2015 besides results from jeanjean 2009 indicated that both static and cyclic p y curves from model test were stiffer than those from matlock which is not consistent with the static test results in presented test this difference could be contributed to 1 test condition and soil type 2 static p y curves from jeanjean 2009 were far stiffer than those from matlock even cyclic load causing some degradation it still turned out to be slightly stiffer than cyclic p y curves from matlock test results from gilbert et al 2015 indicated that matlock 1970 p y curves tend to underestimate the lateral resistance for all three types of test bed with normal moderately and heavily overconsolidated clay besides secant stiffness was observed decreasing between 20 and 30 percent in both normally consolidated and overconsolidated clay and observed in both kaolin and gulf of mexico marine clay it should be noted that matlock 1970 method is suggest for soft normally consolidated clay while model soil in the presents tests is overconsolidated marine clay so difference in p y curves could be induced by ocr of soil however it is still not clear that whether influence of ocr on p y curves is negligible for marine clay used in the presented test therefore further studies are required 4 2 4 pore water pressure induced by cyclic load four pore water pressure meters were preset near pile as shown in figs 7 b and 23 these sensors were designed to measure of pore water pressure pwp accumulated in so called near field and free field ashour and norris 2003 position of p1 is 350 mm under soil surface 7d which is close to inflection point of bending moment in static test position of p2 is 200 mm under soil surface 4d which is close to maximum value of bending moment in static test position of p3 is 50 mm under soil surface 1d and close to pile position of p4 is 50 mm under soil surface and 50 mm 1d away from pile which is directly under the steel sheet at soil surface pwp induced by cyclic load in test c3 is shown in fig 24 normalized pwp is calculated using follow equation 7 δ u n δ u n σ v c where δ u n is normalized pwp δ u n is measured pwp σ v c is overburden vertical stress it can be observed that pwp in p1 decrease in about first 1000 cycles and turns to increase till 5000 cycles this can be linked to deflection at pile head because deflection of pile at the position same as p1 become steady after 1000 cycles of load negative pwp keep decreasing as position of p1 is at the back of pile moving direction negative pwp may be the result of suction stresses developing during the test similar phenomenon had been reported by bauer and kempfert 2016 pwp in p2 keeps accumulating during the whole cyclic test even deflection at pile head becoming steady this may be understood that position of p2 is 4d away beneath the ground surface and test soil with low permeability could not drain during the test in addition increase rate of pwp in p2 becomes slight declining after deflection at pile head reaching plateau it should be noted that pwp in p1 and p2 shows different behavior this may contributed to that pwp in p1 and p2 were induced by suction and pressure from pile movement and negative pwp may dissipate easier as static pore water field was positive during the test pwp in p3 and p4 have a similar trend with accumulation of pwp in less than 1000 cycles and then become steady in the rest of loading cycles besides oscillating and decreasing of pwp in p3 may be linked to the opening of gap furthermore maximum pwp in p4 is less than pwp in p3 which indicates that influence of cyclic load is degraded nearly 17 through 1d range it can be noted that accumulation of pwp at shallow depth can be linked to gradually stabilize of deflection at pile head this highlights the importance of considering the coupling effects between soil stress and pwp in design nevertheless pwp in p2 and p1 are sophisticated to fully understand and could be linked to permeability and position corresponding to the movement direction of pile due to limited and scattered pwp sensors in present tests further studies are required 4 2 5 evolution of soil surface gap and soil softening zone ssz around pile in clayey foundation had been reported by other researchers as discussed in introduction section it is a macro phenomenon induced by partial failure of lateral loaded pile soil system which is typically occurring in clayey foundation comparing with subsidence in sandy foundation however formation and estimation method of gap and ssz are not yet clearly discussed in literature zhang et al 2011 suggested that reduction in pile soil stiffness is caused by opening of a gap near soil surface which provides a pathway for free water to pass down the pile surface kagawa and kraft 1980 suggested that more than 70 of the pile displacement concentrated in soil mass within 1d in the presented tests ldms and two types of markers are used to measure the evolution of soil surface fig 25 a and b show that the gap alternatively opens and closes while squeezing the entrapped water and forcing it upward it can be seen from fig 25 c that there is an obvious upheaval at the front of pile and opening of gap at the back of pile after test above observations indicate that opening of gap is corresponding to the number of cyclic cycles which may be linked to the degradation of soil stiffness and dissipation of pwp discussed in the former section besides some observable crack was formed at the two sides of pile and extended to the direction perpendicular to applied cyclic load this may be linked to the shear tendency induced by pile movement at these sides smith 1987 in addition it is observed from fig 25 d and e that the gap eventually formed about 2d in depth and 9 mm in wide after test as the depth of gap gradually exceeds the depth installed pore water pressure meter at p3 see fig 23 change of drainage pathway could be linked to the oscillating of pwp measured at p3 fig 26 shows the picture recorded by camera during one load cycle as shown in fig 26 a and b markers beyond the range of 1d show negligible deflection during one load cycle in contrast deflection of markers steel nail located at 30 to load direction was observed with negligible deformation measured deflection of two steel sheets in test c3 is shown in fig 27 which is assumed equivalent to the deflection of soil as show in fig 27 measured deflection at two points keep increasing in first two hundred cycles and then reach a steady plateau changing of deflection at point b and c are consistent with the value measured at pile head in addition it is also showed that more than 80 of deflection concentrating in soil mass within 1d which is slightly larger than the value suggested by kagawa and kraft 1980 due to one way cyclic loading maximum deflection in point c is about 80 of that in point b difference between deflection at point b and c reflects the tilting of ssz which is consistent with the phenomenon observed in fig 25 c 5 conclusion and discussion this paper has reported a series of 1 g model tests estimated response of flexible pile embedded in overconsolidated soft marine clay and subjected to static and cyclic lateral load a new designed loading device was applied in cyclic test to output steady lateral load one static and three cyclic tests with various load levels were carried out in same test condition different sensors and markers were preset in the test model to measure the responses including cyclic deflection at pile head degradation of system stiffness cyclic p y curves pore water pressure in soil and forming of soil softening zone key observations from presented tests are as follow 1 lateral deflection at pile head develops most accumulated displacement within first 1000 cycles while displacement of test under larger load level requires more cycles to reach steady plateau in addition cyclic loading induces about 1 2 1 5 times of displacement at pile head comparing with same amplitude of static load furthermore lateral deflection at pile head can be fitted with presented formulation which considers effect of loading cycles and displacement in static condition 2 cyclic load with amplitude corresponding to 30 60 of uls induces degradation of system stiffness about 10 40 percent in first 1000 cycles while larger load level induces more degradation of stiffness 3 static p y derived from the test is consistent with that suggested by matlock 1970 with slightly stiffer behavior however measured cyclic p y curves become softer than suggested p y curves even deformation do not exceed elastic limit 3 y c suggested by matlock besides cyclic reduction factor for soil reaction which is linked to load level and depth are presented based on test results from static and cyclic tests 4 observation in test c3 shows that pwp at shallow depth p3 and p4 shows similar behavior to displacement at pile head which increases mainly in first 1000 cycles and reaches steady in the rest cycles in addition comparison of p3 and p4 shows that maximum pwp decrease about 67 within 1d range in the same direction with cyclic load 5 observation of makers at soil surface shows that cyclic load mainly induces observable deformation in soil mass within 1d range in the same direction as applied load measured displacement of steel sheets by using ldm indicates that more than 80 of deflections concentrating in soil mass within 1d difference between deflections at two steel sheets reflects tilting of soil softening zone which can explain the formation of upheaval and gap in soil after test observed results are mainly discussed with the cyclic effect on lateral response of pile in overconsolidated marine clay results from presented four tests indicate that available design method may underestimate cyclic lateral response of monopile installed in this type of site it is important to note that wind turbine is typically a system combined with three main parts 1 blades rotor and nacelle 2 tower and transition piece 3 monopile while blades tower and transition piece contribute most load to the system resistance of the system is provided only by pile soil interaction normal operation of a wind turbine mainly depends on working condition of blade rotor nacelle part which requires reasonable and controllable permanent deformation displacement criteria suggested by dnv gl as 2016 therefore comprehensive study of wind turbine should consider both system disturbance and resistance in the same time which requires analysis of fluid structure interaction including coupling of aerodynamic hydrodynamic and pile soil interaction it should be noted that presented model tests only focus on reproducing the pile soil interaction of monopile foundation however coupling of environmental load with upper systems such as blade rotor nacelle and tower transition parts is neglected in the presented tests as suggested by gl 2005 changing of system stiffness and damping induced by cyclic load is contributed mostly to foundation part therefore test results could be used to assess most part of cyclic effect on system load deflection behavior and they also foreshadow potential approaches to the re assessment of cyclic p y behavior
