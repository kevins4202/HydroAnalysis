7770,study region rocky mountains in colorado including front and san juan ranges study focus hydrologic modeling of ungaged mountain basins plays an important role in ensuring the safety of colorado s dams recent research has shown that infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff and subsurface stormflow can all contribute to streamflow generated by extreme rainfall in colorado s mountains and the soil moisture accounting sma method in hec hms has been suggested as an appropriate approach to model these mechanisms however sma requires estimation of parameters that have not been previously considered for large floods the objective of this work is to develop methods to estimate sma parameters for modeling the response to extreme rainfall in ungaged mountain basins of colorado where calibration to observed discharges is not possible new hydrological insights for the region the proposed parameter estimation methods are tested for five basins in the front range and three basins in the san juan range that have streamflow data available for major flood events for these historical events the proposed uncalibrated models produce the same streamflow generation processes as calibrated models and the predicted peak discharges from the uncalibrated models usually have 25 errors or smaller for design storms the peak discharges from the uncalibrated models can differ substantially from the peak discharges from calibrated models but are conservative relative to the envelope of observed peak discharges graphical abstract ga1 keywords colorado mountains hydrologic modeling ungaged basins parameter estimation soil moisture accounting extreme rainfall data availability models and data will be posted at mountain scholar csu s data repository after the paper has been finalized accepted 1 introduction dams must safely convey floods in order to avoid potential failures and associated environmental damages economic losses and risks to public safety depending on the local regulations and associated risks dams might be evaluated for events with specified return periods e g 100 years to 107 years and or the probable maximum flood for these events estimates are needed for the peak streamflow rates to evaluate spillway sizing and total streamflow volume to consider freeboard requirements peak streamflow rates can be estimated by analyzing streamflow records with methods such as bulletin 17 c england et al 2019 if a stream gage with adequate record length is available at the dam however many dams are in ungaged basins colorado for example has more than 2000 dams and the vast majority do not have associated streamflow gages alternatively peak streamflow rates can be estimated by applying regression equations such as those found in streamstats capesius and stephens 2009 however such regression equations were developed using limited streamflow record lengths so they are less reliable and often unavailable for large return periods furthermore the mechanisms that produce annual peak flows can change with return period in colorado more frequent annual peak flows are produced by snowmelt in high elevation mountain basins 3100 m mixtures of snowmelt and rainfall for intermediate elevation basins 2000 3100 m and rainfall alone for low elevation basins 2000 m fassnacht and records 2015 kampf and lefsky 2016 however more extreme flood peaks are thought to be produced by rainfall in colorado s mountains jarrett 1990 pitlick 1994 in part because the most damaging historical floods have been produced by rainfall including the 1976 big thompson river flood and the 2013 front range floods woolridge et al 2020 due to these limitations on estimating peak streamflow rates and because streamflow volumes are also required in dam safety evaluations there is an ongoing need to model the response of ungaged watersheds to extreme rainfall events in colorado design storms are generated based on the regional extreme precipitation study reps cdwr and nmose 2018 reps updated probable maximum precipitation pmp estimates by including recent extreme storm events and developed return period based precipitation estimates that account for the different meteorological mechanisms that can produce extreme precipitation in the region hydrologic models are then used to estimate the streamflow hydrographs that are generated from the design storms colorado s modeling guidelines sabol 2008 assume that streamflow from extreme rainfall is generated by infiltration excess runoff horton 1940 and recommend modeling runoff production using the green and ampt method sabol 2008 or the initial and constant loss method ferc 2001 however through an examination of several large historical floods in colorado s front range woolridge et al 2020 found that infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff dunne and black 1970a 1970b and subsurface stormflow kirkby and chorley 1967 can all significantly contribute to streamflow in particular the 2013 front range floods were produced by a low intensity but prolonged storm gochis et al 2015 that produced runoff by saturating soils from below woolridge et al 2020 this mechanism is not considered by the sabol 2008 guidelines woolridge et al 2020 recommended the soil moisture accounting sma loss method within hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms bennett et al 1998 bennett et al 2000 to simulate runoff production mechanisms for extreme rainfall events in mountain basins of colorado unlike green ampt or initial and constant loss methods sma s infiltration capacity can decrease to zero when the soil layer saturates this low infiltration capacity is necessary to reproduce saturation excess runoff and the observed hydrographs from the 2013 event woolridge et al 2020 in developing their models they disaggregated five study basins into sub basins in order to better represent the spatial variation of observed precipitation they further divided the sub basins into north facing and south facing components to account for aspect related differences in vegetation and soil the clark 1945 method was used to transform runoff into streamflow and a linear reservoir was used to transform subsurface stormflow into streamflow this modeling approach reproduced the active streamflow mechanisms for the large observed floods in the front range and it was able to reproduce the observed hydrographs with good to very good accuracy according to the criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 sma requires specification of several parameters that have not been previously considered in dam safety evaluations in colorado s mountains including the total storage capacity of the soil which is important in determining saturation excess runoff and the time constant for the subsurface stormflow response which strongly influences the peak streamflow rate woolridge et al 2020 estimated several required parameters by calibrating to streamflow observations but calibration is not possible in ungaged basins furthermore no guidance is available in the scientific literature regarding uncalibrated sma model parameter estimation although several studies have provided calibrated parameter values sorooshian et al 1993 bennett et al 2000 feldman 2000 the objective of this research is to develop and test a parameter estimation method for sma based hec hms models that simulate the response to extreme rainfall events in ungaged mountain basins of colorado the proposed parameter estimation method determines most parameters based on the physical characteristics of the ungaged basins in cases where such relationships cannot be determined constant parameter values are applied throughout the region we refer to the resulting models as uncalibrated because the parameters are not adjusted in individual basins to match the streamflow observations the uncalibrated modeling approach is developed and evaluated using relatively undisturbed and unurbanized basins in the front and san juan ranges of colorado the uncalibrated models and associated results can be accessed at irvin et al 2022 the modeling approach is first evaluated by simulating historical flood events and comparing to observed flows and the results of calibrated models for the front range the calibrated models were developed by woolridge et al 2020 for the san juan range new calibrated models are developed using the procedures of woolridge et al 2020 the uncalibrated models are also evaluated by simulating the discharge from return period and pmp design storms and comparing to the results of the calibrated models independent estimates of extreme flows from streamstats capesius and stephens 2009 and a regional peak flow envelope curve crippen and bue 1977 2 study basins and events 2 1 basins eight basins were selected for modeling because they have experienced significant floods for which hourly precipitation data are available to force the model simulations and at least a partial hydrograph is available for model evaluation five are in the front range and three are in the san juan range fig 1 basic characteristics of the basins can be found in table 1 mineral creek and vallecito creek are in the heart of the san juan range while saguache creek is in the cochetopa hills which connect the san juan and sawatch ranges the front range is in north central colorado it is a laramide range with a core of precambrian crystalline rock gneiss and granodiorite and uplifted adjacent mesozoic sedimentary rock dickinson et al 1988 anderson et al 2015 common vegetation types include lodgepole pine aspen douglas fir limber pine shrubs and herbaceous understory anderson et al 2019 ebel 2012 at low elevations the north facing slopes are primarily forested while south facing slopes are shrublands ebel 2012 at intermediate elevations hillslopes are primarily forested irrespective of their aspect high elevations are above timberline soils typically have high sand content and fall in hydrologic groups a and b soil survey staff 2020 the san juan range is in southwestern colorado it is geologically complex with a core of precambrian crystalline rocks localized areas of volcanism and intrusive igneous rock and sedimentary rocks along the range margins chimner et al 2010 ash flow tuffs and basalt flows and associated tuff and breccia are also present tweto 1979 common vegetation types include ponderosa pine mexican white pine subalpine fir colorado blue spruce shrubby cinquefoil and rabbitbrush zier and baker 2006 like the front range the high elevations are above timberline soils have lower sand content than the front range but still typically fall into hydrologic groups a and b soil survey staff 2020 little urbanization is present in any of the watersheds 2 2 historical storms a summary of the considered historical storms is provided in table 2 all four flood generating storm types in reps are included in the dataset a mesoscale storm with embedded convection mec is an organized mesoscale to sub synoptic scale storm system that has embedded thunderstorms an mec storm occurred over the north fork of the big thompson river basin in 1976 mccain et al 1979 a mid latitude cyclone mlc is a synoptic scale system associated with low pressure and cyclonic circulation mlc events occurred over cheyenne creek in 1997 and over most of the front range in 2013 gochis et al 2015 another mlc event occurred over mineral creek and vallecito creek in 2006 fema 2010 a tropical storm remnant tsr is a storm that is associated with a hurricane or tropical cyclone atmospheric environment a tsr event occurred over vallecito creek in 1970 roeske 1971 as well as mineral creek and vallecito creek in 2004 a local storm ls is a small scale thunderstorm that occurs in the absence of a large scale storm system an ls event occurred over the northeast portion of the saguache creek basin in 1999 perry 2021 rainfall data for the historical storms were obtained from the storm precipitation analysis system spas parzybok and tomlinson 2006 spas uses rain gage and radar data to estimate the spatial 36 arc second or approximately 850 m resolution and temporal 1 h resolution patterns of precipitation metstat 2018 nexrad radar heiss et al 1990 became available in the mid 1990 s so precipitation estimates after this date are expected to be more accurate vertical polarization of the signal began in 2006 which helps identify hail contamination and further improves the estimates hubbert and pratte 2006 a nexrad radar is available in denver which is adjacent to the front range at the time of the historical storms the nearest nexrad radars to the san juan range were in grand junction and pueblo because these radars are far from the range 150 km the beam is high and diffusive which leads to lower accuracy in the precipitation rates for san juan storms kitchen and jackson 1993 smith et al 1996 young et al 1999 streamflow data were obtained from u s geological survey and colorado division of water resources gages and typically have a 15 min resolution however for the vallecito creek 1970 event only daily average flows and the peak flow are available for the north fork big thompson river 1976 event only a partial hydrograph is available but it captures the peak flow mccain et al 1979 for the vallecito creek 2004 event only a partial hydrograph is available and it is not known whether the peak flow was captured to give a sense of the magnitude of the flood events table 2 provides the ratios between the observed peak flows and the streamstats 100 yr flows capesius and stephens 2009 https streamstats usgs gov ss the front range storms usually produced higher ratios than the san juan range storms the north fork big thompson river 1976 event produced the highest ratio among all the events runoff coefficients were calculated as the total volume of discharge divided by the total volume of precipitation the highest runoff coefficients occurred in mineral creek and vallecito creek for the 2006 storm table 2 a flood insurance study by fema 2010 suggested that rain on snow occurred for this event which could explain the high runoff coefficients however an examination of nearby snow telemetry snotel sites did not show a clear melting of snowpack saguache creek 1999 has a lower runoff coefficient than the other basins storms the lower value occurs in part because the 1999 storm only occurred in a part of this large basin if the runoff coefficient is calculated using the storm area rather than the basin area it increases to 0 44 which is similar to the other values in table 2 2 3 design storms the design storms were obtained from reps specifically 2 hr ls events 6 hr mec events and 48 hr mlc events with return periods between 10 yr and 107 yr are modeled in each basin three pmp storms 2 hr 6 hr and 72 hr are also modeled in each basin in reps the return period based rainfall estimates are produced using a 4 parameter kappa distribution with no upper bound which allows those events to exceed the pmp on occasion cdwr and nmose 2018 3 parameter estimation methodology 3 1 model components the main components and processes included in each sub basin of the hec hms models are based on woolridge et al 2020 fig 2 rainfall first enters the canopy storage which represents interception this storage must be filled before precipitated water can enter the other storage volumes feldman 2000 water in the canopy storage is held until it is removed by evaporation surface storage i e depression storage is not explicitly represented in our models because the canopy and surfaces storages behave the same way if included in sma the canopy storage element may implicitly represent some surface storage in our models when canopy storage is overcome rainfall becomes throughfall and can contribute to the soil storage the infiltration capacity is a linear function of the current soil storage the soil storage includes water that attaches to the soil particles and can only be removed by evapotranspiration et i e tension storage it also includes water that fills the pore spaces between the soil particles and can be removed by et or gravity drainage i e gravity storage feldman 2000 runoff is transformed into streamflow at the sub basin outlet by the clark 1945 method this method uses a dimensionless time area curve and the time of concentration to account for the translation of flow to the sub basin outlet it also uses a linear reservoir to account for sub basin storage effects clark 1945 when the soil storage exceeds the maximum tension storage water can enter groundwater storage via soil percolation the groundwater layer represents any saturated layer on top of the bedrock feldman 2000 and outflow from this layer depends in part on its current storage the outflow is converted into streamflow at the sub basin outlet by a linear reservoir the outflow from the linear reservoir is a function of the current reservoir storage and a specified time constant river routing is needed to combine flows from upper and lower sub basins the muskingum cunge method is used for routing because it includes flood wave advection and attenuation feldman 2000 and it allows overbank flows which are expected for extreme events woolridge et al 2020 south boulder creek basin contains a reservoir gross reservoir and uses reservoir routing an elevation storage discharge relationship outlet structure information and initial conditions were obtained from the division of water resources and denver water south boulder creek also includes moffatt tunnel which moves water under the continental divide and the south boulder creek diversion for both specified flows were obtained from the division of water resources 3 2 basin disaggregation hec hms assumes that rainfall and watershed properties are spatially uniform within sub basins we use the same sub basin disaggregation method as woolridge et al 2020 while neglecting the separate consideration of north facing and south facing hillslopes separate north facing and south facing slopes are not considered because that approach greatly increases the number of parameters that require estimation while providing little improvement in model performance see further discussion below the sub basins were determined using 1 3 arc second resolution 10 m digital elevation model dem from the national elevation dataset u s geological survey 2020a the channel network was derived from the dem using a contributing area threshold and a sub basin was included for each source and link in the channel network djokic et al 2011 a 15 km2 threshold is used because the resulting sub basins have relatively uniform rainfall in space while the number of sub basins remains low woolridge et al 2020 the sub basins produced by this disaggregation method are shown for the big thompson river basin in fig s1 3 3 data sources for parameter estimation an overview of the proposed parameter estimation procedure is provided in fig 3 the parameters are estimated from five data sources which are available for ungaged watersheds in colorado first landsat 8 imagery u s geological survey 2020b is used to characterize the vegetation coverage and its effect on soil hydraulic properties from landsat 8 we use the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which is a measure of surface greenness montandon and small 2008 fractional vegetation cover is computed from ndvi using a linear function montandon and small 2008 vermote et al 2016 the endpoints of the linear function are the ndvi s for fully vegetated areas ndvi and barren areas ndvi0 which have been estimated in the front range as ndvi 0 70 and ndvi0 0 04 timilsina et al 2021 for simplicity we use these values to estimate fractional vegetation cover in both the front and san juan ranges second the nrcs gridded national soil survey geographic database gnatsgo is used to estimate the soil parameters fig 3 gnatsgo relies mainly on the nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo with gaps filled using the state soil geographic database statsgo2 and raster soil survey database rss soil survey staff 2020 from gnatsgo we use percent sand percent clay and percent organic matter from the soil surface to a depth of 60 cm the 60 cm value was chosen based on typical soil depths in the colorado mountains soil survey staff 2020 the depth to any restrictive layer z soil is also obtained from gnatsgo for conservatism and consistency with the soil texture estimates if the sub basin average depth to restrictive layer exceeds 60 cm z soil is set to 60 cm basic soil hydraulic properties are calculated from the gnatsgo soil texture information using pedotransfer functions rawls et al 1983 saxton and rawls 2006 the outputs of these pedotransfer functions are grids of soil moisture content at saturation θ s field capacity θ fld wilting point θ wp wetting front suction head ψ f and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity is then adjusted based on the fractional vegetation cover as recommended by sabol 2008 and divided by two to account for possible unsaturated flow bouwer 1964 woolridge et al 2020 to produce the final saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat the gridded soil hydraulic properties are then averaged to obtain values for each sub basin fig s1 shows the sub basin boundaries and key gridded data inputs for the big thompson river basin the third data source is the dem fig 3 which is used in the hec hms terrain processing functions to characterize sub basin and reach geomorphology the outputs of this processing include the sub basin area a the flow length between the hydraulically most distant point and the outlet l the watercourse slope s and the flow length between a point on l that is perpendicular to the watershed centroid and the outlet l ca sabol 2008 fourth google earth satellite imagery google 2020 is used to identify floodplain and channel characteristics fig 3 fifth streamstats capesius and stephens 2009 is used to estimate the 2 year flow in each reach 3 4 canopy parameters the canopy model requires estimation of three parameters maximum canopy storage initial canopy storage and canopy evaporation rate woolridge et al 2020 estimated the maximum canopy storage and canopy evaporation rate using measurements from the cache la poudre experimental catchment in the front range traff et al 2015 throughfall was measured under the dominant vegetation species on north facing slopes ponderosa pines and south facing slopes antelope bitterbrush and rainfall was measured in an open area woolridge et al 2020 calibrated the maximum canopy storage and canopy evaporation for each hillslope orientation to reproduce the observed throughfall rates as closely as possible we propose using a simple average of the north facing and south facing maximum canopy storage values for ungaged basins 4 3 mm in reality the canopy storage is expected to vary with the dominant vegetation species and density of vegetation cover sabol 2008 but the quantitative dependence of canopy storage on these factors is poorly understood like woolridge et al 2020 we assume that the initial canopy storage is zero timilsina et al 2021 determined a function to estimate average potential et from elevation in the front range for ungaged basins we propose estimating the canopy evaporation as the average potential et at the average elevation of each sub basin from the timilsina et al 2021 function this procedure assumes that the canopy evaporation occurs at the potential et rate and that the dependence of potential et on elevation in the front range applies to other ranges in colorado 3 5 soil layer parameters the soil layer model has six parameters maximum infiltration rate maximum soil storage tension storage initial soil storage soil percolation rate and imperviousness the maximum infiltration rate f is the highest rate at which water can enter the soil layer following woolridge et al 2020 we propose estimating f as the green and ampt 1911 infiltration rate when the wetting front is near the ground surface i e early in the storm when the soil is dry 1 f k sat 1 ψ f δ where δ is the depth of the wetting front which is selected as 7 5 cm following woolridge et al 2020 and sabol 2008 maximum soil storage s max represents the total water that can be stored and removed from the soil layer including both tension and gravity storage for ungaged basins we propose estimating s max based on an approach koren et al 2000 suggested for the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma burnash et al 1995 specifically 2 s max 1 p gw z soil θ sat θ wp where p gw is the fraction of the soil column above the restrictive layer that is dedicated to groundwater storage the wilting point is subtracted in eq 2 because no natural mechanism lowers the soil moisture below the wilting point p gw is difficult to estimate because the thickness of the groundwater layer likely varies between events p gw 0 10 was selected based on the model performance for gaged basins considered in this study we propose estimating tension storage s ten also following koren et al 2000 specifically 3 s ten 1 p gw z soil θ fld θ wp in sma the groundwater layer does not consider tension storage so any water stored in the groundwater layer can drain however the groundwater layer represents the bottom of the soil column so tension storage occurs in reality because such storage cannot be included in the groundwater layer it is included in the soil layer by increasing θ fld by 30 the soil percolation rate is the maximum rate at which water moves from the soil layer to the groundwater layer we assume that the soil percolation occurs as gravity drainage i e without a soil suction gradient in that case darcy s law indicates that the soil percolation rate is k sat fig s2 shows an example of the gridded soil layer parameters for the big thompson river basin table s1 provides average parameter values for all basins considered the initial soil storage is the portion of the maximum soil storage that is occupied by water at the start of the simulation for the historical storms this value was estimated from nearby soil moisture sensors if available snotel stations or anderson et al 2019 and otherwise calibrated for the design storms and ungaged basins we used the adjusted field capacity sabol 2008 the imperviousness is defined as the portion of a sub basin for which all precipitation becomes runoff feldman 2000 natural imperviousness can occur in mountain basins as bedrock outcrops and canyon walls landcover datasets are known to underestimate natural imperviousness by large margins petliak et al 2019 we considered estimating natural imperviousness as the portion of the sub basin where the depth to any soil restrictive layer is zero soil survey staff 2020 we also considered treating any gnatsgo soil units with a leading descriptor of bedrock as impervious however these approaches are speculative in part because they do not consider the hydrologic connectivity of the imperviousness other mountain hydrology studies have used values between 2 and 5 for imperviousness ahl et al 2008 din et al 2019 consequently 5 imperviousness is proposed for ungaged basins in colorado 3 6 transform parameters the clark transform method requires specification of a dimensionless time area curve that describes the cumulative distribution of travel times from each point to the sub basin outlet clark 1945 feldman 2000 woolridge et al 2020 obtained a time area distribution for each sub basin using cumulative travel time rasters from the dem landcover data and an approximation of manning s equation we propose using the default dimensionless time area curve in hec hms which is 4 a t a 1 414 t t c 1 5 t t c 2 1 1 414 1 t t c 1 5 t t c 2 where t c is the time of concentration t is a time between 0 and t c and a t is the area of the sub basin contributing flow at time t the clark method also requires specification of t c many empirical equations are available for estimating t c see almeida et al 2014 we used the expression for the rocky mountains from sabol 2008 5 t c 2 47 a 0 078 l 0 212 l ca 0 212 s 0 263 where sub basin area a is in km2 l is in km s is in m km and l ca is in km we applied several other methods from almeida et al 2014 to cheyenne creek and found that they produce similar estimates to the sabol 2008 expression specifically the folmar et al 2007 linsley et al 1992 yen and chow 1983 and kirpich 1940 equations estimate t c within 10 min 9 20 min 18 5 min 4 and 15 min 13 of the sabol 2008 estimate respectively the clark method also requires the linear reservoir storage coefficient r feldman 2000 the storage coefficient is commonly estimated by defining x as 6 x r r t c and assuming that x remains constant within a given region ferc 2001 dunn et al 2001 yoo et al 2014 this approach is the same as assuming 7 r y t c where 8 y x 1 x similarly empirical expressions have been proposed to estimate r as a function of t c sabol 2008 all these approaches imply that r increases with increasing sub basin size and it is consistent with clark 1945 who considered basin storage to occur mainly in channels as sub basin size increases the channel length included in the sub basin increases however zoch 1937 considered basin storage to occur mainly in the hillslopes in such a case r would remain essentially constant with increasing sub basin size because the hillslope size is a morphological feature that remains constant irrespective the selected sub basin size for the steep shallow streams in colorado s mountain basins we hypothesize that most of the basin storage occurs in the hillslopes thus rather than using eqs 6 or 7 we propose using a fixed value r 7 h for all sub basins this approach is directly evaluated later in this study 3 7 groundwater layer parameters the groundwater layer requires four parameters maximum groundwater storage groundwater time constant linear reservoir time constant and groundwater percolation rate maximum groundwater storage s gw represents the maximum water that can be stored in the groundwater layer for ungaged basins we propose estimating s gw based on koren et al 2000 specifically 9 s gw p gw z soil θ sat θ wp the initial groundwater storage is assumed to be zero which implies that no large storms occurred immediately before the events of interest the groundwater time constant controls the rate that water is released from the groundwater layer and the linear reservoir time constant controls the rate that the released water is routed to the sub basin outlet for simplicity we assume both time constants have the same value t gw many approaches have been proposed to estimate groundwater time constants koren et al 2000 estimated the time constant based on θ sat θ wp and a linearization constant however this method neglects topographic properties that are known to be important freeze 1972 freer et al 2002 hallema et al 2016 other approaches use theoretical relationships with hillslope length slope horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity soil porosity and aquifer depth kirkby 1989 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 samper et al 2015 to estimate time constants pereira and keller 1982 proposed regression equations for estimating groundwater time constants for different seasons in the swiss alps based on hydraulic conductivity average basin slope channel slope forest cover and mean seasonal precipitation theoretical expressions are difficult to apply because the aquifer depth is unknown and estimating an appropriate hillslope length is difficult a regression equation is unlikely to apply outside of the region for which it was developed in hec hms subsurface stormflow is routed to the outlet of the sub basin completely as groundwater feldman 2000 in reality subsurface stormflow is expected to travel a shorter distance before it enters the stream network and then travel to the sub basin outlet as streamflow this subsurface flow distance is expected to control t gw and it is likely related to the scale of the hillslopes zecharias and brutsaert 1988 samper et al 2015 we propose using a fixed value t gw 20 h for all sub basins which is similar to the values used by woolridge et al 2020 this assumption is directly evaluated later in this study the groundwater percolation rate determines the net water loss from the system and is expected to depend on the bedrock material and its jointing and weathering as noted earlier the bedrock in the front range is primarily plutonic and metamorphic while the bedrock in the san juan range is often volcanic and pyroclastic for the front range we propose using the average calibrated value from woolridge et al 2020 2 5 mm h for the san juan range we propose using 0 5 mm h which was estimated based on the performance of the models 3 8 river routing parameters the muskingum cunge river routing method requires the channel length channel slope cross section geometry channel roughness floodplain roughness and index flow feldman 2000 length and slope can be determined using hec hms the 8 point cross section in hec hms is used to represent the channel and floodplain geometry the channel part of the cross section is assumed to be rectangular which requires specification of only a single parameter the width the width is estimated from the google earth imagery and the depth is determined from manning s equation and the 2 yr peak flow from streamstats capesius and stephens 2009 woolridge et al 2020 the floodplain cross sections are developed using the dem and arcmap roughness values are assigned based on bed material and riparian vegetation from the google earth photos chow 1959 based on this information channels are given a roughness value of 0 04 while overbank areas have roughness values between 0 06 and 0 10 the index flow is estimated as the 2 yr peak streamflow from streamstats 3 9 calibrated model development the uncalibrated models are evaluated in part by comparing to calibrated models for the same basins and storm events for the front range basins the calibrated models were developed by woolridge et al 2020 they manually calibrated the maximum soil storage maximum infiltrate rate time of concentration clark storage coefficient and all groundwater parameters the parameter values were constrained to fall within physically realistic ranges and the final values were selected based on nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce peak flow error and visual goodness of fit for consistency we developed the calibrated models for the san juan basin the same way however woolridge et al 2020 neglected imperviousness which is included in the calibrated models for the san juan range as well as the uncalibrated models as discussed earlier 4 results 4 1 historical storms in this section the uncalibrated models are evaluated by comparing their results to the streamflow observations and the results from calibrated models of the historical storms fig 4 shows the observed calibrated and uncalibrated streamflow hydrographs for the front range events overall the uncalibrated model hydrographs resemble the calibrated model hydrographs with the uncalibrated models usually overestimating peak flow for the north fork big thompson river 1976 fig 4a the uncalibrated model has higher peak flow and longer time to peak due to lower infiltration rates and larger values for r and t c than the calibrated model for cheyenne creek 1997 fig 4b the uncalibrated model matches the observed peak flow better than the calibrated model because saturation excess runoff is produced in the uncalibrated model due to higher tension storage which makes saturation easier to achieve later in the storm event for bear creek 2013 fig 4e the uncalibrated model better reproduces the early part of the observed hydrograph but deviates more during the recessions due to shorter groundwater time constants compared to the calibrated model fig 5 shows the effects of sequentially changing the parameter values from the calibrated to the uncalibrated values for the big thompson river the peak flow changes most substantially when the uncalibrated values of the clark parameters t c and r are used fig 5b the recession limb changes most when the uncalibrated values of the soil and groundwater parameters f s max s ten k sat s gw t gw and percent imperviousness are used fig 5c and d fig 6 shows the observed calibrated and uncalibrated streamflow hydrographs for the san juan range events for saguache creek 1999 fig 6b the uncalibrated model significantly overestimates the observed volume but the model s peak flow is similar to the observed value the precipitation might be overestimated for this storm due to its distance from the available radars and its small spatial extent also interviews with eyewitnesses suggest that some of the streamflow bypassed the gage perry 2021 for mineral creek 2004 vallecito creek 2004 and mineral creek 2006 fig 6c fig 6d and fig 6e the uncalibrated models produce nearly constant flows during the hydrograph recession this behavior is caused in part by the high initial soil storage this water percolates and eventually saturates the groundwater layer leading to a constant discharge from that layer this behavior is more pronounced in the uncalibrated models because they have higher maximum groundwater storage values than the calibrated models table 3 indicates the runoff mechanism that occurs in the calibrated and uncalibrated models for each storm following woolridge et al 2020 runoff is considered saturation excess if the soil layer is at least 85 saturated all cases produce subsurface stormflow and most cases produce saturation excess runoff only the north fork big thompson 1976 and saguache creek 1999 events produce infiltration excess runoff the uncalibrated models almost always produce the runoff by the same mechanism as the calibrated models the exception is cheyenne creek 1997 where the calibrated model does not produce surface runoff while the uncalibrated model produces saturation excess runoff root mean squared error rmse and nsce for the streamflow rates and the percent error in total streamflow volume are also shown in table 3 for the calibrated and uncalibrated models overall the uncalibrated models usually perform slightly worse than the calibrated models the lower performance is expected because the parameters have not been adjusted in each basin to match the observed streamflow hydrograph for cheyenne creek 1997 and big thompson river 2013 the uncalibrated models perform better than the previously calibrated models in part because imperviousness was included in the uncalibrated models however for mineral creek 2004 and especially saguache creek 1999 the uncalibrated models perform much worse than the calibrated models moriasi et al 2007 specified model performance ratings based on nsce and the rmse to observations standard deviation ratio focusing only on nsce they suggested values between 0 50 and 0 65 are satisfactory values between 0 65 and 0 75 are good and values between 0 75 and 1 are very good aside from saguache creek 1999 where the observed precipitation might be overestimated and the streamflow might be underestimated the calibrated models consistently produce nsce values above 0 65 which is consistent with a good classification or better the uncalibrated models also produce nsce values above 0 65 with the exceptions of mineral creek 2004 and saguache creek 1999 overall the uncalibrated models tend to underestimate the flow volume in the front range and overestimate the flow volume in the san juan range the largest underestimation of volume by the uncalibrated models is 25 cheyenne creek 1997 the largest overestimation of volume occurs for saguache creek 1999 which is one of the two infiltration excess cases table 4 shows performance metrics that pertain to the peak flow overall the uncalibrated models perform similar to the calibrated models in terms of peak flow for percent error in peak flow the uncalibrated models perform worst for the north fork big thompson river 1976 event which is one of the two infiltration excess cases however the uncalibrated model s error in peak flow is only 10 for the saguache creek 1999 event which is the other infiltration excess case the range of percent errors in peak flow is 14 25 on average the timing of the peak is estimated very well by the calibrated models and relatively well for most of the uncalibrated models in south boulder creek the uncalibrated model predicts the peak flow much earlier than the observed peak 4 2 design storms fig 7 compares the modeled peak flows from the calibrated and uncalibrated models for the reps design storms the results from the calibrated models are viewed as the best available estimates so the uncalibrated models should reproduce these results as accurately as possible typically the differences between the calibrated and uncalibrated peak flows are larger for the shorter duration storms and for the more extreme design storms e g north fork big thompson river big thompson river and cheyenne creek for the north fork big thompson river fig 7a and saguache creek fig 7h the calibrated model uses much shorter values for t c and r than the uncalibrated model which produces higher peak flows when surface runoff occurs shorter duration storms for both basins the infiltration rate was increased in the calibrated models it is expected that this would lead to lower peak flows however the shorter values for r counteract the increase in infiltration rate and lead to higher peak flows for the calibrated models for south boulder creek fig 7c the 72 hr pmp produces low flows in both models because of gross reservoir gross reservoir also captures much of the flow from the 2 hr and 6 hr design storms for bear creek fig 7d differences in the soil layer parameters primarily soil storage produce less surface runoff for the uncalibrated model than the calibrated model for almost all design storms for vallecito creek fig 7g the uncalibrated model produces saturation excess runoff later in the 48 hr design storms which produces lower peak flows than the calibrated model the flows from the uncalibrated and calibrated models can exhibit substantial differences for the design storms fig 8 plots the distribution of the percent error in the peak flow from all the design storms and basins a positive value indicates the uncalibrated model overestimates the peak flow of the calibrated model the distribution of peak flow percent errors has a mean of 14 which suggests that the uncalibrated models are conservative on average the standard deviation is 39 which could be used to develop a factor of safety to reduce the likelihood that the uncalibrated models underestimate the peak flow 4 3 analysis of time constant assumptions in the proposed uncalibrated parameter estimation methods the clark storage coefficient r and the groundwater time constant t gw were assumed to be independent of sub basin size i e set to constants these assumptions can be tested by developing lumped models for the basins using the lumped models to simulate the design storms and comparing the results of the lumped models to the results of the semi distributed models because the design storm rainfall is spatially constant across the basin the lumped models should produce similar results to the semi distributed models if the parameters properly account for the basin size in this experiment two lumped models are considered for each basin one uses the proposed constant values for r and t gw i e the values in the lumped models remain the same as the semi distributed models the other model uses r 3 t c and t gw 12 t c i e the values scale with basin size where t c was calculated using eq 5 fig 9 shows that the lumped models with constant values produce better estimates of the semi distributed results than the lumped models with values based on t c when the lumped models are created the sub basins and reaches are replaced with a single basin the parameters of the single basin need to account for any attenuation in flow that occurs in the removed reach elements of the semi distributed model the constant values neglect any such attenuation they perform well because the muskingum cunge method produces very little attenuation in the steep and shallow reaches lee and yen 1997 lee and huang 2012 4 4 comparison to independent estimates of peak flows in this section the peak flows generated by the uncalibrated models for the reps design storms are compared to other independent estimates of extreme flows first the model results are compared to streamstats which estimates the peak discharge from 2 yr to 500 yr return periods this comparison assumes that the largest peak flow produced among the design storms for a given return period has the same return period as the design storm i e return period neutrality the streamstats estimates are produced by regional regression equations that use drainage area mean watershed elevation mean watershed slope percentage of drainage area above 2300 m mean annual precipitation and the 6 hr 100 yr precipitation from noaa atlas 2 capesius and stephens 2009 the streamstats estimates include substantial uncertainty due to the limited streamflow record lengths that were used to develop the regressions and the unreliability of extrapolating observed regressions to large return periods fig 10 shows the streamstats estimates along with the peak flow estimates from the uncalibrated models in the front and san juan ranges the figure also shows error bars on the streamstats estimates that span plus and minus the standard error reported by capesius and stephens 2009 the uncalibrated models estimate lower peak flows than streamstats for the 10 yr and 100 yr return periods although some of the model estimates fall within the error bars of the streamstats estimates these peak flows are likely produced by the spring melt of mountain snowpack or a combination of rainfall and snowmelt jarrett and tomlinson 2000 fassnacht and records 2015 kampf and lefsky 2016 particularly for the higher elevation basins table 1 snowmelt is not considered by the uncalibrated models most of the 1000 yr flows and 10 000 yr flows from the uncalibrated model applications are below the 500 yr flows from streamstats fig 10 this result could occur in part due to errors in the streamstats estimates which are expected to increase for larger return periods and it could indicate that melting snowpack continues to play a significant role for these return periods the result could also indicate that the uncalibrated models are underestimating the flows at these return periods due to errors in the reps precipitation and or errors in the watershed models for return periods larger than 10 000 yr the slope of the peak flow versus return period curve increases and the uncalibrated models predict flows above the streamstats 500 yr flow the rapid increase in peak flows is similar to the behavior pitlick 1994 observed in an analysis of streamflow records for the colorado foothills for the 48 hr storms the break in slope coincides with the initiation of saturation excess runoff this phenomenon has also been observed by kusumastuti et al 2006 regional peak flow envelope curves provide another independent method to evaluate the estimates from the models in colorado peak flow envelope curves are available for regions based on geography and elevation crippen and bue 1977 jarrett and tomlinson 2000 for this study the envelope developed by crippen and bue 1977 is used because the jarrett and tomlinson 2000 curve considers only northwestern colorado the crippen and bue 1977 envelope considers mountainous areas 2300 m as well as lower elevation areas because lower elevations are known to experience more severe storms jarrett 1993 the crippen and bue 1977 envelope is expected to overestimate peak flows for mountainous areas fig 11 displays the crippen and bue 1977 envelope the peak flow measurements in the usgs colorado flood database and the maximum peak streamflow estimates for each basin from the calibrated and uncalibrated models most of the modeled flows are produced by the 2 hr 6 hr or 72 hr pmp the modeled peak streamflow estimates are above the observed peak flows at the associated drainage area but below the envelope from crippen and bue 1977 the calibrated and uncalibrated models also produce similar results when viewed in the context of this plot 5 discussion in the literature three general approaches have been proposed to predict streamflow hydrographs for ungaged basins first regionalization transfers calibrated parameter values from one or more gaged basins to the ungaged basin blöschl and sivapalan 1995 the gaged basins can be selected based on their proximity or similarity in terms of geology morphology landcover etc to the ungaged basin zhang and chiew 2009 second relationships can be established between the parameter values and geomorphic geological soil and vegetation attributes using gaged basins kokkonen et al 2003 once the relationships are established the parameter values for the ungaged basin are estimated from the relationships and the ungaged basin s observed attributes zhang and chiew 2009 third ensemble modeling mcintyre et al 2005 averages the results of different models of gaged basins to provide an estimate of streamflow in the ungaged basin it thus avoids estimating the parameters of the ungaged basin and directly estimates the streamflow based on models from other basins mcintyre et al 2005 in our proposed uncalibrated parameter estimation methodology most parameters are estimated based on relationships to basin attributes for a few parameters e g maximum canopy storage imperviousness clark storage coefficient r and groundwater time constant t gw no such relationships could be determined so the parameters are set to constant values and applied regionally in the literature the preferred method for prediction in ungaged basins remains unclear zhang and chiew 2009 found that a regionalization approach that combines spatial proximity and physical similarity outperforms regionalization based on spatial proximity or physical similarity alone samuel et al 2011 also found that a coupled similarity proximity approach leads to better performance razavi and coulibaly 2013 found that regionalization based on proximity and similarity works best in arid to temperate climates as well as cold and snowy regions however they found that relationship based methods perform better in warm temperate regions mcintyre et al 2005 found that ensemble modeling performs better than a relationship based approach in the present study the results of the uncalibrated models were compared to the results of calibrated models based on woolridge et al 2020 the uncalibrated parameter estimation method has some similarities to the parameter estimation used by woolridge et al 2020 the uncalibrated models maximum canopy storage is the average of the values they used for north facing and south facing slopes the uncalibrated models maximum infiltration rate is similar to the preliminary estimates from woolridge et al 2020 but they ultimately calibrated this parameter the groundwater percolation rate in uncalibrated models of the front range is the average of the woolridge et al 2020 calibrated values and all the routing parameters are estimated the same as woolridge et al 2020 despite these similarities most parameter values differ between the uncalibrated and calibrated models the uncalibrated models errors are larger than those of the calibrated models as expected however the uncalibrated models generally produce streamflow by the same mechanisms as the associated calibrated models and the uncalibrated models provide reasonable estimates of the peak streamflow and total stream volumes for historical events the differences between the two modeling approaches are small when compared to the crippen and bue 1977 peak flow envelope curve and both models produce peak discharges that are conservative relative to the observed peak flows the sabol 2008 guidelines neglect subsurface stormflow and saturation excess runoff which were important for some recent extreme events and thus are relevant to dam safety evaluations woolridge et al 2020 the proposed modeling approach can produce discharge from such mechanisms the sabol 2008 guidelines are also known to greatly overestimate major floods in the mountains jarrett 1993 perry et al 2017 in contrast the median percent error in the peak flow is 6 for the uncalibrated models of the historical events the median nsce of the proposed uncalibrated models is 0 70 for context razavi and coulibaly 2013 evaluated the performance of uncalibrated models in studies across different regions and climates and the average nsce for the models in those studies is 0 61 with a range from 0 12 to 0 97 however several limitations remain the methods were developed and tested using basins from two mountain ranges in colorado basins in central colorado such as the gore sawatch and elk ranges and western colorado such as the flat tops grand mesa and the uncompahgre plateau were not considered due to lack of hourly precipitation and complete hydrographs for events that are large enough to be relevant to dam safety applications each range has distinct geologic geomorphologic and vegetation characteristics which are expected to impact the performance of the proposed methods also the proposed groundwater percolation rate differs between the front range and the san juan range appropriate values for this parameter in other mountain ranges are unknown the proposed methods have not been tested in non mountainous portions of colorado such as the eastern plains bedrock is often very deep in the plains soil survey staff 2020 so saturation excess runoff and subsurface stormflow are less likely most historical storms considered in this study had long durations that produced subsurface stormflow and saturation excess runoff only two short duration high intensity storms producing infiltration excess runoff were available north fork big thompson river 1976 and saguache creek 1999 for north fork big thompson river 1976 an incomplete hydrograph prevents a detailed evaluation of the model for saguache creek 1999 the localized precipitation might be inaccurate and discharge was observed to bypass the stream gage also the performance of the uncalibrated models is worse for the shorter storms than the longer storms thus substantial uncertainty remains in the simulation of short duration high intensity storms continuing research should explore ways to estimate the assumed constant parameter values from basin characteristics an improved canopy storage could consider fractional vegetation cover which is already used in the parameter estimation methods groundwater parameters could be better constrained by considering smaller historical storms smaller storms are less likely to produce surface runoff so they cannot be used to constrain surface runoff related parameters however subsurface stormflow still occurs for these events so the related parameters can be analyzed the results of the uncalibrated models when forced with reps design storms were compared to streamstats peak streamflow estimates although streamstats provides consistent independent estimates of peak streamflow these estimates contain substantial uncertainty because they rely on regional regression equations future studies should also compare the model results to bulletin 17 c analyses of stream gage records england et al 2019 bulletin 17 c is expected to provide improved estimates of peak flows for given return periods but it would still include uncertainties associated with limited record lengths impacts of climate change on basin hydrology were not considered this study focused only on rainfall induced flooding in relatively undisturbed mountain watersheds due in part to climate change wildfires are increasing in frequency and size across the western united states brown et al 2004 abatzoglou and kolden 2013 wildfires alter the soil structure and increase water repellency which increases runoff production for years debano 2000 doerr et al 2000 climate change is also expected to diminish the role of snowmelt and increase the role of rainfall in producing flood peaks kampf and lefsky 2016 rain on snow events are becoming more common in the western united states with climate change as well surfleet and tullos 2013 if rainfall occurs when snowpack is present it can produce much larger flows due to abrupt melting of snow these events have potentially occurred in colorado fema 2010 but might become more common under the modified climate climate change could also change the temporal distribution of antecedent soil moisture which has the potential to impact runoff production for a given event 6 conclusions the purpose of this study was to develop parameter estimation methods that can be used to simulate the response of ungaged mountain basins in colorado to large rainfall events e g watershed average depths around 100 mm or more the study focuses on the sma method in hec hms which was previously shown to reproduce the streamflow generation mechanisms for large storms in the colorado front range woolridge et al 2020 the results from the uncalibrated models were compared to observed streamflow the results from the calibrated models streamstats and a regional peak flow envelope the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the proposed parameter estimation methods typically perform well for the studied historical storms in the front range and san juan range the median rmse and nsce for the uncalibrated models are 6 20 m3 s and 0 70 respectively for comparison the median rmse and nsce for the calibrated models are 4 40 m3 s and 0 80 respectively for all but one historical event the uncalibrated models produce streamflow by the same mechanisms as the calibrated models for the case where the mechanism changed cheyenne creek 1997 the overall model performance of the uncalibrated model was better than the previously calibrated model the uncalibrated models provide rough estimates of the peak flows from the calibrated models for the design storms in the studied basins on average the uncalibrated models overestimate the peak flows from the calibrated models by 14 however the standard deviation of the peak flow error is 39 thus the predictions from the uncalibrated models are typically but not consistently conservative the uncalibrated models may not produce accurate peak flows for return periods less than 1000 yr to 10 000 yr for these return periods the models produce lower peak flows than the regional regression equation in streamstats this underestimation likely occurs because the models neglect the contribution from snowmelt which can play an important role for small return periods kampf and lefsky 2016 the inconsistency could also arise due to errors in the streamstats estimates for return periods at or above 10 000 yr the peak flows from the models are usually much higher than the streamstats 500 yr flows as expected the uncalibrated models appear to produce reasonable results for very large storm events the largest streamflow values from the uncalibrated models among all design storms are above all the observed peak flows in the usgs colorado flood database they are below the envelope developed by crippen and bue 1977 which is expected because that envelope also considered lower elevations which experience higher peak flows overall the uncalibrated modeling methods appear to provide reasonable estimates of streamflow hydrographs from large storm events while these methods can be used in dam safety analyses they should be used in a way that accounts for the uncertainty in their results we recommend that dam managers use multiple pathways to develop streamflow estimates and conservatively interpret those estimates comparison and even calibration to independent streamflow estimates is recommended a factor of safety should also be considered the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimation methods was estimated by comparing the peak flows from the uncalibrated and calibrated models for the design storms the resulting distribution of errors could be used to select a factor of safety that partially accounts for the uncertainty in the model parameterization however numerous factors were neglected that might also affect dam safety evaluations including snowmelt rain on snow wildfire impacts sediment bulking and climate change therefore a more general factor of safety may be warranted in spillway embankment and freeboard designs

7770,study region rocky mountains in colorado including front and san juan ranges study focus hydrologic modeling of ungaged mountain basins plays an important role in ensuring the safety of colorado s dams recent research has shown that infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff and subsurface stormflow can all contribute to streamflow generated by extreme rainfall in colorado s mountains and the soil moisture accounting sma method in hec hms has been suggested as an appropriate approach to model these mechanisms however sma requires estimation of parameters that have not been previously considered for large floods the objective of this work is to develop methods to estimate sma parameters for modeling the response to extreme rainfall in ungaged mountain basins of colorado where calibration to observed discharges is not possible new hydrological insights for the region the proposed parameter estimation methods are tested for five basins in the front range and three basins in the san juan range that have streamflow data available for major flood events for these historical events the proposed uncalibrated models produce the same streamflow generation processes as calibrated models and the predicted peak discharges from the uncalibrated models usually have 25 errors or smaller for design storms the peak discharges from the uncalibrated models can differ substantially from the peak discharges from calibrated models but are conservative relative to the envelope of observed peak discharges graphical abstract ga1 keywords colorado mountains hydrologic modeling ungaged basins parameter estimation soil moisture accounting extreme rainfall data availability models and data will be posted at mountain scholar csu s data repository after the paper has been finalized accepted 1 introduction dams must safely convey floods in order to avoid potential failures and associated environmental damages economic losses and risks to public safety depending on the local regulations and associated risks dams might be evaluated for events with specified return periods e g 100 years to 107 years and or the probable maximum flood for these events estimates are needed for the peak streamflow rates to evaluate spillway sizing and total streamflow volume to consider freeboard requirements peak streamflow rates can be estimated by analyzing streamflow records with methods such as bulletin 17 c england et al 2019 if a stream gage with adequate record length is available at the dam however many dams are in ungaged basins colorado for example has more than 2000 dams and the vast majority do not have associated streamflow gages alternatively peak streamflow rates can be estimated by applying regression equations such as those found in streamstats capesius and stephens 2009 however such regression equations were developed using limited streamflow record lengths so they are less reliable and often unavailable for large return periods furthermore the mechanisms that produce annual peak flows can change with return period in colorado more frequent annual peak flows are produced by snowmelt in high elevation mountain basins 3100 m mixtures of snowmelt and rainfall for intermediate elevation basins 2000 3100 m and rainfall alone for low elevation basins 2000 m fassnacht and records 2015 kampf and lefsky 2016 however more extreme flood peaks are thought to be produced by rainfall in colorado s mountains jarrett 1990 pitlick 1994 in part because the most damaging historical floods have been produced by rainfall including the 1976 big thompson river flood and the 2013 front range floods woolridge et al 2020 due to these limitations on estimating peak streamflow rates and because streamflow volumes are also required in dam safety evaluations there is an ongoing need to model the response of ungaged watersheds to extreme rainfall events in colorado design storms are generated based on the regional extreme precipitation study reps cdwr and nmose 2018 reps updated probable maximum precipitation pmp estimates by including recent extreme storm events and developed return period based precipitation estimates that account for the different meteorological mechanisms that can produce extreme precipitation in the region hydrologic models are then used to estimate the streamflow hydrographs that are generated from the design storms colorado s modeling guidelines sabol 2008 assume that streamflow from extreme rainfall is generated by infiltration excess runoff horton 1940 and recommend modeling runoff production using the green and ampt method sabol 2008 or the initial and constant loss method ferc 2001 however through an examination of several large historical floods in colorado s front range woolridge et al 2020 found that infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff dunne and black 1970a 1970b and subsurface stormflow kirkby and chorley 1967 can all significantly contribute to streamflow in particular the 2013 front range floods were produced by a low intensity but prolonged storm gochis et al 2015 that produced runoff by saturating soils from below woolridge et al 2020 this mechanism is not considered by the sabol 2008 guidelines woolridge et al 2020 recommended the soil moisture accounting sma loss method within hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms bennett et al 1998 bennett et al 2000 to simulate runoff production mechanisms for extreme rainfall events in mountain basins of colorado unlike green ampt or initial and constant loss methods sma s infiltration capacity can decrease to zero when the soil layer saturates this low infiltration capacity is necessary to reproduce saturation excess runoff and the observed hydrographs from the 2013 event woolridge et al 2020 in developing their models they disaggregated five study basins into sub basins in order to better represent the spatial variation of observed precipitation they further divided the sub basins into north facing and south facing components to account for aspect related differences in vegetation and soil the clark 1945 method was used to transform runoff into streamflow and a linear reservoir was used to transform subsurface stormflow into streamflow this modeling approach reproduced the active streamflow mechanisms for the large observed floods in the front range and it was able to reproduce the observed hydrographs with good to very good accuracy according to the criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2007 sma requires specification of several parameters that have not been previously considered in dam safety evaluations in colorado s mountains including the total storage capacity of the soil which is important in determining saturation excess runoff and the time constant for the subsurface stormflow response which strongly influences the peak streamflow rate woolridge et al 2020 estimated several required parameters by calibrating to streamflow observations but calibration is not possible in ungaged basins furthermore no guidance is available in the scientific literature regarding uncalibrated sma model parameter estimation although several studies have provided calibrated parameter values sorooshian et al 1993 bennett et al 2000 feldman 2000 the objective of this research is to develop and test a parameter estimation method for sma based hec hms models that simulate the response to extreme rainfall events in ungaged mountain basins of colorado the proposed parameter estimation method determines most parameters based on the physical characteristics of the ungaged basins in cases where such relationships cannot be determined constant parameter values are applied throughout the region we refer to the resulting models as uncalibrated because the parameters are not adjusted in individual basins to match the streamflow observations the uncalibrated modeling approach is developed and evaluated using relatively undisturbed and unurbanized basins in the front and san juan ranges of colorado the uncalibrated models and associated results can be accessed at irvin et al 2022 the modeling approach is first evaluated by simulating historical flood events and comparing to observed flows and the results of calibrated models for the front range the calibrated models were developed by woolridge et al 2020 for the san juan range new calibrated models are developed using the procedures of woolridge et al 2020 the uncalibrated models are also evaluated by simulating the discharge from return period and pmp design storms and comparing to the results of the calibrated models independent estimates of extreme flows from streamstats capesius and stephens 2009 and a regional peak flow envelope curve crippen and bue 1977 2 study basins and events 2 1 basins eight basins were selected for modeling because they have experienced significant floods for which hourly precipitation data are available to force the model simulations and at least a partial hydrograph is available for model evaluation five are in the front range and three are in the san juan range fig 1 basic characteristics of the basins can be found in table 1 mineral creek and vallecito creek are in the heart of the san juan range while saguache creek is in the cochetopa hills which connect the san juan and sawatch ranges the front range is in north central colorado it is a laramide range with a core of precambrian crystalline rock gneiss and granodiorite and uplifted adjacent mesozoic sedimentary rock dickinson et al 1988 anderson et al 2015 common vegetation types include lodgepole pine aspen douglas fir limber pine shrubs and herbaceous understory anderson et al 2019 ebel 2012 at low elevations the north facing slopes are primarily forested while south facing slopes are shrublands ebel 2012 at intermediate elevations hillslopes are primarily forested irrespective of their aspect high elevations are above timberline soils typically have high sand content and fall in hydrologic groups a and b soil survey staff 2020 the san juan range is in southwestern colorado it is geologically complex with a core of precambrian crystalline rocks localized areas of volcanism and intrusive igneous rock and sedimentary rocks along the range margins chimner et al 2010 ash flow tuffs and basalt flows and associated tuff and breccia are also present tweto 1979 common vegetation types include ponderosa pine mexican white pine subalpine fir colorado blue spruce shrubby cinquefoil and rabbitbrush zier and baker 2006 like the front range the high elevations are above timberline soils have lower sand content than the front range but still typically fall into hydrologic groups a and b soil survey staff 2020 little urbanization is present in any of the watersheds 2 2 historical storms a summary of the considered historical storms is provided in table 2 all four flood generating storm types in reps are included in the dataset a mesoscale storm with embedded convection mec is an organized mesoscale to sub synoptic scale storm system that has embedded thunderstorms an mec storm occurred over the north fork of the big thompson river basin in 1976 mccain et al 1979 a mid latitude cyclone mlc is a synoptic scale system associated with low pressure and cyclonic circulation mlc events occurred over cheyenne creek in 1997 and over most of the front range in 2013 gochis et al 2015 another mlc event occurred over mineral creek and vallecito creek in 2006 fema 2010 a tropical storm remnant tsr is a storm that is associated with a hurricane or tropical cyclone atmospheric environment a tsr event occurred over vallecito creek in 1970 roeske 1971 as well as mineral creek and vallecito creek in 2004 a local storm ls is a small scale thunderstorm that occurs in the absence of a large scale storm system an ls event occurred over the northeast portion of the saguache creek basin in 1999 perry 2021 rainfall data for the historical storms were obtained from the storm precipitation analysis system spas parzybok and tomlinson 2006 spas uses rain gage and radar data to estimate the spatial 36 arc second or approximately 850 m resolution and temporal 1 h resolution patterns of precipitation metstat 2018 nexrad radar heiss et al 1990 became available in the mid 1990 s so precipitation estimates after this date are expected to be more accurate vertical polarization of the signal began in 2006 which helps identify hail contamination and further improves the estimates hubbert and pratte 2006 a nexrad radar is available in denver which is adjacent to the front range at the time of the historical storms the nearest nexrad radars to the san juan range were in grand junction and pueblo because these radars are far from the range 150 km the beam is high and diffusive which leads to lower accuracy in the precipitation rates for san juan storms kitchen and jackson 1993 smith et al 1996 young et al 1999 streamflow data were obtained from u s geological survey and colorado division of water resources gages and typically have a 15 min resolution however for the vallecito creek 1970 event only daily average flows and the peak flow are available for the north fork big thompson river 1976 event only a partial hydrograph is available but it captures the peak flow mccain et al 1979 for the vallecito creek 2004 event only a partial hydrograph is available and it is not known whether the peak flow was captured to give a sense of the magnitude of the flood events table 2 provides the ratios between the observed peak flows and the streamstats 100 yr flows capesius and stephens 2009 https streamstats usgs gov ss the front range storms usually produced higher ratios than the san juan range storms the north fork big thompson river 1976 event produced the highest ratio among all the events runoff coefficients were calculated as the total volume of discharge divided by the total volume of precipitation the highest runoff coefficients occurred in mineral creek and vallecito creek for the 2006 storm table 2 a flood insurance study by fema 2010 suggested that rain on snow occurred for this event which could explain the high runoff coefficients however an examination of nearby snow telemetry snotel sites did not show a clear melting of snowpack saguache creek 1999 has a lower runoff coefficient than the other basins storms the lower value occurs in part because the 1999 storm only occurred in a part of this large basin if the runoff coefficient is calculated using the storm area rather than the basin area it increases to 0 44 which is similar to the other values in table 2 2 3 design storms the design storms were obtained from reps specifically 2 hr ls events 6 hr mec events and 48 hr mlc events with return periods between 10 yr and 107 yr are modeled in each basin three pmp storms 2 hr 6 hr and 72 hr are also modeled in each basin in reps the return period based rainfall estimates are produced using a 4 parameter kappa distribution with no upper bound which allows those events to exceed the pmp on occasion cdwr and nmose 2018 3 parameter estimation methodology 3 1 model components the main components and processes included in each sub basin of the hec hms models are based on woolridge et al 2020 fig 2 rainfall first enters the canopy storage which represents interception this storage must be filled before precipitated water can enter the other storage volumes feldman 2000 water in the canopy storage is held until it is removed by evaporation surface storage i e depression storage is not explicitly represented in our models because the canopy and surfaces storages behave the same way if included in sma the canopy storage element may implicitly represent some surface storage in our models when canopy storage is overcome rainfall becomes throughfall and can contribute to the soil storage the infiltration capacity is a linear function of the current soil storage the soil storage includes water that attaches to the soil particles and can only be removed by evapotranspiration et i e tension storage it also includes water that fills the pore spaces between the soil particles and can be removed by et or gravity drainage i e gravity storage feldman 2000 runoff is transformed into streamflow at the sub basin outlet by the clark 1945 method this method uses a dimensionless time area curve and the time of concentration to account for the translation of flow to the sub basin outlet it also uses a linear reservoir to account for sub basin storage effects clark 1945 when the soil storage exceeds the maximum tension storage water can enter groundwater storage via soil percolation the groundwater layer represents any saturated layer on top of the bedrock feldman 2000 and outflow from this layer depends in part on its current storage the outflow is converted into streamflow at the sub basin outlet by a linear reservoir the outflow from the linear reservoir is a function of the current reservoir storage and a specified time constant river routing is needed to combine flows from upper and lower sub basins the muskingum cunge method is used for routing because it includes flood wave advection and attenuation feldman 2000 and it allows overbank flows which are expected for extreme events woolridge et al 2020 south boulder creek basin contains a reservoir gross reservoir and uses reservoir routing an elevation storage discharge relationship outlet structure information and initial conditions were obtained from the division of water resources and denver water south boulder creek also includes moffatt tunnel which moves water under the continental divide and the south boulder creek diversion for both specified flows were obtained from the division of water resources 3 2 basin disaggregation hec hms assumes that rainfall and watershed properties are spatially uniform within sub basins we use the same sub basin disaggregation method as woolridge et al 2020 while neglecting the separate consideration of north facing and south facing hillslopes separate north facing and south facing slopes are not considered because that approach greatly increases the number of parameters that require estimation while providing little improvement in model performance see further discussion below the sub basins were determined using 1 3 arc second resolution 10 m digital elevation model dem from the national elevation dataset u s geological survey 2020a the channel network was derived from the dem using a contributing area threshold and a sub basin was included for each source and link in the channel network djokic et al 2011 a 15 km2 threshold is used because the resulting sub basins have relatively uniform rainfall in space while the number of sub basins remains low woolridge et al 2020 the sub basins produced by this disaggregation method are shown for the big thompson river basin in fig s1 3 3 data sources for parameter estimation an overview of the proposed parameter estimation procedure is provided in fig 3 the parameters are estimated from five data sources which are available for ungaged watersheds in colorado first landsat 8 imagery u s geological survey 2020b is used to characterize the vegetation coverage and its effect on soil hydraulic properties from landsat 8 we use the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which is a measure of surface greenness montandon and small 2008 fractional vegetation cover is computed from ndvi using a linear function montandon and small 2008 vermote et al 2016 the endpoints of the linear function are the ndvi s for fully vegetated areas ndvi and barren areas ndvi0 which have been estimated in the front range as ndvi 0 70 and ndvi0 0 04 timilsina et al 2021 for simplicity we use these values to estimate fractional vegetation cover in both the front and san juan ranges second the nrcs gridded national soil survey geographic database gnatsgo is used to estimate the soil parameters fig 3 gnatsgo relies mainly on the nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo with gaps filled using the state soil geographic database statsgo2 and raster soil survey database rss soil survey staff 2020 from gnatsgo we use percent sand percent clay and percent organic matter from the soil surface to a depth of 60 cm the 60 cm value was chosen based on typical soil depths in the colorado mountains soil survey staff 2020 the depth to any restrictive layer z soil is also obtained from gnatsgo for conservatism and consistency with the soil texture estimates if the sub basin average depth to restrictive layer exceeds 60 cm z soil is set to 60 cm basic soil hydraulic properties are calculated from the gnatsgo soil texture information using pedotransfer functions rawls et al 1983 saxton and rawls 2006 the outputs of these pedotransfer functions are grids of soil moisture content at saturation θ s field capacity θ fld wilting point θ wp wetting front suction head ψ f and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity is then adjusted based on the fractional vegetation cover as recommended by sabol 2008 and divided by two to account for possible unsaturated flow bouwer 1964 woolridge et al 2020 to produce the final saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat the gridded soil hydraulic properties are then averaged to obtain values for each sub basin fig s1 shows the sub basin boundaries and key gridded data inputs for the big thompson river basin the third data source is the dem fig 3 which is used in the hec hms terrain processing functions to characterize sub basin and reach geomorphology the outputs of this processing include the sub basin area a the flow length between the hydraulically most distant point and the outlet l the watercourse slope s and the flow length between a point on l that is perpendicular to the watershed centroid and the outlet l ca sabol 2008 fourth google earth satellite imagery google 2020 is used to identify floodplain and channel characteristics fig 3 fifth streamstats capesius and stephens 2009 is used to estimate the 2 year flow in each reach 3 4 canopy parameters the canopy model requires estimation of three parameters maximum canopy storage initial canopy storage and canopy evaporation rate woolridge et al 2020 estimated the maximum canopy storage and canopy evaporation rate using measurements from the cache la poudre experimental catchment in the front range traff et al 2015 throughfall was measured under the dominant vegetation species on north facing slopes ponderosa pines and south facing slopes antelope bitterbrush and rainfall was measured in an open area woolridge et al 2020 calibrated the maximum canopy storage and canopy evaporation for each hillslope orientation to reproduce the observed throughfall rates as closely as possible we propose using a simple average of the north facing and south facing maximum canopy storage values for ungaged basins 4 3 mm in reality the canopy storage is expected to vary with the dominant vegetation species and density of vegetation cover sabol 2008 but the quantitative dependence of canopy storage on these factors is poorly understood like woolridge et al 2020 we assume that the initial canopy storage is zero timilsina et al 2021 determined a function to estimate average potential et from elevation in the front range for ungaged basins we propose estimating the canopy evaporation as the average potential et at the average elevation of each sub basin from the timilsina et al 2021 function this procedure assumes that the canopy evaporation occurs at the potential et rate and that the dependence of potential et on elevation in the front range applies to other ranges in colorado 3 5 soil layer parameters the soil layer model has six parameters maximum infiltration rate maximum soil storage tension storage initial soil storage soil percolation rate and imperviousness the maximum infiltration rate f is the highest rate at which water can enter the soil layer following woolridge et al 2020 we propose estimating f as the green and ampt 1911 infiltration rate when the wetting front is near the ground surface i e early in the storm when the soil is dry 1 f k sat 1 ψ f δ where δ is the depth of the wetting front which is selected as 7 5 cm following woolridge et al 2020 and sabol 2008 maximum soil storage s max represents the total water that can be stored and removed from the soil layer including both tension and gravity storage for ungaged basins we propose estimating s max based on an approach koren et al 2000 suggested for the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma burnash et al 1995 specifically 2 s max 1 p gw z soil θ sat θ wp where p gw is the fraction of the soil column above the restrictive layer that is dedicated to groundwater storage the wilting point is subtracted in eq 2 because no natural mechanism lowers the soil moisture below the wilting point p gw is difficult to estimate because the thickness of the groundwater layer likely varies between events p gw 0 10 was selected based on the model performance for gaged basins considered in this study we propose estimating tension storage s ten also following koren et al 2000 specifically 3 s ten 1 p gw z soil θ fld θ wp in sma the groundwater layer does not consider tension storage so any water stored in the groundwater layer can drain however the groundwater layer represents the bottom of the soil column so tension storage occurs in reality because such storage cannot be included in the groundwater layer it is included in the soil layer by increasing θ fld by 30 the soil percolation rate is the maximum rate at which water moves from the soil layer to the groundwater layer we assume that the soil percolation occurs as gravity drainage i e without a soil suction gradient in that case darcy s law indicates that the soil percolation rate is k sat fig s2 shows an example of the gridded soil layer parameters for the big thompson river basin table s1 provides average parameter values for all basins considered the initial soil storage is the portion of the maximum soil storage that is occupied by water at the start of the simulation for the historical storms this value was estimated from nearby soil moisture sensors if available snotel stations or anderson et al 2019 and otherwise calibrated for the design storms and ungaged basins we used the adjusted field capacity sabol 2008 the imperviousness is defined as the portion of a sub basin for which all precipitation becomes runoff feldman 2000 natural imperviousness can occur in mountain basins as bedrock outcrops and canyon walls landcover datasets are known to underestimate natural imperviousness by large margins petliak et al 2019 we considered estimating natural imperviousness as the portion of the sub basin where the depth to any soil restrictive layer is zero soil survey staff 2020 we also considered treating any gnatsgo soil units with a leading descriptor of bedrock as impervious however these approaches are speculative in part because they do not consider the hydrologic connectivity of the imperviousness other mountain hydrology studies have used values between 2 and 5 for imperviousness ahl et al 2008 din et al 2019 consequently 5 imperviousness is proposed for ungaged basins in colorado 3 6 transform parameters the clark transform method requires specification of a dimensionless time area curve that describes the cumulative distribution of travel times from each point to the sub basin outlet clark 1945 feldman 2000 woolridge et al 2020 obtained a time area distribution for each sub basin using cumulative travel time rasters from the dem landcover data and an approximation of manning s equation we propose using the default dimensionless time area curve in hec hms which is 4 a t a 1 414 t t c 1 5 t t c 2 1 1 414 1 t t c 1 5 t t c 2 where t c is the time of concentration t is a time between 0 and t c and a t is the area of the sub basin contributing flow at time t the clark method also requires specification of t c many empirical equations are available for estimating t c see almeida et al 2014 we used the expression for the rocky mountains from sabol 2008 5 t c 2 47 a 0 078 l 0 212 l ca 0 212 s 0 263 where sub basin area a is in km2 l is in km s is in m km and l ca is in km we applied several other methods from almeida et al 2014 to cheyenne creek and found that they produce similar estimates to the sabol 2008 expression specifically the folmar et al 2007 linsley et al 1992 yen and chow 1983 and kirpich 1940 equations estimate t c within 10 min 9 20 min 18 5 min 4 and 15 min 13 of the sabol 2008 estimate respectively the clark method also requires the linear reservoir storage coefficient r feldman 2000 the storage coefficient is commonly estimated by defining x as 6 x r r t c and assuming that x remains constant within a given region ferc 2001 dunn et al 2001 yoo et al 2014 this approach is the same as assuming 7 r y t c where 8 y x 1 x similarly empirical expressions have been proposed to estimate r as a function of t c sabol 2008 all these approaches imply that r increases with increasing sub basin size and it is consistent with clark 1945 who considered basin storage to occur mainly in channels as sub basin size increases the channel length included in the sub basin increases however zoch 1937 considered basin storage to occur mainly in the hillslopes in such a case r would remain essentially constant with increasing sub basin size because the hillslope size is a morphological feature that remains constant irrespective the selected sub basin size for the steep shallow streams in colorado s mountain basins we hypothesize that most of the basin storage occurs in the hillslopes thus rather than using eqs 6 or 7 we propose using a fixed value r 7 h for all sub basins this approach is directly evaluated later in this study 3 7 groundwater layer parameters the groundwater layer requires four parameters maximum groundwater storage groundwater time constant linear reservoir time constant and groundwater percolation rate maximum groundwater storage s gw represents the maximum water that can be stored in the groundwater layer for ungaged basins we propose estimating s gw based on koren et al 2000 specifically 9 s gw p gw z soil θ sat θ wp the initial groundwater storage is assumed to be zero which implies that no large storms occurred immediately before the events of interest the groundwater time constant controls the rate that water is released from the groundwater layer and the linear reservoir time constant controls the rate that the released water is routed to the sub basin outlet for simplicity we assume both time constants have the same value t gw many approaches have been proposed to estimate groundwater time constants koren et al 2000 estimated the time constant based on θ sat θ wp and a linearization constant however this method neglects topographic properties that are known to be important freeze 1972 freer et al 2002 hallema et al 2016 other approaches use theoretical relationships with hillslope length slope horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity soil porosity and aquifer depth kirkby 1989 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 samper et al 2015 to estimate time constants pereira and keller 1982 proposed regression equations for estimating groundwater time constants for different seasons in the swiss alps based on hydraulic conductivity average basin slope channel slope forest cover and mean seasonal precipitation theoretical expressions are difficult to apply because the aquifer depth is unknown and estimating an appropriate hillslope length is difficult a regression equation is unlikely to apply outside of the region for which it was developed in hec hms subsurface stormflow is routed to the outlet of the sub basin completely as groundwater feldman 2000 in reality subsurface stormflow is expected to travel a shorter distance before it enters the stream network and then travel to the sub basin outlet as streamflow this subsurface flow distance is expected to control t gw and it is likely related to the scale of the hillslopes zecharias and brutsaert 1988 samper et al 2015 we propose using a fixed value t gw 20 h for all sub basins which is similar to the values used by woolridge et al 2020 this assumption is directly evaluated later in this study the groundwater percolation rate determines the net water loss from the system and is expected to depend on the bedrock material and its jointing and weathering as noted earlier the bedrock in the front range is primarily plutonic and metamorphic while the bedrock in the san juan range is often volcanic and pyroclastic for the front range we propose using the average calibrated value from woolridge et al 2020 2 5 mm h for the san juan range we propose using 0 5 mm h which was estimated based on the performance of the models 3 8 river routing parameters the muskingum cunge river routing method requires the channel length channel slope cross section geometry channel roughness floodplain roughness and index flow feldman 2000 length and slope can be determined using hec hms the 8 point cross section in hec hms is used to represent the channel and floodplain geometry the channel part of the cross section is assumed to be rectangular which requires specification of only a single parameter the width the width is estimated from the google earth imagery and the depth is determined from manning s equation and the 2 yr peak flow from streamstats capesius and stephens 2009 woolridge et al 2020 the floodplain cross sections are developed using the dem and arcmap roughness values are assigned based on bed material and riparian vegetation from the google earth photos chow 1959 based on this information channels are given a roughness value of 0 04 while overbank areas have roughness values between 0 06 and 0 10 the index flow is estimated as the 2 yr peak streamflow from streamstats 3 9 calibrated model development the uncalibrated models are evaluated in part by comparing to calibrated models for the same basins and storm events for the front range basins the calibrated models were developed by woolridge et al 2020 they manually calibrated the maximum soil storage maximum infiltrate rate time of concentration clark storage coefficient and all groundwater parameters the parameter values were constrained to fall within physically realistic ranges and the final values were selected based on nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce peak flow error and visual goodness of fit for consistency we developed the calibrated models for the san juan basin the same way however woolridge et al 2020 neglected imperviousness which is included in the calibrated models for the san juan range as well as the uncalibrated models as discussed earlier 4 results 4 1 historical storms in this section the uncalibrated models are evaluated by comparing their results to the streamflow observations and the results from calibrated models of the historical storms fig 4 shows the observed calibrated and uncalibrated streamflow hydrographs for the front range events overall the uncalibrated model hydrographs resemble the calibrated model hydrographs with the uncalibrated models usually overestimating peak flow for the north fork big thompson river 1976 fig 4a the uncalibrated model has higher peak flow and longer time to peak due to lower infiltration rates and larger values for r and t c than the calibrated model for cheyenne creek 1997 fig 4b the uncalibrated model matches the observed peak flow better than the calibrated model because saturation excess runoff is produced in the uncalibrated model due to higher tension storage which makes saturation easier to achieve later in the storm event for bear creek 2013 fig 4e the uncalibrated model better reproduces the early part of the observed hydrograph but deviates more during the recessions due to shorter groundwater time constants compared to the calibrated model fig 5 shows the effects of sequentially changing the parameter values from the calibrated to the uncalibrated values for the big thompson river the peak flow changes most substantially when the uncalibrated values of the clark parameters t c and r are used fig 5b the recession limb changes most when the uncalibrated values of the soil and groundwater parameters f s max s ten k sat s gw t gw and percent imperviousness are used fig 5c and d fig 6 shows the observed calibrated and uncalibrated streamflow hydrographs for the san juan range events for saguache creek 1999 fig 6b the uncalibrated model significantly overestimates the observed volume but the model s peak flow is similar to the observed value the precipitation might be overestimated for this storm due to its distance from the available radars and its small spatial extent also interviews with eyewitnesses suggest that some of the streamflow bypassed the gage perry 2021 for mineral creek 2004 vallecito creek 2004 and mineral creek 2006 fig 6c fig 6d and fig 6e the uncalibrated models produce nearly constant flows during the hydrograph recession this behavior is caused in part by the high initial soil storage this water percolates and eventually saturates the groundwater layer leading to a constant discharge from that layer this behavior is more pronounced in the uncalibrated models because they have higher maximum groundwater storage values than the calibrated models table 3 indicates the runoff mechanism that occurs in the calibrated and uncalibrated models for each storm following woolridge et al 2020 runoff is considered saturation excess if the soil layer is at least 85 saturated all cases produce subsurface stormflow and most cases produce saturation excess runoff only the north fork big thompson 1976 and saguache creek 1999 events produce infiltration excess runoff the uncalibrated models almost always produce the runoff by the same mechanism as the calibrated models the exception is cheyenne creek 1997 where the calibrated model does not produce surface runoff while the uncalibrated model produces saturation excess runoff root mean squared error rmse and nsce for the streamflow rates and the percent error in total streamflow volume are also shown in table 3 for the calibrated and uncalibrated models overall the uncalibrated models usually perform slightly worse than the calibrated models the lower performance is expected because the parameters have not been adjusted in each basin to match the observed streamflow hydrograph for cheyenne creek 1997 and big thompson river 2013 the uncalibrated models perform better than the previously calibrated models in part because imperviousness was included in the uncalibrated models however for mineral creek 2004 and especially saguache creek 1999 the uncalibrated models perform much worse than the calibrated models moriasi et al 2007 specified model performance ratings based on nsce and the rmse to observations standard deviation ratio focusing only on nsce they suggested values between 0 50 and 0 65 are satisfactory values between 0 65 and 0 75 are good and values between 0 75 and 1 are very good aside from saguache creek 1999 where the observed precipitation might be overestimated and the streamflow might be underestimated the calibrated models consistently produce nsce values above 0 65 which is consistent with a good classification or better the uncalibrated models also produce nsce values above 0 65 with the exceptions of mineral creek 2004 and saguache creek 1999 overall the uncalibrated models tend to underestimate the flow volume in the front range and overestimate the flow volume in the san juan range the largest underestimation of volume by the uncalibrated models is 25 cheyenne creek 1997 the largest overestimation of volume occurs for saguache creek 1999 which is one of the two infiltration excess cases table 4 shows performance metrics that pertain to the peak flow overall the uncalibrated models perform similar to the calibrated models in terms of peak flow for percent error in peak flow the uncalibrated models perform worst for the north fork big thompson river 1976 event which is one of the two infiltration excess cases however the uncalibrated model s error in peak flow is only 10 for the saguache creek 1999 event which is the other infiltration excess case the range of percent errors in peak flow is 14 25 on average the timing of the peak is estimated very well by the calibrated models and relatively well for most of the uncalibrated models in south boulder creek the uncalibrated model predicts the peak flow much earlier than the observed peak 4 2 design storms fig 7 compares the modeled peak flows from the calibrated and uncalibrated models for the reps design storms the results from the calibrated models are viewed as the best available estimates so the uncalibrated models should reproduce these results as accurately as possible typically the differences between the calibrated and uncalibrated peak flows are larger for the shorter duration storms and for the more extreme design storms e g north fork big thompson river big thompson river and cheyenne creek for the north fork big thompson river fig 7a and saguache creek fig 7h the calibrated model uses much shorter values for t c and r than the uncalibrated model which produces higher peak flows when surface runoff occurs shorter duration storms for both basins the infiltration rate was increased in the calibrated models it is expected that this would lead to lower peak flows however the shorter values for r counteract the increase in infiltration rate and lead to higher peak flows for the calibrated models for south boulder creek fig 7c the 72 hr pmp produces low flows in both models because of gross reservoir gross reservoir also captures much of the flow from the 2 hr and 6 hr design storms for bear creek fig 7d differences in the soil layer parameters primarily soil storage produce less surface runoff for the uncalibrated model than the calibrated model for almost all design storms for vallecito creek fig 7g the uncalibrated model produces saturation excess runoff later in the 48 hr design storms which produces lower peak flows than the calibrated model the flows from the uncalibrated and calibrated models can exhibit substantial differences for the design storms fig 8 plots the distribution of the percent error in the peak flow from all the design storms and basins a positive value indicates the uncalibrated model overestimates the peak flow of the calibrated model the distribution of peak flow percent errors has a mean of 14 which suggests that the uncalibrated models are conservative on average the standard deviation is 39 which could be used to develop a factor of safety to reduce the likelihood that the uncalibrated models underestimate the peak flow 4 3 analysis of time constant assumptions in the proposed uncalibrated parameter estimation methods the clark storage coefficient r and the groundwater time constant t gw were assumed to be independent of sub basin size i e set to constants these assumptions can be tested by developing lumped models for the basins using the lumped models to simulate the design storms and comparing the results of the lumped models to the results of the semi distributed models because the design storm rainfall is spatially constant across the basin the lumped models should produce similar results to the semi distributed models if the parameters properly account for the basin size in this experiment two lumped models are considered for each basin one uses the proposed constant values for r and t gw i e the values in the lumped models remain the same as the semi distributed models the other model uses r 3 t c and t gw 12 t c i e the values scale with basin size where t c was calculated using eq 5 fig 9 shows that the lumped models with constant values produce better estimates of the semi distributed results than the lumped models with values based on t c when the lumped models are created the sub basins and reaches are replaced with a single basin the parameters of the single basin need to account for any attenuation in flow that occurs in the removed reach elements of the semi distributed model the constant values neglect any such attenuation they perform well because the muskingum cunge method produces very little attenuation in the steep and shallow reaches lee and yen 1997 lee and huang 2012 4 4 comparison to independent estimates of peak flows in this section the peak flows generated by the uncalibrated models for the reps design storms are compared to other independent estimates of extreme flows first the model results are compared to streamstats which estimates the peak discharge from 2 yr to 500 yr return periods this comparison assumes that the largest peak flow produced among the design storms for a given return period has the same return period as the design storm i e return period neutrality the streamstats estimates are produced by regional regression equations that use drainage area mean watershed elevation mean watershed slope percentage of drainage area above 2300 m mean annual precipitation and the 6 hr 100 yr precipitation from noaa atlas 2 capesius and stephens 2009 the streamstats estimates include substantial uncertainty due to the limited streamflow record lengths that were used to develop the regressions and the unreliability of extrapolating observed regressions to large return periods fig 10 shows the streamstats estimates along with the peak flow estimates from the uncalibrated models in the front and san juan ranges the figure also shows error bars on the streamstats estimates that span plus and minus the standard error reported by capesius and stephens 2009 the uncalibrated models estimate lower peak flows than streamstats for the 10 yr and 100 yr return periods although some of the model estimates fall within the error bars of the streamstats estimates these peak flows are likely produced by the spring melt of mountain snowpack or a combination of rainfall and snowmelt jarrett and tomlinson 2000 fassnacht and records 2015 kampf and lefsky 2016 particularly for the higher elevation basins table 1 snowmelt is not considered by the uncalibrated models most of the 1000 yr flows and 10 000 yr flows from the uncalibrated model applications are below the 500 yr flows from streamstats fig 10 this result could occur in part due to errors in the streamstats estimates which are expected to increase for larger return periods and it could indicate that melting snowpack continues to play a significant role for these return periods the result could also indicate that the uncalibrated models are underestimating the flows at these return periods due to errors in the reps precipitation and or errors in the watershed models for return periods larger than 10 000 yr the slope of the peak flow versus return period curve increases and the uncalibrated models predict flows above the streamstats 500 yr flow the rapid increase in peak flows is similar to the behavior pitlick 1994 observed in an analysis of streamflow records for the colorado foothills for the 48 hr storms the break in slope coincides with the initiation of saturation excess runoff this phenomenon has also been observed by kusumastuti et al 2006 regional peak flow envelope curves provide another independent method to evaluate the estimates from the models in colorado peak flow envelope curves are available for regions based on geography and elevation crippen and bue 1977 jarrett and tomlinson 2000 for this study the envelope developed by crippen and bue 1977 is used because the jarrett and tomlinson 2000 curve considers only northwestern colorado the crippen and bue 1977 envelope considers mountainous areas 2300 m as well as lower elevation areas because lower elevations are known to experience more severe storms jarrett 1993 the crippen and bue 1977 envelope is expected to overestimate peak flows for mountainous areas fig 11 displays the crippen and bue 1977 envelope the peak flow measurements in the usgs colorado flood database and the maximum peak streamflow estimates for each basin from the calibrated and uncalibrated models most of the modeled flows are produced by the 2 hr 6 hr or 72 hr pmp the modeled peak streamflow estimates are above the observed peak flows at the associated drainage area but below the envelope from crippen and bue 1977 the calibrated and uncalibrated models also produce similar results when viewed in the context of this plot 5 discussion in the literature three general approaches have been proposed to predict streamflow hydrographs for ungaged basins first regionalization transfers calibrated parameter values from one or more gaged basins to the ungaged basin blöschl and sivapalan 1995 the gaged basins can be selected based on their proximity or similarity in terms of geology morphology landcover etc to the ungaged basin zhang and chiew 2009 second relationships can be established between the parameter values and geomorphic geological soil and vegetation attributes using gaged basins kokkonen et al 2003 once the relationships are established the parameter values for the ungaged basin are estimated from the relationships and the ungaged basin s observed attributes zhang and chiew 2009 third ensemble modeling mcintyre et al 2005 averages the results of different models of gaged basins to provide an estimate of streamflow in the ungaged basin it thus avoids estimating the parameters of the ungaged basin and directly estimates the streamflow based on models from other basins mcintyre et al 2005 in our proposed uncalibrated parameter estimation methodology most parameters are estimated based on relationships to basin attributes for a few parameters e g maximum canopy storage imperviousness clark storage coefficient r and groundwater time constant t gw no such relationships could be determined so the parameters are set to constant values and applied regionally in the literature the preferred method for prediction in ungaged basins remains unclear zhang and chiew 2009 found that a regionalization approach that combines spatial proximity and physical similarity outperforms regionalization based on spatial proximity or physical similarity alone samuel et al 2011 also found that a coupled similarity proximity approach leads to better performance razavi and coulibaly 2013 found that regionalization based on proximity and similarity works best in arid to temperate climates as well as cold and snowy regions however they found that relationship based methods perform better in warm temperate regions mcintyre et al 2005 found that ensemble modeling performs better than a relationship based approach in the present study the results of the uncalibrated models were compared to the results of calibrated models based on woolridge et al 2020 the uncalibrated parameter estimation method has some similarities to the parameter estimation used by woolridge et al 2020 the uncalibrated models maximum canopy storage is the average of the values they used for north facing and south facing slopes the uncalibrated models maximum infiltration rate is similar to the preliminary estimates from woolridge et al 2020 but they ultimately calibrated this parameter the groundwater percolation rate in uncalibrated models of the front range is the average of the woolridge et al 2020 calibrated values and all the routing parameters are estimated the same as woolridge et al 2020 despite these similarities most parameter values differ between the uncalibrated and calibrated models the uncalibrated models errors are larger than those of the calibrated models as expected however the uncalibrated models generally produce streamflow by the same mechanisms as the associated calibrated models and the uncalibrated models provide reasonable estimates of the peak streamflow and total stream volumes for historical events the differences between the two modeling approaches are small when compared to the crippen and bue 1977 peak flow envelope curve and both models produce peak discharges that are conservative relative to the observed peak flows the sabol 2008 guidelines neglect subsurface stormflow and saturation excess runoff which were important for some recent extreme events and thus are relevant to dam safety evaluations woolridge et al 2020 the proposed modeling approach can produce discharge from such mechanisms the sabol 2008 guidelines are also known to greatly overestimate major floods in the mountains jarrett 1993 perry et al 2017 in contrast the median percent error in the peak flow is 6 for the uncalibrated models of the historical events the median nsce of the proposed uncalibrated models is 0 70 for context razavi and coulibaly 2013 evaluated the performance of uncalibrated models in studies across different regions and climates and the average nsce for the models in those studies is 0 61 with a range from 0 12 to 0 97 however several limitations remain the methods were developed and tested using basins from two mountain ranges in colorado basins in central colorado such as the gore sawatch and elk ranges and western colorado such as the flat tops grand mesa and the uncompahgre plateau were not considered due to lack of hourly precipitation and complete hydrographs for events that are large enough to be relevant to dam safety applications each range has distinct geologic geomorphologic and vegetation characteristics which are expected to impact the performance of the proposed methods also the proposed groundwater percolation rate differs between the front range and the san juan range appropriate values for this parameter in other mountain ranges are unknown the proposed methods have not been tested in non mountainous portions of colorado such as the eastern plains bedrock is often very deep in the plains soil survey staff 2020 so saturation excess runoff and subsurface stormflow are less likely most historical storms considered in this study had long durations that produced subsurface stormflow and saturation excess runoff only two short duration high intensity storms producing infiltration excess runoff were available north fork big thompson river 1976 and saguache creek 1999 for north fork big thompson river 1976 an incomplete hydrograph prevents a detailed evaluation of the model for saguache creek 1999 the localized precipitation might be inaccurate and discharge was observed to bypass the stream gage also the performance of the uncalibrated models is worse for the shorter storms than the longer storms thus substantial uncertainty remains in the simulation of short duration high intensity storms continuing research should explore ways to estimate the assumed constant parameter values from basin characteristics an improved canopy storage could consider fractional vegetation cover which is already used in the parameter estimation methods groundwater parameters could be better constrained by considering smaller historical storms smaller storms are less likely to produce surface runoff so they cannot be used to constrain surface runoff related parameters however subsurface stormflow still occurs for these events so the related parameters can be analyzed the results of the uncalibrated models when forced with reps design storms were compared to streamstats peak streamflow estimates although streamstats provides consistent independent estimates of peak streamflow these estimates contain substantial uncertainty because they rely on regional regression equations future studies should also compare the model results to bulletin 17 c analyses of stream gage records england et al 2019 bulletin 17 c is expected to provide improved estimates of peak flows for given return periods but it would still include uncertainties associated with limited record lengths impacts of climate change on basin hydrology were not considered this study focused only on rainfall induced flooding in relatively undisturbed mountain watersheds due in part to climate change wildfires are increasing in frequency and size across the western united states brown et al 2004 abatzoglou and kolden 2013 wildfires alter the soil structure and increase water repellency which increases runoff production for years debano 2000 doerr et al 2000 climate change is also expected to diminish the role of snowmelt and increase the role of rainfall in producing flood peaks kampf and lefsky 2016 rain on snow events are becoming more common in the western united states with climate change as well surfleet and tullos 2013 if rainfall occurs when snowpack is present it can produce much larger flows due to abrupt melting of snow these events have potentially occurred in colorado fema 2010 but might become more common under the modified climate climate change could also change the temporal distribution of antecedent soil moisture which has the potential to impact runoff production for a given event 6 conclusions the purpose of this study was to develop parameter estimation methods that can be used to simulate the response of ungaged mountain basins in colorado to large rainfall events e g watershed average depths around 100 mm or more the study focuses on the sma method in hec hms which was previously shown to reproduce the streamflow generation mechanisms for large storms in the colorado front range woolridge et al 2020 the results from the uncalibrated models were compared to observed streamflow the results from the calibrated models streamstats and a regional peak flow envelope the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the proposed parameter estimation methods typically perform well for the studied historical storms in the front range and san juan range the median rmse and nsce for the uncalibrated models are 6 20 m3 s and 0 70 respectively for comparison the median rmse and nsce for the calibrated models are 4 40 m3 s and 0 80 respectively for all but one historical event the uncalibrated models produce streamflow by the same mechanisms as the calibrated models for the case where the mechanism changed cheyenne creek 1997 the overall model performance of the uncalibrated model was better than the previously calibrated model the uncalibrated models provide rough estimates of the peak flows from the calibrated models for the design storms in the studied basins on average the uncalibrated models overestimate the peak flows from the calibrated models by 14 however the standard deviation of the peak flow error is 39 thus the predictions from the uncalibrated models are typically but not consistently conservative the uncalibrated models may not produce accurate peak flows for return periods less than 1000 yr to 10 000 yr for these return periods the models produce lower peak flows than the regional regression equation in streamstats this underestimation likely occurs because the models neglect the contribution from snowmelt which can play an important role for small return periods kampf and lefsky 2016 the inconsistency could also arise due to errors in the streamstats estimates for return periods at or above 10 000 yr the peak flows from the models are usually much higher than the streamstats 500 yr flows as expected the uncalibrated models appear to produce reasonable results for very large storm events the largest streamflow values from the uncalibrated models among all design storms are above all the observed peak flows in the usgs colorado flood database they are below the envelope developed by crippen and bue 1977 which is expected because that envelope also considered lower elevations which experience higher peak flows overall the uncalibrated modeling methods appear to provide reasonable estimates of streamflow hydrographs from large storm events while these methods can be used in dam safety analyses they should be used in a way that accounts for the uncertainty in their results we recommend that dam managers use multiple pathways to develop streamflow estimates and conservatively interpret those estimates comparison and even calibration to independent streamflow estimates is recommended a factor of safety should also be considered the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimation methods was estimated by comparing the peak flows from the uncalibrated and calibrated models for the design storms the resulting distribution of errors could be used to select a factor of safety that partially accounts for the uncertainty in the model parameterization however numerous factors were neglected that might also affect dam safety evaluations including snowmelt rain on snow wildfire impacts sediment bulking and climate change therefore a more general factor of safety may be warranted in spillway embankment and freeboard designs

7771,study region peninsular spain study focus there is strong evidence that climate change has produced a decrease in precipitation combined with an increased frequency intensity and magnitude of high intensity storm events in peninsular spain such events have been particularly recurrent on the spanish mediterranean coast in recent years this study s first objective is to update the trends in the magnitude and seasonality of precipitation in spain from 1951 to 2019 at different time scales secondly we analyse how extreme precipitation events recorded in recent years can modify water infrastructure design flows a qgis plugin was programmed using python to calculate the design flows in accordance with the methodologies legally established in spain new hydrological insights for the region the results confirm the decreasing trend in annual precipitation in most of the spanish territory this decrease was particularly significant during march and june moreover the average increases of around 30 40 in design flows which reached double the values obtained in the reference period of 1951 1990 in some basins confirm the relevance of incorporating high intensity storm events recorded in recent years into flow calculations in peninsular spain design flows obtained without using the most recent rainfall data can be underestimated with profound risk implications therefore there is a sufficient technical basis to draw attention to this problem and recommend its formal consideration by competent authorities graphical abstract ga1 keywords rainfall trends extreme rainfall peninsular spain floods design flows rational method data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the impact of climate change on the variability of water resources analysing spatial and temporal precipitation patterns has become essential in recent decades especially in water management caloiero et al 2020 kumar et al 2010 in addition also driven by climate change the number of extreme events has increased fivefold over the past 50 years with one disaster related to a weather climate or water hazard occurring daily on average killing 115 people and causing losses of 202 million per day wmo 2021 this problem is particularly significant in both mediterranean europe avino et al 2021 and peninsular spain where more frequent extreme 24 h records can exceed the annual average of the historical series eguibar et al 2021 in a few intense precipitation events and cause flood episodes with significant economic and anthropogenic impacts insua costa et al 2021 most precipitation series studies undertaken in peninsular spain have focused on specific regions of the country and on annual seasonal or monthly time scales del río et al 2005 lana et al 2021 lópez moreno et al 2010 martínez et al 2007 miró et al 2018 pérez sánchez and senent aparicio 2018 senent aparicio et al 2018a which are fundamental for water resource and drought management few studies have analysed precipitation trends in spain on a national scale gonzález hidalgo et al 2010 studied precipitation trends on a monthly scale using data from 1946 to 2005 with the results obtained from river basins as the analytical unit moreover del río et al 2011 analysed annual seasonal and monthly rainfall trends from 1961 to 2006 using data from 553 spanish weather stations more recently mulomba mukadi and gonzález garcía 2021 analysed monthly precipitation and temperature data from 47 weather stations located in the main cities of peninsular spain using data available up to 2013 and with a varied start date depending on the availability of data at each station regarding extreme precipitation lópez moreno et al 2010 studied daily precipitation trends at 217 different weather stations for the period of 1955 2006 the authors observed that heavy rainfall events generally decreased in the west of the peninsula and increased in the east especially in autumn when most of the events were recorded serrano notivoli et al 2017 recently developed a database called spread covering the period from 1950 to 2012 from which they identified that the number of rainy days or dry spells in peninsular spain follows a clear northwest to southeast gradient from higher to lower in the case of the number of rainy days and the reverse in the case of dry spells using the same database the authors also detected a decrease in the frequency of extreme precipitation events in peninsular spain except for the mediterranean coast where the frequency of extreme precipitation events noticeably increased serrano notivoli et al 2018 in the last few years high intensity precipitation events in peninsular spain particularly in the east have been of such magnitude that knowledge and consideration of these new events could affect currently accepted statistical estimates of maximum rainfall in the affected area and consequently the corresponding design flood flows given their extreme magnitude these storm events have been analysed in numerous scientific studies for example the september 2019 event that occurred predominantly in the segura river basin corresponded to a 500 year return period storm senent aparicio et al 2021d with damage estimated by insurance companies at around 19 million tapiador et al 2021 also noteworthy are the torrential rains of 28 september 2012 affecting andalucía and murcia with 214 mm of precipitation recorded in 8 h 10 fatalities and estimated material losses of 120 million amengual et al 2015 another significant event was the girona river flash flood in 2007 which registered more than 400 mm of precipitation in less than 12 h segura beltrán et al 2016 however no studies have been found that analyse how the inclusion of the latest high intensity storm events in spain affects the flood flows considered in infrastructure design this work s objective is twofold firstly this study aims to update trends in rainfall magnitude in spain from 1951 to 2019 in terms of the number of rainy days maximum daily precipitation and monthly seasonal and annual time scales secondly this work assesses the effect of incorporating the high intensity rainfall events registered in spain in recent years particularly in the southeastern part of the country and their corresponding effect on the flows used for infrastructure design in accordance with the methodologies currently operating in spain it should be noted that the current leading reference for extreme rainfall in peninsular spain is santamaría et al 1999 whose results have been widely used to date in numerous scientific flood studies across the country furdada et al 2020 garrote et al 2019 huelin rueda et al 2014 hürlimann et al 2022 jiménez de santiago et al 2019 mateo lázaro et al 2014 sañudo et al 2020 and by a large number of engineering projects that could be dangerously underestimating these design flows 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this research covers the continental part of spain and has a surface area of 493 515 km2 peninsular spain is characterised by a wide range of weather patterns due to its complex orography and geographical location between the subtropical and temperate european zones senent aparicio et al 2018b in peninsular spain precipitation exhibits significant spatial and temporal variability independent of the temporal resolution of the data analysed meseguer ruiz et al 2019 several locations such as parts of galicia are among the rainiest in europe with more than 2000 mm of precipitation annually compared to areas such as campo de cartagena which with less than 200 mm per year are among the driest regions in europe pérez sánchez et al 2019 the mean annual precipitation values allow us to distinguish three large pluviometric areas humid or rainy areas where the average rainfall exceeds 800 mm per year lie primarily in the north of the peninsula which is more exposed to atlantic disturbances dry or transitional areas with average annual values between 300 and 800 mm cover almost three quarters of the iberian peninsula finally arid or semi desert areas are limited to the southeast of the peninsula the maximum daily rainfall values were observed along large sections of the coastline primarily the mediterranean coast some inland mountainous areas such as the pyrenees and the central system are also affected by heavy rainfall which often triggers flooding episodes despite being far from the ocean which is the main source of humidity their topography can favour torrential rains conversely rainfall intensities are much lower in most of the peninsula s interior 2 2 data daily rainfall data for the period of 1951 2019 was obtained from the second version of the national gridded dataset developed by the spanish meteorological agency aemet this dataset has a resolution of 5 km and was generated from data available at 3236 rainfall stations distributed throughout the national territory the daily precipitation fields were calculated by statistical interpolation this linear estimation method handles irregular distributions of observations well it produces minimal interpolation error correctly formulating the error statistics of the estimations from which it begins to create the analysed field the analysis considers the influence of orography as well as the seasonal variation spatial distribution and daily variability of the rainfall further details about this dataset can be found in peral garcía et al 2017 a recent analysis of gridded rainfall products throughout peninsular spain revealed that the aemet dataset is superior to other remote sensing rainfall products dhanesh et al 2020 senent aparicio et al 2018b the benefits of using this gridded dataset to fill in missing rainfall gaps senent aparicio et al 2021b and in subsequent hydrological modelling have been noted in several studies pérez sánchez et al 2020 senent aparicio et al 2021a 2021c 2020 3 methodology as illustrated in fig 1 this work is divided into two distinct sections in the first part the mann kendall test was used to analyse annual and seasonal rainfall trends the number of rainy days and the maximum 24 h rainfall throughout peninsular spain next the influence of considering these trends on the design flows of infrastructures was analysed the second part was further divided into three steps 1 the maximum daily rainfall for three different probability scenarios return periods of 10 100 and 500 years was calculated using two different time intervals from 1951 to 1990 corresponding to a base period similar to that used in santamaría et al 1999 and the entire period 1951 2019 2 the spanish reference methodology was applied to calculate design flows for the scenarios proposed in the previous step by implementing the easybasin plugin developed specifically for this work which facilitates design flow calculations for different case studies twelve study areas were selected to reflect climatic diversity in peninsular spain the study areas were under 50 km2 a condition necessary to apply this methodology 3 the impact of recent high intensity storm events on the magnitude of infrastructure design flows was analysed 3 1 evaluation of rainfall trends using the modified mann kendall test this study applied the modified mann kendall test function implemented in the modifiedmk package in r software to detect annual seasonal and monthly precipitation trends https cran r project org package modifiedmk this test is one of the most widely used non parametric tests for detecting trends in hydroclimatic series unlike parametric methods it does not require the data to be normally distributed it requires only that the data is independent blanco gómez et al 2019 furthermore it has low sensitivity to abrupt peaks due to inhomogeneous time series senent aparicio et al 2018a the z test statistic assesses the presence of a statistically significant trend a positive z value indicates an upward trend and a negative value indicates a downward trend further details of the mann kendall test formulation are given in partal and kahya 2006 the mann kendall test is highly influenced by serially correlated data and addresses this issue by modifying the original trend tests to account for serial correlation hamed 2008 in this study the methodology proposed by hamed 2009 was used to calculate the significance of the trend sen s slope sen 1968 estimator was used to estimate the slope or rate of change 3 2 assessment of annual maximum daily precipitation variation and its implications for water infrastructure design in spain the general rules and prescriptions for estimating maximum annual flow qmax are commonly obtained from norm 5 2 ic of the spanish highway instruction boe 2016 norm 5 2 ic includes several methods for estimating qmax the primary input for water infrastructure design young et al 2009 in norm 5 2 ic the procedure for selecting the most appropriate hydro meteorological method is determined by the basin size for small basins with an area lower than 50 km2 a modified rational method mr can be applied otherwise norm 5 2 ic recommends using another more suitable hydro meteorological method this research applied norm 5 2 ic to assess the impact of annual maximum daily rainfall pcpmax variation in estimating qmax and thereby in the water infrastructure design the evaluation was performed using two periods selected according to the availability of aemet precipitation data 1951 2019 peral garcía et al 2017 and the precipitation data period used in the publication maximum daily rainfall in peninsular spain until 1990 santamaría et al 1999 the latter has been used to obtain the pcpmax of a given return period t in most spanish hydrological studies and in several investigations furdada et al 2020 jiménez de santiago et al 2019 mateo lázaro et al 2016 taking the previous considerations into account the hydrological results of a baseline period 1951 1990 were compared with those of a recent period 1951 2019 to assess the changes in the pcpmax of a given return period and their implications for water infrastructure design the methodological framework followed in this part of the study is illustrated in fig 1 first the pcpmax for three probability scenarios suggested by the spanish law on flood risk evaluation and management boe 2010 high probability t 10 years medium probability t 100 years and low probability t 500 years were obtained by statistically analysing the aemet precipitation gridded dataset and applying the sqrt et max distribution etoh et al 1987 for each period this extremal distribution was adjusted to the pcpmax values following the approach and recommendations proposed by zorraquino 2004 and santamaría et al 1999 in addition a pcpmax comparison between the mean values of both selected periods was carried out to quantify the variation in pcpmax in each probability scenario throughout peninsular spain second the easybasin tool was implemented to simulate qmax for each probability scenario applying the mr proposed by norm 5 2 ic this simulation was carried out in 12 small basins fig 2 which were selected based on their drainage area less than 50 km2 and their climatological zone according to the köppen classification kottek et al 2006 finally a qmax comparison for each probability scenario was undertaken in the selected study areas as a result the variation in qmax between both periods was quantified and its potential implications for designing hydraulic works were assessed 3 2 1 modified rational method the rational method is a widely used hydro meteorological method chow et al 1988 for estimating the qmax corresponding to a given return period in small basins chin 2019 this research implemented a modified mr proposed by norm 5 2 ic which includes a set of corrections proposed by témez 1992 such as a rainfall uniformity distribution coefficient kt and a rainfall reduction factor per basin area ka as well as several specific tables and parameters for spain the mr is commonly expressed as equation x q t i c a k t 3 6 where qt is the qmax corresponding to a return period m3 s i is the maximum rainfall intensity mm h c is the runoff coefficient a is the basin area km2 and kt is the rainfall uniformity coefficient detailed information about this mr can be found in norm 5 2 ic boe 2016 3 2 2 easybasin plugin easybasin is an open source qgis plugin that this study s authors developed to optimise the mr application proposed by norm 5 2 ic the plugin was written in python 3 it is compatible with any 3 4 x version of qgis since easybasin requires several grass software functions it must be run using qgis with the grass programme which is included in the qgis 3 4 software package the number of data management and geospatial operations involved in applying the mr is substantial and can present a challenge the easybasin workflow fig 3 guides users through the steps required to successfully apply the mr proposed by norm 5 2 ic to estimate the qmax for a given return period the easybasin interface is designed with two primary windows an initial window that includes the option to run the geospatial processes of watershed and stream network delineation and a results window comprising the mr processes parameters and results in this second window the mr procedure is divided into four steps 1 watershed features 2 rainfall intensity 3 runoff coefficient and 4 maximum annual flow each step is run individually however they must follow the previously mentioned order one of easybasin s main advantages is the small amount of input data required to set up the mr application users merely introduce a digital elevation map of the study area and its outlet point coordinates from the previous inputs easybasin combines several geospatial operations to delineate the watershed and its stream network and extracts the required parameters to apply the mr a limitation is that the easybasin plugin was developed for application in peninsular spain hence it operates using data specific to this region such as an initial runoff threshold map developed by ferrer juliá et al 2004 a torrentiality index map and a regional classification map of the runoff correction factor extracted from the norm 5 2 ic the easybasin plugin demonstrated in this study is available in zenodo at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5517063 along with detailed instructions on how its use 4 results and discussion first of all the results obtained from the trend analysis carried out on an annual seasonal and monthly scale are presented analysis at these time scales is critically important in a country like spain which is the european country most affected by water stress estrela et al 2012 secondly these results are complemented by an analysis of the number of rainy days and maximum daily rainfall which indicates wether a reduction in the amount of rainfall is combined with a lower number of rainy days but with a higher amount of rainfall registered constraining the water storage capacity needed to mitigate water stress and raising the possibility of extreme flooding events finally using the easybasin tool it is shown that an increase in maximum annual rainfall can affect the streamflows used for the sizing of infrastructures 4 1 annual seasonal and monthly rainfall trend analysis the mann kendall test results applied to the aemet precipitation gridded data for the period of 1951 2019 are illustrated in fig 4 and summarised in table 1 as the percentage of grid points with significant positive and negative trends the seasons displayed in fig 4 and the subsequent figures were divided according to season considering december january and february as winter march april and may as spring june july and august as summer and september october and november as autumn different seasonal trends in the amount of precipitation were noted throughout spain all seasons except autumn show a dominant negative trend the spatial distribution of the pluviometric trends reveals a significant negative trend in many areas of western spain in summer in the southern zone many areas with a significant negative trend are observed during all seasons except autumn on an annual scale the results demonstrate a decreasing precipitation trend across the territory except in isolated areas to the north where positive trends are observed these results are in line with those of caloiero et al 2018 who found that galicia presents a significant increase in rainfall eighteen percent of the grid points display a negative trend on an annual scale of which only 0 74 are positive rainfall tends to decrease in more than 40 of grid points in summer fig 5 illustrates the percentages of grid points with significant positive and negative trends these results indicate significantly different monthly trends april and september exhibit a generally positive trend significantly affecting 7 of spanish grid points the situation was reversed in the remaining months indicating an overall decrease in total monthly precipitation march and june exhibit the highest percentage of points with significant negative trends of 27 and 65 respectively previous studies undertaken in spain gonzález hidalgo et al 2010 2011 have revealed similar trends in march june and october many previous works del río et al 2005 serrano et al 1999 have detected an overall decrease in precipitation in march which has been related to a northward shift in storms paredes et al 2006 and a positive trend in sunshine duration and anticyclonic activity sanchez lorenzo et al 2007 the significant decrease in precipitation found in june is consistent with recent studies carried out for the city of barcelona lana et al 2022 and for catalonia lana et al 2021 4 2 rainy day trend analysis the mann kendall test was applied to detect the annual seasonal and monthly rainy day trends in the aemet precipitation gridded data a day was defined as rainy when the precipitation volume was 1 mm the analysis results indicate a general negative trend throughout the territory on annual and seasonal scales fig 6 and table 2 in winter and summer the percentage of grid points with a significant negative trend is higher with 52 70 and 73 31 respectively however autumn is the only season that indicates a significant positive trend although it affects only 0 13 of the grid points on an annual scale virtually the entire territory demonstrates a decreasing trend in the number of rainy days with 76 39 of the points revealing a significant negative trend on a monthly scale the results fig 7 also indicate a decreasing trend regarding the number of rainy days june is prominent with more than 80 of the points indicating a significant negative trend followed by march 43 and december 25 a few points less than 1 of the territory indicate a significant positive trend in august and september in the northeastern zone the trend is significantly negative on an annual scale and for all seasons as observed in lópez moreno et al 2010 where the number of rainy days generally decreased during the period of 1955 2006 this decrease in the number of days with rain is common among all mediterranean regions because of the nao index s persistence since 1980 which is characterised by more anticyclonic conditions in the south of europe and stronger westerly winds in the north martínez et al 2007 4 3 maximum daily rain trend analysis according to the mann kendall test the maximum daily rainfall trend is predominantly positive on annual and seasonal scales except in summer fig 8 and table 3 the trend s spatial distribution varies at each station except in eastern spain where the trend remains significantly positive at all stations this trend is significantly positive in 9 54 of the grid points in winter around 20 in spring and 26 10 in autumn regarding the monthly distribution fig 9 all months display a predominantly positive trend except june and july where the maximum daily precipitation generally decreases april and october are particularly notable with 28 and 25 of the grid points revealing a significant positive trend respectively in contrast june demonstrates a significant negative trend in 21 of the territory therefore the results indicate a general decrease in the number of rainy days over the study period although rainfall generally tends to be more intense these results support those of other studies such as gonzález hidalgo et al 2003 who observed a positive trend towards higher precipitation events in the spanish mediterranean area meseguer ruiz et al 2021 observed a positive trend in the number of torrential events in eastern and southeastern spain particularly in september and november 4 4 assessment of annual maximum daily precipitation variation and its implications for water infrastructure design following the methodology described above the pcpmax variation was quantified for each aemet data point throughout peninsular spain after adjusting for each selected data period for the sqrt et max statistical distribution the result is a pcpmax variation map for each probability scenario fig 10 the main strength of the sqrt et max distribution is that it was developed to specifically model annual maximum series of daily rainfall zorraquino 2004 therefore no overestimation is expected in the values of the highest return periods and the sensitivity to outliers is lower than for other conventional distributions as observed in fig 10 the pcpmax variation pattern exhibits a general increase in all the probability scenarios when the recent period is compared with the baseline period this general increase is more pronounced in low probability scenarios potentially indicating a design problem for water infrastructure because most waterworks are developed for high return periods slight decreases are also observed in the central and southeastern parts of spain this result highlights that the rainfall data in the maximum daily rainfall in peninsular spain publication needs to be updated as mateo lázaro et al 2016 have previously suggested table 4 presents the main characteristics and climate classifications of each study area the physical characteristics were extracted from the easybasin plugin s watershed features component using the physical and climatic information of the selected watersheds table 4 easybasin estimates each parameter of mr following the next workflow first the maximum rainfall intensity i is obtained from the pcpmax of each given return period after applying the ka correction factor and a torrential factor second the runoff coefficient c is calculated using the pcp max of each given return period the ka and the initial runoff threshold map ferrer juliá et al 2004 last the mr equation is implemented with the previous estimated parameters the watershed area a and the kt correction factor which depends only on the concentration time of the watershed detailed information about the mr equations can be found in norm 5 2 ic boe 2016 the mr parameters derived from easybasin for each study area are listed in table 5 subsequently the qmax for the selected basins was estimated by applying the entire easybasin workflow for each probability scenario qmax was obtained for the baseline and recent periods and the percentage of variation between them was quantified table 6 the results displayed in table 6 indicate clear differences when the baseline and recent pcpmax periods are used to estimate qmax an increase in qmax is observed in all the selected basins ranging from 3 6 to 69 5 in the high probability scenario from 9 9 to 115 1 in the medium probability scenario and from 9 1 to 128 6 in the low probability scenario the variation in qmax indicates the need for updated data in water infrastructure design to avoid underestimating the amount of discharge generated in the basin 5 conclusions the analysis of the annual rainfall trend demonstrates a decreasing trend in 18 of the territory an increasing trend is observed only in some areas in the north of the country corresponding to less than 1 of the total territory seasonally this decrease in precipitation tends to be concentrated in summer and to a lesser extent in autumn on a monthly scale this work supports previous studies that detected a significant reduction in precipitation during march and june trends in the number of rainy days performed similarly to previous results with a general decreasing trend detected in most parts of the country the annual trend of maximum daily rainfall is positive in 29 47 of the territory with only 1 39 showing a decreasing trend similar results are observed on a seasonal level except in summer when the opposite occurs with 12 75 of the territory showing a negative trend in maximum daily rainfall compared to 1 64 with an increasing trend therefore in many parts of the territory the number of rainy days decreased year by year on an annual and seasonal scale except in summer but the maximum daily rainfall increased applying the easybasin plugin made it possible to easily calculate the design flows in 12 study basins distributed throughout peninsular spain the results confirm the need for updated data to estimate these flows because regardless of the return period considered average increases in design flows of around 30 40 have been detected reaching double the values for the baseline period 1951 1990 in some basins design flows obtained without using the most recent data could be underestimated resulting in a severe flood risk therefore a sufficient technical basis exists for drawing attention to this problem and recommending its formal consideration by competent authorities flood maps currently available in spain are probably obsolete the flood areas derived from them would not be obtained today through applying the same technical procedures with the inclusion of new meteorological data this scenario

7771,study region peninsular spain study focus there is strong evidence that climate change has produced a decrease in precipitation combined with an increased frequency intensity and magnitude of high intensity storm events in peninsular spain such events have been particularly recurrent on the spanish mediterranean coast in recent years this study s first objective is to update the trends in the magnitude and seasonality of precipitation in spain from 1951 to 2019 at different time scales secondly we analyse how extreme precipitation events recorded in recent years can modify water infrastructure design flows a qgis plugin was programmed using python to calculate the design flows in accordance with the methodologies legally established in spain new hydrological insights for the region the results confirm the decreasing trend in annual precipitation in most of the spanish territory this decrease was particularly significant during march and june moreover the average increases of around 30 40 in design flows which reached double the values obtained in the reference period of 1951 1990 in some basins confirm the relevance of incorporating high intensity storm events recorded in recent years into flow calculations in peninsular spain design flows obtained without using the most recent rainfall data can be underestimated with profound risk implications therefore there is a sufficient technical basis to draw attention to this problem and recommend its formal consideration by competent authorities graphical abstract ga1 keywords rainfall trends extreme rainfall peninsular spain floods design flows rational method data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the impact of climate change on the variability of water resources analysing spatial and temporal precipitation patterns has become essential in recent decades especially in water management caloiero et al 2020 kumar et al 2010 in addition also driven by climate change the number of extreme events has increased fivefold over the past 50 years with one disaster related to a weather climate or water hazard occurring daily on average killing 115 people and causing losses of 202 million per day wmo 2021 this problem is particularly significant in both mediterranean europe avino et al 2021 and peninsular spain where more frequent extreme 24 h records can exceed the annual average of the historical series eguibar et al 2021 in a few intense precipitation events and cause flood episodes with significant economic and anthropogenic impacts insua costa et al 2021 most precipitation series studies undertaken in peninsular spain have focused on specific regions of the country and on annual seasonal or monthly time scales del río et al 2005 lana et al 2021 lópez moreno et al 2010 martínez et al 2007 miró et al 2018 pérez sánchez and senent aparicio 2018 senent aparicio et al 2018a which are fundamental for water resource and drought management few studies have analysed precipitation trends in spain on a national scale gonzález hidalgo et al 2010 studied precipitation trends on a monthly scale using data from 1946 to 2005 with the results obtained from river basins as the analytical unit moreover del río et al 2011 analysed annual seasonal and monthly rainfall trends from 1961 to 2006 using data from 553 spanish weather stations more recently mulomba mukadi and gonzález garcía 2021 analysed monthly precipitation and temperature data from 47 weather stations located in the main cities of peninsular spain using data available up to 2013 and with a varied start date depending on the availability of data at each station regarding extreme precipitation lópez moreno et al 2010 studied daily precipitation trends at 217 different weather stations for the period of 1955 2006 the authors observed that heavy rainfall events generally decreased in the west of the peninsula and increased in the east especially in autumn when most of the events were recorded serrano notivoli et al 2017 recently developed a database called spread covering the period from 1950 to 2012 from which they identified that the number of rainy days or dry spells in peninsular spain follows a clear northwest to southeast gradient from higher to lower in the case of the number of rainy days and the reverse in the case of dry spells using the same database the authors also detected a decrease in the frequency of extreme precipitation events in peninsular spain except for the mediterranean coast where the frequency of extreme precipitation events noticeably increased serrano notivoli et al 2018 in the last few years high intensity precipitation events in peninsular spain particularly in the east have been of such magnitude that knowledge and consideration of these new events could affect currently accepted statistical estimates of maximum rainfall in the affected area and consequently the corresponding design flood flows given their extreme magnitude these storm events have been analysed in numerous scientific studies for example the september 2019 event that occurred predominantly in the segura river basin corresponded to a 500 year return period storm senent aparicio et al 2021d with damage estimated by insurance companies at around 19 million tapiador et al 2021 also noteworthy are the torrential rains of 28 september 2012 affecting andalucía and murcia with 214 mm of precipitation recorded in 8 h 10 fatalities and estimated material losses of 120 million amengual et al 2015 another significant event was the girona river flash flood in 2007 which registered more than 400 mm of precipitation in less than 12 h segura beltrán et al 2016 however no studies have been found that analyse how the inclusion of the latest high intensity storm events in spain affects the flood flows considered in infrastructure design this work s objective is twofold firstly this study aims to update trends in rainfall magnitude in spain from 1951 to 2019 in terms of the number of rainy days maximum daily precipitation and monthly seasonal and annual time scales secondly this work assesses the effect of incorporating the high intensity rainfall events registered in spain in recent years particularly in the southeastern part of the country and their corresponding effect on the flows used for infrastructure design in accordance with the methodologies currently operating in spain it should be noted that the current leading reference for extreme rainfall in peninsular spain is santamaría et al 1999 whose results have been widely used to date in numerous scientific flood studies across the country furdada et al 2020 garrote et al 2019 huelin rueda et al 2014 hürlimann et al 2022 jiménez de santiago et al 2019 mateo lázaro et al 2014 sañudo et al 2020 and by a large number of engineering projects that could be dangerously underestimating these design flows 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this research covers the continental part of spain and has a surface area of 493 515 km2 peninsular spain is characterised by a wide range of weather patterns due to its complex orography and geographical location between the subtropical and temperate european zones senent aparicio et al 2018b in peninsular spain precipitation exhibits significant spatial and temporal variability independent of the temporal resolution of the data analysed meseguer ruiz et al 2019 several locations such as parts of galicia are among the rainiest in europe with more than 2000 mm of precipitation annually compared to areas such as campo de cartagena which with less than 200 mm per year are among the driest regions in europe pérez sánchez et al 2019 the mean annual precipitation values allow us to distinguish three large pluviometric areas humid or rainy areas where the average rainfall exceeds 800 mm per year lie primarily in the north of the peninsula which is more exposed to atlantic disturbances dry or transitional areas with average annual values between 300 and 800 mm cover almost three quarters of the iberian peninsula finally arid or semi desert areas are limited to the southeast of the peninsula the maximum daily rainfall values were observed along large sections of the coastline primarily the mediterranean coast some inland mountainous areas such as the pyrenees and the central system are also affected by heavy rainfall which often triggers flooding episodes despite being far from the ocean which is the main source of humidity their topography can favour torrential rains conversely rainfall intensities are much lower in most of the peninsula s interior 2 2 data daily rainfall data for the period of 1951 2019 was obtained from the second version of the national gridded dataset developed by the spanish meteorological agency aemet this dataset has a resolution of 5 km and was generated from data available at 3236 rainfall stations distributed throughout the national territory the daily precipitation fields were calculated by statistical interpolation this linear estimation method handles irregular distributions of observations well it produces minimal interpolation error correctly formulating the error statistics of the estimations from which it begins to create the analysed field the analysis considers the influence of orography as well as the seasonal variation spatial distribution and daily variability of the rainfall further details about this dataset can be found in peral garcía et al 2017 a recent analysis of gridded rainfall products throughout peninsular spain revealed that the aemet dataset is superior to other remote sensing rainfall products dhanesh et al 2020 senent aparicio et al 2018b the benefits of using this gridded dataset to fill in missing rainfall gaps senent aparicio et al 2021b and in subsequent hydrological modelling have been noted in several studies pérez sánchez et al 2020 senent aparicio et al 2021a 2021c 2020 3 methodology as illustrated in fig 1 this work is divided into two distinct sections in the first part the mann kendall test was used to analyse annual and seasonal rainfall trends the number of rainy days and the maximum 24 h rainfall throughout peninsular spain next the influence of considering these trends on the design flows of infrastructures was analysed the second part was further divided into three steps 1 the maximum daily rainfall for three different probability scenarios return periods of 10 100 and 500 years was calculated using two different time intervals from 1951 to 1990 corresponding to a base period similar to that used in santamaría et al 1999 and the entire period 1951 2019 2 the spanish reference methodology was applied to calculate design flows for the scenarios proposed in the previous step by implementing the easybasin plugin developed specifically for this work which facilitates design flow calculations for different case studies twelve study areas were selected to reflect climatic diversity in peninsular spain the study areas were under 50 km2 a condition necessary to apply this methodology 3 the impact of recent high intensity storm events on the magnitude of infrastructure design flows was analysed 3 1 evaluation of rainfall trends using the modified mann kendall test this study applied the modified mann kendall test function implemented in the modifiedmk package in r software to detect annual seasonal and monthly precipitation trends https cran r project org package modifiedmk this test is one of the most widely used non parametric tests for detecting trends in hydroclimatic series unlike parametric methods it does not require the data to be normally distributed it requires only that the data is independent blanco gómez et al 2019 furthermore it has low sensitivity to abrupt peaks due to inhomogeneous time series senent aparicio et al 2018a the z test statistic assesses the presence of a statistically significant trend a positive z value indicates an upward trend and a negative value indicates a downward trend further details of the mann kendall test formulation are given in partal and kahya 2006 the mann kendall test is highly influenced by serially correlated data and addresses this issue by modifying the original trend tests to account for serial correlation hamed 2008 in this study the methodology proposed by hamed 2009 was used to calculate the significance of the trend sen s slope sen 1968 estimator was used to estimate the slope or rate of change 3 2 assessment of annual maximum daily precipitation variation and its implications for water infrastructure design in spain the general rules and prescriptions for estimating maximum annual flow qmax are commonly obtained from norm 5 2 ic of the spanish highway instruction boe 2016 norm 5 2 ic includes several methods for estimating qmax the primary input for water infrastructure design young et al 2009 in norm 5 2 ic the procedure for selecting the most appropriate hydro meteorological method is determined by the basin size for small basins with an area lower than 50 km2 a modified rational method mr can be applied otherwise norm 5 2 ic recommends using another more suitable hydro meteorological method this research applied norm 5 2 ic to assess the impact of annual maximum daily rainfall pcpmax variation in estimating qmax and thereby in the water infrastructure design the evaluation was performed using two periods selected according to the availability of aemet precipitation data 1951 2019 peral garcía et al 2017 and the precipitation data period used in the publication maximum daily rainfall in peninsular spain until 1990 santamaría et al 1999 the latter has been used to obtain the pcpmax of a given return period t in most spanish hydrological studies and in several investigations furdada et al 2020 jiménez de santiago et al 2019 mateo lázaro et al 2016 taking the previous considerations into account the hydrological results of a baseline period 1951 1990 were compared with those of a recent period 1951 2019 to assess the changes in the pcpmax of a given return period and their implications for water infrastructure design the methodological framework followed in this part of the study is illustrated in fig 1 first the pcpmax for three probability scenarios suggested by the spanish law on flood risk evaluation and management boe 2010 high probability t 10 years medium probability t 100 years and low probability t 500 years were obtained by statistically analysing the aemet precipitation gridded dataset and applying the sqrt et max distribution etoh et al 1987 for each period this extremal distribution was adjusted to the pcpmax values following the approach and recommendations proposed by zorraquino 2004 and santamaría et al 1999 in addition a pcpmax comparison between the mean values of both selected periods was carried out to quantify the variation in pcpmax in each probability scenario throughout peninsular spain second the easybasin tool was implemented to simulate qmax for each probability scenario applying the mr proposed by norm 5 2 ic this simulation was carried out in 12 small basins fig 2 which were selected based on their drainage area less than 50 km2 and their climatological zone according to the köppen classification kottek et al 2006 finally a qmax comparison for each probability scenario was undertaken in the selected study areas as a result the variation in qmax between both periods was quantified and its potential implications for designing hydraulic works were assessed 3 2 1 modified rational method the rational method is a widely used hydro meteorological method chow et al 1988 for estimating the qmax corresponding to a given return period in small basins chin 2019 this research implemented a modified mr proposed by norm 5 2 ic which includes a set of corrections proposed by témez 1992 such as a rainfall uniformity distribution coefficient kt and a rainfall reduction factor per basin area ka as well as several specific tables and parameters for spain the mr is commonly expressed as equation x q t i c a k t 3 6 where qt is the qmax corresponding to a return period m3 s i is the maximum rainfall intensity mm h c is the runoff coefficient a is the basin area km2 and kt is the rainfall uniformity coefficient detailed information about this mr can be found in norm 5 2 ic boe 2016 3 2 2 easybasin plugin easybasin is an open source qgis plugin that this study s authors developed to optimise the mr application proposed by norm 5 2 ic the plugin was written in python 3 it is compatible with any 3 4 x version of qgis since easybasin requires several grass software functions it must be run using qgis with the grass programme which is included in the qgis 3 4 software package the number of data management and geospatial operations involved in applying the mr is substantial and can present a challenge the easybasin workflow fig 3 guides users through the steps required to successfully apply the mr proposed by norm 5 2 ic to estimate the qmax for a given return period the easybasin interface is designed with two primary windows an initial window that includes the option to run the geospatial processes of watershed and stream network delineation and a results window comprising the mr processes parameters and results in this second window the mr procedure is divided into four steps 1 watershed features 2 rainfall intensity 3 runoff coefficient and 4 maximum annual flow each step is run individually however they must follow the previously mentioned order one of easybasin s main advantages is the small amount of input data required to set up the mr application users merely introduce a digital elevation map of the study area and its outlet point coordinates from the previous inputs easybasin combines several geospatial operations to delineate the watershed and its stream network and extracts the required parameters to apply the mr a limitation is that the easybasin plugin was developed for application in peninsular spain hence it operates using data specific to this region such as an initial runoff threshold map developed by ferrer juliá et al 2004 a torrentiality index map and a regional classification map of the runoff correction factor extracted from the norm 5 2 ic the easybasin plugin demonstrated in this study is available in zenodo at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5517063 along with detailed instructions on how its use 4 results and discussion first of all the results obtained from the trend analysis carried out on an annual seasonal and monthly scale are presented analysis at these time scales is critically important in a country like spain which is the european country most affected by water stress estrela et al 2012 secondly these results are complemented by an analysis of the number of rainy days and maximum daily rainfall which indicates wether a reduction in the amount of rainfall is combined with a lower number of rainy days but with a higher amount of rainfall registered constraining the water storage capacity needed to mitigate water stress and raising the possibility of extreme flooding events finally using the easybasin tool it is shown that an increase in maximum annual rainfall can affect the streamflows used for the sizing of infrastructures 4 1 annual seasonal and monthly rainfall trend analysis the mann kendall test results applied to the aemet precipitation gridded data for the period of 1951 2019 are illustrated in fig 4 and summarised in table 1 as the percentage of grid points with significant positive and negative trends the seasons displayed in fig 4 and the subsequent figures were divided according to season considering december january and february as winter march april and may as spring june july and august as summer and september october and november as autumn different seasonal trends in the amount of precipitation were noted throughout spain all seasons except autumn show a dominant negative trend the spatial distribution of the pluviometric trends reveals a significant negative trend in many areas of western spain in summer in the southern zone many areas with a significant negative trend are observed during all seasons except autumn on an annual scale the results demonstrate a decreasing precipitation trend across the territory except in isolated areas to the north where positive trends are observed these results are in line with those of caloiero et al 2018 who found that galicia presents a significant increase in rainfall eighteen percent of the grid points display a negative trend on an annual scale of which only 0 74 are positive rainfall tends to decrease in more than 40 of grid points in summer fig 5 illustrates the percentages of grid points with significant positive and negative trends these results indicate significantly different monthly trends april and september exhibit a generally positive trend significantly affecting 7 of spanish grid points the situation was reversed in the remaining months indicating an overall decrease in total monthly precipitation march and june exhibit the highest percentage of points with significant negative trends of 27 and 65 respectively previous studies undertaken in spain gonzález hidalgo et al 2010 2011 have revealed similar trends in march june and october many previous works del río et al 2005 serrano et al 1999 have detected an overall decrease in precipitation in march which has been related to a northward shift in storms paredes et al 2006 and a positive trend in sunshine duration and anticyclonic activity sanchez lorenzo et al 2007 the significant decrease in precipitation found in june is consistent with recent studies carried out for the city of barcelona lana et al 2022 and for catalonia lana et al 2021 4 2 rainy day trend analysis the mann kendall test was applied to detect the annual seasonal and monthly rainy day trends in the aemet precipitation gridded data a day was defined as rainy when the precipitation volume was 1 mm the analysis results indicate a general negative trend throughout the territory on annual and seasonal scales fig 6 and table 2 in winter and summer the percentage of grid points with a significant negative trend is higher with 52 70 and 73 31 respectively however autumn is the only season that indicates a significant positive trend although it affects only 0 13 of the grid points on an annual scale virtually the entire territory demonstrates a decreasing trend in the number of rainy days with 76 39 of the points revealing a significant negative trend on a monthly scale the results fig 7 also indicate a decreasing trend regarding the number of rainy days june is prominent with more than 80 of the points indicating a significant negative trend followed by march 43 and december 25 a few points less than 1 of the territory indicate a significant positive trend in august and september in the northeastern zone the trend is significantly negative on an annual scale and for all seasons as observed in lópez moreno et al 2010 where the number of rainy days generally decreased during the period of 1955 2006 this decrease in the number of days with rain is common among all mediterranean regions because of the nao index s persistence since 1980 which is characterised by more anticyclonic conditions in the south of europe and stronger westerly winds in the north martínez et al 2007 4 3 maximum daily rain trend analysis according to the mann kendall test the maximum daily rainfall trend is predominantly positive on annual and seasonal scales except in summer fig 8 and table 3 the trend s spatial distribution varies at each station except in eastern spain where the trend remains significantly positive at all stations this trend is significantly positive in 9 54 of the grid points in winter around 20 in spring and 26 10 in autumn regarding the monthly distribution fig 9 all months display a predominantly positive trend except june and july where the maximum daily precipitation generally decreases april and october are particularly notable with 28 and 25 of the grid points revealing a significant positive trend respectively in contrast june demonstrates a significant negative trend in 21 of the territory therefore the results indicate a general decrease in the number of rainy days over the study period although rainfall generally tends to be more intense these results support those of other studies such as gonzález hidalgo et al 2003 who observed a positive trend towards higher precipitation events in the spanish mediterranean area meseguer ruiz et al 2021 observed a positive trend in the number of torrential events in eastern and southeastern spain particularly in september and november 4 4 assessment of annual maximum daily precipitation variation and its implications for water infrastructure design following the methodology described above the pcpmax variation was quantified for each aemet data point throughout peninsular spain after adjusting for each selected data period for the sqrt et max statistical distribution the result is a pcpmax variation map for each probability scenario fig 10 the main strength of the sqrt et max distribution is that it was developed to specifically model annual maximum series of daily rainfall zorraquino 2004 therefore no overestimation is expected in the values of the highest return periods and the sensitivity to outliers is lower than for other conventional distributions as observed in fig 10 the pcpmax variation pattern exhibits a general increase in all the probability scenarios when the recent period is compared with the baseline period this general increase is more pronounced in low probability scenarios potentially indicating a design problem for water infrastructure because most waterworks are developed for high return periods slight decreases are also observed in the central and southeastern parts of spain this result highlights that the rainfall data in the maximum daily rainfall in peninsular spain publication needs to be updated as mateo lázaro et al 2016 have previously suggested table 4 presents the main characteristics and climate classifications of each study area the physical characteristics were extracted from the easybasin plugin s watershed features component using the physical and climatic information of the selected watersheds table 4 easybasin estimates each parameter of mr following the next workflow first the maximum rainfall intensity i is obtained from the pcpmax of each given return period after applying the ka correction factor and a torrential factor second the runoff coefficient c is calculated using the pcp max of each given return period the ka and the initial runoff threshold map ferrer juliá et al 2004 last the mr equation is implemented with the previous estimated parameters the watershed area a and the kt correction factor which depends only on the concentration time of the watershed detailed information about the mr equations can be found in norm 5 2 ic boe 2016 the mr parameters derived from easybasin for each study area are listed in table 5 subsequently the qmax for the selected basins was estimated by applying the entire easybasin workflow for each probability scenario qmax was obtained for the baseline and recent periods and the percentage of variation between them was quantified table 6 the results displayed in table 6 indicate clear differences when the baseline and recent pcpmax periods are used to estimate qmax an increase in qmax is observed in all the selected basins ranging from 3 6 to 69 5 in the high probability scenario from 9 9 to 115 1 in the medium probability scenario and from 9 1 to 128 6 in the low probability scenario the variation in qmax indicates the need for updated data in water infrastructure design to avoid underestimating the amount of discharge generated in the basin 5 conclusions the analysis of the annual rainfall trend demonstrates a decreasing trend in 18 of the territory an increasing trend is observed only in some areas in the north of the country corresponding to less than 1 of the total territory seasonally this decrease in precipitation tends to be concentrated in summer and to a lesser extent in autumn on a monthly scale this work supports previous studies that detected a significant reduction in precipitation during march and june trends in the number of rainy days performed similarly to previous results with a general decreasing trend detected in most parts of the country the annual trend of maximum daily rainfall is positive in 29 47 of the territory with only 1 39 showing a decreasing trend similar results are observed on a seasonal level except in summer when the opposite occurs with 12 75 of the territory showing a negative trend in maximum daily rainfall compared to 1 64 with an increasing trend therefore in many parts of the territory the number of rainy days decreased year by year on an annual and seasonal scale except in summer but the maximum daily rainfall increased applying the easybasin plugin made it possible to easily calculate the design flows in 12 study basins distributed throughout peninsular spain the results confirm the need for updated data to estimate these flows because regardless of the return period considered average increases in design flows of around 30 40 have been detected reaching double the values for the baseline period 1951 1990 in some basins design flows obtained without using the most recent data could be underestimated resulting in a severe flood risk therefore a sufficient technical basis exists for drawing attention to this problem and recommending its formal consideration by competent authorities flood maps currently available in spain are probably obsolete the flood areas derived from them would not be obtained today through applying the same technical procedures with the inclusion of new meteorological data this scenario could have significant technical and legal consequences for designing water infrastructure and urban planning declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

the citarum river basin we focus on july to october because these are agriculturally important months in java we use a high resolution hydrologic model wflow sbm with data for the period 1989 2009 new hydrological insights for the region water users and agricultural practitioners commonly need monthly to seasonal hydrological forecasts the forecasts should be sufficiently skillful and provide information that is relevant to the decisions makers in order to have practical value to them we assess if skilful seas5 eqm bias corrected based seasonal forecasts are available with the purpose to support rice production in this streamflow forecast calibration we look at different aggregation days and different lead times for the verification we use the continuous ranked probability skill score crpss brier skill score bss and mean average error mae we also look at the correlation the root mean square error rmse and the receiver operating characteristic skill rocs the lt1 and lt2 forecast show higher skills than longer lead times meanwhile streamflow based on the aggregated forecast at 30 to 60 days aggregation days is more skillful than larger aggregations in indonesia this study is a study that initiates using a hydrological model with inputs from a seasonal rainfall forecast graphical abstract keywords ecmwf seas5 bias corrected streamflow forecast verification skill wflow sbm model hydrological ensemble forecast citarum river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction national development programs in indonesia have led to increasing demand for water for uses such as safe drinking water and irrigation the water demand in jakarta and bandung two big cities in indonesia depend on the citarum river as its water resources loebis and syariman 1993 fares and yudianto 2003 sahu et al 2017 loebis and syariman 1993 mentioned that 80 of the water demands in jakarta are supplied by the citarum river basin the longest and largest river basin in west java this river basin has a significant influence on the daily life of the population in the province of west java not only for electricity and water supply but also for agriculture fisheries and industrial sectors in the agricultural sector the indonesian government has a target of development to achieve self sufficiency in rice production pasaribu 2010 adequacy of the supply of rice will increase food security for indonesia according to suwarno 2016 one of the indicators of national food security is the availability of foodstuffs the indonesian ministry of agriculture encouraged rice farmers to increase rice productivity in rain fed rice fields to ensure abundant national rice stock to harmonize government programs the water availability of rice fields needs to be considered rain fed rice fields rely on rainfall so farmers require skillful forecasts of rainfall and water availability meanwhile in irrigated paddy fields if the water is available throughout the year farmers most likely can continuously run rice cultivation however this has a negative side in terms of the development of pests and diseases plant rusastra et al 2019 besides this problem the farmers often face rice production risk and harvesting failure due to the occurrence of floods and droughts farmers need to plan strategically to avoid risks associated with varying water availability to support this a skillful seasonal forecast of streamflow is needed the streamflows are affected by not only morphological but also anthropogenic factors including topography and land use changes besides rainfall sahu et al 2012 mention that the relationship between river streamflow and variation of climate sometimes still unclear though the topography factor has a direct impact on rainfall variability a timely forecast of climate related natural hazards such as floods and droughts can help farmers and decision makers to increase preparedness and reduce the impacts of these hazards adjusting planting time selecting commodities and knowing the climatic conditions before and during the growing season are important surmaini and syahbuddin 2016 in addition a lot of research has been invested in the provision of skillful seasonal forecasts which is motivated by the development of streamflow forecasts effort towards developing streamflow forecasting crochemore et al 2016 for the adequate management of water resources systems precise forecast streamflows are needed masselot et al 2016 the streamflow forecasts accuracy relies on a proper understanding of meteorological and hydrological uncertainties brown et al 2012 siddique et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 mentioned that hydrological forecasting are sensitive to biases in atmospheric forcing in addition streamflow postprocessors often assume unbiased forcing accordingly research in hydrological forecasting have to develop and enhanced forecasting systems in order to improve the skill and reliability of short to long range streamflow forecasts sharma et al 2018 this study will focus on july august september and october the period of july until september is important because these are dry months when farmers have to carefully decide their action whether they will grow a third rice crop or not ratri et al 2019 the farmers should have knowledge about whether they will have enough rain in the region or have enough water to irrigate all the fields on time for the growth of rice in addition october will also be the focus month of the analysis in this study because farmers commonly divide a year into three rain dependent rice cultivation seasons and the prime cultivation starting in october kumalasari and bergmeier 2014 naylor et al 2001 the main planting season comprises the months between october and december naylor et al 2001 the rice planting pattern in java follows the marked seasonality of rainfall and has been explained by naylor et al 2001 forecasting skill is valuable to many sector because it gives the ability to make informed decisions and develop driven strategies we need skillful and reliable rainfall forecasts as the input to any hydrological model a statistical post processing is needed to correct the errors in order to increases streamflow forecast skills across lead times and spatialscales siddique and mejia 2017 yang et al 2017 yang et al 2017 sharma et al 2017 implemented a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system rheps to improve the quality of ensemble streamflow forecasts in the u s mid atlantic region yang et al 2017 assessed the potential of bayesian model averaging bma and heteroscedastic censored logistic regression hclr to postprocess precipitation ensembles from the 11 member gefsrv2 dataset and found that generally the postprocessors perform similarly in this study we use ecmwf seas5 rainfall forecasts that have been bias corrected using eqm as the inputs to the hydrological model we use seasonal precipitation forecasts that have been corrected using empirical quantile mapping seas5 eqm bias corrected as input to the hydrological model that produces seasonal streamflow forecasts for the citarum river basin this produces seas5 eqm bias corrected streamflow forecasts crochemore et al 2017 notes that precipitation forecasts are an integral part of hydrological forecasting systems both at sub seasonal and at seasonal time scales moreover taking into account climate information in seasonal streamflow forecasts increases streamflow predictability wood et al 2016 in other words to increase the skill of the hydrological forecasts we need to improve the skill of the meteorological forecasts to achieve a better representation of the initial conditions and simulated flows skillful and reliable forecasts are important with advances in computing power seasonal ensemble forecasts from global climate models gcms have become available operationally and these are used to force hydrological models for hydrological predictions models contain errors the systematic bias in ensemble forecasts of seasonal precipitation from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf system 5 johnson et al 2019 for java has been corrected by ratri et al 2019 ecmwf issues forecasts with seas5 up to 7 months lead times however in this study we will focus only up to the 4 months lead time because the rice crop needs between 90 120 days to grow starting from nurseries to harvest naylor et al 2001 in this study we use corrected rainfall as the input parameter for hydrological model to demonstrate that improved basic inputs for the hydrological modeling system increase skill and facilitate human and computational efforts for step by step verification in section 2 the location of the study area is further described in section 3 of this article the models and data in this study will be explained in sections 4 and 5 we present the verification methods as well as results and discussion respectively to look at the skill we will verify the streamflow forecasts using several verification measures e g brier skill score bss continuous ranked probability skill score crpss and mean absolute error mae furthermore this is followed by the conclusions and future works in section 6 2 location of the case study area the citarum river basin fig 1 is located in west java indonesia geographically this basin is located between 6 43 s 107 22 e and 7 15 s 107 57 e the citarum river is not only the longest but also the largest in west java sahu et al 2017 the citarum river basin has a very central role in agricultural developments in west java and its surrounding citarum river basin supplies water to 10 million residents in jakarta d arrigo et al 2011a and irrigates 240 000 hectares of rice field hatmoko et al 2020 the citarum river basin is topographically surrounded by the mountainous area around the basin periphery dwi dasanto et al 2014 the highest elevation of this river basin is 2 500 m above sea level asl this basin has three dams they are jatiluhur in the north part cirata in the middle part and saguling in the south part mayrowani et al 2006 the water in the main reservoir in west java namely saguling reservoir was supplied by citarum basin syahputra 1987 the peak of precipitation events in java is mostly during the december february the rainfall variability in the java sea is affected by spatial and temporal monsoon wind patterns aldrian and dwi susanto 2003 satyawardhana and susandi 2015 mentioned that the western part of java has higher variability in rainfall during june august and sometimes there is still rainfall over this region during the dry season meanwhile the annual rainfall of the citarum basin is between 2000 to 3000 mm per year as shown in fig 2 the year is divided into two seasons a rainy season november april with a monthly mean rainfall of approximately is between 200 300 mm per month and a dry season may october with a monthly mean rainfall of approximately is between 50 200 mm per month fig 3 3 models and data 3 1 hydrological model in this study we use a high resolution conceptual hydrologic model wflow sbm this model has been used in broad applications on hydrological modeling lopez 2018 rusli et al 2021 wflow sbm model schellekens et al 2018 is used to simulate the hydrological cycle in the citarum basin the wflow sbm is built on and python language pcraster karssenberg et al 2010 vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 mentioned that the primary strength of this model is parameters that mostly represent physical characteristics these strengths of the model lead to the easiness of interpreting and correlating the values of the model with physical catchment properties an overview of the simulated processes and fluxes within the model framework can be seen in fig 4 see imhoff et al 2020 and eilander et al 2021 for more information on the model setup and parameterizations here we used the same model parameter choice and set up as rusli et al 2021 fig 4 shows the concept of model wflow sbm the soil part of this model follows the same ideas as the topog sbm model which is designed to simulate fast runoff processes during discrete storm events in small catchments vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 however wflow sbm can be applied on a wide variety of catchments wannasin et al 2021 sperna weiland et al 2021 imhoff et al 2020 rainfall interception in this model is based on the analytical approach by gash 1979 every single bucket represents the soil in every model grid cell it is divided into two parts a saturated and unsaturated store soil infiltration depends on the soil infiltration capacity and the fraction of paved and unpaved areas the transfer of water from the unsaturated store to the saturated store depends on the saturated hydraulic conductivity at the water table and the saturation deficit 1 of the whole soil profile transpiration is first derived from the saturated store if roots intersect with the saturated store and then from the unsaturated store capillary rise from the saturated store also results in influx from the saturated store to the unsaturated store the darcy equation is applied to route water in the saturated zone laterally the kinematic wave is used to route water over the surface and subsurface and through rivers based on the d8 method which was used to extract the drainage pattern 3 2 estimating hydrological states 1989 2009 simulation run wflow sbm is run in continuous simulation mode meaning that at any time an estimate of the current hydrological conditions is made the hydrologcial state of the mode this state constitutes the starting point for a hydrological forecast run states are estimated by using observed precipitation and temperature inputs to the model which is then run in simulation mode as opposed to forecasting mode the simulation run uses observations as the inputs this hydrological model was run in simulation mode for 20 years 1989 2009 resulting in what we call the state updating run observed meteorological data originates from daily high resolution land only observational gridded sa obs dataset van den besselaar et al 2017 as this data was also used to bias correct ecmwf s5 forecast ratri et al 2019 2021 the sa obs dataset covers the period 1981 2014 this precipitation dataset covers the southeast asia region and the resolution is 0 25 and 0 5 the sa obs dataset is constructed based on daily station time series collected in cooperation with meteorological services in the region 3 3 seas5 eqm bias corrected data in this study we use eqm bias corrected precipitation at 1 to 4 month lead time as the base input ratri et al 2019 the eqm bias corrected data are bias corrected using empirical quantile mapping of daily precipitation reforecasts from seas5 ratri et al 2019 in bias correcting the seasonal precipitation reforecasts ratri et al 2019 used daily total precipitation seas5 as the raw precipitation data for the period of 1981 2010 the resolution of the reforecasts data is 36 km horizontal seas5 has 51 ensemble members for the real time forecasts and 25 ensemble members for the hindcasts johnson et al 2018 3 4 aggregated forecasts and simulation time series the forecasts and the simulation data set have a daily time step however for verification purposes both of them are aggregated across timescales the aggregations of 30 60 90 and 120 days were derived by averaging the forecast and the simulation values over the aggregation duration these aggregation durations are relevant for different types of drought impacts and early warning systems this is also extensively used for agricultural activities purposes 3 5 forecast lead times this study aims to understand how hydrological forecasting skill varies with month and season it is important to make it possible to meet farmers needs at their most preferred lead time of 1 month before the farming season nyadzi et al 2019 besides the aggregation following the needs assessment the skill assessment of the discharge forecast was performed on different lead times 1 2 3 and 4 months the discharge was evaluated by validating streamflow forecast with simulation data to determine their performance in the study area 4 verification methods to look at the skill of the wflow sbm model derived by rusli et al 2021 when forced with sa obs for the period 1989 2009 before it is further used for this study a metric is calculated according to the observed discharge the observed daily discharge data are provided by the water resources research and development center pusair kling gupta efficiency kge value is used to measure the hydrological model performances vis et al 2015 mentioned that kge has been introduced as an improvement of the used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse in which nse considers different types of model errors error in the mean the variability and the dynamics the difference between kge and nse is that kge focuses more on the simulation of flow variability while the nse focuses more on high flows knoben et al 2019 qi et al 2022 mizukami et al 2019 topography affects the kge skill score qi et al 2020 and the kge of the hydrological model used in this study is 0 32 a range suitable to the citarum basin and indicates that the hydrological model improves upon the mean flow benchmark knoben et al 2019 rusli et al 2021 for comparison rusli et al 2021 obtained when forcing the model with chirps for the period 2005 2015 a kge of 0 18 and a kge value for glofas of 0 03 for the same discharge station in supplementary figure 1 we show a time series plot figure s1 a and scatterplot figure s1 b of the simulated discharge against the observed discharge the hydrological model that uses forecast information as inputs is verified against the simulation that uses observations as inputs this hydrological model can generate stream flow estimates over a long period and can be used to generate future yields simulations comprise a time series produced by the wflow sbm model with a one day time step the forecasts are aggregated to forecasts comprising time series with timesteps of 30 90 and 120 days those numbers of aggregation are chosen for the purpose of irrigation especially for rice field this study aims to investigate whether using eqm bias corrected as the input of the streamflow forecast in the citarum river basin can have good skill we measure the quality of the deterministic and probabilistic forecasts for the deterministic forecast quality we look at the correlation root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae of the ensemble mean the calculations are based on wilks 2006 we also measure the probabilistic forecast quality with the brier s probability skill score bss continuous ranked probability skill score crpss and the relative operating characteristic score rocs the bss is based on the brier score bs 1 b s 1 n t 1 n f t o t 2 this formula above measures the root mean squared error of the forecasts in probability space n is the observed events the forecast for event f t are expressed as a number between 0 and 1 the observation o t is indicated by either 0 for non occurrence of the event or 1 for event occurrence then the calculation of the skill score based on bs of reference forecast i e climatology is as below 2 b s s 1 b s b s r e f for the bss the forecast is perfect when the value is 1 meanwhile the is called no improvement compared to the climatology if the value is 0 a negative value means the forecast quality is poorer than the climatology the bss values in this study will be calculated as a function of two less than 25th percentile and more than 75th percentile the next verification metric is crpss firstly for each forecast the difference between a cumulative ensemble forecast and an observational step function is determined which is subsequently averaged over all forecasts considered the calculation of crpss is defined as follows e g wilks 2006 3 c r p s f y f o y 2 d y where 4 f o y 0 y o b s e r v e d v a l u e 1 y o b s e r v e d v a l u e f y represents the forecast s cdf cumulative distribution function fo y is a stepwise cdf of the observed value score 0 is a perfect crps the formula above defined the crps calculation for a single case meanwhile for several cases in practice the crps is averaged wilks 2006 the crpss compares the crps of a rainfall forecast to the observed climatology as a reference forecast it measures reliability and resolution the corresponding crpss can be written as follows wilks 2006 5 c r p s s 1 c r p s c r p s r e f the range value of crpss is to 1 if the value 0 means that the forecast improves on the reference and vice versa it is worse than the reference if the value is 0 the crpsref is the crps of the reference i e climatology the relative operating characteristic roc curve is considered as a measure of the probabilistic and ensemble based forecast potential usefulness mason 1982 the roc measures the quality of probability forecasts that relates the hit rate to the corresponding false alarm rate kharin and zwiers 2003 to see the ability of the forecast in discriminating between events and non events mason 1982 mason and graham 2002 this score does not inform about reliability because this score is not sensitive to forecast bias the benefit of roc is it allows non calibrated have not been bias corrected forecasts to be compared anctil and ramos 2019 in the calculation the event was defined here as the streamflow less than 25th and streamflow exceeding the 75th percentile of the sample climatology using a probability threshold one has to decide whether a probabilistic forecast would be interpreted as an event forecast or event not forecast occurrence rocs comprises the auc of the main forecasting system normalized by the auc of the climatological forecast i e 0 5 the stationary block bootstrap politis and romano 1994 is applied in order to quantify the sampling uncertainties of the verification measurements adjacent pairs of blocks are randomly sampled from a number of available pairs and overlapping blocks are permitted the size of the block is 21 length of the series data 25 number of ensemble members the average length of each block is calculated by the sample data that is being autocorrelated this resampling action is repeated up to 1000 times to produce 1000 means for the bootstrap sample we compute the verification metrics from each sample for the probabilistic verification the forecast probability was calculated for each bootstraps sample the threshold that is measured for each sample is the discharge with a probability of more than 0 90 quantiles 5 results and discussion fig 5 shows the interannual variability and annual cycle of monthly mean discharge of simulated and ensemble streamflow forecasts for the citarum river basin for the period of 1989 2009 at four different lead times we find that the mean of the forecast ensemble member shows acceptable performance in simulating discharge data comparing the simulated discharge to forecast discharge time series we generally see that the temporal dynamics are covered reasonably well by the hydrological model comparison of the inter annual cycle of 1 month lead time lt1 to longer lead times lt2 lt4 shows that the forecast ensemble spread of 1 month lead time is narrower than other lead times as is expected the ensemble is more confident at shorter lead times in addition the annual cycle of streamflow cycles is also presented in fig 5 for 1 month lead time to 4 month lead time the monsoonal pattern is observable from the figure the annual cycle of monthly mean discharge from november to april wet season is between 50 250 m s and from may to september dry season is below 100 m s to nearly zero for lt1 the forecast follows closely the simulation data set the forecast still follows the simulation at the longer lead times but we can see that there are some periods of obvious over prediction such as january and march also at longer lead times we see a gap between simulation and forecast data in the dry season 5 1 verification results based on the aggregated forecast as described in the method section several verification metrics were used to determine the accuracy and the skill of the streamflow forecast this section analyzes the forecast s predictive power at the four different aggregation periods 30d 60d 90d and 120d identification of skillful temporal aggregations of forecast information is valuable to water supply managers mcinerney et al 2020 table 1 shows the value metrics that describe the accuracy of the forecast to the simulations for different aggregation days both deterministic and probabilistic verification measures correlation rmse and mae are measures of the deviations of the deterministic forecasts values from the values of the simulation the correlation coefficient varies considerably with the aggregation period with optimum values attained when data is aggregated to 30 to 60 days except august in terms of the correlation value mostly the error metrics reduce by the higher aggregation days from table 1 it shows the increase in the rmse as a function of time aggregation for all months july october in addition mae measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts however it does not consider their direction moreover from table 1 for all months the mae increases with the increasing aggregation days table 1 also shows the probabilistic or quantitative model checking values they are crpss and both the bss and rocs for the probability of streamflow less than 25th and more than 75th percentile from the scores streamflow at 30 to 60 days aggregation days is more skillful than larger aggregation in july supplementary figure 2 based on the rmse and mae the error is the lowest for a 30 day aggregation and increases with the increasing level of aggregation reaching the largest value for a 120 day aggregation in general the more aggregations the larger the error this is due to its seasonal variability this happens because when a value is aggregated over a longer time it will cause the number of seasons involved to have more varied rainfall to provide information tailored to the user s needs aggregation over longer longer than 30 days periods is needed bohn et al 2010 temporal aggregation of 30 days is typically used in seasonal forecasting services apel et al 2018 in addition probabilistic seasonal forecasts are essential for water intensive activities requiring long term planning table 1 also shows that even if the skill for the forecast period decreases when aggregating of the days is higher the forecasts mostly remain skillful crpss are mostly greater than 0 the bss value for the threshold more than the 75th percentile also shows the values are greater than zero in addition supplementary figure 2 also shows that the skill of the forecast when predicting the streamflow less than the 25th percentile decreases by the increasing number of aggregations even though the different values of bss are not significantly different for the 60 to 120 days aggregation meanwhile for the crpss the skill after the 30 days aggregation decreases and reaches around zero but then increases again for the higher aggregation days the streamflow forecast skill may be affected by the precipitation forecast skill the variability of the crpss values of seas5 bias corrected model forecast in the western part of java is probably because of its high rainfall variability that is linked to topography ratri et al 2019 the forecast model skill is expected to decay with the increase in lead time however this is not always the case in august supplementary figure 3 however if we look at the error both rmse and mae we can see there is a rate of increase of errors with lead time as expected the skill of the streamflow forecast is affected by the skill of rainfall forecast in indonesia the skill also depends on the region month and season and the distribution of land and sea aldrian et al 2007 in september supplementary figure 4 except for the bss and rocs with a threshold less than the 25th percentile the other metrics such as rmse mae corr crpss are almost as expected it shows that 30 to 60 days aggregation has higher performance this is also the same as in october supplementary figure 5 the validation metrics for october show that 30 to 60 days of aggregation have higher performance than higher aggregation days during september october streamflow variability in the citarum river basin is linked to the iod and enso variations the streamflow over this region and its link to climate has been analyzed by d arrigo et al 2011b 5 2 verification results based on the lead time forecasts the verification scores are also investigated based on the lead times fig 6 presents the crpss values of the streamflow forecast for lt1 to lt4 the figure shows that all forecasts for lt1 are skillful in addition in july and october all forecasts until lt4 are skillful while in august and september skill is lost in the second lead time for all months the median crpss values of lt1 and lt2 are higher than longer lead times shown by blue solid lines in fig 6 the crpss values up to about 0 5 for july september and october in the lt1 except for august the crpss values decrease by lead times in july and october most of the crpss values for all lead times are above zero however in august and september the crpps values for lt2 lt4 are below zero nyamekye et al 2021 mentioned that seasonal forecast information provided at an early lead time significantly informed farmer decision making compared to longer lead times forecasts of precipitation and streamflow are closely related to each other and it can potentially assist with planning of managed reservoir releases provided forecasts are sufficiently accurate at lead times necessary for management decisions turner et al 2017 nyamekye et al 2021 added that communicating forecast information at an appropriate lead time has the potential to help users especially farmers manage risks and improve decision making pappenberger et al 2015 mentioned that the crpss is one of the most recommended skill scores if we want to evaluate overall hydrological ensemble forecast performance fig 11 shows that for all the months the crpss values tend overall to decline with increasing lead time this is because the longer the lead times the weather uncertainties tend to grow and become more dominant siddique and mejia 2017 across all lead times the crpss values vary approximately from about 1 to 1 the median crpss showed by the solid line the crpss value at lt1 for all months has positive skill for lt2 the median of the crpss is still nearly 0 however for longer lead times especially for august and september the crpss have slightly negative skills even though in general there are decreasing crpss values by lead times there is a relatively narrow range of the lead times sharma et al 2019 found that after postprocessing is applied into a streamflow forecast skill looking at the crpss values the models have comparable skill across lead times generally as would be expected the mae increases slightly by increasing the lead times this indicates decreasing skill with increasing lead time fig 7 in all months the seas5 eqm bias corrected based streamflow forecasts are more skillful in early lt1 lt2 compared to longer lt3 lt4 lead times furthermore fig 7 shows the variability of mae among months and lead times looking at the accuracy error statistics like mae will allow us to see how large the bias and errors are the variability and median values of mae show agreement with the crpss values this indicates there are more variability and uncertainty as the streamflow forecast extends further in time meanwhile among those four months for october the majority of the grid cells have larger mae than other months for all lead times this is probably because october is generally wetter than the other months the performance of the forecasts is good for the shorter lead time but may become worse as the lead times increases this can be also observed in figs 8 and 9 which show that correlation rmse is generally high small for early lead times but increases decreases thereafter boxplots of bsss are shown in fig 10 in the wet months september and october better performance of streamflow ensembles is obtained for early lt both for threshold less than 25th percentile and more than the 75th percentile bss values vary significantly with lead time however in dry months july and august better scores are generally obtained when considering high discharge thresholds exceedances of the percentile q75 this is especially observed in the case of the hydrological models that do not make use of an updating procedure during forecasting the boxplot distributions of bss shown in fig 10 indicate positive values and therefore a better performance of the forecasting systems compared to the climatology except for august the better skill was shown in earlier lead times considering the growth of rice crops is between 90 120 days which is related to the early lead times the forecast information with the positive skill of bss is sufficient to adjust critical agricultural decisions to improve the efficiency of agricultural management and to ensure food and livelihood security forecast information with a sufficient lead time to adjust critical agricultural decisions is needed apipattanavis et al 2010 fig 11 shows the roc skill score as a function of forecast lead time the evaluation that is conducted in this study is also based on the roc skill score at a threshold less than the 25th percentile and more than the 75th percentile the no skill value for rocss is 0 so from fig 11 it is shown that especially in the wet months september and october for both thresholds the longer lead times are the less skillful meanwhile for the early lt there is no regular pattern of skill decreasing by lead times 6 conclusion and future works enhancing hydrological forecasting accuracy is still a challenging issue by applying the eqm bias correction approaches to ecmwf seas5 before generating the streamflow forecasts exploring four different aggregation days and four different lead times we find that the model skills reach the most efficient at 30 or 60 aggregation days meanwhile based on the different lead times the performances of lt1 and lt2 are better than other lead times bss indicates that the model approach is reasonable for early lead times as the skill score shows positive value this evaluation performance of the hydrological model is good and can help farmers to adjust critical agricultural decisions lt1 and lt2 of forecast information are more useful for agricultural rice practitioners than longer lead times as they relate to the rice plants cycle so far given information related to these issues is still lacking this methodology is now good enough to be used for advice to farmers this study especially in indonesia is a study that initiates using a hydrological model with inputs from a bias corrected seasonal rainfall forecast when forecasts are accurate then the information has the potential as a significant tool in water resource management alemu et al 2011 on the other hand unskilled forecasts can result in unwanted impacts to allocate resources and meet demands water resource managers and agricultural practitioners require streamflow predictions that are accurate and timely for example there will be unnecessary drought mitigation actions happen if the forecasts predict lower flows than actually occur conversely improper drought mitigation actions will be called for which could result in a drought if the forecasts predict higher flows than actually occur for now this paper only describes the performance skill and uncertainty of seas5 eqm bias corrected based streamflow prediction however the improved skill compared to climatology cannot be achieved for all forecast lead times in a future study we could look at post processing the streamflow forecast itself in addition a more advanced statistical postprocessing approach for the ensemble precipitation forecast is may be needed to further improve seasonal forecast skills so the performance of seas5 advanced statistical bias corrected based streamflow forecast skill can be studied adding climate indices e g dipole mode index dmi madden julian oscillation mjo indices sea surface temperature sst as potential predictors in the analysis for future study can be

7772,study region citarum river basin west java indonesia study focus we look at the skill of empirical quantile mapping corrected ecmwf seas5 seas5 eqm bias corrected based streamflow forecasts in the citarum river basin we focus on july to october because these are agriculturally important months in java we use a high resolution hydrologic model wflow sbm with data for the period 1989 2009 new hydrological insights for the region water users and agricultural practitioners commonly need monthly to seasonal hydrological forecasts the forecasts should be sufficiently skillful and provide information that is relevant to the decisions makers in order to have practical value to them we assess if skilful seas5 eqm bias corrected based seasonal forecasts are available with the purpose to support rice production in this streamflow forecast calibration we look at different aggregation days and different lead times for the verification we use the continuous ranked probability skill score crpss brier skill score bss and mean average error mae we also look at the correlation the root mean square error rmse and the receiver operating characteristic skill rocs the lt1 and lt2 forecast show higher skills than longer lead times meanwhile streamflow based on the aggregated forecast at 30 to 60 days aggregation days is more skillful than larger aggregations in indonesia this study is a study that initiates using a hydrological model with inputs from a seasonal rainfall forecast graphical abstract keywords ecmwf seas5 bias corrected streamflow forecast verification skill wflow sbm model hydrological ensemble forecast citarum river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction national development programs in indonesia have led to increasing demand for water for uses such as safe drinking water and irrigation the water demand in jakarta and bandung two big cities in indonesia depend on the citarum river as its water resources loebis and syariman 1993 fares and yudianto 2003 sahu et al 2017 loebis and syariman 1993 mentioned that 80 of the water demands in jakarta are supplied by the citarum river basin the longest and largest river basin in west java this river basin has a significant influence on the daily life of the population in the province of west java not only for electricity and water supply but also for agriculture fisheries and industrial sectors in the agricultural sector the indonesian government has a target of development to achieve self sufficiency in rice production pasaribu 2010 adequacy of the supply of rice will increase food security for indonesia according to suwarno 2016 one of the indicators of national food security is the availability of foodstuffs the indonesian ministry of agriculture encouraged rice farmers to increase rice productivity in rain fed rice fields to ensure abundant national rice stock to harmonize government programs the water availability of rice fields needs to be considered rain fed rice fields rely on rainfall so farmers require skillful forecasts of rainfall and water availability meanwhile in irrigated paddy fields if the water is available throughout the year farmers most likely can continuously run rice cultivation however this has a negative side in terms of the development of pests and diseases plant rusastra et al 2019 besides this problem the farmers often face rice production risk and harvesting failure due to the occurrence of floods and droughts farmers need to plan strategically to avoid risks associated with varying water availability to support this a skillful seasonal forecast of streamflow is needed the streamflows are affected by not only morphological but also anthropogenic factors including topography and land use changes besides rainfall sahu et al 2012 mention that the relationship between river streamflow and variation of climate sometimes still unclear though the topography factor has a direct impact on rainfall variability a timely forecast of climate related natural hazards such as floods and droughts can help farmers and decision makers to increase preparedness and reduce the impacts of these hazards adjusting planting time selecting commodities and knowing the climatic conditions before and during the growing season are important surmaini and syahbuddin 2016 in addition a lot of research has been invested in the provision of skillful seasonal forecasts which is motivated by the development of streamflow forecasts effort towards developing streamflow forecasting crochemore et al 2016 for the adequate management of water resources systems precise forecast streamflows are needed masselot et al 2016 the streamflow forecasts accuracy relies on a proper understanding of meteorological and hydrological uncertainties brown et al 2012 siddique et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 mentioned that hydrological forecasting are sensitive to biases in atmospheric forcing in addition streamflow postprocessors often assume unbiased forcing accordingly research in hydrological forecasting have to develop and enhanced forecasting systems in order to improve the skill and reliability of short to long range streamflow forecasts sharma et al 2018 this study will focus on july august september and october the period of july until september is important because these are dry months when farmers have to carefully decide their action whether they will grow a third rice crop or not ratri et al 2019 the farmers should have knowledge about whether they will have enough rain in the region or have enough water to irrigate all the fields on time for the growth of rice in addition october will also be the focus month of the analysis in this study because farmers commonly divide a year into three rain dependent rice cultivation seasons and the prime cultivation starting in october kumalasari and bergmeier 2014 naylor et al 2001 the main planting season comprises the months between october and december naylor et al 2001 the rice planting pattern in java follows the marked seasonality of rainfall and has been explained by naylor et al 2001 forecasting skill is valuable to many sector because it gives the ability to make informed decisions and develop driven strategies we need skillful and reliable rainfall forecasts as the input to any hydrological model a statistical post processing is needed to correct the errors in order to increases streamflow forecast skills across lead times and spatialscales siddique and mejia 2017 yang et al 2017 yang et al 2017 sharma et al 2017 implemented a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system rheps to improve the quality of ensemble streamflow forecasts in the u s mid atlantic region yang et al 2017 assessed the potential of bayesian model averaging bma and heteroscedastic censored logistic regression hclr to postprocess precipitation ensembles from the 11 member gefsrv2 dataset and found that generally the postprocessors perform similarly in this study we use ecmwf seas5 rainfall forecasts that have been bias corrected using eqm as the inputs to the hydrological model we use seasonal precipitation forecasts that have been corrected using empirical quantile mapping seas5 eqm bias corrected as input to the hydrological model that produces seasonal streamflow forecasts for the citarum river basin this produces seas5 eqm bias corrected streamflow forecasts crochemore et al 2017 notes that precipitation forecasts are an integral part of hydrological forecasting systems both at sub seasonal and at seasonal time scales moreover taking into account climate information in seasonal streamflow forecasts increases streamflow predictability wood et al 2016 in other words to increase the skill of the hydrological forecasts we need to improve the skill of the meteorological forecasts to achieve a better representation of the initial conditions and simulated flows skillful and reliable forecasts are important with advances in computing power seasonal ensemble forecasts from global climate models gcms have become available operationally and these are used to force hydrological models for hydrological predictions models contain errors the systematic bias in ensemble forecasts of seasonal precipitation from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf system 5 johnson et al 2019 for java has been corrected by ratri et al 2019 ecmwf issues forecasts with seas5 up to 7 months lead times however in this study we will focus only up to the 4 months lead time because the rice crop needs between 90 120 days to grow starting from nurseries to harvest naylor et al 2001 in this study we use corrected rainfall as the input parameter for hydrological model to demonstrate that improved basic inputs for the hydrological modeling system increase skill and facilitate human and computational efforts for step by step verification in section 2 the location of the study area is further described in section 3 of this article the models and data in this study will be explained in sections 4 and 5 we present the verification methods as well as results and discussion respectively to look at the skill we will verify the streamflow forecasts using several verification measures e g brier skill score bss continuous ranked probability skill score crpss and mean absolute error mae furthermore this is followed by the conclusions and future works in section 6 2 location of the case study area the citarum river basin fig 1 is located in west java indonesia geographically this basin is located between 6 43 s 107 22 e and 7 15 s 107 57 e the citarum river is not only the longest but also the largest in west java sahu et al 2017 the citarum river basin has a very central role in agricultural developments in west java and its surrounding citarum river basin supplies water to 10 million residents in jakarta d arrigo et al 2011a and irrigates 240 000 hectares of rice field hatmoko et al 2020 the citarum river basin is topographically surrounded by the mountainous area around the basin periphery dwi dasanto et al 2014 the highest elevation of this river basin is 2 500 m above sea level asl this basin has three dams they are jatiluhur in the north part cirata in the middle part and saguling in the south part mayrowani et al 2006 the water in the main reservoir in west java namely saguling reservoir was supplied by citarum basin syahputra 1987 the peak of precipitation events in java is mostly during the december february the rainfall variability in the java sea is affected by spatial and temporal monsoon wind patterns aldrian and dwi susanto 2003 satyawardhana and susandi 2015 mentioned that the western part of java has higher variability in rainfall during june august and sometimes there is still rainfall over this region during the dry season meanwhile the annual rainfall of the citarum basin is between 2000 to 3000 mm per year as shown in fig 2 the year is divided into two seasons a rainy season november april with a monthly mean rainfall of approximately is between 200 300 mm per month and a dry season may october with a monthly mean rainfall of approximately is between 50 200 mm per month fig 3 3 models and data 3 1 hydrological model in this study we use a high resolution conceptual hydrologic model wflow sbm this model has been used in broad applications on hydrological modeling lopez 2018 rusli et al 2021 wflow sbm model schellekens et al 2018 is used to simulate the hydrological cycle in the citarum basin the wflow sbm is built on and python language pcraster karssenberg et al 2010 vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 mentioned that the primary strength of this model is parameters that mostly represent physical characteristics these strengths of the model lead to the easiness of interpreting and correlating the values of the model with physical catchment properties an overview of the simulated processes and fluxes within the model framework can be seen in fig 4 see imhoff et al 2020 and eilander et al 2021 for more information on the model setup and parameterizations here we used the same model parameter choice and set up as rusli et al 2021 fig 4 shows the concept of model wflow sbm the soil part of this model follows the same ideas as the topog sbm model which is designed to simulate fast runoff processes during discrete storm events in small catchments vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 however wflow sbm can be applied on a wide variety of catchments wannasin et al 2021 sperna weiland et al 2021 imhoff et al 2020 rainfall interception in this model is based on the analytical approach by gash 1979 every single bucket represents the soil in every model grid cell it is divided into two parts a saturated and unsaturated store soil infiltration depends on the soil infiltration capacity and the fraction of paved and unpaved areas the transfer of water from the unsaturated store to the saturated store depends on the saturated hydraulic conductivity at the water table and the saturation deficit 1 of the whole soil profile transpiration is first derived from the saturated store if roots intersect with the saturated store and then from the unsaturated store capillary rise from the saturated store also results in influx from the saturated store to the unsaturated store the darcy equation is applied to route water in the saturated zone laterally the kinematic wave is used to route water over the surface and subsurface and through rivers based on the d8 method which was used to extract the drainage pattern 3 2 estimating hydrological states 1989 2009 simulation run wflow sbm is run in continuous simulation mode meaning that at any time an estimate of the current hydrological conditions is made the hydrologcial state of the mode this state constitutes the starting point for a hydrological forecast run states are estimated by using observed precipitation and temperature inputs to the model which is then run in simulation mode as opposed to forecasting mode the simulation run uses observations as the inputs this hydrological model was run in simulation mode for 20 years 1989 2009 resulting in what we call the state updating run observed meteorological data originates from daily high resolution land only observational gridded sa obs dataset van den besselaar et al 2017 as this data was also used to bias correct ecmwf s5 forecast ratri et al 2019 2021 the sa obs dataset covers the period 1981 2014 this precipitation dataset covers the southeast asia region and the resolution is 0 25 and 0 5 the sa obs dataset is constructed based on daily station time series collected in cooperation with meteorological services in the region 3 3 seas5 eqm bias corrected data in this study we use eqm bias corrected precipitation at 1 to 4 month lead time as the base input ratri et al 2019 the eqm bias corrected data are bias corrected using empirical quantile mapping of daily precipitation reforecasts from seas5 ratri et al 2019 in bias correcting the seasonal precipitation reforecasts ratri et al 2019 used daily total precipitation seas5 as the raw precipitation data for the period of 1981 2010 the resolution of the reforecasts data is 36 km horizontal seas5 has 51 ensemble members for the real time forecasts and 25 ensemble members for the hindcasts johnson et al 2018 3 4 aggregated forecasts and simulation time series the forecasts and the simulation data set have a daily time step however for verification purposes both of them are aggregated across timescales the aggregations of 30 60 90 and 120 days were derived by averaging the forecast and the simulation values over the aggregation duration these aggregation durations are relevant for different types of drought impacts and early warning systems this is also extensively used for agricultural activities purposes 3 5 forecast lead times this study aims to understand how hydrological forecasting skill varies with month and season it is important to make it possible to meet farmers needs at their most preferred lead time of 1 month before the farming season nyadzi et al 2019 besides the aggregation following the needs assessment the skill assessment of the discharge forecast was performed on different lead times 1 2 3 and 4 months the discharge was evaluated by validating streamflow forecast with simulation data to determine their performance in the study area 4 verification methods to look at the skill of the wflow sbm model derived by rusli et al 2021 when forced with sa obs for the period 1989 2009 before it is further used for this study a metric is calculated according to the observed discharge the observed daily discharge data are provided by the water resources research and development center pusair kling gupta efficiency kge value is used to measure the hydrological model performances vis et al 2015 mentioned that kge has been introduced as an improvement of the used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse in which nse considers different types of model errors error in the mean the variability and the dynamics the difference between kge and nse is that kge focuses more on the simulation of flow variability while the nse focuses more on high flows knoben et al 2019 qi et al 2022 mizukami et al 2019 topography affects the kge skill score qi et al 2020 and the kge of the hydrological model used in this study is 0 32 a range suitable to the citarum basin and indicates that the hydrological model improves upon the mean flow benchmark knoben et al 2019 rusli et al 2021 for comparison rusli et al 2021 obtained when forcing the model with chirps for the period 2005 2015 a kge of 0 18 and a kge value for glofas of 0 03 for the same discharge station in supplementary figure 1 we show a time series plot figure s1 a and scatterplot figure s1 b of the simulated discharge against the observed discharge the hydrological model that uses forecast information as inputs is verified against the simulation that uses observations as inputs this hydrological model can generate stream flow estimates over a long period and can be used to generate future yields simulations comprise a time series produced by the wflow sbm model with a one day time step the forecasts are aggregated to forecasts comprising time series with timesteps of 30 90 and 120 days those numbers of aggregation are chosen for the purpose of irrigation especially for rice field this study aims to investigate whether using eqm bias corrected as the input of the streamflow forecast in the citarum river basin can have good skill we measure the quality of the deterministic and probabilistic forecasts for the deterministic forecast quality we look at the correlation root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae of the ensemble mean the calculations are based on wilks 2006 we also measure the probabilistic forecast quality with the brier s probability skill score bss continuous ranked probability skill score crpss and the relative operating characteristic score rocs the bss is based on the brier score bs 1 b s 1 n t 1 n f t o t 2 this formula above measures the root mean squared error of the forecasts in probability space n is the observed events the forecast for event f t are expressed as a number between 0 and 1 the observation o t is indicated by either 0 for non occurrence of the event or 1 for event occurrence then the calculation of the skill score based on bs of reference forecast i e climatology is as below 2 b s s 1 b s b s r e f for the bss the forecast is perfect when the value is 1 meanwhile the is called no improvement compared to the climatology if the value is 0 a negative value means the forecast quality is poorer than the climatology the bss values in this study will be calculated as a function of two less than 25th percentile and more than 75th percentile the next verification metric is crpss firstly for each forecast the difference between a cumulative ensemble forecast and an observational step function is determined which is subsequently averaged over all forecasts considered the calculation of crpss is defined as follows e g wilks 2006 3 c r p s f y f o y 2 d y where 4 f o y 0 y o b s e r v e d v a l u e 1 y o b s e r v e d v a l u e f y represents the forecast s cdf cumulative distribution function fo y is a stepwise cdf of the observed value score 0 is a perfect crps the formula above defined the crps calculation for a single case meanwhile for several cases in practice the crps is averaged wilks 2006 the crpss compares the crps of a rainfall forecast to the observed climatology as a reference forecast it measures reliability and resolution the corresponding crpss can be written as follows wilks 2006 5 c r p s s 1 c r p s c r p s r e f the range value of crpss is to 1 if the value 0 means that the forecast improves on the reference and vice versa it is worse than the reference if the value is 0 the crpsref is the crps of the reference i e climatology the relative operating characteristic roc curve is considered as a measure of the probabilistic and ensemble based forecast potential usefulness mason 1982 the roc measures the quality of probability forecasts that relates the hit rate to the corresponding false alarm rate kharin and zwiers 2003 to see the ability of the forecast in discriminating between events and non events mason 1982 mason and graham 2002 this score does not inform about reliability because this score is not sensitive to forecast bias the benefit of roc is it allows non calibrated have not been bias corrected forecasts to be compared anctil and ramos 2019 in the calculation the event was defined here as the streamflow less than 25th and streamflow exceeding the 75th percentile of the sample climatology using a probability threshold one has to decide whether a probabilistic forecast would be interpreted as an event forecast or event not forecast occurrence rocs comprises the auc of the main forecasting system normalized by the auc of the climatological forecast i e 0 5 the stationary block bootstrap politis and romano 1994 is applied in order to quantify the sampling uncertainties of the verification measurements adjacent pairs of blocks are randomly sampled from a number of available pairs and overlapping blocks are permitted the size of the block is 21 length of the series data 25 number of ensemble members the average length of each block is calculated by the sample data that is being autocorrelated this resampling action is repeated up to 1000 times to produce 1000 means for the bootstrap sample we compute the verification metrics from each sample for the probabilistic verification the forecast probability was calculated for each bootstraps sample the threshold that is measured for each sample is the discharge with a probability of more than 0 90 quantiles 5 results and discussion fig 5 shows the interannual variability and annual cycle of monthly mean discharge of simulated and ensemble streamflow forecasts for the citarum river basin for the period of 1989 2009 at four different lead times we find that the mean of the forecast ensemble member shows acceptable performance in simulating discharge data comparing the simulated discharge to forecast discharge time series we generally see that the temporal dynamics are covered reasonably well by the hydrological model comparison of the inter annual cycle of 1 month lead time lt1 to longer lead times lt2 lt4 shows that the forecast ensemble spread of 1 month lead time is narrower than other lead times as is expected the ensemble is more confident at shorter lead times in addition the annual cycle of streamflow cycles is also presented in fig 5 for 1 month lead time to 4 month lead time the monsoonal pattern is observable from the figure the annual cycle of monthly mean discharge from november to april wet season is between 50 250 m s and from may to september dry season is below 100 m s to nearly zero for lt1 the forecast follows closely the simulation data set the forecast still follows the simulation at the longer lead times but we can see that there are some periods of obvious over prediction such as january and march also at longer lead times we see a gap between simulation and forecast data in the dry season 5 1 verification results based on the aggregated forecast as described in the method section several verification metrics were used to determine the accuracy and the skill of the streamflow forecast this section analyzes the forecast s predictive power at the four different aggregation periods 30d 60d 90d and 120d identification of skillful temporal aggregations of forecast information is valuable to water supply managers mcinerney et al 2020 table 1 shows the value metrics that describe the accuracy of the forecast to the simulations for different aggregation days both deterministic and probabilistic verification measures correlation rmse and mae are measures of the deviations of the deterministic forecasts values from the values of the simulation the correlation coefficient varies considerably with the aggregation period with optimum values attained when data is aggregated to 30 to 60 days except august in terms of the correlation value mostly the error metrics reduce by the higher aggregation days from table 1 it shows the increase in the rmse as a function of time aggregation for all months july october in addition mae measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts however it does not consider their direction moreover from table 1 for all months the mae increases with the increasing aggregation days table 1 also shows the probabilistic or quantitative model checking values they are crpss and both the bss and rocs for the probability of streamflow less than 25th and more than 75th percentile from the scores streamflow at 30 to 60 days aggregation days is more skillful than larger aggregation in july supplementary figure 2 based on the rmse and mae the error is the lowest for a 30 day aggregation and increases with the increasing level of aggregation reaching the largest value for a 120 day aggregation in general the more aggregations the larger the error this is due to its seasonal variability this happens because when a value is aggregated over a longer time it will cause the number of seasons involved to have more varied rainfall to provide information tailored to the user s needs aggregation over longer longer than 30 days periods is needed bohn et al 2010 temporal aggregation of 30 days is typically used in seasonal forecasting services apel et al 2018 in addition probabilistic seasonal forecasts are essential for water intensive activities requiring long term planning table 1 also shows that even if the skill for the forecast period decreases when aggregating of the days is higher the forecasts mostly remain skillful crpss are mostly greater than 0 the bss value for the threshold more than the 75th percentile also shows the values are greater than zero in addition supplementary figure 2 also shows that the skill of the forecast when predicting the streamflow less than the 25th percentile decreases by the increasing number of aggregations even though the different values of bss are not significantly different for the 60 to 120 days aggregation meanwhile for the crpss the skill after the 30 days aggregation decreases and reaches around zero but then increases again for the higher aggregation days the streamflow forecast skill may be affected by the precipitation forecast skill the variability of the crpss values of seas5 bias corrected model forecast in the western part of java is probably because of its high rainfall variability that is linked to topography ratri et al 2019 the forecast model skill is expected to decay with the increase in lead time however this is not always the case in august supplementary figure 3 however if we look at the error both rmse and mae we can see there is a rate of increase of errors with lead time as expected the skill of the streamflow forecast is affected by the skill of rainfall forecast in indonesia the skill also depends on the region month and season and the distribution of land and sea aldrian et al 2007 in september supplementary figure 4 except for the bss and rocs with a threshold less than the 25th percentile the other metrics such as rmse mae corr crpss are almost as expected it shows that 30 to 60 days aggregation has higher performance this is also the same as in october supplementary figure 5 the validation metrics for october show that 30 to 60 days of aggregation have higher performance than higher aggregation days during september october streamflow variability in the citarum river basin is linked to the iod and enso variations the streamflow over this region and its link to climate has been analyzed by d arrigo et al 2011b 5 2 verification results based on the lead time forecasts the verification scores are also investigated based on the lead times fig 6 presents the crpss values of the streamflow forecast for lt1 to lt4 the figure shows that all forecasts for lt1 are skillful in addition in july and october all forecasts until lt4 are skillful while in august and september skill is lost in the second lead time for all months the median crpss values of lt1 and lt2 are higher than longer lead times shown by blue solid lines in fig 6 the crpss values up to about 0 5 for july september and october in the lt1 except for august the crpss values decrease by lead times in july and october most of the crpss values for all lead times are above zero however in august and september the crpps values for lt2 lt4 are below zero nyamekye et al 2021 mentioned that seasonal forecast information provided at an early lead time significantly informed farmer decision making compared to longer lead times forecasts of precipitation and streamflow are closely related to each other and it can potentially assist with planning of managed reservoir releases provided forecasts are sufficiently accurate at lead times necessary for management decisions turner et al 2017 nyamekye et al 2021 added that communicating forecast information at an appropriate lead time has the potential to help users especially farmers manage risks and improve decision making pappenberger et al 2015 mentioned that the crpss is one of the most recommended skill scores if we want to evaluate overall hydrological ensemble forecast performance fig 11 shows that for all the months the crpss values tend overall to decline with increasing lead time this is because the longer the lead times the weather uncertainties tend to grow and become more dominant siddique and mejia 2017 across all lead times the crpss values vary approximately from about 1 to 1 the median crpss showed by the solid line the crpss value at lt1 for all months has positive skill for lt2 the median of the crpss is still nearly 0 however for longer lead times especially for august and september the crpss have slightly negative skills even though in general there are decreasing crpss values by lead times there is a relatively narrow range of the lead times sharma et al 2019 found that after postprocessing is applied into a streamflow forecast skill looking at the crpss values the models have comparable skill across lead times generally as would be expected the mae increases slightly by increasing the lead times this indicates decreasing skill with increasing lead time fig 7 in all months the seas5 eqm bias corrected based streamflow forecasts are more skillful in early lt1 lt2 compared to longer lt3 lt4 lead times furthermore fig 7 shows the variability of mae among months and lead times looking at the accuracy error statistics like mae will allow us to see how large the bias and errors are the variability and median values of mae show agreement with the crpss values this indicates there are more variability and uncertainty as the streamflow forecast extends further in time meanwhile among those four months for october the majority of the grid cells have larger mae than other months for all lead times this is probably because october is generally wetter than the other months the performance of the forecasts is good for the shorter lead time but may become worse as the lead times increases this can be also observed in figs 8 and 9 which show that correlation rmse is generally high small for early lead times but increases decreases thereafter boxplots of bsss are shown in fig 10 in the wet months september and october better performance of streamflow ensembles is obtained for early lt both for threshold less than 25th percentile and more than the 75th percentile bss values vary significantly with lead time however in dry months july and august better scores are generally obtained when considering high discharge thresholds exceedances of the percentile q75 this is especially observed in the case of the hydrological models that do not make use of an updating procedure during forecasting the boxplot distributions of bss shown in fig 10 indicate positive values and therefore a better performance of the forecasting systems compared to the climatology except for august the better skill was shown in earlier lead times considering the growth of rice crops is between 90 120 days which is related to the early lead times the forecast information with the positive skill of bss is sufficient to adjust critical agricultural decisions to improve the efficiency of agricultural management and to ensure food and livelihood security forecast information with a sufficient lead time to adjust critical agricultural decisions is needed apipattanavis et al 2010 fig 11 shows the roc skill score as a function of forecast lead time the evaluation that is conducted in this study is also based on the roc skill score at a threshold less than the 25th percentile and more than the 75th percentile the no skill value for rocss is 0 so from fig 11 it is shown that especially in the wet months september and october for both thresholds the longer lead times are the less skillful meanwhile for the early lt there is no regular pattern of skill decreasing by lead times 6 conclusion and future works enhancing hydrological forecasting accuracy is still a challenging issue by applying the eqm bias correction approaches to ecmwf seas5 before generating the streamflow forecasts exploring four different aggregation days and four different lead times we find that the model skills reach the most efficient at 30 or 60 aggregation days meanwhile based on the different lead times the performances of lt1 and lt2 are better than other lead times bss indicates that the model approach is reasonable for early lead times as the skill score shows positive value this evaluation performance of the hydrological model is good and can help farmers to adjust critical agricultural decisions lt1 and lt2 of forecast information are more useful for agricultural rice practitioners than longer lead times as they relate to the rice plants cycle so far given information related to these issues is still lacking this methodology is now good enough to be used for advice to farmers this study especially in indonesia is a study that initiates using a hydrological model with inputs from a bias corrected seasonal rainfall forecast when forecasts are accurate then the information has the potential as a significant tool in water resource management alemu et al 2011 on the other hand unskilled forecasts can result in unwanted impacts to allocate resources and meet demands water resource managers and agricultural practitioners require streamflow predictions that are accurate and timely for example there will be unnecessary drought mitigation actions happen if the forecasts predict lower flows than actually occur conversely improper drought mitigation actions will be called for which could result in a drought if the forecasts predict higher flows than actually occur for now this paper only describes the performance skill and uncertainty of seas5 eqm bias corrected based streamflow prediction however the improved skill compared to climatology cannot be achieved for all forecast lead times in a future study we could look at post processing the streamflow forecast itself in addition a more advanced statistical postprocessing approach for the ensemble precipitation forecast is may be needed to further improve seasonal forecast skills so the performance of seas5 advanced statistical bias corrected based streamflow forecast skill can be studied adding climate indices e g dipole mode index dmi madden julian oscillation mjo indices sea surface temperature sst as potential predictors in the analysis for future study can be

7773,study region nine chinese major basins study focus to create a manually measured stream width dataset in the study region to investigate the applicability and the spatial variation of horton s stream width order relations where w ω a e b ω new hydrological insights for the region we analyzed about 10 000 width measurements made from google earth imagery over 2500 rivers in nine major basins of china the analysis suggests that 1 when these rivers are treated as a single branching network or nine individual networks stream order ω explains about at least 91 of the variation in average stream widths w ω at the significance level of p 0 01 2 while the ratios of average widths of streams with consecutive strahler orders i e e b tend to be centered at about 1 93 and vary in a narrow range of 1 50 2 36 the values of coefficient a vary up to ten folds 0 34 4 60 across basins 3 the long term average annual precipitation volume runoff volume and aridity explain about 77 82 and 66 of the cross basin variation of a at the significance level of p 0 01 respectively these results reveal that horton s law of stream width holds for but varies across river networks in china and this cross basin variability tends to be strongly associated with climate this study may provide insights into understanding the formation of river network and estimating stream widths over data lacking

provides an avenue to examine stream geometry quantitatively has been explored for numbers lengths and areas horton 1945 kirchner 1993 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 troutman et al 1994 yang and paik 2017 while that for widths remains relatively lacking this gap is partially due to the facts that width observations are often not readily available for most of the rivers on earth allen et al 2018 andreadis et al 2013 giachetta and willett 2018 nevertheless geomorphic relationships which typically relate stream width to discharge andreadis et al 2013 faustini et al 2009 or drainage area beighley and gummadi 2011 montgomery and gran 2001 wilkerson et al 2014 have been adopted in hydrologic or floodplain analyses following the same geomorphologic approach few works examine stream widths under the framework of horton relation in one such study reported by downing et al 2012 the stream width order relation which is interchangeably used as the horton s law of stream width in our work is expressed in the form of 1 w ω a e b ω where w ω m is the average width of the streams of strahler order ω and a and b are empirical coefficients similar to the definitions of bifurcation ratio r b length ratio r l and area ratio r a the width ratio r w is expressed as 2 r w w ω 1 w ω e b apparently the width ratio reflects only information about the exponent b and that about

similar frequency of flow allen and pavelsky 2015 chen et al 2020 yang et al 2020 remote sensing isikdogan et al 2017 may provide opportunities to explore the stream width order relations with larger sample sizes it is worth noting that remote sensing currently has difficulties in resolving small streams and rivers with widths narrower than 90 m allen and pavelsky 2018 yamazaki et al 2014 yang et

areas simply because the regression coefficient a in eq 1 may vary across regions additionally previous studies investigating the climate s watermark in stream density moglen et al 1998 wang and wu 2013 branching angles seybold et al 2017 longitudinal profiles chen et al 2019 and stream surface area butman and raymond 2011 imply that there could be spatial variation of horton laws it appears that more attention has been paid to the similarity of exponent b than to the variation of coefficient a of the horton s relation the relative lack of characterizing river width under the framework of horton s analysis motivates this study to explore the validity and spatial variation of width order relation in this work we used a large river data set created by the authors that cover nine major river basins of china with remarkable variation of physiographic conditions the objectives of this study are twofold one is to explore whether the horton width order relations hold for streams in individual major basins and for streams from all basins treated as a single branching network in china the other is to investigate whether these laws of stream width change across individual basins and if so to explore the controls of this spatial variation this study may provide insight into understanding the formation of river network and estimating stream widths over data lacking regions the following section describes the basins studied in china and the compilation of large stream width data set the next section then presents the stream width order relations as a single and basin wise branching river networks and explores the controls on the spatial variation of these laws of stream width the last two sections discuss and summarize the findings of this study 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this work explores the laws of stream width and their controls of nine major river basins in the mainland of china fig 1 among them seven are exorheic basins and the remaining two endothecia these basins are selected to represent the remarkable spatiotemporal variation in physiographic conditions including but not limited to precipitation potential evapotranspiration topography and geomorphologies table 1 the long term 30 years average annual precipitation amounts for the exorheic and endothecia river basins are in the ranges of 460 1579 mm and 125 153 mm respectively the mean annual runoff depths of these basins vary from 17 to 1037 mm to account for the potential impact of basin size the precipitation and runoff depths in mm were converted to volumes in 108 m3 by multiplying drainage areas for each basin and employed in our analyses the aridity indices ai of these basins which are calculated as the ratio of annual average depths of pan evaporation to precipitation range from as low as 1 0 in the perl river basin to as high as 19 3 in the tarim river basin the topographic and erodibility characteristics of a basin which may also impact the development of its drainage network are represented in this study by the elevation drop of the main channel and the average annual sediment yield respectively for the nine major river basins their elevation drops vary from 200 to 6600 m and their amounts of sediment yield range from 2 to 1050 million tons per year additionally these basins are the areas where most of the chinese population resides the climatic and runoff data for the river basins over the period from 1956 to 2000 were reported by ren and guo 2006 2 2 stream ordering and sampling stream width data set was obtained in two steps sampling and measuring based on the river networks of the hydrosheds hydrography dataset lehner and grill 2013 we sampled rivers uniformly in space according to their strahler orders fig 1 within each basin all the rivers with orders greater than five were sampled and 60 streams were randomly selected for each of the rest orders about 280 rivers were identified for width measurement in each basin 2 3 stream width measurement following the remote sensing approach chen et al 2020 isikdogan et al 2017 measurements of the wetted width of flowing water within sampled channels were carried out manually from google earth imagery three ten and five width measurements were made for streams with orders lower than three higher than five and in between respectively similarly to remote sensing based approach all the stream width measurements were made from images acquired during the months that rivers were approximately under the bankfull condition allen and pavelsky 2015 yang et al 2020 widths for about 80 of the 2500 sampled rivers were measured in the period from october to december and for most of the remaining rivers in non flood season i e not in the period from june to september when measuring stream widths reaches with lakes or reservoirs were avoided under this systematical sampling and measuring strategy a total of about 1100 width measurements were made for each of the nine basins for each sampled stream its width was determined as the mean of the individual measurements made along its watercourse we acknowledge the importance and difficulties of sampling the rivers and measuring their widths and tried our best to conduct the manual measurements as carefully as possible 2 4 stream width order relation analysis the stream width order relation analyses were carried out similarly to horton 1945 in semi log space the stream width of each individual river was plotted against their strahler order and their means by order were also superimposed by adopting the nonlinear fitting function i e nls of the programming language r we fitted eq 1 to the width order data pairs for all of 2500 rivers in china collectively and for about 280 rivers in each of the nine major basins individually coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the stream width order relations simple regressions were used to explore the influencing factors of cross basin variation of stream width order relations the values of coefficient a in eq 1 whose variation dominate the cross basin variation of the width order relations see section 3 2 were taken as dependent variables and regressed against explanatory variables 3 results in this section we present the laws of stream width in china as a whole and as individual major basins we first explore if the law of stream width holds in china when streams sampled from all basins are treated as a single branching river network we then examine if the laws of stream width apply in each basin and their variation finally we investigate the controls on the variation of stream width order relations 3 1 estimates of stream widths in china table 2 summarizes the stream width i e the wetted width of flowing water according to strahler order for each individual basin stream widths averaged by strahler order tend to increase with orders indicating that the law of stream width potentially holds the coefficients of variation presented in table 2 range from 0 1 to 1 0 and have a median value of 0 5 indicating that widths of streams of the same order within each basin vary considerably furthermore streams of the same order in drier basins i e tarim river basin and other inland river basins tend to be notably narrower than those in wetter basins i e yangtze river basin and yellow river basin for the rivers with strahler orders less than four in other inland river basins the channels are ephemeral or seasonal and therefore their widths were not measured because there are few of the highest order streams for each basin their average widths are somewhat less accurate and their coefficients of variation cannot be determined when compared to the global average presented by downing et al 2012 the widths of small streams strahler order 4 tend to be wider and those of the remaining larger rivers are narrower in china table 2 this might be because larger rivers in china are intensively regulated for agriculture and flood mitigation 3 2 the applicability of width order relation as a single branching river network fig 2 a illustrates that the average widths of streams in china appears to have empirical exponential relationship with strahler stream order all the rivers sampled from each major basin are treated as a single sample according to their stream order in fig 2 a although there is wide spread around the mean width of each stream order and the average widths for high order rivers are less reliable as the numbers of rivers of orders eight and nine are ten and two respectively fig 2 a indicates that the average stream width w ω generally increases exponentially with strahler stream order ω the law of stream width for chinese river is fitted as 3 w ω 1 00 e 0 76 ω stream order explains about 97 of the variation in average stream widths at the significance level of p 0 0001 indicating that strahler order is a good predictor for order averaged stream width the measured average width of the first order streams is 2 32 m and the predicted width by eq 3 is 2 13 m interestingly when both treating all of the rivers investigated as a single branching network the exponent b estimated for china 0 76 is similar to the value 0 82 determined by downing et al 2012 also it is worth noting that the fitted values of coefficient a for china is unity and that for the global is 0 54 these imply that while the width ratio i e e b tends to be relatively constant the coefficient a appears to be more variable across basins 3 3 the applicability of width order relation as nine individual river networks the law of stream width tends to apply in each of the nine investigated major basins fig 2 b c and table 3 in china fig 2 b shows the exponential increase of average width of rivers in the perl river basin with strahler stream order stream order explains about 99 of the variation in average widths of rivers at the significance level of p 0 0001 indicating a strong width order relation in the perl river basin apparently for each stream order the variation of stream width in the perl river basin fig 2 b is smaller than that in china as shown in fig 2 a the fitting lines of the width order relations for the nine major basins are shown in fig 2 c and their fitted parameters are listed in table 2 the high values of coefficient of determination r2 0 91 and the statistical significance tests p 0 01 imply good width order relations across individual basins the width ratio table 3 which is the ratio of the average width of streams in a given order to that in the next lower order ranges from 1 50 to 2 36 across the nine major basins of china and with a median value of 1 93 in contrast the values of a vary in about one order of magnitude across these basins the relative constant values of b and the large variability in a imply that whereas horton s law of stream width apply it could vary notably across basins 3 4 impact factors of the law of stream widths although the law of stream widths applies for each of the individual basin the coefficients of these relations show notable variation across basins the width order fitting lines for different basins are relatively parallel to each other and exhibit vertical shifts indicating that the slope of the width order relation remains fairly constant across the nine basins fig 2 c and table 3 the vertical shifts imply that for each of the same strahler order streams and rivers from one basin can be consistently wider or narrower than those from other basins for example though the slopes of the width order relation are similar the rivers and streams of the same order in the yangtze river basin are about four times wider than those in the yellow river basin we explore the influencing factors of cross basin variation of the law of stream widths by examining the degree of vertical shift i e coefficient a under fixed b since the values of slope b are relatively uniform the differences in the values of coefficient a i e the vertical shift dominate this cross basin variation of the law of stream widths for this reason we fixed the slope and determined the coefficient a for each basin by minimizing the root mean squared error for a linear regression the slope b is fixed at 0 66 i e the median value of b fitted for the nine individual basins for all basins the larger the value of coefficient a the wider the rivers and streams in a basin when stream orders are the same the similar goodness of fit for variable b the fifth and sixth columns and fixed b the ninth and tenth columns regressions shown in table 3 indicates that applying a fixed b value does not worsen the width order relation fitting much we also plotted the predicted average width of each order against the measured average width to check the performance of the fix b model for each basin the points in the scatter plots are generally located along the 1 1 line indicating a regression slope close to unity and an intercept statistically not different from zero not shown here for brevity these allow for further assessment of intercept values against geophysical conditions of basins a clear trend emerges in fig 2 c that the magnitude of vertical shift in the humid bluish lines southern china tends to be larger than those in the more arid yellowish lines northern china as can be seen in fig 2 c curves on the top are for the yangtze perl and huai river basins with humid climate those at the bottom are for the other inland and tarim river basins with arid climate and in between are the songhua liao hai and yellow river basins with intermediate aridity this sequential downward shift of the width order curves from the wet to the dry basins suggests that the magnitude of vertical shift may be associated with climatic conditions we quantified the climatic conditions of each basin using the long term 1956 2000 average annual precipitation volume runoff volume and aridity index the aridity index in this work is defined as the ratio of long term average annual pan evaporation to precipitation the smaller the aridity index the more humid the basin fig 3 shows a strong statistical association between the magnitude of vertical shift and climate we conducted power law regressions of coefficient a against average annual precipitation volume runoff volume and aridity data from all the nine basins fig 3 as expected while coefficient a increases with annual precipitation volume and runoff volume it decreases with aridity interestingly as evidenced by the largest value of r2 and smallest mean squared error mse the association between coefficient a and precipitation and runoff volume is stronger than that between a and aridity these notable goodness of fit quantitatively confirms the strong association as shown fig 2 c between climatic conditions and the spatial variation of horton s law of stream width we acknowledge that the spread around the fitted curves indicates that other factors except for climatic conditions also regulate the value of coefficient a while exploring other factors e g vegetation cover is beyond the scope of the current study nevertheless by combining eq 1 with the fitted equation shown in fig 3 b we present the empirical width order relation 3 w 0 11 q 0 41 e 0 66 ω where w m is the average width for rivers of strahler order ω and q 108 m3 is the long term average annual runoff volume for a basin depending on the data availability the equations in fig 3 a and c can be combined with eq 1 to obtain empirical relations similar to eq 3 these empirical relations may provide simple equations to estimate stream and river widths for the regions where appropriate measurement data is not available similar to the analyses of climatic variables we find that the long term sediment yield can explain about 66 p 0 01 the yellow river excluded of the variation in coefficient a while the elevation drop of the main channel is statistically unassociated with a r 2 0 01 p 0 84 however if the yellow river were included in the analysis the r 2 drops to 0 15 and p 0 31 indicating there is no statistically significant association between sediment yield and the variation of width order relation overall it seems that the cross basin variation of stream width order relation is more strongly associated with climate than with topography and soil erodibility 4 discussion 4 1 the applicability of the horton width order relation due to relative ease of measuring the planform geometries including stream number length and drainage area have been widely demonstrated to obey horton s law horton 1945 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 troutman et al 1994 yang and paik 2017 whereas whether stream width as another important geometric variable follows horton s law has only been investigated with limited regional or small data set the results presented in section 3 2 figs 2 and 3 3 table 3 which were obtained based on more than 10 000 width measurements made over 2500 rivers table 2 suggest that horton s law of stream width i e the width order relation tends to hold for the major river basins investigated in china these basins drain areas greater than 200 000 km2 receive mean annual precipitation varying from 100 mm to 1500 mm and have aridity index ranging from about 1 20 observations drawn from these non nested huge branching river networks developed under wide range of climatic vegetative and topographic conditions in contiguous china are consistent with those made from relatively smaller data sets e g downing et al 2012 gupta and mesa 2014 leopold and miller 1956 though a more comprehensive investigation our work provides a further indication that in addition to horton s law for stream numbers lengths and areas e g kirchner 1993 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 troutman et al 1994 horton s law of stream width might be general with the advancement of techniques for measuring river widths more frequently both in space and time chen et al 2020 isikdogan et al 2017 yang et al 2020 the applicability of width order relation could be further investigated 4 2 spatial variation of the horton width order relation while it is widely known that horton s ratios of stream number length and drainage area represented by the scaling exponents all tend to be relatively constant little attention has been paid to the notable cross basin variation of horton law the horton width ratio r w shown in table 3 ranges from 1 50 2 36 and has a median value of 1 93 by analyzing the data presented in published research the range of width ratios found in this study appears to be consistent with the r w values of 1 61 in ashley river basin gupta and mesa 2014 2 05 in the raystown branch of the susquehanna river barila et al 1981 2 28 for the world downing et al 2012 and 2 0 0 32 for drainage networks of worldwide coastal segmentation and related catchment raymond et al 2013 the lower bound of horton width ratio were reported to be1 34 for the south fork running through a highly forested watershed in central idaho platts 1979 and 1 25 for the supraglacial river networks on the southwest greenland ice sheet yang et al 2016 these data together suggest that similar to the horton ratios of river numbers lengths and areas kirchner 1993 yang and paik 2017 the width ratio also tends to vary in relatively narrow ranges across river networks developed under various physiographic conditions however the regression coefficient a shown in fig 2 c and table 3 vary by several times and even up to one order of magnitude between basins this variation can also be seen from the remarkable underestimation or overestimation of the average widths for rivers with the same order from different basins if the overall equation of china fig 2 a a 1 00 b 0 76 is used for prediction for example the predicted average width of order 5 streams using the overall equation in china is 44 7 m while the measured averages for the yangtze and yellow river basins are 107 6 m and 22 3 m respectively in summary although the width ratio tends to be relatively constant the horton width order relation can vary remarkably across basins originating from the variability in coefficient a 4 3 association between regional variation of width order relation and climate what are the possible sources of this high cross basin variability of the horton s width order relation with a fixed exponent b for all basins our investigation presented in section 3 4 shows that the cross basin discrepancy of horton s law of stream width i e the variation of coefficient a tends to be notably associated with climate on the one hand our analysis found that basin wise annual average precipitation depth in mm can explain about 58 of the variation of coefficient a for simplicity not shown herein at the significance level of p 0 01 which is similar to the findings that annual average precipitation depth plays roles in shaping the drainage density moglen et al 1998 and percentage of the stream surface area butman and raymond 2011 of basins on the other hand our data revealed that basin wise annual average runoff depth in mm explained about 65 of the variation of a not shown herein which is consistent with the reported strong association between baseflow and perennial stream density wang and wu 2013 interestingly replacing the long term average depth of average annual precipitation fig 3 a and runoff fig 3 b with their volumes in 108 m3 can explain about 20 more 77 and 82 for precipitation and runoff volumes respectively of this cross basin variation of coefficient a implying drainage area tends to be another important control of horton s law of stream width also our results show that climate aridity can explain 66 of the cross basin variation of coefficient a fig 3 c which is in line with the finding that climate aridity appears to regulate the mean branching angle seybold et al 2017 and longitudinal profiles chen et al 2019 of river networks in all the association between cross basin variation of width order relation and climate revealed in this study provides an additional evidence that climate tends to be an important control for the development of natural drainage network 4 4 implication and limitation of this study horton s laws which quantitatively describe the geometric relationships between stream properties and stream order have served as one of the most important tools for investigating the interaction between geomorphology and catchment scale drainage function in the history of hydrology e g gupta et al 2015 horton 1945 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 rodríguez iturbe et al 1979 along this avenue the stream width order relations and their variation found in this study across major basins in contiguous china have several implications the wide physiographic conditions of these basins suggest that horton s law of stream width may hold for natural drainage networks while recognizing the remarkable similarity of river networks as quantified by horton laws one should also acknowledge their cross basin variation on the one hand at the large basin scale 200 000 km2 this study found that notable portion of the cross basin variation of the average width order relation could be best explained by the long term average annual runoff volume on the other hand at the river reach scale there is rich literature reporting that at a site average channel width seems to adjust to flood magnitude and duration e g andreadis et al 2013 grams et al 2020 leopold and miller 1956 more detailed and sophisticated investigations are needed to bridge the understanding of controls of channel widths at the spatial scales of river network versus river reach and the temporal scales of short duration flood against long term average flows additionally the observed empirical stream width order relations and association between their coefficients and climate variables may shed light on estimating river widths for data sparse region andreadis et al 2013 beighley and gummadi 2011 giachetta and willett 2018 yamazaki et al 2014 we recognize that stream widths vary across flow conditions river reach stream order and basins our stream width data were manually measured from high resolution googleearth images approximately taken during mean flow conditions and therefore we share the same challenge of all remote sensing based methods for measuring stream width allen and pavelsky 2015 chen et al 2020 isikdogan et al 2017 yang et al 2020 stream width vary with time furthermore the within basin variation of stream width due to differences of climate vegetation condition bedrock properties sediment transport and flow regulations by human are not considered in this study 5 conclusion by creating a manually measured stream width data set across nine major river basins in the mainland of china with remarkable spatiotemporal variation in physiographic conditions we investigated the applicability the spatial variation and the control of horton s stream width order relations where w ω a e b ω specifically we found that 1 we created a data set of 10 000 width measurements manually and carefully made from google earth imagery over 2500 rivers in nine major basins of china it could be used to validate river widths estimated via other approaches including but not limited to remote sensing techniques and hydrological or hydraulic relations 2 horton s law of stream width holds for the rivers sampled when they are treated as a single branching network r2 0 98 p 0 01 or nine individual networks r2 0 91 p 0 01 while the horton s width ratios across basins tend to center at about 1 93 and range narrowly in 1 50 2 36 the values of coefficient a vary up to ten folds indicating that the cross basin variation of horton s law of stream width is characterized by the heterogeneity of a 3 the cross basin variation of a could be largely associated with the long term average annual precipitation volume runoff volume and aridity at the significance level of p 0 01 respectively the empirical width order relation based on the sampled rivers for china is w ω 0 11 q 0 41 e 0 66 ω r2 0 82 p 0 01 similar empirical relations fitted in this study see section 3 4 may provide simple equations to estimate stream and river widths for the regions where appropriate measurement data is not available in conclusion our work reveals that horton s law of stream width holds for but varies remarkably across river networks in china and this spatial variability tends to be strongly associated with climate this study may provide insights into understanding the formation of river network and

7773,study region nine chinese major basins study focus to create a manually measured stream width dataset in the study region to investigate the applicability and the spatial variation of horton s stream width order relations where w ω a e b ω new hydrological insights for the region we analyzed about 10 000 width measurements made from google earth imagery over 2500 rivers in nine major basins of china the analysis suggests that 1 when these rivers are treated as a single branching network or nine individual networks stream order ω explains about at least 91 of the variation in average stream widths w ω at the significance level of p 0 01 2 while the ratios of average widths of streams with consecutive strahler orders i e e b tend to be centered at about 1 93 and vary in a narrow range of 1 50 2 36 the values of coefficient a vary up to ten folds 0 34 4 60 across basins 3 the long term average annual precipitation volume runoff volume and aridity explain about 77 82 and 66 of the cross basin variation of a at the significance level of p 0 01 respectively these results reveal that horton s law of stream width holds for but varies across river networks in china and this cross basin variability tends to be strongly associated with climate this study may provide insights into understanding the formation of river network and estimating stream widths over data lacking regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords stream width china width order relation river network climate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the striking structural similarity of river networks has been recognized to play an important role in shaping the hydrologic responses to rainfall e g biswal and marani 2010 chen and krajewski 2015 quintero et al 2020 rodríguez iturbe et al 1979 and the related bio chemical processes e g aufdenkampe et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 this self similar geometry of river networks has been notionally depicted by the horton s laws which was first reported about 80 years ago horton 1945 horton s laws have been widely studied with respect to stream numbers lengths and drainage areas e g dodds and rothman 1999 downing et al 2012 kim 2022 kirchner 1993 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 leopold et al 1964 troutman et al 1994 and recently extended to stream flows gupta et al 2015 investigating stream width as one of the important planform geometries of river networks under the framework of horton s law may provide additional insight into understanding the development and functioning of river networks horton relationship which provides an avenue to examine stream geometry quantitatively has been explored for numbers lengths and areas horton 1945 kirchner 1993 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 troutman et al 1994 yang and paik 2017 while that for widths remains relatively lacking this gap is partially due to the facts that width observations are often not readily available for most of the rivers on earth allen et al 2018 andreadis et al 2013 giachetta and willett 2018 nevertheless geomorphic relationships which typically relate stream width to discharge andreadis et al 2013 faustini et al 2009 or drainage area beighley and gummadi 2011 montgomery and gran 2001 wilkerson et al 2014 have been adopted in hydrologic or floodplain analyses following the same geomorphologic approach few works examine stream widths under the framework of horton relation in one such study reported by downing et al 2012 the stream width order relation which is interchangeably used as the horton s law of stream width in our work is expressed in the form of 1 w ω a e b ω where w ω m is the average width of the streams of strahler order ω and a and b are empirical coefficients similar to the definitions of bifurcation ratio r b length ratio r l and area ratio r a the width ratio r w is expressed as 2 r w w ω 1 w ω e b apparently the width ratio reflects only information about the exponent b and that about coefficient a is absent with the data available downing et al 2012 treated the world s streams as a single branching river network and reported the law of stream width a 0 542 b 0 824 r 2 0 80 p 0 0001 based on 418 pairs of width order data over the global with the potential capability of collecting data covering a wider spectral of stream widths under the condition that all streams are at the similar frequency of flow allen and pavelsky 2015 chen et al 2020 yang et al 2020 remote sensing isikdogan et al 2017 may provide opportunities to explore the stream width order relations with larger sample sizes it is worth noting that remote sensing currently has difficulties in resolving small streams and rivers with widths narrower than 90 m allen and pavelsky 2018 yamazaki et al 2014 yang et al 2020 which are most abundant in nature while it is known that river networks across regions tend to have relatively constant horton s ratios e g e b in eq 2 the notable cross basin variation of horton law due to variability in coefficient a and its controls have been overlooked investigations of river networks from regions with various climate geology and other geophysical conditions reveal that 1 horton s law of stream numbers lengths and drainage areas generally hold horton 1945 kirchner 1993 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 troutman et al 1994 and 2 the horton ratios of bifurcation length and area tend to be remarkably constant with r b r l and r a ranging within 3 5 1 5 3 and 3 6 respectively yang and paik 2017 these discoveries have advanced our understanding of fluvial geomorphology landscape evolution and hydrologic processes gupta et al 2015 yang and paik 2017 the fairly constant horton ratios do not mean rivers of the same order across regions have the same numbers lengths or areas simply because the regression coefficient a in eq 1 may vary across regions additionally previous studies investigating the climate s watermark in stream density moglen et al 1998 wang and wu 2013 branching angles seybold et al 2017 longitudinal profiles chen et al 2019 and stream surface area butman and raymond 2011 imply that there could be spatial variation of horton laws it appears that more attention has been paid to the similarity of exponent b than to the variation of coefficient a of the horton s relation the relative lack of characterizing river width under the framework of horton s analysis motivates this study to explore the validity and spatial variation of width order relation in this work we used a large river data set created by the authors that cover nine major river basins of china with remarkable variation of physiographic conditions the objectives of this study are twofold one is to explore whether the horton width order relations hold for streams in individual major basins and for streams from all basins treated as a single branching network in china the other is to investigate whether these laws of stream width change across individual basins and if so to explore the controls of this spatial variation this study may provide insight into understanding the formation of river network and estimating stream widths over data lacking regions the following section describes the basins studied in china and the compilation of large stream width data set the next section then presents the stream width order relations as a single and basin wise branching river networks and explores the controls on the spatial variation of these laws of stream width the last two sections discuss and summarize the findings of this study 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this work explores the laws of stream width and their controls of nine major river basins in the mainland of china fig 1 among them seven are exorheic basins and the remaining two endothecia these basins are selected to represent the remarkable spatiotemporal variation in physiographic conditions including but not limited to precipitation potential evapotranspiration topography and geomorphologies table 1 the long term 30 years average annual precipitation amounts for the exorheic and endothecia river basins are in the ranges of 460 1579 mm and 125 153 mm respectively the mean annual runoff depths of these basins vary from 17 to 1037 mm to account for the potential impact of basin size the precipitation and runoff depths in mm were converted to volumes in 108 m3 by multiplying drainage areas for each basin and employed in our analyses the aridity indices ai of these basins which are calculated as the ratio of annual average depths of pan evaporation to precipitation range from as low as 1 0 in the perl river basin to as high as 19 3 in the tarim river basin the topographic and erodibility characteristics of a basin which may also impact the development of its drainage network are represented in this study by the elevation drop of the main channel and the average annual sediment yield respectively for the nine major river basins their elevation drops vary from 200 to 6600 m and their amounts of sediment yield range from 2 to 1050 million tons per year additionally these basins are the areas where most of the chinese population resides the climatic and runoff data for the river basins over the period from 1956 to 2000 were reported by ren and guo 2006 2 2 stream ordering and sampling stream width data set was obtained in two steps sampling and measuring based on the river networks of the hydrosheds hydrography dataset lehner and grill 2013 we sampled rivers uniformly in space according to their strahler orders fig 1 within each basin all the rivers with orders greater than five were sampled and 60 streams were randomly selected for each of the rest orders about 280 rivers were identified for width measurement in each basin 2 3 stream width measurement following the remote sensing approach chen et al 2020 isikdogan et al 2017 measurements of the wetted width of flowing water within sampled channels were carried out manually from google earth imagery three ten and five width measurements were made for streams with orders lower than three higher than five and in between respectively similarly to remote sensing based approach all the stream width measurements were made from images acquired during the months that rivers were approximately under the bankfull condition allen and pavelsky 2015 yang et al 2020 widths for about 80 of the 2500 sampled rivers were measured in the period from october to december and for most of the remaining rivers in non flood season i e not in the period from june to september when measuring stream widths reaches with lakes or reservoirs were avoided under this systematical sampling and measuring strategy a total of about 1100 width measurements were made for each of the nine basins for each sampled stream its width was determined as the mean of the individual measurements made along its watercourse we acknowledge the importance and difficulties of sampling the rivers and measuring their widths and tried our best to conduct the manual measurements as carefully as possible 2 4 stream width order relation analysis the stream width order relation analyses were carried out similarly to horton 1945 in semi log space the stream width of each individual river was plotted against their strahler order and their means by order were also superimposed by adopting the nonlinear fitting function i e nls of the programming language r we fitted eq 1 to the width order data pairs for all of 2500 rivers in china collectively and for about 280 rivers in each of the nine major basins individually coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the stream width order relations simple regressions were used to explore the influencing factors of cross basin variation of stream width order relations the values of coefficient a in eq 1 whose variation dominate the cross basin variation of the width order relations see section 3 2 were taken as dependent variables and regressed against explanatory variables 3 results in this section we present the laws of stream width in china as a whole and as individual major basins we first explore if the law of stream width holds in china when streams sampled from all basins are treated as a single branching river network we then examine if the laws of stream width apply in each basin and their variation finally we investigate the controls on the variation of stream width order relations 3 1 estimates of stream widths in china table 2 summarizes the stream width i e the wetted width of flowing water according to strahler order for each individual basin stream widths averaged by strahler order tend to increase with orders indicating that the law of stream width potentially holds the coefficients of variation presented in table 2 range from 0 1 to 1 0 and have a median value of 0 5 indicating that widths of streams of the same order within each basin vary considerably furthermore streams of the same order in drier basins i e tarim river basin and other inland river basins tend to be notably narrower than those in wetter basins i e yangtze river basin and yellow river basin for the rivers with strahler orders less than four in other inland river basins the channels are ephemeral or seasonal and therefore their widths were not measured because there are few of the highest order streams for each basin their average widths are somewhat less accurate and their coefficients of variation cannot be determined when compared to the global average presented by downing et al 2012 the widths of small streams strahler order 4 tend to be wider and those of the remaining larger rivers are narrower in china table 2 this might be because larger rivers in china are intensively regulated for agriculture and flood mitigation 3 2 the applicability of width order relation as a single branching river network fig 2 a illustrates that the average widths of streams in china appears to have empirical exponential relationship with strahler stream order all the rivers sampled from each major basin are treated as a single sample according to their stream order in fig 2 a although there is wide spread around the mean width of each stream order and the average widths for high order rivers are less reliable as the numbers of rivers of orders eight and nine are ten and two respectively fig 2 a indicates that the average stream width w ω generally increases exponentially with strahler stream order ω the law of stream width for chinese river is fitted as 3 w ω 1 00 e 0 76 ω stream order explains about 97 of the variation in average stream widths at the significance level of p 0 0001 indicating that strahler order is a good predictor for order averaged stream width the measured average width of the first order streams is 2 32 m and the predicted width by eq 3 is 2 13 m interestingly when both treating all of the rivers investigated as a single branching network the exponent b estimated for china 0 76 is similar to the value 0 82 determined by downing et al 2012 also it is worth noting that the fitted values of coefficient a for china is unity and that for the global is 0 54 these imply that while the width ratio i e e b tends to be relatively constant the coefficient a appears to be more variable across basins 3 3 the applicability of width order relation as nine individual river networks the law of stream width tends to apply in each of the nine investigated major basins fig 2 b c and table 3 in china fig 2 b shows the exponential increase of average width of rivers in the perl river basin with strahler stream order stream order explains about 99 of the variation in average widths of rivers at the significance level of p 0 0001 indicating a strong width order relation in the perl river basin apparently for each stream order the variation of stream width in the perl river basin fig 2 b is smaller than that in china as shown in fig 2 a the fitting lines of the width order relations for the nine major basins are shown in fig 2 c and their fitted parameters are listed in table 2 the high values of coefficient of determination r2 0 91 and the statistical significance tests p 0 01 imply good width order relations across individual basins the width ratio table 3 which is the ratio of the average width of streams in a given order to that in the next lower order ranges from 1 50 to 2 36 across the nine major basins of china and with a median value of 1 93 in contrast the values of a vary in about one order of magnitude across these basins the relative constant values of b and the large variability in a imply that whereas horton s law of stream width apply it could vary notably across basins 3 4 impact factors of the law of stream widths although the law of stream widths applies for each of the individual basin the coefficients of these relations show notable variation across basins the width order fitting lines for different basins are relatively parallel to each other and exhibit vertical shifts indicating that the slope of the width order relation remains fairly constant across the nine basins fig 2 c and table 3 the vertical shifts imply that for each of the same strahler order streams and rivers from one basin can be consistently wider or narrower than those from other basins for example though the slopes of the width order relation are similar the rivers and streams of the same order in the yangtze river basin are about four times wider than those in the yellow river basin we explore the influencing factors of cross basin variation of the law of stream widths by examining the degree of vertical shift i e coefficient a under fixed b since the values of slope b are relatively uniform the differences in the values of coefficient a i e the vertical shift dominate this cross basin variation of the law of stream widths for this reason we fixed the slope and determined the coefficient a for each basin by minimizing the root mean squared error for a linear regression the slope b is fixed at 0 66 i e the median value of b fitted for the nine individual basins for all basins the larger the value of coefficient a the wider the rivers and streams in a basin when stream orders are the same the similar goodness of fit for variable b the fifth and sixth columns and fixed b the ninth and tenth columns regressions shown in table 3 indicates that applying a fixed b value does not worsen the width order relation fitting much we also plotted the predicted average width of each order against the measured average width to check the performance of the fix b model for each basin the points in the scatter plots are generally located along the 1 1 line indicating a regression slope close to unity and an intercept statistically not different from zero not shown here for brevity these allow for further assessment of intercept values against geophysical conditions of basins a clear trend emerges in fig 2 c that the magnitude of vertical shift in the humid bluish lines southern china tends to be larger than those in the more arid yellowish lines northern china as can be seen in fig 2 c curves on the top are for the yangtze perl and huai river basins with humid climate those at the bottom are for the other inland and tarim river basins with arid climate and in between are the songhua liao hai and yellow river basins with intermediate aridity this sequential downward shift of the width order curves from the wet to the dry basins suggests that the magnitude of vertical shift may be associated with climatic conditions we quantified the climatic conditions of each basin using the long term 1956 2000 average annual precipitation volume runoff volume and aridity index the aridity index in this work is defined as the ratio of long term average annual pan evaporation to precipitation the smaller the aridity index the more humid the basin fig 3 shows a strong statistical association between the magnitude of vertical shift and climate we conducted power law regressions of coefficient a against average annual precipitation volume runoff volume and aridity data from all the nine basins fig 3 as expected while coefficient a increases with annual precipitation volume and runoff volume it decreases with aridity interestingly as evidenced by the largest value of r2 and smallest mean squared error mse the association between coefficient a and precipitation and runoff volume is stronger than that between a and aridity these notable goodness of fit quantitatively confirms the strong association as shown fig 2 c between climatic conditions and the spatial variation of horton s law of stream width we acknowledge that the spread around the fitted curves indicates that other factors except for climatic conditions also regulate the value of coefficient a while exploring other factors e g vegetation cover is beyond the scope of the current study nevertheless by combining eq 1 with the fitted equation shown in fig 3 b we present the empirical width order relation 3 w 0 11 q 0 41 e 0 66 ω where w m is the average width for rivers of strahler order ω and q 108 m3 is the long term average annual runoff volume for a basin depending on the data availability the equations in fig 3 a and c can be combined with eq 1 to obtain empirical relations similar to eq 3 these empirical relations may provide simple equations to estimate stream and river widths for the regions where appropriate measurement data is not available similar to the analyses of climatic variables we find that the long term sediment yield can explain about 66 p 0 01 the yellow river excluded of the variation in coefficient a while the elevation drop of the main channel is statistically unassociated with a r 2 0 01 p 0 84 however if the yellow river were included in the analysis the r 2 drops to 0 15 and p 0 31 indicating there is no statistically significant association between sediment yield and the variation of width order relation overall it seems that the cross basin variation of stream width order relation is more strongly associated with climate than with topography and soil erodibility 4 discussion 4 1 the applicability of the horton width order relation due to relative ease of measuring the planform geometries including stream number length and drainage area have been widely demonstrated to obey horton s law horton 1945 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 troutman et al 1994 yang and paik 2017 whereas whether stream width as another important geometric variable follows horton s law has only been investigated with limited regional or small data set the results presented in section 3 2 figs 2 and 3 3 table 3 which were obtained based on more than 10 000 width measurements made over 2500 rivers table 2 suggest that horton s law of stream width i e the width order relation tends to hold for the major river basins investigated in china these basins drain areas greater than 200 000 km2 receive mean annual precipitation varying from 100 mm to 1500 mm and have aridity index ranging from about 1 20 observations drawn from these non nested huge branching river networks developed under wide range of climatic vegetative and topographic conditions in contiguous china are consistent with those made from relatively smaller data sets e g downing et al 2012 gupta and mesa 2014 leopold and miller 1956 though a more comprehensive investigation our work provides a further indication that in addition to horton s law for stream numbers lengths and areas e g kirchner 1993 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 troutman et al 1994 horton s law of stream width might be general with the advancement of techniques for measuring river widths more frequently both in space and time chen et al 2020 isikdogan et al 2017 yang et al 2020 the applicability of width order relation could be further investigated 4 2 spatial variation of the horton width order relation while it is widely known that horton s ratios of stream number length and drainage area represented by the scaling exponents all tend to be relatively constant little attention has been paid to the notable cross basin variation of horton law the horton width ratio r w shown in table 3 ranges from 1 50 2 36 and has a median value of 1 93 by analyzing the data presented in published research the range of width ratios found in this study appears to be consistent with the r w values of 1 61 in ashley river basin gupta and mesa 2014 2 05 in the raystown branch of the susquehanna river barila et al 1981 2 28 for the world downing et al 2012 and 2 0 0 32 for drainage networks of worldwide coastal segmentation and related catchment raymond et al 2013 the lower bound of horton width ratio were reported to be1 34 for the south fork running through a highly forested watershed in central idaho platts 1979 and 1 25 for the supraglacial river networks on the southwest greenland ice sheet yang et al 2016 these data together suggest that similar to the horton ratios of river numbers lengths and areas kirchner 1993 yang and paik 2017 the width ratio also tends to vary in relatively narrow ranges across river networks developed under various physiographic conditions however the regression coefficient a shown in fig 2 c and table 3 vary by several times and even up to one order of magnitude between basins this variation can also be seen from the remarkable underestimation or overestimation of the average widths for rivers with the same order from different basins if the overall equation of china fig 2 a a 1 00 b 0 76 is used for prediction for example the predicted average width of order 5 streams using the overall equation in china is 44 7 m while the measured averages for the yangtze and yellow river basins are 107 6 m and 22 3 m respectively in summary although the width ratio tends to be relatively constant the horton width order relation can vary remarkably across basins originating from the variability in coefficient a 4 3 association between regional variation of width order relation and climate what are the possible sources of this high cross basin variability of the horton s width order relation with a fixed exponent b for all basins our investigation presented in section 3 4 shows that the cross basin discrepancy of horton s law of stream width i e the variation of coefficient a tends to be notably associated with climate on the one hand our analysis found that basin wise annual average precipitation depth in mm can explain about 58 of the variation of coefficient a for simplicity not shown herein at the significance level of p 0 01 which is similar to the findings that annual average precipitation depth plays roles in shaping the drainage density moglen et al 1998 and percentage of the stream surface area butman and raymond 2011 of basins on the other hand our data revealed that basin wise annual average runoff depth in mm explained about 65 of the variation of a not shown herein which is consistent with the reported strong association between baseflow and perennial stream density wang and wu 2013 interestingly replacing the long term average depth of average annual precipitation fig 3 a and runoff fig 3 b with their volumes in 108 m3 can explain about 20 more 77 and 82 for precipitation and runoff volumes respectively of this cross basin variation of coefficient a implying drainage area tends to be another important control of horton s law of stream width also our results show that climate aridity can explain 66 of the cross basin variation of coefficient a fig 3 c which is in line with the finding that climate aridity appears to regulate the mean branching angle seybold et al 2017 and longitudinal profiles chen et al 2019 of river networks in all the association between cross basin variation of width order relation and climate revealed in this study provides an additional evidence that climate tends to be an important control for the development of natural drainage network 4 4 implication and limitation of this study horton s laws which quantitatively describe the geometric relationships between stream properties and stream order have served as one of the most important tools for investigating the interaction between geomorphology and catchment scale drainage function in the history of hydrology e g gupta et al 2015 horton 1945 kovchegov and zaliapin 2020 rodríguez iturbe et al 1979 along this avenue the stream width order relations and their variation found in this study across major basins in contiguous china have several implications the wide physiographic conditions of these basins suggest that horton s law of stream width may hold for natural drainage networks while recognizing the remarkable similarity of river networks as quantified by horton laws one should also acknowledge their cross basin variation on the one hand at the large basin scale 200 000 km2 this study found that notable portion of the cross basin variation of the average width order relation could be best explained by the long term average annual runoff volume on the other hand at the river reach scale there is rich literature reporting that at a site average channel width seems to adjust to flood magnitude and duration e g andreadis et al 2013 grams et al 2020 leopold and miller 1956 more detailed and sophisticated investigations are needed to bridge the understanding of controls of channel widths at the spatial scales of river network versus river reach and the temporal scales of short duration flood against long term average flows additionally the observed empirical stream width order relations and association between their coefficients and climate variables may shed light on estimating river widths for data sparse region andreadis et al 2013 beighley and gummadi 2011 giachetta and willett 2018 yamazaki et al 2014 we recognize that stream widths vary across flow conditions river reach stream order and basins our stream width data were manually measured from high resolution googleearth images approximately taken during mean flow conditions and therefore we share the same challenge of all remote sensing based methods for measuring stream width allen and pavelsky 2015 chen et al 2020 isikdogan et al 2017 yang et al 2020 stream width vary with time furthermore the within basin variation of stream width due to differences of climate vegetation condition bedrock properties sediment transport and flow regulations by human are not considered in this study 5 conclusion by creating a manually measured stream width data set across nine major river basins in the mainland of china with remarkable spatiotemporal variation in physiographic conditions we investigated the applicability the spatial variation and the control of horton s stream width order relations where w ω a e b ω specifically we found that 1 we created a data set of 10 000 width measurements manually and carefully made from google earth imagery over 2500 rivers in nine major basins of china it could be used to validate river widths estimated via other approaches including but not limited to remote sensing techniques and hydrological or hydraulic relations 2 horton s law of stream width holds for the rivers sampled when they are treated as a single branching network r2 0 98 p 0 01 or nine individual networks r2 0 91 p 0 01 while the horton s width ratios across basins tend to center at about 1 93 and range narrowly in 1 50 2 36 the values of coefficient a vary up to ten folds indicating that the cross basin variation of horton s law of stream width is characterized by the heterogeneity of a 3 the cross basin variation of a could be largely associated with the long term average annual precipitation volume runoff volume and aridity at the significance level of p 0 01 respectively the empirical width order relation based on the sampled rivers for china is w ω 0 11 q 0 41 e 0 66 ω r2 0 82 p 0 01 similar empirical relations fitted in this study see section 3 4 may provide simple equations to estimate stream and river widths for the regions where appropriate measurement data is not available in conclusion our work reveals that horton s law of stream width holds for but varies remarkably across river networks in china and this spatial variability tends to be strongly associated with climate this study may provide insights into understanding the formation of river network and estimating stream widths over data lacking regions to support research in the flood ecology and other related fields credit authorship contribution statement bo chen conceptualization methodology

7774,study region the yellow river basin yrb china study focus to alleviate flood risks and safeguard human well being understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of and factors influencing flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand relationship is crucial this study quantifies the capacity demand ratio and identifies the regions where capacity did not meet demand from 2000 to 2020 the spatial durbin models sdm were employed to detect the spillovers and assess the direct and indirect effects of factors influencing the capacity demand relationship in the yrb and across different reaches new hydrological insights for the region the results show that regions with unmet demand has increased since 2000 due to a dramatic increase in demand and a reduction in capacity in the yrb the sdm results reveal that wetlands and forests had positive direct effects and cropland and built up land had adverse effects on the capacity demand ratios heterogeneity tests show that wetland forest and low coverage grassland were the biggest contributors to the capacity demand ratios across upper mid and downstream areas respectively forest in the upper reach had positive direct effects and spillovers on the capacity demand ratio cropland and low coverage grassland negatively affected the capacity demand ratio in the middle reach the capacity demand relationship in the lower reach needs to be improved by restoring ecologically functional land and enhancing the capacity of artificial hydro facilities graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecosystem services flood regulating spatial spillover land use yellow river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods have enormous uncertainty threaten billions of people s livelihoods and cause tremendous loss of life and economic damage worldwide china has witnessed the highest average socioeconomic loss caused by floods in the last half a century unisdr 2015 twenty eight out of 31 provinces or autonomous regions and municipalities in china have continued experiencing severe floods since 2000 mwr 2021 climate change and human interventions heighten the pressure of frequent and devastating flooding posted on the ecosystems berndtsson et al 2019 the intensity of flooding and resultant damages have increased over the past decades in the yellow river basin yrb in 2021 sheehan 2022 thus there is a pressing need to unravel the spatial relationship between flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand and its mechanisms to alleviate flood risks and safeguard human well being ecosystems have the potential to buffer the damage of natural hazards and provide ecosystem services including regulating services plieninger et al 2022 flood regulating ecosystem service one of the ecosystem regulation services can be defined as an ecosystem s capacity to reduce flood hazards by regulating runoff retention and reducing peak discharges stürck et al 2014 haines young and potschin 2018 mori et al 2021 many studies have investigated the capacity supply of flood regulating ecosystem services and provided explicit quantification at various scales basin city country and continent stürck et al 2014 li et al 2019 maría et al 2019 rojas et al 2022 hydrological models such as the soil conservation service curve number cn model and the soil water assessment tool swat are widely used to estimate flood regulating ecosystem service capacity hereinafter abbreviated as capacity maría et al 2019 mori et al 2021 capacity largely depends on land use or land cover types slope and soil hydraulic properties vallecillo et al 2020 zeng et al 2017 and precipitation schulp et al 2014 the regulating role of forests wetlands and green space draws the close attention of researchers e g bhattacharjee and behera 2018 kadykalo and findlay 2016 du et al 2019 the value of ecosystem services is dependent on human demands recent studies have attended to flood regulating ecosystem service demand hereinafter abbreviated as demand at the city scale schröter et al 2018 wang et al 2021 and driving controlling factors berndtsson et al 2019 li et al 2022 the quantification of demand is generally based on the indicators measuring flood hazards and assets the more flood hazards and assets exposed to flood risks the greater demand for flood regulating capacity rudari et al 2015 existing literature affirms a strong correlation between built up land and flood risks and suggests that rapid urban expansion significantly increases peak discharge and flood volume thus compounding the frequency of floods du et al 2015 han et al 2020 overall land use covers and change exhibit a direct impact on flood regulating ecosystem service and flood risks and the effect of single land use type has received attention the spatial balance between human demand and capacity services delivered by ecosystems or keeping the consumption of ecosystem services within a responsible range is a comprehensive embodiment of sustainable development and ecosystem health tao et al 2018 it is therefore crucial to spatially determine the capacity demand relationship especially identifying the areas with unmet demand where additional flood regulating strategies or solutions will be needed villamagna et al 2013 many studies have attempted to find out adaptation strategies suitable for their study areas infrastructure engineering work such as dams and dikes have been used as ultimate measures to regulate floods shrestha and kawasaki 2020 however their sustainability and cost effectiveness in preventing damage from flood hazards are sceptical and they also tend to weaken the natural adaptive capacity in hazard prone areas temmerman et al 2013 reducing the mismatch between supply capacity and demand and mitigating adverse effects of floods through effective land resource management and nature based solutions are recognized as optimal environmental options seddon et al 2021 recently a hybrid strategy that combines soft strategies i e nature based measures and hard strategies i e dams and floodwalls has been proposed to manage flood risks and proved to be a robust adaptive strategy in shanghai du et al 2020 different regions should consider nature based or artificial solutions according to the spatial relationship of capacity demand and the factors influencing it the spatial capacity demand relationship at different scales basin bioregion city country and continent was mapped shen et al 2021 villarreal rosas et al 2022 nedkov and burkhard 2012 mori et al 2021 stürck et al 2015 however these studies failed to address the temporal evolution and quantify the factors influencing the capacity demand relationship where influencing factors were addressed only one factor such as forest coverage was studied no study has addressed spillover effects it remains a gap in knowledge about identifying regions where flood regulating ecosystem service capacity does not meet demand over different periods and analyzing significant factors influencing the capacity demand relationship in a comprehensive manner statistical models are used to analyze influencing factors but the results of classical statistical models would be unreliable if observations are spatially autocorrelated wu et al 2020 spatial regression models such as the spatial error model sem and spatial lag model slm were used for coping with the spatial dependence of variables as they can accurately depict the relationship between variables by delineating the spatial dependence as an error or lag term ward and gleditsch 2018 lesage and pace 2009 proposed to integrate slm and sem to form a comprehensive and more generalized spatial durbin model sdm which can be used to estimate the spillover effects more accurately even in case of misspecification rüttenauer 2022 emerging studies have started to address spillovers of land use protected areas and environmental policies to inform land use governance and achieve sustainable outcomes meyfroidt et al 2020 boillat et al 2022 some scholars have noticed the existence of spatial spillovers of factors influencing ecosystem service for example xing et al 2021 took 340 chinese cities as study areas and explored the spatial spillovers and negative effects of land urbanization on ecosystem services value the study of chen and chi 2022 asserted that spatial dependence and spillover existed between ecosystem services and urbanization in the yangtze river urban agglomerations and varied by scale there is scant research into spatial dependence in a typical ecosystem service and its drivers the present study fills such a research gap by using spatial regression models to assess the factors influencing flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship in the yrb including possible spillover effects taking the yrb as a case study area this study aims to achieve three objectives 1 to quantify and map change in the flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand in 2000 2020 2 to spatially compare the capacity demand relationship and identify regions with unmet demand in the upper middle and lower reaches of the basin over time 3 to identify significant factors influencing the capacity demand relationship by incorporating spatial effects this paper comprises five parts following the introduction about the background aim and overview of this study in part one part two introduces the study area data sources and methodology of the proposed framework part three presents the results of the study part four discusses the findings and outlines some directions for future research part five concludes the study robust findings from this study help us to better understand the capacity and demand relationship of flood regulating ecosystem service in the yrb and provide scientific evidence for advancing land use development and river basin management toward a higher level of equilibrium between human needs and ecosystem services 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and flows east to the bohai gulf stretching 5464 km and traversing three ladder like regions of china the yrb second to the largest one yangtze river basin in china is a typical basin with high vulnerability to diverse ecosystems and disproportionally socio economic development varis et al 2014 the yrb s elevation declines from its western part to the east while the precipitation population and economic development increase the upper and middle reaches encompass a range of poverty stricken areas and ecologically fragile zones the lower reach featured by flat terrain moderate climate and sound irrigation systems embraces important grain producing most developed and densely populated areas based on the digital elevation model dem data with 30 m resolution and the river distribution map the catchment area of the yellow river was delineated as shown in fig 1 our study area includes 426 counties lying within the yrb catchment covering 1 17 million km2 although the area of the upper reach is some 11 times that of the lower reach the population and gdp there is only about a quarter of the lower reach table 1 since the 1950 s the yrb has undergone tremendous land use change and economic development meanwhile extreme rainfall has become more frequent and intensive wang et al 2022 and flooding frequently occurs and causes enormous loss of assets and human life li et al 2019 2 2 data sources multi source spatial data were used to calculate and verify flood regulating ecosystem service capacity as apparent in table 2 the land use data spanning three years 2000 2010 and 2020 and with an original resolution of

100 year return period flood hazard with 1000 m resolution was collected from the global assessment report atlas risk data platform https risk preventionweb net which builds upon one dimensional hydraulic modeling and a probabilistic approach we collected annual flood frequency data from the emergency events database em dat www emdat be and the statistical data of disaster states from the national disaster reduction center of china http www ndrcc org cn to verify the reliability of the estimated demand due to the lack of information on population density and economic density for 2020 data for 2019 was employed as the proxy the population density and economic density in 2000 2010 and 2019 were obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform with a 1000 m resolution we resampled the land use maps and other data to 500 m 500 m using bilinear interpolation a widely used resample method liu et al 2022 then we created a fishnet with 500 m width and height to extract values of raster and vector data for further calculations of capacity demand and the ratio of capacity demand to identify the factors influencing the capacity demand relationship using spatial econometric models we defined the dependent and independent variables and used panel data at the county level and at a decadal timespan 2000 2010 and 2020 different vegetation coverages may contribute dissimilarly to the capacity bhattacharjee and behera 2018 dependent variables include the proportions of forest shrubland high and medium coverage grassland low coverage grassland residential land industrial public service and transportation land wetland and cropland in all land use among them forests wetlands shrubland high and medium coverage grassland and low coverage grassland are ecologically functional land wang et al 2018 since human activities significantly affect ecosystems associated with flood regulation economic and population density are considered besides considering the impact of precipitation on flood regulating ecosystem service may increase with climate change it is thus considered an influencing factor as a basis for carrying out spatial regression analysis using the zonal statistics tool in arcgis 10 8 the average situation of each factor across all counties in the basin was summarized to form a 3 year panel dataset of 426 county level cities the description of all variables is apparent in table 3 2 3 research framework fig 2 depicts the research framework of this study based on multi source data flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand in 2000 2010 and 2020 were assessed and mapped out we calculated the capacity demand ratio to spatially measure the relationship between capacity and demand and identified the regions where capacity cannot meet demand further we used spatial durbin models to assess the effects of land use on the capacity demand ratio in the yrb and across different reaches while considering spatial spillovers and controlling for other important factors such as climate and human activity finally to promote sustainable watershed management we made differentiated recommendations for improving the capacity demand relationship in regions with unmet demand 2 4 methods 2 4 1 calculating surface runoff the capacity of ecosystems in providing flood regulation is mediated by retaining surface runoff and reducing flood peak discharges higher surface runoff corresponds to lower capacity vallecillo et al 2020 before assessing the capacity it is necessary to calculate surface runoff using hydrological models the cn model was selected to calculate the runoff the equation is given in eq 1 hong and adler 2008 1 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s p 0 2 s 0 p 0 2 s where q represents the surface runoff mm p represents the precipitation mm s is the retention parameter of a land pixel mm which can be computed using eq 2 2 s 25400 cn 254 the cn scores range from 0 to 100 a higher cn value reflects lower infiltration and higher runoff the cn model was initially developed and applied for flat areas with slopes less than 5 thus the slope factor is not incorporated into the original cn model huang et al 2006 vallecillo et al 2020 the slope is an important factor influencing water movement and infiltration across the landscape the yrb stretches across china s three terrain steps and has complex topography mountains plateaus and plains the average slope of the yrb is about 7 therefore a slope adjusted cn constructed by huang et al 2006 was adapted to the yrb 3 cn c n 0 322 79 15 63 α α 323 53 where the cn considers land use hydrological soil properties and slope α is the slope ratio cn0 indicates the original dimensionless parameter obtained experimentally from runoff and rainfall measurements over a wide range of geographic land cover and management and soil conditions usda 2004 as apparent in table 4 we assigned different cn0 values to different land use cover types and different hydrologic soil properties as recommended by hong and adler 2008 and vallecillo et al 2020 their studies refined the reference scores from the soil conservation service scs handbook scs 1972 and provided finer scores for land use the soil was classified into four hydrologic soil groups a b c and d according to soil nature zeng et al 2017 the infiltration rates decrease and runoff potential increases from group a to group d to validate the accuracy of the simulated runoff calculated by the cn model we compared it with the observed runoff because it is almost impossible to obtain observed data on all hydrological stations in the yrb in different periods we extracted the simulated runoff data in 2000 to a total of 356 observation points across different reaches the scatter plot fig 3 depicts the runoff computed by the cn model against the observed runoff r2 is over 0 75 indicating a high agreement between the observed and simulated runoff and thus high reliability of our results 2 4 2 assessing flood regulating ecosystem service capacity under natural rainfall conditions a relative index of runoff i a negative indicator of capacity was obtained by computing the ratio of the runoff q against the precipitation p for each land pixel following the study of castelli et al 2017 and mori et al 2021 4 i q p then the index of capacity was obtained by converting i into a positive indicator using eq 5 5 capacity 1 i i min i max i min where i i min i max i min is a normalized i using the max min normalization method finally the capacity was categorized into five classes very low low moderate high and very high using the quantile method which is widely used to group flood regulating ecosystem service shen et al 2021 mori et al 2021 to make the classes in different years comparable the categorization interval of the five classes in 2010 and 2020 were the same as that in 2000 2 4 3 assessing flood regulating ecosystem service demand areas that are prone to high risks of flood hazards and have more assets demand more flood regulating ecosystem services rudari et al 2015 under a natural rainfall condition the index of demand in this study was calculated based on the probability of flood hazard h and the potential assets loss a of occurrence of flood events 6 demand h a the flood hazard was expressed as the probability of a 100 year flood hazard tonn et al 2021 the 100 year return period flood event is a standard for managing flood risk in many countries and cities tonn et al 2021 mpggo 2021 assets were estimated to be the sum of built capital and human capital as existing buildings and infrastructure damage and casualties form the main losses from flooding kundzewicz et al 2019 human capital can be primarily represented by the population density grid and built capital can be represented using the ntl data turner et al 2016 du et al 2018 after calculating the demand in 2000 2010 and 2020 we used the quantile method to categorize it into five groups very low low moderate high and very high which correspond to the five classes of capacity the five groups of demand in 2010 and 2020 were categorized following the categorization interval of 2000 to make the groups in different years comparable 2 4 4 relationship between flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand the ratio of capacity supply against the demand for ecosystem services links ecosystem services capacity supply to demand and reveals a surplus or shortage of ecosystem services xiang et al 2022 the ratio of capacity demand was computed to quantify the relationship between capacity and demand and identify the unmet demand areas 7 r capacity demand capacity max demand max 2 where r is the capacity demand ratio capacity max and demand max are the maximum scores measuring the capacity and demand respectively a positive r value denotes that the capacity could meet demand zero indicates that there is a balance between capacity and demand a negative value denotes that the capacity cannot meet demand indicating unmet demand after calculating the capacity demand ratio in 2000 2010 and 2020 we categorized them into five classes high deficient low deficient balance low surplus and high surplus 2 4 5 spatial regression model specification assuming the possible spatial spillover effect of flood regulating ecosystem service moran s i test was developed to identify the spatial dependence on the capacity demand ratio anselin and bera 1998 in the presence of spatial dependence taking the capacity demand ratio in 2000 2010 and 2020 as the dependent variable and a series of factors as the explanatory variables the sdm was used to test the spatial spillovers of variables using eq 8 8 r it ρ j 1 n w ij r it βx it θ j 1 n w ij x it ε i where i and j represent different counties r it refers to the capacity demand ratio for county i at year t x it denotes a vector of explanatory variables for county i at year t ρ represents the spatial autoregression coefficient j 1 n w ij r it refers to the endogenous interaction of the dependent variable r it with w ij w ij denotes the n n order spatial weights matrix and was constructed using a queen contiguity weights matrix clement et al 2015 β denotes the regression coefficient of the explanatory variables θ is the spatial regression coefficient of the explanatory variables ε i is the random error the effects of explanatory variables on the dependent outcome variable can be divided into direct effect de indirect effect ie and total effect te lesage and pace 2009 and the equations can be adapted from the study of chen and chi 2022 in our study the de expresses a change in the capacity demand ratio in a county caused by those explanatory variables ie represents the effects of change in these factors of a specific county that has on the capacity demand ratio falling on other counties that is the spatial spillover effect the farther the distance the weaker the impact te is the sum of the de and ie we decomposed the spatial effects using stata 17 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal variation of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity looking into the overall spatial pattern of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity fig 4 its value is higher in the northern areas and lower in the southern areas of the yrb the capacity exhibits a declining trend from 2000 to 2020 the areas with high and very high capacity covered 39 95 of the yrb in 2000 32 72 in 2010 and 31 09 in 2020 in contrast the areas with very low capacity expanded from about 39 97 of the basin in 2000 to 46 96 in 2020 the upper reach especially the ordos plateau of inner mongolia and ningxia hui autonomous region was a concentrated region possessing high and very high capacity due to sand and sandy loam a high share of natural and semi natural land covers and less precipitation but the share of high and very high capacity has dropped dramatically in the last two decades changing from 48 33 in 2000 to 38 04 in 2020 the reduction also occurred in the middle and lower reaches to a lesser extent the western mountains in the upper reach have low capacity mainly because the soil there produces slow infiltration rates more than 50 of the middle reach had low or very low capacity in 2000 and the share kept rising reaching 60 in 2020 more than a fifth of the regions in the middle reach held high and very high capacity which were mainly distributed in yan an city and counties near mountains taihang and qinling vast areas accounting for 80 identified to have low or very low capacity were located in the downstream plain especially in the provinces of shandong and henan 3 2 spatial temporal variation of flood regulating ecosystem service demand the overall flood regulating ecosystem service demand in the yrb increased significantly from 2000 to 2020 fig 5 more than half of the yrb had low or very low demand such areas are mainly distributed in the upper reaches with high altitudes steep slopes small populations and an underdeveloped economy the areas posing high and very high demand comprised less than 15 of the yrb in 2000 and 2010 this figure increased to 16 45 in 2020 such regions are featured by low lying topography adjoining rivers dense populations and developed economies the highest demand overlapped greatly with the provinces of henan and shandong in the downstream region taiyuan and xi an provincial capital cities of shanxi and shaanxi in the middle reach and other provincial capitals in the upper reach the share of very high or high demand in the lower reach increased substantially changing from 80 13 in 2000 to 96 54 in 2020 a significant increase was observed in the middle and upper reaches changing from 9 69 in 2000 to 23 05 in 2020 corresponding figures were even smaller in the upper reach 6 00 and 6 65 respectively this is mainly because those areas covered by large patches of semi natural and natural vegetation are not prone to floods to validate the accuracy of the demand estimations we counted the total flood events across different watersheds of the yrb over the 2000 2021 period fig 6 our counting was based on the annual flood frequency data obtained from the em dat statistical data on disasters from the national disaster reduction center of china and reliable media reports on flood events in those years sourced from baidu website the largest web search engine in chinese the results indicate that about 80 of the areas with high and very high demand in 2000 2010 and 2020 were located within the watersheds where two flood events appeared during 2000 2021 about 60 of the areas with very low demand were located in watersheds that were never affected by flooding during 2000 2021 in addition the complex geomorphology has a large resistance to the flow of surface runoff and thus reduces the probability of flood events zhang et al 2015 the watersheds with a more complex geomorphological shape in the upper reach have a lower flood risk than that located in the lower reach where geomorphology is plain the estimated demand is in line with the practical situation of the yrb 3 3 spatial relationship between flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand over time fig 7 shows the spatial pattern of capacity demand ratios in different years there was a marked increase in regions where capacity could not meet demand in the last two decades the regions with unmet demand were mainly distributed in the lower reach in 2000 93 2 of the lower reach had unmet demand compared to 29 85 and 3 83 of unmet demand regions in the middle and upper reaches respectively in 2020 the regions with unmet demand in the lower reach increased to 95 02 at the mean growth rate increased from 0 57 in 2000 2010 to 1 38 in 2000 2020 unmet demand areas in the middle and upper reaches increased more significantly in the last 20 years the growth rate slowed down decreasing from 54 19 in 2000 2010 to 28 43 in 2010 2020 in the midstream and 107 82 and 64 16 in the upper stream the unmet demand regions mainly expanded around the provincial capital cities especially xi an taiyuan xining lanzhou and yinchuan and their surroundings the expansion evolved from spot like and line shaped distributions in 2000 to sheet shaped distributions in 2020 the rapid expansion of urban built up land has brought about economic development and population growth suggesting a dramatic increase in assets exposed to floods meanwhile land exploitation damages the local ecosystem services vegetation clearance caused by urbanization affects the water balance and hydrological conditions thus reducing capacity and increasing flood risks this is an important causal factor leading to a high proportion of areas with unmet demand in the lower reach 3 4 influencing mechanism for flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship the spatial autocorrelation on the capacity demand ratios was tested using moran s i test before conducting the spatial regression analysis the test results table a 1 in appendix show that the global moran s i values of the capacity demand ratios in 2000 2010 and 2020 were plausible at 0 731 0 689 and 0 654 respectively the no spatial autocorrelation hypothesis was rejected at the 0 01 significance level suggesting that there is positive spatial autocorrelation on the capacity demand ratio among all counties falling within the yrb the likelihood ratio lr test was performed to check whether the sdm model performs better than the slm model or sem model elhorst 2014 the hausman test was performed to determine whether the model with fixed or random effects should be selected the lr and hausman test results for the yrb upper middle and lower reaches were summarized in table a 2 the lr results suggest that the sdm models are appropriate for the yrb and different reaches the hausman test results confirmed that the fixed effect model is more appropriate for analyzing the middle and lower reaches while the random effect model is more appropriate for the upper reach small variance inflation factor vif values 10 suggest that the regression models do not suffer serious multicollinearity table a 3 causing little impact on the regression results the regression coefficients in table a 2 indicate the impact of explanatory variables on the capacity demand ratio outcome the direct effect de indirect effect ie and total effect te of all explanatory variables and regional heterogeneity were estimated table 5 in the yrb forest wetland shrubland and high and medium coverage grassland have a direct and positive impact on the capacity demand ratio contributing differently the average capacity demand ratio would increase by 0 22 for every one unit 1 of increase in the proportion of forest coverage in a county at the 0 01 significance level forest had no significant spillover effect on the capacity demand ratio in the surrounding counties the de coefficients of wetland shrubland and high and medium coverage grassland indicate that for every one unit of increase i e 1 in their proportions the average overall capacity demand ratio would increase by 0 26 0 08 and 0 08 respectively residential land industrial public service and transportation land and cropland have negative associations with the capacity demand ratio at the county level for example raising the proportion of industrial public service and transportation land by 1 would lead to a reduced capacity demand ratio of 0 66 cropland has negative de and ie meaning that increasing cropland would curb the capacity demand ratio in a county and its neighboring areas population density and economic density have no significant association with the capacity demand ratio precipitation has no de but has a negligible ie the effects of population density economic density and precipitation on the capacity demand ratio are also negligibly small across all reach areas the effects of different land use types vary in different reaches fig 8 in the upper reach areas with a high capacity demand ratio ecologically functional land including wetland forest and grassland has a significant positive de on the capacity demand ratio whereas industrial public service and transportation land has negative de the wide distribution of ecologically functional land and less built up land are important reasons for the high capacity demand ratio in the upper reach areas the ie of forest captures the existence of positive spillovers in the upper reach areas suggesting that afforestation could enhance the capacity demand ratio not only within a specific county but also in adjacent counties in the middle reach only forest and shrubland have significant positive de on the capacity demand ratio industrial public service and transportation land have a greater negative de than the upper and lower reaches residential land cropland and low coverage grassland show negative de the ie of grassland and cropland shows negative spillovers which do not exist in the lower reach the ecological environment in the upper and middle reaches is more vulnerable than that in the lower reach thus their resilience to the impact of human activities is lower therefore returning cropland to forests and restricting urban sprawl are effective approaches to improve the capacity demand ratio in the middle reach in the lower reach with the lowest capacity demand ratio ecologically functional land and facility land industrial public service and transportation land have positive de and spillover effects due to a lack of forests and grasslands the provinces of henan and shandong in the lower reach have vast areas with demand for flood regulating ecosystem services unmet increasing the capacity demand ratio not only relies on protecting and increasing ecologically functional land but also needs to improve the capacity and efficiency of artificial facilities 3 5 reliability of regional flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand and its scale effects our calculation of the capacity and demand employed data at a 500 m grid scale considering the massive number of samples we aggregated the data to the county level when using spatial regression analysis to identify significant factors integrating data from small scales to large scales may reduce accuracy to test the reliability and robustness of the results we selected the lower reach of the yrb in 2020 for validation firstly to identify regions with high values for the capacity demand ratio we performed hotspot analysis a widely used spatial analysis technique for identifying key areas for ecosystem services provision wang et al 2019 fig 9 the hotspots at the county level were widespread in the middle and upper reaches whereas coldspots predominantly covered the lower reach at the 500 m grid scale fig 9b there were also many hotspots in the lower reach which result from scale effects comparing the distribution of hotspots and land use fig 9c we note that the land use in hotspot areas is dominated by grasslands forests and wetlands then we counted the proportion of various land use in the hotspots and coldspots with different confidence levels fig 9d compared to other regions the hotspot regions with the 99 confidence level have the highest proportion of wetlands and industrial public service and transportation land and the lowest proportion of cropland and residential land the hotspot regions with a 90 confidence level have the highest proportions of forests shrublands and grasslands and the lowest proportion of wetlands the results confirmed the positive effect of ecological functional land and industrial public service and transportation land on the ratio of capacity demand in the lower reach this finding is consistent with the results of spatial regression models using county level data although the use of county level data could obscure the detailed features of local areas based on the 500 m grid data it did not significantly affect the results of this study 4 discussion 4 1 responses of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship to regional land use and policies rapid economic development and urbanization in the yrb have resulted in drastic land use changes and land degradation since 2000 the growth in impervious surface and conversion of ecologically functional land induced by urbanization is recognized to be the main reasons for increased flood risks han et al 2020 in the lower reach of the yrb more than 80 of the land is cropping and built up land there are too few forests shrublands and grassland to effectively improve the capacity demand ratios accordingly over 93 of the region has unmet demand in the upper and middle reaches the regions with unmet demand were mainly distributed in the provincial capital cities and expanded to surrounding areas during the urbanizing process when built up land encroaches on ecologically functional land our study found that land use is a vital factor influencing the capacity demand ratio this finding supports literature rogger et al 2017 li et al 2019 vallecillo et al 2020 on the other hand regions with strong economic growth are more likely to invest in flood mitigation and adaptation and relief activities in the aftermath of flood hazards shaari et al 2016 this could compromise the negative effects peng et al 2017 and further substantiate the insignificant effects of socioeconomic factors on the capacity demand ratio in this study to reverse land degradation and safeguard ecosystem security the chinese central government has implemented an array of ecosystem conservation and restoration programs one of the major programs is the grain for green program ggp aimed at transforming croplands with steep slopes at a gradient of 25 degrees or above and low productivity into forests grasslands or wetlands after the devastating floods across the yangtze river in 1998 the ggp has restored vegetation in the middle and upper reaches and improved the flood regulating ecosystem services in the main tributary watersheds of the yrb whereas there were no obvious improvements in most of the mainstream watersheds such as jinghe and weihe the largest tributaries of the yellow river li et al 2019 this consequence could be explained by the poor connectivity of these rivers according to the connectivity index of the rivers grill et al 2019 a third of the rivers in the lower reach of yrb have low connectivity the connectivity is much better in the middle and upper reaches at 4 25 and 2 39 respectively watersheds in the lower reach and the weihe and jinghe river watersheds in the middle reach have the poorest river connectivity leading to massive areas of unmet demand in 2011 the beijing government issued the national main functional area planning which designated four types of functional areas across the country optimized key restricted and prohibited development zones and formulated strict safeguard measures for the development zones of restricted and prohibited the state council 2011 in the yrb the prohibited development zones aim to protect natural and cultural heritage and therefore are not allowed for agricultural and urban land use such zones are mainly distributed in the middle and upper reaches the dropping growth rate of areas with unmet demand in the upper and middle reaches from the period 2000 2010 to the period 2010 2020 illustrates the effects of the implementations of the ggp and the national main functional area planning 4 2 the role of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship in sustainable watershed management dams drainage systems reservoirs and other engineering works have been constructed to regulate floods and soil erosion shrestha and kawasaki 2020 li et al 2019 however these hard strategies tend to reduce river connectivity exacerbate the loss of floodplain wetlands and weaken the natural adaptive capacity of hazard prone areas grill et al 2019 temmerman et al 2013 ecosystem based adaptive measures such as sustainable forest management and wetland strategies have begun to gain momentum as these soft strategies are more sustainable and can reduce the residual risks resulting from the hard strategies bhattacharjee and behera 2018 du et al 2020 different reaches and regions of the yrb should choose soft strategies or hard strategies or hybrid strategies with facts this study confirmed the positive direct effects of ecologically functional land on improving the capacity demand relationship of flood regulating ecosystem service and the existence of heterogeneity and spillovers the magnitude of the effects of different land use types on the capacity demand ratio varies across different reaches due to differences in biophysical and socioeconomic environments when implementing ecological protection or restoration projects to reduce vulnerability to climate change including climatic extremes and variations different reaches or regions should select suitable vegetation to maximize their direct and indirect effects for example the forest is more suitable than shrubland and grassland in the middle reach as the forest has a positive direct effect and no negative indirect effect whereas due to the significant negative direct effects of industrial public service and transportation land in the middle and upper reaches these regions should focus on ecosystem based adaptive measures the construction of artificial facilities in upper and midstream areas should be fully assessed and weighed to minimize their negative effects all kinds of ecologically functional land help to mend the capacity demand relationship in the lower reach meanwhile industrial public service and transportation land have positive effects on the capacity demand ratio in the lower reach therefore hybrid strategies combining ecosystem based measures and hydro facilities can serve as a useful flood adaptation strategy for the downstream areas the spatial spillover effects of the capacity demand ratio and the spatial effects of various factors indicated the importance of overall planning and inter regional cooperation constructing ecological networks and barriers has been recommended to improve ecosystem conservation in the medium and long term in china shi et al 2020 liang et al 2018 as doing so can not only restore the local ecosystems but also contribute to china s ecosystem security the ecological barriers located in the yrb such as the loess plateau sichuan yunnan ecological barrier should be strictly regulated and well protected via inter regional cooperation to reduce natural disasters and soil erosion governments around the world are committed to protecting and restoring water related ecosystems following the target 6 6 of the 2030 un sustainable development un 2015 in 2019 the chinese government put forward a major strategy for ecosystem conservation and high quality development of the yrb jiang et al 2021 following the enforcement of the yangtze river protection law of the prc in 2020 the yellow river protection law was drafted in 2021 it seeks to regulate and repair the river courses improve fragile ecosystems and reduce threats to soil erosion and floods the chinese government is placing a clear emphasis on developing quality and sustainable watershed management although using counties as a unit for hydrological ecosystem services analysis may introduce a bias the results can be a valuable guide for the chinese government s hierarchical management and policy implementation as well as improve the efficiency of watershed management the combination of territorial spatial planning and flood regulating infrastructure construction is expected to reduce the areas with unmet demand and thus become an important step towards sustainable watershed development 4 3 limitations and future direction this study quantified the spatiotemporal capacity and demand at a 500 m grid scale and considered the spatial spillover effects when assessing the influencing factors of the flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand ratio three limitations of this study deserve mention firstly restricted by data availability we assumed that the soil conditions remain unchanged across different time points the soil s hydrological properties could be improved by vegetation restoration after 20 years of afforestation the vegetation of the loess plateau a significant part of the yrb has been restored which has an impact on the infiltration capacity of the soil qiu et al 2022 in the future considering a change in soil hydrological property in the multi year flood regulating ecosystem service accounting might be more helpful in implementing vegetation restoration projects and seeking nature based management measures secondly dams reservoirs and drainage systems have also played vital roles in flood regulation in depth research into their effects is beyond the scope of this study due to space and data limitations a concrete analysis of how different interventions and infrastructure construction affect flood regulating ecosystem service would have more implications for sustainable watershed management decision making in future research finally we focused on how to improve the capacity and demand ratio narrow down the regions with unmet demand and thus have no further analysis and suggestions for regions with a surplus of capacity research on how to balance capacity supply and demand needs research in future 5 conclusion this study estimated and mapped the spatial pattern of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand of the yrb in 2000 2020 at a 500 m grid scale we have assessed the effects of various land use types on the capacity demand ratio while considering spatial spillovers and controlling socioeconomic and climatic factors the regions with unmet demand in different reaches were identified the robustness of the results was verified the overall spatial pattern of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity was higher in the north of the middle and upper reaches and lower in the south part especially in the lower reach while the demand was spatially separated from the supply from 2000 2020 flood regulating ecosystem service capacity significantly decreased and the demand increased vastly this is particularly the case in the provincial capital cities and their surroundings the regions with unmet demand were predominately in the middle and lower reaches over 90 of the lower reach and about 30 of the middle reaches were occupied by unmet demand regions the upper reach covered the least unmet demand regions only 3 83 in 2000 but it exhibits an upward trend from 2000 to 2020 mainly located in the provincial capital cities including xining qinghai lanzhou gansu and yinchuan ningxia the results of sdm models suggest that land use greatly influences flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship across different reaches while precipitation population and economic development have no significant impact ecologically functional land especially forest and wetland has a positive direct effect on improving the capacity demand ratio the direct and indirect effects of different land use types vary across different reaches wetland forest and low coverage grassland are the biggest contributors to the capacity demand ratio for corresponding counties in the upstream midstream and downstream with a 1 increase in them resulting in a 0 73 0 25 and 1 74 increase in the ratio respectively built up land especially industrial public service and transportation land have a negative direct effect on the capacity demand ratio in the upper and middle reaches raising the proportion of industrial public service and transportation land by 1 would lead to a reduced capacity demand ratio of 0 26 and 0 61 in upper and midstream areas respectively to improve the capacity demand ratio in regions with unmet demand and achieve sustainable watershed development it is imperative to adopt differentiated adaptive measures and strengthen cross regional corporations for the downstream areas the combination of ecosystem based measures and artificial hydro facilities is an appropriate solution for the upper and middle reaches it should be biased towards the implementation of ecosystem based measures such as wetland and forest management intervention our findings close a gap in the literature by highlighting the influencing mechanism and spillover effects of the capacity demand relationship the robust findings of this study can provide a deep understanding of flood regulating ecosystem service in the yrb thus potentially contributing to advancing land development and watershed management towards a higher level

7774,study region the yellow river basin yrb china study focus to alleviate flood risks and safeguard human well being understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of and factors influencing flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand relationship is crucial this study quantifies the capacity demand ratio and identifies the regions where capacity did not meet demand from 2000 to 2020 the spatial durbin models sdm were employed to detect the spillovers and assess the direct and indirect effects of factors influencing the capacity demand relationship in the yrb and across different reaches new hydrological insights for the region the results show that regions with unmet demand has increased since 2000 due to a dramatic increase in demand and a reduction in capacity in the yrb the sdm results reveal that wetlands and forests had positive direct effects and cropland and built up land had adverse effects on the capacity demand ratios heterogeneity tests show that wetland forest and low coverage grassland were the biggest contributors to the capacity demand ratios across upper mid and downstream areas respectively forest in the upper reach had positive direct effects and spillovers on the capacity demand ratio cropland and low coverage grassland negatively affected the capacity demand ratio in the middle reach the capacity demand relationship in the lower reach needs to be improved by restoring ecologically functional land and enhancing the capacity of artificial hydro facilities graphical abstract ga1 keywords ecosystem services flood regulating spatial

tremendous loss of life and economic damage worldwide china has witnessed the highest average socioeconomic loss caused by floods in the last half a century unisdr 2015 twenty eight out of 31 provinces or autonomous regions and municipalities in china have continued experiencing severe floods since 2000 mwr 2021 climate change and human interventions heighten the pressure of frequent and devastating flooding posted on the ecosystems berndtsson et al 2019 the intensity of flooding and resultant damages have increased over the past decades in the yellow river basin yrb in 2021 sheehan

well being ecosystems have the potential to buffer the damage of natural hazards and provide ecosystem services including regulating services plieninger et al 2022 flood regulating ecosystem service one of the ecosystem regulation services can be defined as an ecosystem s capacity to reduce flood hazards by regulating runoff retention and reducing peak discharges stürck et al 2014 haines young

and continent stürck et al 2014 li et al 2019 maría et al 2019 rojas et al 2022 hydrological models such as the soil conservation service curve number cn model and the soil water assessment tool swat are widely used to estimate flood regulating ecosystem service capacity hereinafter abbreviated as capacity maría et al 2019 mori et al 2021 capacity largely depends on land use or land cover types slope and soil hydraulic properties vallecillo et al 2020 zeng et al 2017 and precipitation schulp et al 2014 the regulating role of forests wetlands and green space draws the close attention of researchers e g bhattacharjee and behera 2018 kadykalo and findlay 2016 du et al 2019 the value of ecosystem services is dependent on human demands recent studies have attended to flood regulating ecosystem service demand hereinafter abbreviated as demand at the city scale schröter et al 2018 wang et al 2021 and driving controlling factors berndtsson et al 2019 li et al 2022 the quantification of demand is generally based on the indicators measuring flood hazards and assets the more flood hazards and assets exposed to flood risks the greater demand for flood regulating capacity rudari et al 2015 existing literature affirms a strong correlation between built up land and flood risks and suggests that rapid urban expansion significantly increases peak discharge and flood volume thus compounding the frequency of floods du et al 2015 han et al 2020 overall land use covers and change exhibit a direct impact on flood regulating ecosystem service and flood risks and the effect of single land use type has received attention the spatial balance between human demand and capacity services delivered by ecosystems or keeping the consumption of ecosystem services within a responsible range is a comprehensive embodiment of sustainable development and ecosystem health tao et al 2018 it is therefore crucial to spatially determine the capacity demand relationship especially identifying the areas with unmet demand where additional flood regulating strategies or solutions will be needed villamagna et al 2013 many studies have attempted to find out adaptation strategies suitable for their study areas infrastructure engineering work such as dams and dikes have been used as ultimate measures to regulate floods shrestha and kawasaki 2020 however their sustainability and cost effectiveness in preventing damage from flood hazards are sceptical and they also tend to weaken the natural adaptive capacity in hazard prone areas temmerman et al 2013 reducing the mismatch between supply capacity and demand and mitigating adverse effects of floods through effective land resource management and nature based solutions are recognized as optimal environmental options seddon et al 2021 recently a hybrid strategy that combines soft strategies i e nature based measures and hard strategies i e dams and floodwalls has been proposed to manage flood risks and proved to be a robust adaptive strategy in shanghai du et al 2020 different regions should consider nature based or artificial solutions according to the spatial relationship of capacity demand and the factors influencing it the spatial capacity demand relationship at different scales basin bioregion city country and continent was mapped shen et al 2021 villarreal rosas et al 2022 nedkov and burkhard 2012 mori et al 2021 stürck et al 2015 however these studies failed to address the temporal evolution and quantify the factors influencing the capacity demand relationship where influencing factors were addressed only one factor such as forest coverage was studied no study has addressed spillover effects it remains a gap in knowledge about identifying regions where flood regulating ecosystem service capacity does not meet demand over different periods and analyzing significant factors influencing the capacity demand relationship in a comprehensive manner statistical models are used to analyze influencing factors but the results of classical statistical models would be unreliable if observations are spatially autocorrelated wu et al 2020 spatial regression models such as the spatial error model sem and spatial lag model slm were used for coping with the spatial dependence of variables as they can accurately depict the relationship between variables by delineating the spatial dependence as an error or lag term ward and gleditsch 2018 lesage and pace 2009 proposed to integrate slm and sem to form a comprehensive and more generalized spatial durbin model sdm which can be used to estimate the spillover effects more accurately even in case of misspecification rüttenauer 2022 emerging studies have started to address spillovers of land use protected areas and environmental policies to inform land use governance and achieve sustainable outcomes meyfroidt et al 2020 boillat et al 2022 some scholars have noticed the existence of spatial spillovers of factors influencing ecosystem service for example xing et al 2021 took 340 chinese cities as study areas and explored the spatial spillovers and negative effects of land urbanization on ecosystem services value the study of chen and chi 2022 asserted that spatial dependence and spillover existed between ecosystem services and urbanization in the yangtze river urban agglomerations and varied by scale there is scant research into spatial dependence in a typical ecosystem service and its drivers the present study fills such a research gap by using spatial regression models to assess the factors influencing flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship in the yrb including possible spillover effects taking the yrb as a case study area this study aims to achieve three objectives 1 to quantify and map change in the flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand in 2000 2020 2 to spatially compare the capacity demand relationship and identify regions with unmet demand in the upper middle and lower reaches of the basin over time 3 to identify significant factors influencing the capacity demand relationship by incorporating spatial effects this paper comprises five parts following the introduction about the background aim and overview of this study in part one part two introduces the study area data sources and methodology of the proposed framework part three presents the results of the study part four discusses the findings and outlines some directions for future research part five concludes the study robust findings from this study help us to better understand the capacity and demand relationship of flood regulating ecosystem service in the yrb and provide scientific evidence for advancing land use development and river basin management toward a higher level of equilibrium between human needs and ecosystem services 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and flows east to the bohai gulf stretching 5464 km and traversing three ladder like regions of china the yrb second to the largest one yangtze river basin in china is a typical basin with high vulnerability to diverse ecosystems and disproportionally socio economic development varis et al 2014 the yrb s elevation declines from its western part to the east while the precipitation population and economic development increase the upper and middle reaches encompass a range of poverty stricken areas and ecologically fragile zones the lower reach featured by flat terrain moderate climate and sound irrigation systems embraces important grain producing most developed and densely populated areas based on the digital elevation model dem data with 30 m resolution and the river distribution map the catchment area of the yellow river was delineated as shown in fig 1 our study area includes 426 counties lying within the yrb catchment covering 1 17 million km2 although the area of the upper reach is some 11 times that of the lower reach the population and gdp there is only about a quarter of the lower reach table 1 since the 1950 s the yrb has undergone tremendous land use change and economic development meanwhile extreme rainfall has become more frequent and intensive wang et al 2022 and flooding frequently occurs and causes enormous loss of assets and human life li et al 2019 2 2 data sources multi source spatial data were used to calculate and verify flood regulating ecosystem service capacity as apparent in table 2 the land use data spanning three years 2000 2010 and 2020 and with an original resolution of 30 m was sourced from the resources and environment data cloud platform https www resdc cn it includes 25 subclasses of land use with an overall accuracy of over 90 liu et al 2014 the 30 m resolution dem data was sourced from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn the soil data with 1000 m resolution was collected from the harmonized world soil database fischer et al 2008 the precipitation data were obtained from version 4 of the cru ts monthly high resolution gridded multivariate climate dataset harris et al 2020 the annual precipitation data in 2000 2010 and 2020 were calculated and projected using arcgis 10 8 measured runoff data in 2010 was obtained from the geographic remote sensing ecological platform https www gisrs cn which was based on the observed data of hydrological stations and predicted the runoff distribution data using spatial interpolation data on the river system was obtained from open street map http www openstreetmap org the data used to calculate and verify flood regulating ecosystem service demand are as follows the nighttime light ntl datasets in 2000 2010 and 2020 which were produced by chen et al 2020 with 500 m original resolution data on the 100 year return period flood hazard with 1000 m resolution was collected from the global assessment report atlas risk data platform https risk preventionweb net which builds upon one dimensional hydraulic modeling and a probabilistic approach we collected annual flood frequency data from the emergency events database em dat www emdat be and the statistical data of disaster states from the national disaster reduction center of china http www ndrcc org cn to verify the reliability of the estimated demand due to the lack of information on population density and economic density for 2020 data for 2019 was employed as the proxy the population density and economic density in 2000 2010 and 2019 were obtained from the resources and environment data cloud platform with a 1000 m resolution we resampled the land use maps and other data to 500 m 500 m using bilinear interpolation a widely used resample method liu et al 2022 then we created a fishnet with 500 m width and height to extract values of raster and vector data for further calculations of capacity demand and the ratio of capacity demand to identify the factors influencing the capacity demand relationship using spatial econometric models we defined the dependent and independent variables and used panel data at the county level and at a decadal timespan 2000 2010 and 2020 different vegetation coverages may contribute dissimilarly to the capacity bhattacharjee and behera 2018 dependent variables include the proportions of forest shrubland high and medium coverage grassland low coverage grassland residential land industrial public service and transportation land wetland and cropland in all land use among them forests wetlands shrubland high and medium coverage grassland and low coverage grassland are ecologically functional land wang et al 2018 since human activities significantly affect ecosystems associated with flood regulation economic and population density are considered besides considering the impact of precipitation on flood regulating ecosystem service may increase with climate change it is thus considered an influencing factor as a basis for carrying out spatial regression analysis using the zonal statistics tool in arcgis 10 8 the average situation of each factor across all counties in the basin was summarized to form a 3 year panel dataset of 426 county level cities the description of all variables is apparent in table 3 2 3 research framework fig 2 depicts the research framework of this study based on multi source data flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand in 2000 2010 and 2020 were assessed and mapped out we calculated the capacity demand ratio to spatially measure the relationship between capacity and demand and identified the regions where capacity cannot meet demand further we used spatial durbin models to assess the effects of land use on the capacity demand ratio in the yrb and across different reaches while considering spatial spillovers and controlling for other important factors such as climate and human activity finally to promote sustainable watershed management we made differentiated recommendations for improving the capacity demand relationship in regions with unmet demand 2 4 methods 2 4 1 calculating surface runoff the capacity of ecosystems in providing flood regulation is mediated by retaining surface runoff and reducing flood peak discharges higher surface runoff corresponds to lower capacity vallecillo et al 2020 before assessing the capacity it is necessary to calculate surface runoff using hydrological models the cn model was selected to calculate the runoff the equation is given in eq 1 hong and adler 2008 1 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s p 0 2 s 0 p 0 2 s where q represents the surface runoff mm p represents the precipitation mm s is the retention parameter of a land pixel mm which can be computed using eq 2 2 s 25400 cn 254 the cn scores range from 0 to 100 a higher cn value reflects lower infiltration and higher runoff the cn model was initially developed and applied for flat areas with slopes less than 5 thus the slope factor is not incorporated into the original cn model huang et al 2006 vallecillo et al 2020 the slope is an important factor influencing water movement and infiltration across the landscape the yrb stretches across china s three terrain steps and has complex topography mountains plateaus and plains the average slope of the yrb is about 7 therefore a slope adjusted cn constructed by huang et al 2006 was adapted to the yrb 3 cn c n 0 322 79 15 63 α α 323 53 where the cn considers land use hydrological soil properties and slope α is the slope ratio cn0 indicates the original dimensionless parameter obtained experimentally from runoff and rainfall measurements over a wide range of geographic land cover and management and soil conditions usda 2004 as apparent in table 4 we assigned different cn0 values to different land use cover types and different hydrologic soil properties as recommended by hong and adler 2008 and vallecillo et al 2020 their studies refined the reference scores from the soil conservation service scs handbook scs 1972 and provided finer scores for land use the soil was classified into four hydrologic soil groups a b c and d according to soil nature zeng et al 2017 the infiltration rates decrease and runoff potential increases from group a to group d to validate the accuracy of the simulated runoff calculated by the cn model we compared it with the observed runoff because it is almost impossible to obtain observed data on all hydrological stations in the yrb in different periods we extracted the simulated runoff data in 2000 to a total of 356 observation points across different reaches the scatter plot fig 3 depicts the runoff computed by the cn model against the observed runoff r2 is over 0 75 indicating a high agreement between the observed and simulated runoff and thus high reliability of our results 2 4 2 assessing flood regulating ecosystem service capacity under natural rainfall conditions a relative index of runoff i a negative indicator of capacity was obtained by computing the ratio of the runoff q against the precipitation p for each land pixel following the study of castelli et al 2017 and mori et al 2021 4 i q p then the index of capacity was obtained by converting i into a positive indicator using eq 5 5 capacity 1 i i min i max i min where i i min i max i min is a normalized i using the max min normalization method finally the capacity was categorized into five classes very low low moderate high and very high using the quantile method which is widely used to group flood regulating ecosystem service shen et al 2021 mori et al 2021 to make the classes in different years comparable the categorization interval of the five classes in 2010 and 2020 were the same as that in 2000 2 4 3 assessing flood regulating ecosystem service demand areas that are prone to high risks of flood hazards and have more assets demand more flood regulating ecosystem services rudari et al 2015 under a natural rainfall condition the index of demand in this study was calculated based on the probability of flood hazard h and the potential assets loss a of occurrence of flood events 6 demand h a the flood hazard was expressed as the probability of a 100 year flood hazard tonn et al 2021 the 100 year return period flood event is a standard for managing flood risk in many countries and cities tonn et al 2021 mpggo 2021 assets were estimated to be the sum of built capital and human capital as existing buildings and infrastructure damage and casualties form the main losses from flooding kundzewicz et al 2019 human capital can be primarily represented by the population density grid and built capital can be represented using the ntl data turner et al 2016 du et al 2018 after calculating the demand in 2000 2010 and 2020 we used the quantile method to categorize it into five groups very low low moderate high and very high which correspond to the five classes of capacity the five groups of demand in 2010 and 2020 were categorized following the categorization interval of 2000 to make the groups in different years comparable 2 4 4 relationship between flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand the ratio of capacity supply against the demand for ecosystem services links ecosystem services capacity supply to demand and reveals a surplus or shortage of ecosystem services xiang et al 2022 the ratio of capacity demand was computed to quantify the relationship between capacity and demand and identify the unmet demand areas 7 r capacity demand capacity max demand max 2 where r is the capacity demand ratio capacity max and demand max are the maximum scores measuring the capacity and demand respectively a positive r value denotes that the capacity could meet demand zero indicates that there is a balance between capacity and demand a negative value denotes that the capacity cannot meet demand indicating unmet demand after calculating the capacity demand ratio in 2000 2010 and 2020 we categorized them into five classes high deficient low deficient balance low surplus and high surplus 2 4 5 spatial regression model specification assuming the possible spatial spillover effect of flood regulating ecosystem service moran s i test was developed to identify the spatial dependence on the capacity demand ratio anselin and bera 1998 in the presence of spatial dependence taking the capacity demand ratio in 2000 2010 and 2020 as the dependent variable and a series of factors as the explanatory variables the sdm was used to test the spatial spillovers of variables using eq 8 8 r it ρ j 1 n w ij r it βx it θ j 1 n w ij x it ε i where i and j represent different counties r it refers to the capacity demand ratio for county i at year t x it denotes a vector of explanatory variables for county i at year t ρ represents the spatial autoregression coefficient j 1 n w ij r it refers to the endogenous interaction of the dependent variable r it with w ij w ij denotes the n n order spatial weights matrix and was constructed using a queen contiguity weights matrix clement et al 2015 β denotes the regression coefficient of the explanatory variables θ is the spatial regression coefficient of the explanatory variables ε i is the random error the effects of explanatory variables on the dependent outcome variable can be divided into direct effect de indirect effect ie and total effect te lesage and pace 2009 and the equations can be adapted from the study of chen and chi 2022 in our study the de expresses a change in the capacity demand ratio in a county caused by those explanatory variables ie represents the effects of change in these factors of a specific county that has on the capacity demand ratio falling on other counties that is the spatial spillover effect the farther the distance the weaker the impact te is the sum of the de and ie we decomposed the spatial effects using stata 17 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal variation of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity looking into the overall spatial pattern of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity fig 4 its value is higher in the northern areas and lower in the southern areas of the yrb the capacity exhibits a declining trend from 2000 to 2020 the areas with high and very high capacity covered 39 95 of the yrb in 2000 32 72 in 2010 and 31 09 in 2020 in contrast the areas with very low capacity expanded from about 39 97 of the basin in 2000 to 46 96 in 2020 the upper reach especially the ordos plateau of inner mongolia and ningxia hui autonomous region was a concentrated region possessing high and very high capacity due to sand and sandy loam a high share of natural and semi natural land covers and less precipitation but the share of high and very high capacity has dropped dramatically in the last two decades changing from 48 33 in 2000 to 38 04 in 2020 the reduction also occurred in the middle and lower reaches to a lesser extent the western mountains in the upper reach have low capacity mainly because the soil there produces slow infiltration rates more than 50 of the middle reach had low or very low capacity in 2000 and the share kept rising reaching 60 in 2020 more than a fifth of the regions in the middle reach held high and very high capacity which were mainly distributed in yan an city and counties near mountains taihang and qinling vast areas accounting for 80 identified to have low or very low capacity were located in the downstream plain especially in the provinces of shandong and henan 3 2 spatial temporal variation of flood regulating ecosystem service demand the overall flood regulating ecosystem service demand in the yrb increased significantly from 2000 to 2020 fig 5 more than half of the yrb had low or very low demand such areas are mainly distributed in the upper reaches with high altitudes steep slopes small populations and an underdeveloped economy the areas posing high and very high demand comprised less than 15 of the yrb in 2000 and 2010 this figure increased to 16 45 in 2020 such regions are featured by low lying topography adjoining rivers dense populations and developed economies the highest demand overlapped greatly with the provinces of henan and shandong in the downstream region taiyuan and xi an provincial capital cities of shanxi and shaanxi in the middle reach and other provincial capitals in the upper reach the share of very high or high demand in the lower reach increased substantially changing from 80 13 in 2000 to 96 54 in 2020 a significant increase was observed in the middle and upper reaches changing from 9 69 in 2000 to 23 05 in 2020 corresponding figures were even smaller in the upper reach 6 00 and 6 65 respectively this is mainly because those areas covered by large patches of semi natural and natural vegetation are not prone to floods to validate the accuracy of the demand estimations we counted the total flood events across different watersheds of the yrb over the 2000 2021 period fig 6 our counting was based on the annual flood frequency data obtained from the em dat statistical data on disasters from the national disaster reduction center of china and reliable media reports on flood events in those years sourced from baidu website the largest web search engine in chinese the results indicate that about 80 of the areas with high and very high demand in 2000 2010 and 2020 were located within the watersheds where two flood events appeared during 2000 2021 about 60 of the areas with very low demand were located in watersheds that were never affected by flooding during 2000 2021 in addition the complex geomorphology has a large resistance to the flow of surface runoff and thus reduces the probability of flood events zhang et al 2015 the watersheds with a more complex geomorphological shape in the upper reach have a lower flood risk than that located in the lower reach where geomorphology is plain the estimated demand is in line with the practical situation of the yrb 3 3 spatial relationship between flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand over time fig 7 shows the spatial pattern of capacity demand ratios in different years there was a marked increase in regions where capacity could not meet demand in the last two decades the regions with unmet demand were mainly distributed in the lower reach in 2000 93 2 of the lower reach had unmet demand compared to 29 85 and 3 83 of unmet demand regions in the middle and upper reaches respectively in 2020 the regions with unmet demand in the lower reach increased to 95 02 at the mean growth rate increased from 0 57 in 2000 2010 to 1 38 in 2000 2020 unmet demand areas in the middle and upper reaches increased more significantly in the last 20 years the growth rate slowed down decreasing from 54 19 in 2000 2010 to 28 43 in 2010 2020 in the midstream and 107 82 and 64 16 in the upper stream the unmet demand regions mainly expanded around the provincial capital cities especially xi an taiyuan xining lanzhou and yinchuan and their surroundings the expansion evolved from spot like and line shaped distributions in 2000 to sheet shaped distributions in 2020 the rapid expansion of urban built up land has brought about economic development and population growth suggesting a dramatic increase in assets exposed to floods meanwhile land exploitation damages the local ecosystem services vegetation clearance caused by urbanization affects the water balance and hydrological conditions thus reducing capacity and increasing flood risks this is an important causal factor leading to a high proportion of areas with unmet demand in the lower reach 3 4 influencing mechanism for flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship the spatial autocorrelation on the capacity demand ratios was tested using moran s i test before conducting the spatial regression analysis the test results table a 1 in appendix show that the global moran s i values of the capacity demand ratios in 2000 2010 and 2020 were plausible at 0 731 0 689 and 0 654 respectively the no spatial autocorrelation hypothesis was rejected at the 0 01 significance level suggesting that there is positive spatial autocorrelation on the capacity demand ratio among all counties falling within the yrb the likelihood ratio lr test was performed to check whether the sdm model performs better than the slm model or sem model elhorst 2014 the hausman test was performed to determine whether the model with fixed or random effects should be selected the lr and hausman test results for the yrb upper middle and lower reaches were summarized in table a 2 the lr results suggest that the sdm models are appropriate for the yrb and different reaches the hausman test results confirmed that the fixed effect model is more appropriate for analyzing the middle and lower reaches while the random effect model is more appropriate for the upper reach small variance inflation factor vif values 10 suggest that the regression models do not suffer serious multicollinearity table a 3 causing little impact on the regression results the regression coefficients in table a 2 indicate the impact of explanatory variables on the capacity demand ratio outcome the direct effect de indirect effect ie and total effect te of all explanatory variables and regional heterogeneity were estimated table 5 in the yrb forest wetland shrubland and high and medium coverage grassland have a direct and positive impact on the capacity demand ratio contributing differently the average capacity demand ratio would increase by 0 22 for every one unit 1 of increase in the proportion of forest coverage in a county at the 0 01 significance level forest had no significant spillover effect on the capacity demand ratio in the surrounding counties the de coefficients of wetland shrubland and high and medium coverage grassland indicate that for every one unit of increase i e 1 in their proportions the average overall capacity demand ratio would increase by 0 26 0 08 and 0 08 respectively residential land industrial public service and transportation land and cropland have negative associations with the capacity demand ratio at the county level for example raising the proportion of industrial public service and transportation land by 1 would lead to a reduced capacity demand ratio of 0 66 cropland has negative de and ie meaning that increasing cropland would curb the capacity demand ratio in a county and its neighboring areas population density and economic density have no significant association with the capacity demand ratio precipitation has no de but has a negligible ie the effects of population density economic density and precipitation on the capacity demand ratio are also negligibly small across all reach areas the effects of different land use types vary in different reaches fig 8 in the upper reach areas with a high capacity demand ratio ecologically functional land including wetland forest and grassland has a significant positive de on the capacity demand ratio whereas industrial public service and transportation land has negative de the wide distribution of ecologically functional land and less built up land are important reasons for the high capacity demand ratio in the upper reach areas the ie of forest captures the existence of positive spillovers in the upper reach areas suggesting that afforestation could enhance the capacity demand ratio not only within a specific county but also in adjacent counties in the middle reach only forest and shrubland have significant positive de on the capacity demand ratio industrial public service and transportation land have a greater negative de than the upper and lower reaches residential land cropland and low coverage grassland show negative de the ie of grassland and cropland shows negative spillovers which do not exist in the lower reach the ecological environment in the upper and middle reaches is more vulnerable than that in the lower reach thus their resilience to the impact of human activities is lower therefore returning cropland to forests and restricting urban sprawl are effective approaches to improve the capacity demand ratio in the middle reach in the lower reach with the lowest capacity demand ratio ecologically functional land and facility land industrial public service and transportation land have positive de and spillover effects due to a lack of forests and grasslands the provinces of henan and shandong in the lower reach have vast areas with demand for flood regulating ecosystem services unmet increasing the capacity demand ratio not only relies on protecting and increasing ecologically functional land but also needs to improve the capacity and efficiency of artificial facilities 3 5 reliability of regional flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand and its scale effects our calculation of the capacity and demand employed data at a 500 m grid scale considering the massive number of samples we aggregated the data to the county level when using spatial regression analysis to identify significant factors integrating data from small scales to large scales may reduce accuracy to test the reliability and robustness of the results we selected the lower reach of the yrb in 2020 for validation firstly to identify regions with high values for the capacity demand ratio we performed hotspot analysis a widely used spatial analysis technique for identifying key areas for ecosystem services provision wang et al 2019 fig 9 the hotspots at the county level were widespread in the middle and upper reaches whereas coldspots predominantly covered the lower reach at the 500 m grid scale fig 9b there were also many hotspots in the lower reach which result from scale effects comparing the distribution of hotspots and land use fig 9c we note that the land use in hotspot areas is dominated by grasslands forests and wetlands then we counted the proportion of various land use in the hotspots and coldspots with different confidence levels fig 9d compared to other regions the hotspot regions with the 99 confidence level have the highest proportion of wetlands and industrial public service and transportation land and the lowest proportion of cropland and residential land the hotspot regions with a 90 confidence level have the highest proportions of forests shrublands and grasslands and the lowest proportion of wetlands the results confirmed the positive effect of ecological functional land and industrial public service and transportation land on the ratio of capacity demand in the lower reach this finding is consistent with the results of spatial regression models using county level data although the use of county level data could obscure the detailed features of local areas based on the 500 m grid data it did not significantly affect the results of this study 4 discussion 4 1 responses of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship to regional land use and policies rapid economic development and urbanization in the yrb have resulted in drastic land use changes and land degradation since 2000 the growth in impervious surface and conversion of ecologically functional land induced by urbanization is recognized to be the main reasons for increased flood risks han et al 2020 in the lower reach of the yrb more than 80 of the land is cropping and built up land there are too few forests shrublands and grassland to effectively improve the capacity demand ratios accordingly over 93 of the region has unmet demand in the upper and middle reaches the regions with unmet demand were mainly distributed in the provincial capital cities and expanded to surrounding areas during the urbanizing process when built up land encroaches on ecologically functional land our study found that land use is a vital factor influencing the capacity demand ratio this finding supports literature rogger et al 2017 li et al 2019 vallecillo et al 2020 on the other hand regions with strong economic growth are more likely to invest in flood mitigation and adaptation and relief activities in the aftermath of flood hazards shaari et al 2016 this could compromise the negative effects peng et al 2017 and further substantiate the insignificant effects of socioeconomic factors on the capacity demand ratio in this study to reverse land degradation and safeguard ecosystem security the chinese central government has implemented an array of ecosystem conservation and restoration programs one of the major programs is the grain for green program ggp aimed at transforming croplands with steep slopes at a gradient of 25 degrees or above and low productivity into forests grasslands or wetlands after the devastating floods across the yangtze river in 1998 the ggp has restored vegetation in the middle and upper reaches and improved the flood regulating ecosystem services in the main tributary watersheds of the yrb whereas there were no obvious improvements in most of the mainstream watersheds such as jinghe and weihe the largest tributaries of the yellow river li et al 2019 this consequence could be explained by the poor connectivity of these rivers according to the connectivity index of the rivers grill et al 2019 a third of the rivers in the lower reach of yrb have low connectivity the connectivity is much better in the middle and upper reaches at 4 25 and 2 39 respectively watersheds in the lower reach and the weihe and jinghe river watersheds in the middle reach have the poorest river connectivity leading to massive areas of unmet demand in 2011 the beijing government issued the national main functional area planning which designated four types of functional areas across the country optimized key restricted and prohibited development zones and formulated strict safeguard measures for the development zones of restricted and prohibited the state council 2011 in the yrb the prohibited development zones aim to protect natural and cultural heritage and therefore are not allowed for agricultural and urban land use such zones are mainly distributed in the middle and upper reaches the dropping growth rate of areas with unmet demand in the upper and middle reaches from the period 2000 2010 to the period 2010 2020 illustrates the effects of the implementations of the ggp and the national main functional area planning 4 2 the role of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship in sustainable watershed management dams drainage systems reservoirs and other engineering works have been constructed to regulate floods and soil erosion shrestha and kawasaki 2020 li et al 2019 however these hard strategies tend to reduce river connectivity exacerbate the loss of floodplain wetlands and weaken the natural adaptive capacity of hazard prone areas grill et al 2019 temmerman et al 2013 ecosystem based adaptive measures such as sustainable forest management and wetland strategies have begun to gain momentum as these soft strategies are more sustainable and can reduce the residual risks resulting from the hard strategies bhattacharjee and behera 2018 du et al 2020 different reaches and regions of the yrb should choose soft strategies or hard strategies or hybrid strategies with facts this study confirmed the positive direct effects of ecologically functional land on improving the capacity demand relationship of flood regulating ecosystem service and the existence of heterogeneity and spillovers the magnitude of the effects of different land use types on the capacity demand ratio varies across different reaches due to differences in biophysical and socioeconomic environments when implementing ecological protection or restoration projects to reduce vulnerability to climate change including climatic extremes and variations different reaches or regions should select suitable vegetation to maximize their direct and indirect effects for example the forest is more suitable than shrubland and grassland in the middle reach as the forest has a positive direct effect and no negative indirect effect whereas due to the significant negative direct effects of industrial public service and transportation land in the middle and upper reaches these regions should focus on ecosystem based adaptive measures the construction of artificial facilities in upper and midstream areas should be fully assessed and weighed to minimize their negative effects all kinds of ecologically functional land help to mend the capacity demand relationship in the lower reach meanwhile industrial public service and transportation land have positive effects on the capacity demand ratio in the lower reach therefore hybrid strategies combining ecosystem based measures and hydro facilities can serve as a useful flood adaptation strategy for the downstream areas the spatial spillover effects of the capacity demand ratio and the spatial effects of various factors indicated the importance of overall planning and inter regional cooperation constructing ecological networks and barriers has been recommended to improve ecosystem conservation in the medium and long term in china shi et al 2020 liang et al 2018 as doing so can not only restore the local ecosystems but also contribute to china s ecosystem security the ecological barriers located in the yrb such as the loess plateau sichuan yunnan ecological barrier should be strictly regulated and well protected via inter regional cooperation to reduce natural disasters and soil erosion governments around the world are committed to protecting and restoring water related ecosystems following the target 6 6 of the 2030 un sustainable development un 2015 in 2019 the chinese government put forward a major strategy for ecosystem conservation and high quality development of the yrb jiang et al 2021 following the enforcement of the yangtze river protection law of the prc in 2020 the yellow river protection law was drafted in 2021 it seeks to regulate and repair the river courses improve fragile ecosystems and reduce threats to soil erosion and floods the chinese government is placing a clear emphasis on developing quality and sustainable watershed management although using counties as a unit for hydrological ecosystem services analysis may introduce a bias the results can be a valuable guide for the chinese government s hierarchical management and policy implementation as well as improve the efficiency of watershed management the combination of territorial spatial planning and flood regulating infrastructure construction is expected to reduce the areas with unmet demand and thus become an important step towards sustainable watershed development 4 3 limitations and future direction this study quantified the spatiotemporal capacity and demand at a 500 m grid scale and considered the spatial spillover effects when assessing the influencing factors of the flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand ratio three limitations of this study deserve mention firstly restricted by data availability we assumed that the soil conditions remain unchanged across different time points the soil s hydrological properties could be improved by vegetation restoration after 20 years of afforestation the vegetation of the loess plateau a significant part of the yrb has been restored which has an impact on the infiltration capacity of the soil qiu et al 2022 in the future considering a change in soil hydrological property in the multi year flood regulating ecosystem service accounting might be more helpful in implementing vegetation restoration projects and seeking nature based management measures secondly dams reservoirs and drainage systems have also played vital roles in flood regulation in depth research into their effects is beyond the scope of this study due to space and data limitations a concrete analysis of how different interventions and infrastructure construction affect flood regulating ecosystem service would have more implications for sustainable watershed management decision making in future research finally we focused on how to improve the capacity and demand ratio narrow down the regions with unmet demand and thus have no further analysis and suggestions for regions with a surplus of capacity research on how to balance capacity supply and demand needs research in future 5 conclusion this study estimated and mapped the spatial pattern of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity and demand of the yrb in 2000 2020 at a 500 m grid scale we have assessed the effects of various land use types on the capacity demand ratio while considering spatial spillovers and controlling socioeconomic and climatic factors the regions with unmet demand in different reaches were identified the robustness of the results was verified the overall spatial pattern of flood regulating ecosystem service capacity was higher in the north of the middle and upper reaches and lower in the south part especially in the lower reach while the demand was spatially separated from the supply from 2000 2020 flood regulating ecosystem service capacity significantly decreased and the demand increased vastly this is particularly the case in the provincial capital cities and their surroundings the regions with unmet demand were predominately in the middle and lower reaches over 90 of the lower reach and about 30 of the middle reaches were occupied by unmet demand regions the upper reach covered the least unmet demand regions only 3 83 in 2000 but it exhibits an upward trend from 2000 to 2020 mainly located in the provincial capital cities including xining qinghai lanzhou gansu and yinchuan ningxia the results of sdm models suggest that land use greatly influences flood regulating ecosystem service capacity demand relationship across different reaches while precipitation population and economic development have no significant impact ecologically functional land especially forest and wetland has a positive direct effect on improving the capacity demand ratio the direct and indirect effects of different land use types vary across different reaches wetland forest and low coverage grassland are the biggest contributors to the capacity demand ratio for corresponding counties in the upstream midstream and downstream with a 1 increase in them resulting in a 0 73 0 25 and 1 74 increase in the ratio respectively built up land especially industrial public service and transportation land have a negative direct effect on the capacity demand ratio in the upper and middle reaches raising the proportion of industrial public service and transportation land by 1 would lead to a reduced capacity demand ratio of 0 26 and 0 61 in upper and midstream areas respectively to improve the capacity demand ratio in regions with unmet demand and achieve sustainable watershed development it is imperative to adopt differentiated adaptive measures and strengthen cross regional corporations for the downstream areas the combination of ecosystem based measures and artificial hydro facilities is an appropriate solution for the upper and middle reaches it should be biased towards the implementation of ecosystem based measures such as wetland and forest management intervention our findings close a gap in the literature by highlighting the influencing mechanism and spillover effects of the capacity demand relationship the robust findings of this study can provide a deep understanding of flood regulating ecosystem service in the yrb thus potentially contributing to advancing land development and watershed management towards a higher level of balance between humans and the ecosystems and informing policy decision making and practice credit authorship contribution statement jingjing liu conceptualization methodology writing original
