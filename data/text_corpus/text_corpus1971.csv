9855,the choice of drain depth in subsurface drainage design affects system performance previous studies have focused on investigating the hydrology of shallow drains at discrete locations however to our knowledge no study has investigated the profitability of shallow drains across a wide range of soil and climatic conditions the main objective of this study was to comparatively evaluate the effects of 75 cm shallow drains versus 125 cm deep drains on profitability and hydrology of subsurface drainage systems across the eastern usa we conducted drainmod simulations under continuous corn production zea mays l using 30 years of weather data 1990 2019 for combinations of three factors two drain depths four soils and seven locations simulations were optimized for crop production that maximized annual economic return on investment the results showed that corn yield for shallow drains went from 1 6 increase to 1 3 decrease with increasing growing season rainfall from northeast to southeast usa shallow drains provided the benefit of reduced year to year corn yield variability across the region corn yield for coarse textured soil benefited more from shallow drains than fine textured soil across the region even though shallow drains increased annual benefit from higher corn yield under certain soil and weather conditions they were less profitable than deep drains lower benefit cost ratio and higher payback period the benefit of drainage discharge reduction under shallow drains generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa results were used to develop an empirical equation for estimating the benefit of drainage discharge reduction with shallow drains in the eastern usa in conclusion even though shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains they provide benefits that may be of interest to farmers and policymakers keywords corn yield drainage discharge drainmod shallow drains time for drawdown water table depth 1 introduction agricultural subsurface drainage is vital for economical crop production in poorly drained soils evans and fausey 1999 mourtzinis et al 2021 an unintended consequence of subsurface drainage is that it facilitates nitrogen and phosphorus transport to downstream water bodies where they adversely affect the environment fausey et al 1995 ghane et al 2016 schilling et al 2020 due to the water quality ramifications of subsurface drainage it is important to understand how drainage design affects water quantity and quality ayars and evans 2015 the choice of drain depth in drainage design affects water quantity and quality skaggs et al 1994 shallower drains reduce drainage discharge thereby reducing nitrate load compared to deep drains according to modeling craft et al 2018 davis et al 2000 luo et al 2010 nangia et al 2010 skaggs and chescheir 2003 yuan et al 2011 and on station plot experiments burchell et al 2005 gordon et al 2000 helmers et al 2012 sands et al 2008 schott et al 2017 schwab et al 1980 smith et al 2019 knowledge of the nitrate load reduction of shallow drains can increase their adoption by helping develop markets where farmers get paid for the water quality benefit they provide i e nutrient trading programs since reducing drainage discharge is the primary method of reducing nitrate load burchell et al 2005 gordon et al 2000 sands et al 2008 an estimate of drainage discharge reduction with shallow drains is a reliable indicator of the nitrate load reduction one method for estimating the drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains is to use field scale simulation models such as drainmod but the application of these models is a complex process which is usually impractical for conservation professionals another method is developing an empirical equation based on model simulations that are generated for a wide range of drainage designs depth and spacing soils and climatic conditions this empirical equation is also known as a meta model that roughly generates the same results as the drainmod model but with much less inputs and involvement such an equation can be used to estimate drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains for a given field which is located within a specific region where the model simulations were performed this equation can then be incorporated into decision support tools to simplify the decision making process therefore there is need for an empirical equation to increase the knowledge of the environmental value of shallow drains in addition to affecting water quantity and quality the choice of drain depth in drainage design affects crop yield previous on station plot experiments acharya et al 2019 helmers et al 2012 schott et al 2017 and rzwqm2 modeling luo et al 2010 found no significant effect of drain depth on crop yield in contrast corn yield decline has been reported in a drainmod modeling study singh et al 2006 and an on station plot experiment gordon et al 2000 in these studies shallow and deep drains were not coupled with their optimum drain spacings to maximize annual economic return on investment i e optimize crop production for example gordon et al 2000 compared corn yield of two drain depths that were installed at a constant drain spacing however shallow drains require a narrower spacing and higher design drainage rate i e higher drainage intensity than deep drains to optimize crop production ghane et al 2021 skaggs 2007 from an economic perspective crop yield with shallow drains should be compared to deep drains when each drain depth is coupled with its optimum drain spacing so both drainage systems are optimized for crop production as described above optimizing crop production with both the shallow and deep drains is important when comparing their effects on crop yield to our knowledge skaggs and chescheir 2003 is the only study that has taken this optimization approach when comparing shallow with deep drains however their study focused on profitability of the drainage system and nitrate loss in one soil type portsmouth sandy loam at one location plymouth north carolina usa if shallow drains are to be recommended as a water quality improving practice in the eastern usa there is a need to evaluate their profitability for a wide range of soils and climatic conditions this is important because profitability results can help incentivize adoption of shallow drains furthermore there is a need to compare the hydrology of shallow drains with that of deep drains across the eastern usa while optimizing both systems for crop production this is important because the extent of the drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains may vary from one location to the other in the region the objectives of this study were to 1 develop an empirical equation to estimate the drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains across the eastern usa and 2 comparatively evaluate the effects of 75 cm shallow drains versus 125 cm deep drains on hydrology and profitability of subsurface drainage system across a wide range of soils and climatic conditions to our knowledge no study has evaluated the effect of shallow drains on profitability and drainage hydrology across the eastern usa while optimizing both shallow and deep drainage systems for crop production the value of this study is to inform farmers and policymakers about the profitability and hydrological benefits of shallow drains across the eastern usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 drainage equations 2 1 1 hooghoudt equation the hooghoudt steady state equation van der ploeg et al 1999 has been the most common method of determining drain spacing in humid temperate regions ayars and evans 2015 skaggs 2007 defined the design drainage rate as the steady state drainage rate when the water table midway between lateral drains is at the soil surface based on this definition the hooghoudt equation can be written as 1 ddr 8 k e d e d d 4 k e d d 2 s 2 where ddr is the design drainage rate that is equal to drainage intensity cm day k e is the equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity from the soil surface to the restrictive layer cm day d e is the equivalent depth cm d d is the drain depth cm and s is the drain spacing cm fig 1 we calculated d e from the solution developed by van der molen and wesseling 1991 2 1 2 van schilfgaarde equation van schilfgaarde developed a transient equation for the falling water table based on a solution to the boussinesq equation van schilfgaarde 1965 the time required to lower the water table from the soil surface to 30 cm depth tdd 30 in hours can be determined as 2 tdd 30 24 f s 2 9 k e d e ln d d 2 d e d d 30 d d 30 2 d e d d where f is the drainable porosity of the top 30 cm of soil cm3 cm3 other parameters are defined the same as those in section 2 1 1 2 2 drainmod modeling 2 2 1 drainmod description the field scale deterministic model of drainmod simulates the hydrology of a subsurface drained field based on water balance equations skaggs 1982 1978 1977 skaggs et al 2012 drainmod predicts drainage discharge surface runoff evapotranspiration lateral seepage and deep percolation vertical seepage this model also predicts relative crop yield based on salinity dry wet soil water conditions and planting delays due to poor trafficability conditions evans et al 1991 previous studies have validated the hydrology and crop yield predictions of drainmod for a wide range of soils and locations kanwar et al 1994 saadat et al 2020 singh et al 2006 skaggs et al 2012 thorp et al 2009 wang et al 2006 2 2 2 modeling data our drainmod simulations included seven locations that represented a wide range of climatic conditions in the eastern usa fig 2 temperature and precipitation variations at the seven locations showed varying conditions under which we investigated the effects of shallow drains on hydrology and corn yield fig 3 and table 1 these varying conditions allowed us to identify trends of the effect of drain depth on crop yield profitability and hydrology across the eastern usa thirty years of local weather data 1990 2019 were used as weather inputs for drainmod lateral seepage and deep percolation were assumed to be negligible four soil types were used to represent various soil properties in the eastern usa table 2 the soils included normania clay loam aquic haplustoll fine loamy mixed mesic drummer silty clay loam typic endoaquolls fine silty mixed superactive mesic portsmouth sandy loam typic umbraquults fine loamy mixed thermic and rains sandy loam typic paleaquults fine loamy siliceous thermic the soil inputs were based on calibrated and measured data table 2 2 2 3 modeling procedure we conducted drainmod simulations for combinations of three factors two drain depths 75 and 125 cm four soils drummer silty clay loam normania clay loam rains sandy loam portsmouth sandy loam and seven locations baton rouge la plymouth nc memphis tn waseca mn urbana il albany ny lansing mi for each combination of factors simulations were repeated for a range of drain spacing from 5 to 100 m under continuous corn production zea mays l using 30 years of weather data 1990 2019 then we determined the drain spacing that maximized annual economic return on investment as the optimum spacing i e optimized crop production so each drain depth was coupled with its optimum drain spacing for each combination of factors section 2 2 4 this optimization approach allowed us to compare the performance of 75 cm shallow drains installed at a narrower optimum spacing with 125 cm deep drains installed at a wider optimum spacing the simulation results of 30 year average relative corn yield drainage discharge surface runoff evapotranspiration and water table depth were used to compare the performance of the two drain depths 2 2 4 optimization approach to optimize the drainage system for crop production we calculated the average annual economic return on investment for each combination of factors and for spacings ranging from 5 to 100 m the drain spacing with the maximum annual return on investment was selected as the optimum drain spacing which was then coupled with each drain depth the optimum drain spacing was used in eq 1 to calculate the design drainage rate for that combination of factors also the optimum drain spacing was used in eq 2 to calculate the time for drawdown from soil surface to 30 cm depth for each combination of factors the average annual return on investment was calculated as 3 aar aacpi acpc aadsc where aar is the average annual return on investment ha aadsc is the average annual drainage system cost ha acpc is the annual corn production cost of 1 476 ha laporte 2020 and aacpi is the average annual corn production income ha the annual corn production cost included variable direct expenses and fixed indirect expenses the aacpi was calculated as the product of three values relative corn yield decimal potential yield of 14 000 kg ha and corn price of 0 1449 ha the average annual drainage system cost aadsc in units of ha was calculated huffman et al 2013 as 4 aadsc 10000 s o icds irai 2 dep mr where mr is the 0 3 maintenance rate per year decimal dep is the 3 3 depreciation per year based on a 30 year expected lifetime of the drainage system decimal irai is the 5 interest rate on average investment per year decimal icds is the 2 66 m initial cost of the drainage system i e sum of 1 02 m material and 1 64 m installation costs and s o is the optimum drain spacing m the ratio of 10 000 to s o is the required length of the 100 mm diameter lateral drain in units of meter 2 3 profitability analysis to evaluate profitability of the 75 cm shallow and 125 cm deep drains we determined the benefit cost ratio and payback period for each combination of factors based the method outlined in huffman et al 2013 first drainmod simulations were conducted to obtain relative corn yield for an undrained field by setting drainage coefficient i e hydraulic capacity equal to zero then the corn yield difference between the drained and undrained field was used to calculate annual benefit from increased corn yield the benefit cost ratio was calculated as the ratio of annual benefit to average annual drainage system cost the payback period was calculated as the ratio of initial system cost to annual benefit the profitability analysis did not include corn production cost because that would be similar for both shallow and deep drains 2 4 water table indices drainmod daily water table simulation data were used to calculate the 30 year average daily water table depth as smedema 1988 5 h i 1 n h i n where h i is the water table depth on day i over 30 years and n is the number of days over 30 years n 10 957 the 30 year average daily water table depth h g during the five month growing season is calculated as smedema 1988 6 h g i 1 n gs h i n g where h i is the water table depth on day i during the growing season e g apr 5 to sep 5 for lansing over 30 years and n g is the number of growing season days over 30 years n g 4620 the 30 year average number of daily exceedances w 30 when the water table is within 30 cm of the soil surface during the growing season is calculated as smedema 1988 7 w 30 i 1 n g value 30 1 if h i 30 cm 0 if h i 30 cm where h i is the water table depth on day i during the growing season apr 5 to sep 5 for lansing over 30 years and v a l u e goes from day 1 to 4620 during the growing season over 30 years 2 5 statistical analysis a paired t test was used to compare 30 year average relative corn yield from 75 cm shallow drains to that from 125 cm deep drains at the lansing location with years used as replicates n 30 the statistical jmp 15 2 software sas institute inc was used for this analysis design drainage rate optimum drain spacing relative corn yield annual drainage discharge annual surface runoff and time for drawdown were analyzed using the mixed model procedure of sas sas institute inc the fixed effects were soil drain depth their interactions and location location was included as a fixed factor as its variance component converged to zero interactions between location and all other fixed factors were included as random factors the normality and equal variance assumption were checked using normal probability plots and side by side box plots of the residuals when the assumptions were violated the data were natural log transformed all tests were performed with a 0 05 significance level the mean comparison was performed when the effect of targeted factors was statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of drain depth on the water table depth 3 1 1 average daily water table depth at the lansing location the 30 year average daily water table depth for 75 cm shallow drains was 16 cm shallower than that of 125 cm deep drains averaged across four soils table 3 the results for urbana baton rouge and waseca also showed deeper water table depth for 125 cm deep drains averaged across four soils supplementary table s1 furthermore the 30 year average water table depth of shallow drains at the lansing location was shallower than that of deep drains during the growing season apr 5 to sep 5 for each of the four soils table 3 the reason for the deeper water table depth is that deep drains lower the water table to deeper depths than shallow drains helmers et al 2012 conducted a four year on station plot experiment in iowa usa and they reported a four year average daily water table depth of 124 cm for 76 cm shallow drains and 137 cm depth for 125 cm deep drains the shallower water table of shallow drains was also reported in an on station plot experiment schott et al 2017 these combined results indicate that deep drains provide deeper average water table depth than shallow drains at the lansing location the 30 year average monthly water table depth dropped below the level of the 75 cm shallow drains in july august and september for the drummer soil fig 4 however average water table depth did not drop below the 125 cm deep drains this means that shallow drains generate less annual drainage discharge and they flow over a shorter period of the year than deep drains 3 1 2 number of daily exceedances w 30 crop yield loss results from wet stress when the water table is close to the soil surface for too long the 30 year average number of days when the water table was within 30 cm of the soil surface w 30 during the growing season was 0 7 days more for 75 cm shallow drains than for 125 cm deep drains averaged across four soils in lansing table 3 the results for urbana baton rouge and waseca also indicated more frequent water table rise to within 30 cm of the soil surface for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains supplementary table s1 this can be explained by the shallower water table depth resulting from shallow drains compared to the water table depth from deep drains section 3 1 1 the water table rises to the surface quicker after precipitation events when the average water table depth is shallower helmers et al 2012 conducted a four year on station plot experiment and reported that the water table was within 30 cm of the surface only for two days for 76 cm shallow drains during the growing season apr 1 to oct 31 whereas it was within 30 cm of the surface for zero days for 125 cm deep drains singh et al 2007 conducted a 60 year drainmod simulation and reported greater numbers of days when the water table was within 30 cm of the soil surface for 75 cm shallow drains 18 days than for 125 cm deep drains 12 days during the corn growing season in iowa apr oct these combined results indicate that shallow drains result in more frequent water table rise to within 30 cm of the soil surface than deep drains however whether there is yield loss depends on several factors explained in section 3 2 3 2 effect of drain depth on corn yield 3 2 1 corn yield across seven locations we investigated the effects of drain depth on corn yield across seven locations by computing changes in relative yield 75 cm shallow drains minus 125 cm deep drains when yield was averaged across four soils these analyses exhibited a general trend of yield increase for shallow drains with decreasing growing season precipitation from southeast to northeast usa fig 5 baton rouge had the highest yield decline of 1 3 and it corresponded to the greatest growing season precipitation of 662 mm the highest corn yield increase 1 6 was in lansing and it corresponded to the smallest growing season precipitation of 438 mm table 1 and fig 5 results show that corn yield can benefit from shallow drains in locations with a lower growing season precipitation in those locations the root zone retains more moisture with shallow drains because they provide a shallower water table depth section 3 1 1 and increase moisture availability to crop roots through capillary rise vlotman et al 2020 memphis did not quite follow the trend as other locations memphis had the least evenly distributed rainfall over the growing season supplementary section s1 which means that corn yield benefited from shallow drains where there was less uniform rainfall during the growing season less uniform rainfall means that rainfall comes in few days so there are longer periods of drought that corn yield can benefit from shallow drains therefore lower growing season precipitation and less uniform rainfall distribution had a positive effect on corn performance of shallow drains 3 2 2 corn yield across four soils the 75 cm shallow drains increased corn yield from 1 1 to 3 8 compared to corn yield for 125 cm deep drains for portsmouth sandy loam soil at every location except baton rouge fig 6 supplementary table s2 when yield was averaged across seven locations portsmouth soil had the highest corn yield increase of 3 8 for shallow drains at the lansing location which had the lowest growing season precipitation of 438 mm growing season water table depth was generally deeper for coarse textured portsmouth sandy loam soil than for other fine textured soils table 3 supplementary table s1 deeper water table depth supplies less moisture via capillary rise to crop roots and coarse textured portsmouth sandy loam soil has less capillary activity than other fine textured soils supplementary section s2 shallow drains provide a shallower water table depth that compensates for the deeper water table depth of coarse textured soil therefore corn yield for coarse textured portsmouth sandy loam soil benefited more from 75 cm shallow drains than other fine textured soils the beneficial corn yield response for 75 cm shallow drains was greatest in coarse textured portsmouth soil at locations with a lower growing season precipitation compared to that for 125 cm deep drains these combined results indicate that soil type and location are important parameters in the yield performance of shallow drains that should inform design decisions for drain depth 3 2 3 corn yield during dry and wet years for each of the seven locations we determined the dry and wet years based on the 25 and 75 quartiles of the 30 year precipitation distributions then we compared the relative corn yields for 75 cm shallow drains and 125 cm deep drains during dry wet and normal years the results showed an average corn yield increase ranging from 0 6 to 6 5 during dry years for seven locations fig 7 and supplementary table s3 even baton rouge with the highest growing season precipitation exhibited yield increases with shallower water table depths resulting from 75 cm shallow drains during dry years all four soils had yield declines ranging from 0 3 to 6 7 during wet years except for normania at plymouth portsmouth at memphis and portsmouth at lansing therefore 75 cm shallow drains generally provided positive yield responses during dry years and negative yield responses during wet years compared to those for 125 cm deep drains across the eastern usa shallow drains remove less drainage discharge thereby reducing drought stress in some years skaggs and chescheir 2003 during dry years the root zone retains more moisture with shallow drains because they provide a shallower water table depth section 3 1 1 and increase moisture availability to crop roots through capillary rise vlotman et al 2020 adhikari et al 2020 reported that future climate conditions may result in yield losses due to more frequent drought stress during the growing season lobell et al 2020 also found that climate change will intensify drought stress in midwest corn belt states based on historical and modeling analyses rizzo et al 2018 found a 24 corn yield increase when the water table was within 2 m of the surface during severe drought in the usa corn belt they concluded that water table depth within 2 m of the surface can buffer against drought periods and decrease year to year yield variation especially during dry years therefore shallow drains may protect against potential drought stress in dry years due to shallower water table depth section 3 1 1 and less drainage discharge from shallow drains than deep drains section 3 6 3 2 4 corn yield variation from year to year we investigated the effect of drain depth on corn yield variability from year to year by computing standard deviation of relative yield for each soil over 30 years in lansing mi table 3 the results indicated a smaller year to year corn yield variability for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains for each soil at the lansing location on average standard deviation of relative corn yield was 16 2 for 75 cm shallow drains and 17 4 for 125 cm deep drains over 30 years in lansing urbana baton rouge and waseca also showed a smaller yield variability for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains for each soil supplementary table s1 the smaller corn yield variability of shallow drains can be explained by the less variable growing season water table depth for shallow drains than deep drains table 3 these combined results indicate that shallow drains can reduce year to year corn yield variability ghane et al 2012 conducted on farm experiments in ohio usa and explained that less water table variation caused smaller corn yield variability under controlled drainage smaller corn yield variability has also been reported for controlled drainage combined with subirrigation in an on station plot experiment singh and nelson 2021 rizzo et al 2018 also reported that shallow water table depths 2 m decrease corn yield variability based on a historical and modeling study across the usa corn belt 3 3 effect of drain depth on profitability to evaluate the profitability of the drainage system we calculated the benefit cost ratio and payback period for each combination of factors table 4 an example calculation for lansing is presented in supplementary table s4 payback and cost benefit ratio showed that 75 cm shallow drains were less profitable than 125 cm deep drains for all soils and seven locations this is because shallow drains have a higher investment cost in a narrower spacing than for deep drains neither the payback period nor the cost benefit ratio showed any trend of being lower for a specific soil and location in the eastern usa average payback period was 1 6 years for shallow drains and 1 1 years for deep drains averaged across seven locations and four soils table 4 this shows that the payback periods of the shallow and deep drains were close and that both systems pay well deep drains were more profitable with an average benefit cost ratio of 18 1 but shallow drains still generated considerable profit with a benefit cost ratio of 11 1 an average benefit cost ratio of 11 1 indicates that for every 1 invested in the shallow drains the farmer would gain 11 which shows that shallow drains pay well we expect the results to hold for corn soybean rotation overall even though shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains they generate considerable profit and provide a hydrological benefit of reducing drainage discharge that may be of interest to farmers section 3 6 1 skaggs and chescheir 2003 found that although shallow drains have higher initial cost they become more profitable than deep drains when considering the benefit of reducing nitrate loss from the field the benefit comes from the savings that the water treatment plant incurs to not remove high concentrations of nitrate because farmers upstream are reducing nitrate load this benefit can be built into nutrient trading programs where the farmer receives payment from water treatment plant to reduce nitrate load since shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains there is a need for nutrient trading programs to increase the adoption of shallow drains thereby reducing nitrate loss 3 4 effect of drain depth on the design drainage rate and optimum drain spacing the 30 year average design drainage rate ddr was 0 3 0 8 cm day greater for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 the average water table depth was deeper for deep drains than for shallow drains section 3 1 1 a deeper average water table can store more moisture in the soil profile thereby reducing the need for greater ddr therefore a smaller ddr suffices when installing deeper drains the 30 year average optimum drain spacing was 5 1 19 0 m narrower for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 the 75 cm shallow drains have smaller average optimum drain spacing because shallow drains require a greater ddr than deep drains other studies also associated shallower drains with a narrower drain spacing skaggs 2007 skaggs et al 2006 therefore drain spacing needs to become narrower as drains become shallower to optimize crop production and maximize economic return on investment 3 5 effect of drain depth on the time for water table drawdown the 30 year average time for water table drawdown from the soil surface to 30 cm depth took 2 8 7 2 h longer for 125 cm deep drains than for 75 cm shallow drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 within each soil 125 cm deep drains had a longer time for drawdown because they had a smaller drainage intensity wider optimum drain spacing that lowered the water table slower than the 75 cm shallow drains section 3 4 previous studies have reported a quicker water table drawdown for shallow drains than deep drains fausey 1977 skaggs 2007 the quicker water table drawdown and the higher drainage intensity of the shallow drains resulted in a higher peak flow during large flow events supplementary fig s1 these combined results indicate that shallow drains lower the water table quicker than deep drains climate scientists predict that future precipitation will be more variable with wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons konapala et al 2020 also more frequent high intensity rainfalls are predicted in the future sojka et al 2020 on the other hand corn yield declines rapidly after 24 h of waterlogging conditions evans and fausey 1999 therefore quicker water table drawdown for shallow drains may be more beneficial when high intensity rainfalls cause ponding conditions 3 6 effect of drain depth and location on drainage discharge 3 6 1 drain depth the 30 year average annual drainage discharge was 3 4 10 1 cm greater for 125 cm deep drains than 75 cm shallow drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 the average water table depth dropped below the level of the 75 cm shallow drains during the summer but it did not drop below the 125 cm deep drains section 3 1 1 with a deeper drain depth more water will be drained over a longer period fig 4 previous studies reported greater reduction in drainage discharge for shallow drains than deep drains based on results from modeling craft et al 2018 luo et al 2010 singh et al 2007 and on station plot experiments helmers et al 2012 sands et al 2008 schott et al 2017 smith et al 2019 these combined results indicate that shallow drains reduce the annual drainage discharge compared to deep drains 3 6 2 location the 75 cm shallow drains reduced drainage discharge at each of the seven locations compared to the 125 cm deep drains averaged across four soils supplementary fig s2 the smallest reduction in drainage discharge was 2 3 cm in lansing and the largest reduction was 11 2 cm in baton rouge fig 8 this variation can be explained by the higher annual precipitation in baton rouge and the lower annual precipitation in lansing linear regression analysis of drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains and the 30 year average annual precipitation at seven locations revealed a strong relationship between these two parameters r square of 0 87 supplementary fig s3 therefore the beneficial effect of shallow drains on reducing drainage discharge generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa 3 7 effect of drain depth and location on surface runoff 3 7 1 drain depth the 30 year average surface runoff was 1 5 4 0 cm greater for 75 cm shallow drains than the 125 cm deep drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 shallow drains have a shallower average water table depth than deep drains section 3 1 1 consequently the chance of surface runoff is higher with shallow drains because less soil volume is required to be saturated before surface runoff occurs other modeling studies have also reported higher surface runoff predictions for shallow drains than deep drains craft et al 2018 luo et al 2010 singh et al 2007 2006 drainmod is a one dimensional model that conducts water balance for a soil column of unit surface area that is located midway between two parallel drains within the field and extends from the soil surface down to the top of a relatively shallow restrictive soil layer according to the water balance at the soil surface the model predicts surface runoff once surface depressional storage reaches a user defined maximum value however the model does not consider the transmission of this surface runoff to the field edge where it reaches the receiving water body e g drainage ditch or stream in other words drainmod does not consider the lag time or transmission losses of the simulated surface runoff the lag time and transmission losses of the simulated surface runoff to the field edge depend on the field area field slope soil property field cover and field boundary i e buffer strip riparian buffer or a saturated buffer regarding our study although drainmod predicted increased surface runoff for 75 cm shallow drains the actual surface runoff reaching the receiving water body depends on site specific conditions 3 7 2 location evaluating the effect of shallow drains on surface runoff showed that surface runoff increased for 75 cm shallow drains at each of the seven locations averaged across four soils supplementary fig s2 the magnitude of increase in surface runoff varied across locations with the smallest increase of 0 5 cm in lansing and the largest increase of 5 8 cm in baton rouge fig 8 this variation can be explained by the highest annual precipitation of 1572 mm at the baton rouge location compared to the lowest annual precipitation of 857 mm at the lansing location linear regression analyses of surface runoff increase and the 30 year average annual precipitation at seven locations revealed a strong relationship between these two factors r square of 0 82 supplementary fig s4 therefore the adverse effects of shallow drains in increasing surface runoff generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa 3 8 effect of drain depth on the total flow across the region the results showed that 75 cm shallow drains reduced the total flow by 3 4 cm i e combined drainage discharge and surface runoff compared to 125 cm deep drains averaged across all seven locations and four soils table 5 location affected the trade off between reduced drainage discharge section 3 6 2 and increased surface runoff section 3 7 2 for shallow drains primarily due to variation in precipitation across the region shallow drains reduced drainage discharge and increased surface runoff which generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa 3 9 estimating the hydrological benefit of shallow drains 3 9 1 empirical equation for estimating drainage discharge the largest and smallest annual drainage discharge average of shallow and deep drains occurred in baton rouge and lansing respectively which corresponds to the highest and lowest annual precipitation fig 9 a linear regression analysis showed a strong trend of increase in drainage discharge with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa r square 0 97 supplementary fig s5 since annual precipitation is an important predictor of drainage discharge youssef et al 2018 developed an empirical equation for estimating drainage discharge based on annual precipitation the authors conducted regression analysis of drainmod simulations at 48 locations in the midwest usa from 1961 to 1990 dd 29 67 0 6548 p where p is the long term average annual precipitation cm and dd is the long term average annual drainage discharge cm the authors simulations were generated based on one soil type k e 3 5 cm h one drain depth d d 145 cm and one drain spacing s 2740 cm thus their equation is only valid for the design drainage rate or drainage intensity of 2 3 cm day to develop an improved empirical equation for estimating drainage discharge we conducted a stepwise regression analysis of our drainmod simulation data section 2 2 3 using the recent period of 1990 2019 for the regression analysis we simulated the 100 cm drain depth following the procedure outlined in section 2 2 and added the 100 cm depth dataset to the 75 cm and 125 cm datasets to increase the sample size from n 56 to n 84 thereby obtaining a better empirical equation the empirical equation is written as 8 dd 22 0 0 457 p 4 59 ddr 0 00553 s 0 0746 k e where dd is the long term average annual drainage discharge cm p is the long term average annual precipitation cm ddr is the design drainage rate that is equal to drainage intensity when water table midway between laterals is at the soil surface cm day s is the drain spacing cm and k e is the equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile cm day the independent variables of p ddr s and k e were significant predictors whereas drain depth d d and depth to restrictive layer d were not significant predictors at the 0 05 significance level the regression analysis provided an adjusted r square of 0 86 indicating that 86 of the variation in dd can be explained by eq 8 in terms of p ddr s and k e we also evaluated the extent of scatter in the prediction of the empirical equation by comparing empirically predicted dd with the dd values determined in the drainmod simulations supplementary fig s6 the evaluation statistic of nash sutcliffe efficiency was 0 87 1 is perfect and root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio was 0 36 0 is perfect 3 9 2 environmental value of the empirical equation since reducing drainage discharge is the primary method of reducing nitrate load burchell et al 2005 gordon et al 2000 sands et al 2008 an estimate of drainage discharge reduction with shallow drains is a reliable indicator of the nitrate load reduction if p ddr s and k e are available for a specific location in the eastern usa eq 8 can be used to estimate drainage discharge one method of estimating drainage discharge is to choose ddr and d d for a specific field that has a known k e then use the hooghoudt eq 1 to calculate s subsequently ddr s and k e along with the determined p for the specific field can be used in eq 8 to estimate drainage discharge for any location in the eastern usa the environmental value of eq 8 is that it shows the potential of shallow drains for reducing drainage discharge another method for estimating the drainage discharge reduction is using a decision support tool as explained in the next section 3 9 3 decision support tool ghane et al 2021 developed a user friendly online decision support tool entitled drain spacing tool that optimizes drainage design for crop production that tool determines the design drainage rate and optimum drain spacing that maximizes annual return on investment for any location in the midwest usa the empirical eq 8 was incorporated into the drain spacing tool to estimate the long term average annual drainage discharge for a specific drain depth for more information and access to

systems across a wide range of soils and weather conditions in the eastern usa our simulations resulted in key conclusions for the comparison of 75 cm shallow drains installed at a narrower optimum spacing with 125 cm deep drains installed a wider optimum spacing corn yield for shallow drains went from a 1 6 increase to a 1 3 decrease with increasing growing season precipitation from northeast to southeast usa shallow drains resulted in a greater corn yield increase in coarse textured soil than fine textured soil in the eastern usa corn yield for shallow drains increased during dry years 0 6 6 5 whereas yield decreased during wet years shallow drains may protect against potential drought stress in dry years due to shallower water table depth and less drainage discharge shallow drains reduced year to year corn yield variability in the eastern usa corn yield response for shallow drains is site specific it primarily depends on climate soil characteristics dry or wet weather and drainage design depth and spacing shallow drains resulted in a quicker water table drawdown from the surface to 30 cm depth which may be beneficial when high intensity rainfalls cause ponding conditions the drainage discharge reduction under shallow drains generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa even though shallow drains provided a benefit from higher corn yield under certain conditions they resulted in lower benefit cost ratio and higher payback period than deep drains nutrient trading programs are needed to increase the adoption of shallow drains in conclusion even though shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains they provide hydrological and environmental benefits that may be of interest to farmers and policymakers another benefit is that shallow drains are not limited to relatively flat fields like controlled drainage shallow drains can be used on rolling or sloping land without any management need

9855,the choice of drain depth in subsurface drainage design affects system performance previous studies have focused on investigating the hydrology of shallow drains at discrete locations however to our knowledge no study has investigated the profitability of shallow drains across a wide range of soil and climatic conditions the main objective of this study was to comparatively evaluate the effects of 75 cm shallow drains versus 125 cm deep drains on profitability and hydrology of subsurface drainage systems across the eastern usa we conducted drainmod simulations under continuous corn production zea mays l using 30 years of weather data 1990 2019 for combinations of three factors two drain depths four soils and seven locations simulations were optimized for crop production that maximized annual economic return on investment the results showed that corn yield for shallow drains went from 1 6 increase to 1 3 decrease with increasing growing season rainfall from northeast to southeast usa shallow drains provided the benefit of reduced year to year corn yield variability across the region corn yield for coarse textured soil benefited more from shallow drains than fine textured soil across the region even though shallow drains increased annual benefit from higher corn yield under certain soil and weather conditions they were less profitable than deep drains lower benefit cost ratio and higher payback period the benefit of drainage discharge reduction under shallow drains generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa results were used to develop an empirical equation for estimating the benefit of drainage discharge reduction with shallow drains in the eastern usa in conclusion even though shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains they provide benefits that may be of interest to farmers and policymakers keywords corn yield drainage discharge drainmod shallow drains time for drawdown water table depth 1 introduction agricultural subsurface drainage is vital for economical crop production in poorly drained soils evans and fausey 1999 mourtzinis et al 2021 an unintended consequence of subsurface drainage is that it facilitates nitrogen and phosphorus transport to downstream water bodies where they adversely affect the environment fausey et al 1995 ghane et al 2016 schilling et al 2020 due to the water quality ramifications of subsurface drainage it is important to understand how drainage design affects water quantity and quality ayars and evans 2015 the choice of drain depth in drainage design affects water quantity and quality skaggs et al 1994 shallower drains reduce drainage discharge thereby reducing nitrate load compared to deep drains according to modeling craft et al 2018 davis et al 2000 luo et al 2010 nangia et al 2010 skaggs and chescheir 2003 yuan et al 2011 and on station plot experiments burchell et al 2005 gordon et al 2000 helmers et al 2012 sands et al 2008 schott et al 2017 schwab et al 1980 smith et al 2019 knowledge of the nitrate load reduction of shallow drains can increase their adoption by helping develop markets where farmers get paid for the water quality benefit they provide i e nutrient trading programs since reducing drainage discharge is the primary method of reducing nitrate load burchell et al 2005 gordon et al 2000 sands et al 2008 an estimate of drainage discharge reduction with shallow drains is a reliable indicator of the nitrate load reduction one method for estimating the drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains is to use field scale simulation models such as drainmod but the application of these models is a complex process which is usually impractical for conservation professionals another method is developing an empirical equation based on model simulations that are generated for a wide range of drainage designs depth and spacing soils and climatic conditions this empirical equation is also known as a meta model that roughly generates the same results as the drainmod model but with much less inputs and involvement such an equation can be used to estimate drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains for a given field which is located within a specific region where the model simulations were performed this equation can then be incorporated into decision support tools to simplify the decision making process therefore there is need for an empirical equation to increase the knowledge of the environmental value of shallow drains in addition to affecting water quantity and quality the choice of drain depth in drainage design affects crop yield previous on station plot experiments acharya et al 2019 helmers et al 2012 schott et al 2017 and rzwqm2 modeling luo et al 2010 found no significant effect of drain depth on crop yield in contrast corn yield decline has been reported in a drainmod modeling study singh et al 2006 and an on station plot experiment gordon et al 2000 in these studies shallow and deep drains were not coupled with their optimum drain spacings to maximize annual economic return on investment i e optimize crop production for example gordon et al 2000 compared corn yield of two drain depths that were installed at a constant drain spacing however shallow drains require a narrower spacing and higher design drainage rate i e higher drainage intensity than deep drains to optimize crop production ghane et al 2021 skaggs 2007 from an economic perspective crop yield with shallow drains should be compared to deep drains when each drain depth is coupled with its optimum drain spacing so both drainage systems are optimized for crop production as described above optimizing crop production with both the shallow and deep drains is important when comparing their effects on crop yield to our knowledge skaggs and chescheir 2003 is the only study that has taken this optimization approach when comparing shallow with deep drains however their study focused on profitability of the drainage system and nitrate loss in one soil type portsmouth sandy loam at one location plymouth north carolina usa if shallow drains are to be recommended as a water quality improving practice in the eastern usa there is a need to evaluate their profitability for a wide range of soils and climatic conditions this is important because profitability results can help incentivize adoption of shallow drains furthermore there is a need to compare the hydrology of shallow drains with that of deep drains across the eastern usa while optimizing both systems for crop production this is important because the extent of the drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains may vary from one location to the other in the region the objectives of this study were to 1 develop an empirical equation to estimate the drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains across the eastern usa and 2 comparatively evaluate the effects of 75 cm shallow drains versus 125 cm deep drains on hydrology and profitability of subsurface drainage system across a wide range of soils and climatic conditions to our knowledge no study has evaluated the effect of shallow drains on profitability and drainage hydrology across the eastern usa while optimizing both shallow and deep drainage systems for crop production the value of this study is to inform farmers and policymakers about the profitability and hydrological benefits of shallow drains across the eastern usa 2 materials and methods 2 1 drainage equations 2 1 1 hooghoudt equation the hooghoudt steady state equation van der ploeg et al 1999 has been the most common method of determining drain spacing in humid temperate regions ayars and evans 2015 skaggs 2007 defined the design drainage rate as the steady state drainage rate when the water table midway between lateral drains is at the soil surface based on this definition the hooghoudt equation can be written as 1 ddr 8 k e d e d d 4 k e d d 2 s 2 where ddr is the design drainage rate that is equal to drainage intensity cm day k e is the equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity from the soil surface to the restrictive layer cm day d e is the equivalent depth cm d d is the drain depth cm and s is the drain spacing cm fig 1 we calculated d e from the solution developed by van der molen and wesseling 1991 2 1 2 van schilfgaarde equation van schilfgaarde developed a transient equation for the falling water table based on a solution to the boussinesq equation van schilfgaarde 1965 the time required to lower the water table from the soil surface to 30 cm depth tdd 30 in hours can be determined as 2 tdd 30 24 f s 2 9 k e d e ln d d 2 d e d d 30 d d 30 2 d e d d where f is the drainable porosity of the top 30 cm of soil cm3 cm3 other parameters are defined the same as those in section 2 1 1 2 2 drainmod modeling 2 2 1 drainmod description the field scale deterministic model of drainmod simulates the hydrology of a subsurface drained field based on water balance equations skaggs 1982 1978 1977 skaggs et al 2012 drainmod predicts drainage discharge surface runoff evapotranspiration lateral seepage and deep percolation vertical seepage this model also predicts relative crop yield based on salinity dry wet soil water conditions and planting delays due to poor trafficability conditions evans et al 1991 previous studies have validated the hydrology and crop yield predictions of drainmod for a wide range of soils and locations kanwar et al 1994 saadat et al 2020 singh et al 2006 skaggs et al 2012 thorp et al 2009 wang et al 2006 2 2 2 modeling data our drainmod simulations included seven locations that represented a wide range of climatic conditions in the eastern usa fig 2 temperature and precipitation variations at the seven locations showed varying conditions under which we investigated the effects of shallow drains on hydrology and corn yield fig 3 and table 1 these varying conditions allowed us to identify trends of the effect of drain depth on crop yield profitability and hydrology across the eastern usa thirty years of local weather data 1990 2019 were used as weather inputs for drainmod lateral seepage and deep percolation were assumed to be negligible four soil types were used to represent various soil properties in the eastern usa table 2 the soils included normania clay loam aquic haplustoll fine loamy mixed mesic drummer silty clay loam typic endoaquolls fine silty mixed superactive mesic portsmouth sandy loam typic umbraquults fine loamy mixed thermic and rains sandy loam typic paleaquults fine loamy siliceous thermic the soil inputs were based on calibrated and measured data table 2 2 2 3 modeling procedure we conducted drainmod simulations for combinations of three factors two drain depths 75 and 125 cm four soils drummer silty clay loam normania clay loam rains sandy loam portsmouth sandy loam and seven locations baton rouge la plymouth nc memphis tn waseca mn urbana il albany ny lansing mi for each combination of factors simulations were repeated for a range of drain spacing from 5 to 100 m under continuous corn production zea mays l using 30 years of weather data 1990 2019 then we determined the drain spacing that maximized annual economic return on investment as the optimum spacing i e optimized crop production so each drain depth was coupled with its optimum drain spacing for each combination of factors section 2 2 4 this optimization approach allowed us to compare the performance of 75 cm shallow drains installed at a narrower optimum spacing with 125 cm deep drains installed at a wider optimum spacing the simulation results of 30 year average relative corn yield drainage discharge surface runoff evapotranspiration and water table depth were used to compare the performance of the two drain depths 2 2 4 optimization approach to optimize the drainage system for crop production we calculated the average annual economic return on investment for each combination of factors and for spacings ranging from 5 to 100 m the drain spacing with the maximum annual return on investment was selected as the optimum drain spacing which was then coupled with each drain depth the optimum drain spacing was used in eq 1 to calculate the design drainage rate for that combination of factors also the optimum drain spacing was used in eq 2 to calculate the time for drawdown from soil surface to 30 cm depth for each combination of factors the average annual return on investment was calculated as 3 aar aacpi acpc aadsc where aar is the average annual return on investment ha aadsc is the average annual drainage system cost ha acpc is the annual corn production cost of 1 476 ha laporte 2020 and aacpi is the average annual corn production income ha the annual corn production cost included variable direct expenses and fixed indirect expenses the aacpi was calculated as the product of three values relative corn yield decimal potential yield of 14 000 kg ha and corn price of 0 1449 ha the average annual drainage system cost aadsc in units of ha was calculated huffman et al 2013 as 4 aadsc 10000 s o icds irai 2 dep mr where mr is the 0 3 maintenance rate per year decimal dep is the 3 3 depreciation per year based on a 30 year expected lifetime of the drainage system decimal irai is the 5 interest rate on average investment per year decimal icds is the 2 66 m initial cost of the drainage system i e sum of 1 02 m material and 1 64 m installation costs and s o is the optimum drain spacing m the ratio of 10 000 to s o is the required length of the 100 mm diameter lateral drain in units of meter 2 3 profitability analysis to evaluate profitability of the 75 cm shallow and 125 cm deep drains we determined the benefit cost ratio and payback period for each combination of factors based the method outlined in huffman et al 2013 first drainmod simulations were conducted to obtain relative corn yield for an undrained field by setting drainage coefficient i e hydraulic capacity equal to zero then the corn yield difference between the drained and undrained field was used to calculate annual benefit from increased corn yield the benefit cost ratio was calculated as the ratio of annual benefit to average annual drainage system cost the payback period was calculated as the ratio of initial system cost to annual benefit the profitability analysis did not include corn production cost because that would be similar for both shallow and deep drains 2 4 water table indices drainmod daily water table simulation data were used to calculate the 30 year average daily water table depth as smedema 1988 5 h i 1 n h i n where h i is the water table depth on day i over 30 years and n is the number of days over 30 years n 10 957 the 30 year average daily water table depth h g during the five month growing season is calculated as smedema 1988 6 h g i 1 n gs h i n g where h i is the water table depth on day i during the growing season e g apr 5 to sep 5 for lansing over 30 years and n g is the number of growing season days over 30 years n g 4620 the 30 year average number of daily exceedances w 30 when the water table is within 30 cm of the soil surface during the growing season is calculated as smedema 1988 7 w 30 i 1 n g value 30 1 if h i 30 cm 0 if h i 30 cm where h i is the water table depth on day i during the growing season apr 5 to sep 5 for lansing over 30 years and v a l u e goes from day 1 to 4620 during the growing season over 30 years 2 5 statistical analysis a paired t test was used to compare 30 year average relative corn yield from 75 cm shallow drains to that from 125 cm deep drains at the lansing location with years used as replicates n 30 the statistical jmp 15 2 software sas institute inc was used for this analysis design drainage rate optimum drain spacing relative corn yield annual drainage discharge annual surface runoff and time for drawdown were analyzed using the mixed model procedure of sas sas institute inc the fixed effects were soil drain depth their interactions and location location was included as a fixed factor as its variance component converged to zero interactions between location and all other fixed factors were included as random factors the normality and equal variance assumption were checked using normal probability plots and side by side box plots of the residuals when the assumptions were violated the data were natural log transformed all tests were performed with a 0 05 significance level the mean comparison was performed when the effect of targeted factors was statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of drain depth on the water table depth 3 1 1 average daily water table depth at the lansing location the 30 year average daily water table depth for 75 cm shallow drains was 16 cm shallower than that of 125 cm deep drains averaged across four soils table 3 the results for urbana baton rouge and waseca also showed deeper water table depth for 125 cm deep drains averaged across four soils supplementary table s1 furthermore the 30 year average water table depth of shallow drains at the lansing location was shallower than that of deep drains during the growing season apr 5 to sep 5 for each of the four soils table 3 the reason for the deeper water table depth is that deep drains lower the water table to deeper depths than shallow drains helmers et al 2012 conducted a four year on station plot experiment in iowa usa and they reported a four year average daily water table depth of 124 cm for 76 cm shallow drains and 137 cm depth for 125 cm deep drains the shallower water table of shallow drains was also reported in an on station plot experiment schott et al 2017 these combined results indicate that deep drains provide deeper average water table depth than shallow drains at the lansing location the 30 year average monthly water table depth dropped below the level of the 75 cm shallow drains in july august and september for the drummer soil fig 4 however average water table depth did not drop below the 125 cm deep drains this means that shallow drains generate less annual drainage discharge and they flow over a shorter period of the year than deep drains 3 1 2 number of daily exceedances w 30 crop yield loss results from wet stress when the water table is close to the soil surface for too long the 30 year average number of days when the water table was within 30 cm of the soil surface w 30 during the growing season was 0 7 days more for 75 cm shallow drains than for 125 cm deep drains averaged across four soils in lansing table 3 the results for urbana baton rouge and waseca also indicated more frequent water table rise to within 30 cm of the soil surface for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains supplementary table s1 this can be explained by the shallower water table depth resulting from shallow drains compared to the water table depth from deep drains section 3 1 1 the water table rises to the surface quicker after precipitation events when the average water table depth is shallower helmers et al 2012 conducted a four year on station plot experiment and reported that the water table was within 30 cm of the surface only for two days for 76 cm shallow drains during the growing season apr 1 to oct 31 whereas it was within 30 cm of the surface for zero days for 125 cm deep drains singh et al 2007 conducted a 60 year drainmod simulation and reported greater numbers of days when the water table was within 30 cm of the soil surface for 75 cm shallow drains 18 days than for 125 cm deep drains 12 days during the corn growing season in iowa apr oct these combined results indicate that shallow drains result in more frequent water table rise to within 30 cm of the soil surface than deep drains however whether there is yield loss depends on several factors explained in section 3 2 3 2 effect of drain depth on corn yield 3 2 1 corn yield across seven locations we investigated the effects of drain depth on corn yield across seven locations by computing changes in relative yield 75 cm shallow drains minus 125 cm deep drains when yield was averaged across four soils these analyses exhibited a general trend of yield increase for shallow drains with decreasing growing season precipitation from southeast to northeast usa fig 5 baton rouge had the highest yield decline of 1 3 and it corresponded to the greatest growing season precipitation of 662 mm the highest corn yield increase 1 6 was in lansing and it corresponded to the smallest growing season precipitation of 438 mm table 1 and fig 5 results show that corn yield can benefit from shallow drains in locations with a lower growing season precipitation in those locations the root zone retains more moisture with shallow drains because they provide a shallower water table depth section 3 1 1 and increase moisture availability to crop roots through capillary rise vlotman et al 2020 memphis did not quite follow the trend as other locations memphis had the least evenly distributed rainfall over the growing season supplementary section s1 which means that corn yield benefited from shallow drains where there was less uniform rainfall during the growing season less uniform rainfall means that rainfall comes in few days so there are longer periods of drought that corn yield can benefit from shallow drains therefore lower growing season precipitation and less uniform rainfall distribution had a positive effect on corn performance of shallow drains 3 2 2 corn yield across four soils the 75 cm shallow drains increased corn yield from 1 1 to 3 8 compared to corn yield for 125 cm deep drains for portsmouth sandy loam soil at every location except baton rouge fig 6 supplementary table s2 when yield was averaged across seven locations portsmouth soil had the highest corn yield increase of 3 8 for shallow drains at the lansing location which had the lowest growing season precipitation of 438 mm growing season water table depth was generally deeper for coarse textured portsmouth sandy loam soil than for other fine textured soils table 3 supplementary table s1 deeper water table depth supplies less moisture via capillary rise to crop roots and coarse textured portsmouth sandy loam soil has less capillary activity than other fine textured soils supplementary section s2 shallow drains provide a shallower water table depth that compensates for the deeper water table depth of coarse textured soil therefore corn yield for coarse textured portsmouth sandy loam soil benefited more from 75 cm shallow drains than other fine textured soils the beneficial corn yield response for 75 cm shallow drains was greatest in coarse textured portsmouth soil at locations with a lower growing season precipitation compared to that for 125 cm deep drains these combined results indicate that soil type and location are important parameters in the yield performance of shallow drains that should inform design decisions for drain depth 3 2 3 corn yield during dry and wet years for each of the seven locations we determined the dry and wet years based on the 25 and 75 quartiles of the 30 year precipitation distributions then we compared the relative corn yields for 75 cm shallow drains and 125 cm deep drains during dry wet and normal years the results showed an average corn yield increase ranging from 0 6 to 6 5 during dry years for seven locations fig 7 and supplementary table s3 even baton rouge with the highest growing season precipitation exhibited yield increases with shallower water table depths resulting from 75 cm shallow drains during dry years all four soils had yield declines ranging from 0 3 to 6 7 during wet years except for normania at plymouth portsmouth at memphis and portsmouth at lansing therefore 75 cm shallow drains generally provided positive yield responses during dry years and negative yield responses during wet years compared to those for 125 cm deep drains across the eastern usa shallow drains remove less drainage discharge thereby reducing drought stress in some years skaggs and chescheir 2003 during dry years the root zone retains more moisture with shallow drains because they provide a shallower water table depth section 3 1 1 and increase moisture availability to crop roots through capillary rise vlotman et al 2020 adhikari et al 2020 reported that future climate conditions may result in yield losses due to more frequent drought stress during the growing season lobell et al 2020 also found that climate change will intensify drought stress in midwest corn belt states based on historical and modeling analyses rizzo et al 2018 found a 24 corn yield increase when the water table was within 2 m of the surface during severe drought in the usa corn belt they concluded that water table depth within 2 m of the surface can buffer against drought periods and decrease year to year yield variation especially during dry years therefore shallow drains may protect against potential drought stress in dry years due to shallower water table depth section 3 1 1 and less drainage discharge from shallow drains than deep drains section 3 6 3 2 4 corn yield variation from year to year we investigated the effect of drain depth on corn yield variability from year to year by computing standard deviation of relative yield for each soil over 30 years in lansing mi table 3 the results indicated a smaller year to year corn yield variability for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains for each soil at the lansing location on average standard deviation of relative corn yield was 16 2 for 75 cm shallow drains and 17 4 for 125 cm deep drains over 30 years in lansing urbana baton rouge and waseca also showed a smaller yield variability for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains for each soil supplementary table s1 the smaller corn yield variability of shallow drains can be explained by the less variable growing season water table depth for shallow drains than deep drains table 3 these combined results indicate that shallow drains can reduce year to year corn yield variability ghane et al 2012 conducted on farm experiments in ohio usa and explained that less water table variation caused smaller corn yield variability under controlled drainage smaller corn yield variability has also been reported for controlled drainage combined with subirrigation in an on station plot experiment singh and nelson 2021 rizzo et al 2018 also reported that shallow water table depths 2 m decrease corn yield variability based on a historical and modeling study across the usa corn belt 3 3 effect of drain depth on profitability to evaluate the profitability of the drainage system we calculated the benefit cost ratio and payback period for each combination of factors table 4 an example calculation for lansing is presented in supplementary table s4 payback and cost benefit ratio showed that 75 cm shallow drains were less profitable than 125 cm deep drains for all soils and seven locations this is because shallow drains have a higher investment cost in a narrower spacing than for deep drains neither the payback period nor the cost benefit ratio showed any trend of being lower for a specific soil and location in the eastern usa average payback period was 1 6 years for shallow drains and 1 1 years for deep drains averaged across seven locations and four soils table 4 this shows that the payback periods of the shallow and deep drains were close and that both systems pay well deep drains were more profitable with an average benefit cost ratio of 18 1 but shallow drains still generated considerable profit with a benefit cost ratio of 11 1 an average benefit cost ratio of 11 1 indicates that for every 1 invested in the shallow drains the farmer would gain 11 which shows that shallow drains pay well we expect the results to hold for corn soybean rotation overall even though shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains they generate considerable profit and provide a hydrological benefit of reducing drainage discharge that may be of interest to farmers section 3 6 1 skaggs and chescheir 2003 found that although shallow drains have higher initial cost they become more profitable than deep drains when considering the benefit of reducing nitrate loss from the field the benefit comes from the savings that the water treatment plant incurs to not remove high concentrations of nitrate because farmers upstream are reducing nitrate load this benefit can be built into nutrient trading programs where the farmer receives payment from water treatment plant to reduce nitrate load since shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains there is a need for nutrient trading programs to increase the adoption of shallow drains thereby reducing nitrate loss 3 4 effect of drain depth on the design drainage rate and optimum drain spacing the 30 year average design drainage rate ddr was 0 3 0 8 cm day greater for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 the average water table depth was deeper for deep drains than for shallow drains section 3 1 1 a deeper average water table can store more moisture in the soil profile thereby reducing the need for greater ddr therefore a smaller ddr suffices when installing deeper drains the 30 year average optimum drain spacing was 5 1 19 0 m narrower for 75 cm shallow drains than 125 cm deep drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 the 75 cm shallow drains have smaller average optimum drain spacing because shallow drains require a greater ddr than deep drains other studies also associated shallower drains with a narrower drain spacing skaggs 2007 skaggs et al 2006 therefore drain spacing needs to become narrower as drains become shallower to optimize crop production and maximize economic return on investment 3 5 effect of drain depth on the time for water table drawdown the 30 year average time for water table drawdown from the soil surface to 30 cm depth took 2 8 7 2 h longer for 125 cm deep drains than for 75 cm shallow drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 within each soil 125 cm deep drains had a longer time for drawdown because they had a smaller drainage intensity wider optimum drain spacing that lowered the water table slower than the 75 cm shallow drains section 3 4 previous studies have reported a quicker water table drawdown for shallow drains than deep drains fausey 1977 skaggs 2007 the quicker water table drawdown and the higher drainage intensity of the shallow drains resulted in a higher peak flow during large flow events supplementary fig s1 these combined results indicate that shallow drains lower the water table quicker than deep drains climate scientists predict that future precipitation will be more variable with wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons konapala et al 2020 also more frequent high intensity rainfalls are predicted in the future sojka et al 2020 on the other hand corn yield declines rapidly after 24 h of waterlogging conditions evans and fausey 1999 therefore quicker water table drawdown for shallow drains may be more beneficial when high intensity rainfalls cause ponding conditions 3 6 effect of drain depth and location on drainage discharge 3 6 1 drain depth the 30 year average annual drainage discharge was 3 4 10 1 cm greater for 125 cm deep drains than 75 cm shallow drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 the average water table depth dropped below the level of the 75 cm shallow drains during the summer but it did not drop below the 125 cm deep drains section 3 1 1 with a deeper drain depth more water will be drained over a longer period fig 4 previous studies reported greater reduction in drainage discharge for shallow drains than deep drains based on results from modeling craft et al 2018 luo et al 2010 singh et al 2007 and on station plot experiments helmers et al 2012 sands et al 2008 schott et al 2017 smith et al 2019 these combined results indicate that shallow drains reduce the annual drainage discharge compared to deep drains 3 6 2 location the 75 cm shallow drains reduced drainage discharge at each of the seven locations compared to the 125 cm deep drains averaged across four soils supplementary fig s2 the smallest reduction in drainage discharge was 2 3 cm in lansing and the largest reduction was 11 2 cm in baton rouge fig 8 this variation can be explained by the higher annual precipitation in baton rouge and the lower annual precipitation in lansing linear regression analysis of drainage discharge reduction of shallow drains and the 30 year average annual precipitation at seven locations revealed a strong relationship between these two parameters r square of 0 87 supplementary fig s3 therefore the beneficial effect of shallow drains on reducing drainage discharge generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa 3 7 effect of drain depth and location on surface runoff 3 7 1 drain depth the 30 year average surface runoff was 1 5 4 0 cm greater for 75 cm shallow drains than the 125 cm deep drains for the four soils averaged across seven locations table 5 shallow drains have a shallower average water table depth than deep drains section 3 1 1 consequently the chance of surface runoff is higher with shallow drains because less soil volume is required to be saturated before surface runoff occurs other modeling studies have also reported higher surface runoff predictions for shallow drains than deep drains craft et al 2018 luo et al 2010 singh et al 2007 2006 drainmod is a one dimensional model that conducts water balance for a soil column of unit surface area that is located midway between two parallel drains within the field and extends from the soil surface down to the top of a relatively shallow restrictive soil layer according to the water balance at the soil surface the model predicts surface runoff once surface depressional storage reaches a user defined maximum value however the model does not consider the transmission of this surface runoff to the field edge where it reaches the receiving water body e g drainage ditch or stream in other words drainmod does not consider the lag time or transmission losses of the simulated surface runoff the lag time and transmission losses of the simulated surface runoff to the field edge depend on the field area field slope soil property field cover and field boundary i e buffer strip riparian buffer or a saturated buffer regarding our study although drainmod predicted increased surface runoff for 75 cm shallow drains the actual surface runoff reaching the receiving water body depends on site specific conditions 3 7 2 location evaluating the effect of shallow drains on surface runoff showed that surface runoff increased for 75 cm shallow drains at each of the seven locations averaged across four soils supplementary fig s2 the magnitude of increase in surface runoff varied across locations with the smallest increase of 0 5 cm in lansing and the largest increase of 5 8 cm in baton rouge fig 8 this variation can be explained by the highest annual precipitation of 1572 mm at the baton rouge location compared to the lowest annual precipitation of 857 mm at the lansing location linear regression analyses of surface runoff increase and the 30 year average annual precipitation at seven locations revealed a strong relationship between these two factors r square of 0 82 supplementary fig s4 therefore the adverse effects of shallow drains in increasing surface runoff generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa 3 8 effect of drain depth on the total flow across the region the results showed that 75 cm shallow drains reduced the total flow by 3 4 cm i e combined drainage discharge and surface runoff compared to 125 cm deep drains averaged across all seven locations and four soils table 5 location affected the trade off between reduced drainage discharge section 3 6 2 and increased surface runoff section 3 7 2 for shallow drains primarily due to variation in precipitation across the region shallow drains reduced drainage discharge and increased surface runoff which generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa 3 9 estimating the hydrological benefit of shallow drains 3 9 1 empirical equation for estimating drainage discharge the largest and smallest annual drainage discharge average of shallow and deep drains occurred in baton rouge and lansing respectively which corresponds to the highest and lowest annual precipitation fig 9 a linear regression analysis showed a strong trend of increase in drainage discharge with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa r square 0 97 supplementary fig s5 since annual precipitation is an important predictor of drainage discharge youssef et al 2018 developed an empirical equation for estimating drainage discharge based on annual precipitation the authors conducted regression analysis of drainmod simulations at 48 locations in the midwest usa from 1961 to 1990 dd 29 67 0 6548 p where p is the long term average annual precipitation cm and dd is the long term average annual drainage discharge cm the authors simulations were generated based on one soil type k e 3 5 cm h one drain depth d d 145 cm and one drain spacing s 2740 cm thus their equation is only valid for the design drainage rate or drainage intensity of 2 3 cm day to develop an improved empirical equation for estimating drainage discharge we conducted a stepwise regression analysis of our drainmod simulation data section 2 2 3 using the recent period of 1990 2019 for the regression analysis we simulated the 100 cm drain depth following the procedure outlined in section 2 2 and added the 100 cm depth dataset to the 75 cm and 125 cm datasets to increase the sample size from n 56 to n 84 thereby obtaining a better empirical equation the empirical equation is written as 8 dd 22 0 0 457 p 4 59 ddr 0 00553 s 0 0746 k e where dd is the long term average annual drainage discharge cm p is the long term average annual precipitation cm ddr is the design drainage rate that is equal to drainage intensity when water table midway between laterals is at the soil surface cm day s is the drain spacing cm and k e is the equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile cm day the independent variables of p ddr s and k e were significant predictors whereas drain depth d d and depth to restrictive layer d were not significant predictors at the 0 05 significance level the regression analysis provided an adjusted r square of 0 86 indicating that 86 of the variation in dd can be explained by eq 8 in terms of p ddr s and k e we also evaluated the extent of scatter in the prediction of the empirical equation by comparing empirically predicted dd with the dd values determined in the drainmod simulations supplementary fig s6 the evaluation statistic of nash sutcliffe efficiency was 0 87 1 is perfect and root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio was 0 36 0 is perfect 3 9 2 environmental value of the empirical equation since reducing drainage discharge is the primary method of reducing nitrate load burchell et al 2005 gordon et al 2000 sands et al 2008 an estimate of drainage discharge reduction with shallow drains is a reliable indicator of the nitrate load reduction if p ddr s and k e are available for a specific location in the eastern usa eq 8 can be used to estimate drainage discharge one method of estimating drainage discharge is to choose ddr and d d for a specific field that has a known k e then use the hooghoudt eq 1 to calculate s subsequently ddr s and k e along with the determined p for the specific field can be used in eq 8 to estimate drainage discharge for any location in the eastern usa the environmental value of eq 8 is that it shows the potential of shallow drains for reducing drainage discharge another method for estimating the drainage discharge reduction is using a decision support tool as explained in the next section 3 9 3 decision support tool ghane et al 2021 developed a user friendly online decision support tool entitled drain spacing tool that optimizes drainage design for crop production that tool determines the design drainage rate and optimum drain spacing that maximizes annual return on investment for any location in the midwest usa the empirical eq 8 was incorporated into the drain spacing tool to estimate the long term average annual drainage discharge for a specific drain depth for more information and access to the tool visit https www egr msu edu bae water drainage 4 conclusions this study provides novel insights into the effects of shallow drains on hydrology and profitability of subsurface drainage systems across a wide range of soils and weather conditions in the eastern usa our simulations resulted in key conclusions for the comparison of 75 cm shallow drains installed at a narrower optimum spacing with 125 cm deep drains installed a wider optimum spacing corn yield for shallow drains went from a 1 6 increase to a 1 3 decrease with increasing growing season precipitation from northeast to southeast usa shallow drains resulted in a greater corn yield increase in coarse textured soil than fine textured soil in the eastern usa corn yield for shallow drains increased during dry years 0 6 6 5 whereas yield decreased during wet years shallow drains may protect against potential drought stress in dry years due to shallower water table depth and less drainage discharge shallow drains reduced year to year corn yield variability in the eastern usa corn yield response for shallow drains is site specific it primarily depends on climate soil characteristics dry or wet weather and drainage design depth and spacing shallow drains resulted in a quicker water table drawdown from the surface to 30 cm depth which may be beneficial when high intensity rainfalls cause ponding conditions the drainage discharge reduction under shallow drains generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast usa even though shallow drains provided a benefit from higher corn yield under certain conditions they resulted in lower benefit cost ratio and higher payback period than deep drains nutrient trading programs are needed to increase the adoption of shallow drains in conclusion even though shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains they provide hydrological and environmental benefits that may be of interest to farmers and policymakers another benefit is that shallow drains are not limited to relatively flat fields like controlled drainage shallow drains can be used on rolling or sloping land without any management need

9856,a negative pressure irrigation system npis was tested in 2016 and 2018 to determine the optimum soil water control conditions to improve water productivity wp and fruit quality for greenhouse grown watermelon four levels of negative water pressure 5 10 15 and 20 kpa were imposed continuously to a clay made emitter buried 5 cm under the soil surface during three major stages of greenhouse grown watermelon i ve vine extension 32 days ii ff flowering and fruit setting 16 days iii fm fruit expansion to maturity 28 days which created soil water conditions around the emitter being 96 80 72 and 63 of field capacity respectively except for the testing stages with the four levels of water treatments the water supply during other stages was all set with a constant 10 kpa water pressure a traditional furrow irrigation treatment was included to assess the water saving effects of the npis the irrigation timing used for the furrow irrigation treatment was decided based on the soil water contents corresponding to the 15 kpa treatment under npis the results indicated that with an increase in the negative pressure imposed on the emitters the average daily evapotranspiration linearly decreased for all three stages with the largest decrease occurring during iii fm but the watermelon yield decreased more with the decline in the water supply during vine extension due to the after effects of the reduced vine growth water stress improved watermelon quality by increasing sugar contents during ii ff and reduced acid contents during iii fm moderate water stress resulted in the highest water productivity wp as well as protein and total soluble solid contents in the melon during all three stages comparing the npis with furrow irrigation the water use of the former was 18 3 31 2 less the yield was 6 2 12 0 higher and the wp was improved by 36 6 53 8 the results indicated that npis is a water saving irrigation system and the water pressure of npis can be set at 5 to 10 kpa for vine extension and fruit expansion to maturity stages and 10 to 15 kpa for flowering and fruit setting stage to achieve good quality high wp and relatively stable yield for greenhouse grown melon keywords seepage emitter furrow irrigation watermelon quality water use 1 introduction watermelon is an important horticultural crop and the global watermelon cultivation area was nearly 5 33 million ha in 2017 fao 2017 in china the watermelon cultivation area is approximately 1 86 million ha accounting for 34 9 of the cultivation area in the world and making the country the world s largest watermelon producer fao 2017 watermelon is generally grown during warm seasons which limits its market available time currently growing small size watermelon under greenhouse conditions is becoming popular which makes watermelon available on the market the whole year growing watermelon generally requires an adequate water supply under greenhouse growing conditions watermelon will entirely depend on irrigation water therefore using suitable irrigation technologies and irrigation scheduling to improve water productivity and reduce irrigation water use while maintaining the quality of this fruit is becoming more important due to the increased water shortage problems around the world the usage of water saving irrigation can reduce the waste of water and improve water productivity wp in farmland zhen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 sandu et al 2019 for the purposes of improving irrigation water use efficiency irrigation indicators such as the irrigation amount and the threshold value of soil moisture at different growing stages can be used to establish good irrigation scheduling the irrigation amount can be decided by crop evapotranspiration et around 90 of irrigation water applied to the field is generally consumed in the form of et ding et al 2013 rana and katerji 2000 watermelon is sensitive to water stress and its yield decreases significantly when the water supply is insufficient abdelsattar et al 2019 erdem and yuksel 2003 the results from the studies of abdelsattar et al 2019 rouphael et al 2008 and leskovar et al 2004 indicated that watermelon achieves the highest yield using 100 et as the irrigation volume their results also show that the irrigation volume can be set at 75 of the actual et to maintain the stable production of watermelon when there was not enough irrigation water available the soil water contents soil matric water potential leaf water potential or crop water stress index calculated from the canopy temperature can all be used as indicators of the irrigation starting point and those indicators are referred to as the irrigation threshold values among those indicators soil water condition is a more stable indicator for determining the irrigation starting point olutobi et al 2018 crops usually respond differently to water stress at different growing stages therefore different threshold values are used to guide irrigation application at different growing stages of a crop erdem et al 2006 erdem and yuksel 2003 kumar et al 2019 watermelon is more sensitive to water stress at its flowering and fruit setting stage than at the fruit expansion or vine extension stage and the mature stage is rather insensitive to water stress erdem and yuksel 2003 ma and tian 2016 previous results have shown that soil matric potential should be maintained between 30 kpa and 20 kpa to achieve maximum yield but moderate water stress soil matric water potential at approximately 60 kpa to 50 kpa imposed during the flowering and fruit setting stage only slightly affected the yield of watermelon gonzález et al 2009 water saving irrigation depends not only on good irrigation scheduling but also on an effective irrigation system a negative pressure irrigation system npis buries a special seepage emitter underground regulates the negative pressure of the water supply through a control system and relies on atmospheric pressure and soil capillary suction to maintain a certain soil moisture condition therefore this technology ensures a continuous water supply to crops li et al 2017 the water released from the irrigation system was at a certain depth below the soil surface and the surface soil was kept dry to reduce soil evaporation especially for crops grown inside greenhouses dry soil surfaces can reduce the humidity inside the greenhouse which is beneficial to reduce diseases an npis acts like a subsurface drip irrigation system but has the advantage of providing a continuous water supply to the soil to maintain stable soil moisture and the soil water contents can be controlled by adjusting the npis the water supply from the npis can be adjusted either by mercury column wang et al 2016a 2016b 2019 or by water column pressure li et al 2017 both methods can accurately adjust the appropriate suction of negative pressure water supply to meet the crop water demand without power consumption which effectively reduces water leakage and improves wp li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2014 previous results have shown that compared with traditional irrigation the yield wp and fruit quality of eggplant du et al 2019 li et al 2016 cucumber li et al 2010 tomato li et al 2017 liu et al 2013 and cabbage huang et al 2017 were all significantly improved by using npis technology currently most irrigation schedules for crops are based on traditional water saving irrigation techniques such as drip or sprinkler irrigation and irrigation scheduling especially for an npis is less studied due to its difference from other irrigation systems in its ability to continuously supply water to maintain a stable soil water condition irrigation scheduling for an npis should be separately developed to fully achieve the water saving potentials of npis therefore the objectives of this study were to decide the threshold soil water values at different growing stages of watermelon and to establish an optimized irrigation schedule to provide references in using npis the performance of the watermelon under npis was further compared with that under a traditional furrow irrigation system to assess the water saving effects of npis 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site this study was carried out in a greenhouse from march to june in 2016 and 2018 for two seasons the greenhouse is located at the hebei academy of agriculture and forestry sciences in shijiazhuang city hebei province china 38 14 n 114 39 e elevation of 50 m this site belongs to a warm temperate zone with an annual mean air temperature of 13 2 annual sunshine duration of 2374 h and precipitation of 487 1 mm the plastic greenhouse is a steel frame arched structure covered with dripless polyethylene film the film needs to be replaced every two years and the transmittance of the film is 90 the length of the greenhouse is 30 m the width is 8 m and the direction is east west the soil is loam with a field capacity of 24 5 g g and bulk density of 1 45 g cm3 for the 20 cm top soil layer the soil organic matter was 16 8 g kg and the available n p and k were 80 7 81 6 and 219 mg kg respectively the total soil salt content was 0 11 the saturated soil electrical conductance was 0 38 ms cm and the ph value was 7 6 2 2 the setup of the negative pressure irrigation system npis a negative pressure irrigation system npis was used in this study to automatically control the soil water contents at a certain level the device uses the potential energy difference between external water and soil water to provide irrigation power long et al 2020 li et al 2017 the external water potential is controlled by the pressure regulating pipe the soil water potential is determined by the gravitational potential pressure potential matric potential and osmotic potential when the external water potential is greater than the soil water potential external water enters into soil when the external water potential and the soil water potential are balanced the soil water content remains stable when the plant absorbs water the soil water potential decreases and the external water flows into the soil until the water potential is balanced again long et al 2020 li et al 2017 the components of npis used in this study are shown in fig 1 the major parts of this system are pressure regulating pipe the water supply column and the water seepage devices used as the emitter the three parts were connected by a water delivery pipe installed with a valve the device adjusts the water supply pressure to ρgh ρ is the density of water g is gravitational acceleration h is the height of water level in the pressure regulating pipe through the pressure regulating pipe both the air intake pipe and the pressure regulating pipe are 55 cm the water level of 50 cm in each regulating pipe corresponds to a negative water pressure change of 5 kpa in this study 1 2 3 and 4 regulating pipes were used to adjust the negative pressure to 5 10 15 and 20 kpa respectively the water supply column is 70 cm high which is equivalent to the mariotte bottle the bottom is buried in the ground and the air intake pipe is in the same level with the middle of the emitter so that the pressure in the water supply column is consistent with the water pressure at the air intake pipe a ceramic emitter is used as an interface to transform the potential energy difference between external water and soil water into matrix potential difference the emitter with porosity of 23 4 and bottom sealed is 20 cm long with an inside diameter of 1 cm and an outside diameter of 2 cm it is buried 5 cm below the soil surface it has the characteristics of water permeability but air tightness the open end of the emitter is connected with the water supply pipe all irrigating devices were connected to the 6 m long water supply pipe with a 20 cm distance between each other fig 1a four rows of water supply pipes were installed one row of watermelon the water supply pipes were spaced 10 cm apart and the watermelon plants being 50 cm apart fig 1b based on soil water content monitoring under the 0 kpa water pressure treatment the soil water content was maintained at 25 7 g g in the middle position of the soils surrounding the emitters and under 5 kpa at 23 4 under 10 kpa at 19 5 under 15 kpa at 17 6 and under 20 kpa at 15 4 soil gravimetric water contents respectively the four soil water levels were corresponding to 96 80 72 and 63 of field capacity the four negative pressures created a wide range of soil water contents for the purpose of this study fig 2 shows the correlation of the negative water pressure imposed on the emitter and the actual soil water contents surrounding the emitter 2 3 irrigation scheduling setup watermelon was divided into three growing periods vine extension i ve 32 days after transplanting flowering and fruit setting ii ff 16 days and fruit expansion to maturity iii fm 28 days four water levels of negative water pressure at 5 10 15 and 20 kpa were separately imposed for each of the stages except for the testing stage the negative water pressures at other stages were maintained at 10 kpa table 1 lists the treatments of this study the irrigation schedule for furrow irrigation was set up based on soil water monitoring and the irrigation timing was decided according to the soil water conditions corresponding to the 15 kpa negative water pressure the soil water contents of the top 20 cm of the soil inside the furrow were used to determine the timing of irrigation for each irrigation the furrow was filled with water and the irrigation amount per application was approximately 15 25 mm in total eight irrigations with amounts of 155 mm in 2016 and 175 mm in 2018 were applied to the watermelon using the furrow irrigation method table 1 there were totally 11 treatments established for this study for each treatment there were three replicates three blocks were divided inside the greenhouse for the three replicates of each treatment treatments were randomly arranged inside each block for the npis the plot size used for each replicate of the npis was 6 m in length and 3 m in width with two rows of watermelon for the replicate of the furrow irrigation system the plot size was 6 m in length and 6 m in width with four rows of watermelon planted on ridges with a width of 1 5 m and there was a 20 cm width furrow for irrigation the density of the watermelon was maintained at 18 000 plants ha between two treatments plastic film was used to prevent the lateral water infiltration the plastic film was buried vertically to 60 cm depth before planting 900 kg ha composite fertilizer with n p2o5 k2o at 15 15 15 1500 kg ha superphosphate and 4500 kg ha organic manure were applied as the base fertilizers and after fruit setting the composite fertilizer was again applied at a rate of 300 kg ha for all the treatments in the 2016 season watermelon was transplanted on march 29th and harvested on june 13th in the 2018 season it was transplanted on april 6th and harvested on june 21st before watermelon transplanting a full water supply was applied to ensure that the soil water contents reached field capacity for the top 20 cm soil layer 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 growing conditions and irrigation water use the hourly temperature humidity and radiation were automatically recorded by an automatic weather station rr1024 rainroot beijing china installed in the middle of the greenhouse the photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was measured by photosynthetically active radiation sensor li 190sb li cor lincoln usa the hourly temperature and humidity were measured by temperature and humidity sensors rr10th rainroot beijing china the daily water added to the water supply column to maintain the required water level for each treatment was measured and recorded irrigation water came from a tap water supply system ec 346 μs cm 1 and water applied to each plot was monitored by a water meter for furrow irrigation 2 4 2 canopy size and soil water contents the leaf area index lai was measured at the major growing stages of the watermelon for all plots using a canopy analysis system sunscan uk soil water contents were monitored at the beginning and end of the three growing stages for all replicates down to 80 cm by increments of 10 cm using the soil auger sampling method reynolds 1970 the soil gravimetric water content was determined by drying and weighing the sampled soil which was multiplied by the soil bulk density to obtain the soil volumetric water contents for furrow irrigation extra soil moisture monitoring was performed every 5 days inside the furrow for each plot for the top 20 cm to determine the timing of irrigation this measurement was carried out by a portable tdr 100 meter delta t devices ltd burwell cambridge uk 2 4 3 yield and quality at harvest all fruits were harvested and weighed manually for all plots and every fruit was weighed by an electronic scale with accuracy of 1 g and measuring range of 30 kg tsc e sovo shenzhen chian for each plot three watermelons were randomly selected and fruit quality

by a digital refractometer td 45 zhejiang top co ltd li et al 2018 2 5 calculations 2 5 1 crop water use evapotranspiration and water productivity crop water use or actual evapotranspiration et at a certain growing period or for the whole growing duration was calculated using the water balance equation et irrigation water rainfall soil water depletion drainage runoff capillary rise irrigation water was the recorded water added to the water supply column or the irrigation amount added to the furrow irrigation treatment and soil water depletion was the change in soil water content at the beginning and the end of a growing period for the top 80 cm soil layer due to the small irrigation amount applied each time using the two irrigation systems drainage from the root zone was not observed and taken as zero because the groundwater level is 40 m below the soil surface at the experimental site capillary rise was taken as zero runoff was not observed and rainfall was zero due to the watermelon being grown in a greenhouse therefore et was the sum of irrigation and soil water depletion under the conditions of this study water productivity wp was calculated as the watermelon yield divided by the seasonal et wp yield et 2 5 2 reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc reference evapotranspiration et 0 reflects the comprehensive effect of meteorological factors on evapotranspiration the fao recommended penmen monteith equation was used to calculate the eto grass as the reference crop allen 1998 because the wind speed inside a greenhouse is near zero a modified p m equation under greenhouse conditions based on chen et al 2007 was used in this study as the follows 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 1713 t 273 e s e a 1 64 γ where rn is the net radiation at the

the standard deviation of three replicates for yield yield quality water use and water productivity were separately calculated for each season and for each treatment one way analysis of variance anova

difference level among different treatments in the same season for factors being compared 3 results 3 1 growing conditions inside the greenhouse for the two seasons fig 3 indicates the changes in the daily weather factors inside the greenhouse during the two seasons the seasonal average temperature t relative humidity rh photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd and reference evapotranspiration were 27 1 c 68 1 525 1 µmol m 2 s 1 and 4 52 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively and 29 2 c 54 6 467 0 µmol m 2 s 1 and 4 96 mm d 1 in 2018 respectively for the two seasons the average daily temperature during the middle growing stage in 2018 was higher than that in 2016 resulting in lower relative humidity and higher potential atmospheric evaporation the two seasons had similar weather conditions during the initial and late growing stages 3 2 canopy size under different treatments fig 4 shows that with the increase in the negative water pressure imposed on the emitter the canopy size of the crop showed a significantly declining trend as the results of the two years are consistent only the changes in lai in 2016 are shown here generally the highest lai was achieved with 5 kpa pressure imposed on the emitter at the three stages next was the treatment with 10 kpa pressure ck furrow had lai lower than 10 kpa pressure treatment although both treatments had similar soil water conditions lai of 15 kpa pressure treatment was significantly lower than 10 kpa pressure treatment the lowest soil water treatment with 20 kpa pressure resulted in the largest lai decline at all three stages the results indicated that the canopy size of watermelon was sensitive to soil water conditions and higher soil water conditions improved the leaf growth of the melon there was an after effect of the soil water condition on the lai fig 4 also shows that the difference in the lai among the different treatments at the i ve stage was maintained at the ff and fm stages and the reduction in lai caused by the low soil water condition was not completely compensated for after the improvement in water supply similarly the reduction in lai at ii ff under lower soil water contents was not compensated for when the normal water supply resumed at the iii fm stage water stress at i ve and iii fm resulted in larger lai reduction than ii ff which might be due to the longer growing period of the former than the latter 3 3 water use under different treatments fig 5 shows that with the reduction in the water pressure imposed on the emitter crop water use exhibited a significantly declining trend the daily water consumption gradually increased with increasing canopy size during the first stage of vine extension i ve et was 1 15 1 21 mm d 1 for the i ve10 treatments the et of i ve5 was approximately 23 8 25 2 greater than that of i ve10 and 34 3 51 6 greater than that of the i ve15 and i ve20 treatments during the ii ff stage the et of ff5 was 3 50 3 78 mm d 1 which was 13 8 19 3 greater than that of ff10 the et of ff20 was the lowest among all the treatments with an average value of 1 89 mm d 1 which was 38 0 less than that of ff10 during the two seasons during the iii fm stage the et of fm10 was 3 61 4 66 mm d 1 increased to 4 69 6 23 mm d 1 at fm5 and reduced to 2 22 3 42 mm d 1 at fm15 and 1 62 2 44 mm d 1 ta fm20 fig 6 indicates the positive linear correlation between the daily et of watermelon and soil water availability the results indicated that the et of watermelon would maintain an increasing trend with the increase in soil water conditions more water supply would result in more water consumption by watermelon the results also indicated that the difference among the daily water use gradually increased with the increase in the lai among the four water supply levels 3 4 yield yield quality seasonal water use and water productivity table 2 shows the watermelon yield seasonal water use and water productivity under different treatments the comparison of the furrow and npis indicated that seasonal water use yield and wp under npis was 18 3 31 2 lower 6 2 12 0 higher and 36 6 53 8 greater than those achieved with the traditional furrow irrigation respectively the results were obtained with similar soil water conditions for the two systems which were maintained at approximately 80 of the field capacity the reduction in soil evaporation using the underground emitter would promote water use in crop transpiration which was beneficial to achieving a higher yield and higher wp under the slightly water deficit condition the different water levels imposed on the three stages using the npis significantly affected seasonal et the yield and the wp the yield achieved with imposing 20 kpa water pressure on the emitter was 45 9 61 2 less than the yield achieved by imposing 5 kpa for the vine extension stage the first stage the values were 30 3 38 4 for the second stage and 44 1 48 4 for the third stage the reduction in the water supply resulted in the largest yield reduction at the first stage followed by the third stage and the lowest yield reduction occurred in the second stage although there was a smaller daily et decrease with the reduction in water supply reduced vine growth significantly reduced crop water use afterwards even when the high water supply resumed and the canopy size was not able to reach a reasonable level for high yield production a relatively high and stable yield could be observed with a water pressure set below 10 kpa for the first and third stages and below 15 kpa for the second stage the wp was the highest with the treatment of 10 kpa for stages i and iii and 15 kpa for stage ii therefore considering the wp and yield imposing 5 10 kpa negative water pressure on the emitter for stages i and ii and 10 15 kpa for stage ii would result in higher wp and high and stable yields for greenhouse watermelon the quality of watermelon was affected by the water supply the soluble sugar and protein contents in the watermelons were significantly improved and the organic acid contents were reduced with the reduction in water supply during the second stage treatment with a 10 kpa water supply during the third stage resulted in the highest sugar and protein contents and soluble solids and the most water stressed treatment produced the lowest organic acid content table 3 the results indicated that the recommended negative water pressure imposed on the emitter for achieving a high wp and stable yield would also produce watermelon with good quality 3 5 crop coefficients for watermelon grown in a greenhouse the crop coefficient is affected by the soil water condition irrigation method and canopy size under the npis when the surface soil was kept dry during the whole growth duration of greenhouse watermelon the average kc was 0 41 0 42 during the vine extension period 0 88 0 91 during the flowering and fruit setting period and 1 03 1 08 during the fruit expansion to mature period when the soil water contents being maintained around 96 field capacity table 4 the reduction in the water supply reduced the kc and the changing trend in kc with the soil water content exhibited similar trends as the daily et versus the soil water content as shown in fig 5 under the soil water conditions recommended for the npis water use during the three major growing stages could be determined by the kc et0 method with kc being 0 41 0 80 and 1 08 at the first second and third stages respectively based on the results obtained from the two seasons 4 discussion 4 1 water saving effects of the negative pressure irrigation system npis the general growth characteristics of watermelon under the npis were similar to those under furrow irrigation however the lai value of the npis was significantly higher than that of furrow irrigation with similar soil water conditions this may be because the npis can supply water continuously according to the water demand characteristics of watermelon avoiding the influence of soil moisture alternation on crop growth under furrow irrigation another aspect is that under the npis the unsaturated soil can reduce the capillary water content and the ineffective evaporation on the soil surface nalliah et al 2008 thus this part of the water can be used by the crop as transpiration especially when the water supply is not adequate at the same time the salt content of the soil around the emitter decreased which had leaching effect on the surrounding soil and alleviated the soil salt accumulation wang et al 2016a 2016b the comparison of the furrow and npis indicated that the seasonal water yield and wp achieved with the npis was 18 3 31 2 lower 6 2 12 0 higher and 36 6 53 8 better than those achieved with the traditional furrow irrigation respectively li et al 2017 applied this system to tomato and found that significantly increased yield and reduced water consumption were achieved and the fruit yield and wp were improved by 1 6 8 2 and 9 9 30 5 respectively compared with those under drip irrigation the npis has the advantage of maintaining a continuous supply of water and reducing soil evaporation and finally achieving high yield and high water use efficiency in crop production 4 2 irrigation scheduling based on the different responses to water stress a negative pressure irrigation system can accurately control soil moisture and maintain a continuous water supply which is different from other traditional irrigation systems li et al 2017 gao et al 2019 yang et al 2020 therefore it is important to design a suitable water supply level that benefits production as well as water productivity the results in this study showed that there was a slight difference among the three stages in response to the negative water pressure imposed on the emitter the negative water pressure imposed on the emitter should not be lower than 10 kpa during vine extension and fruit expansion to the mature stage and during the flowering and fruit setting stage the value should not be lower than 15 kpa the results indicated that the first and third stages were more sensitive to water stress and the second stage was less sensitive to water stress the result agreed with the findings of abdelsattar et al 2019 and gonzález et al 2009 in watermelon and duran et al 2021 in melon while erdem and yuksel 2003 suggested that flowering and fruit setting stage and fruit expanding stage were more sensitive the reason for the difference may be that the water consumption of different irrigation methods were slightly different the low water supply during vine extension significantly reduced vine growth resulting in a smaller lai fig 4 the reduction in vine growth might also inhibit the uptake of soil nutrients which might negatively affect fruit growth afterwards resuming the water supply afterwards was not able to promote vine growth to its normal level therefore a significant yield reduction was observed the fruit expansion period was generally sensitive to water stress especially for fresh fruit with large size types abdelsattar et al 2019 duran et al 2021 the soil water content threshold value obtained from this study using the npis was slightly higher than that obtained using traditional irrigation methods abdelsattar et al 2019 erdem and yuksel 2003 soil water changes under the traditional irrigation method were generally in a range and the low limit of this range was taken as the threshold for deciding irrigation the npis can supply water continuously and the soil water contents around the emitter are maintained at a stable level this level was higher than the low limit of the soil water range for traditional irrigation methods therefore the soil water contents under the npis were greater than the threshold value for deciding the irrigation timing of other irrigation methods 4 3 water melon quality under different treatments the results from this study showed that the soluble sugar protein and soluble solid contents increased gradually and the soluble acid content decreased gradually with the decrease in the water pressure imposed on the emitter during the flowering and fruit setting stage many previous studies indicated that moderate water deficit would improve fruit quality duran et al 2021 wu et al 2021 liu et al 2014 showed that medium frequency irrigation at mature stage could significantly improve the contents of soluble solids soluble protein and vc of watermelon at the mature stage the soluble sugar protein and soluble solid contents were the highest under water supply suction of 10 kpa a further reduction in the water supply would reduce the formation of carbohydrates which would reduce the sugar or protein contents in the watermelon fruit the result from this study was consistent with the previous results li et al 2018 abdelsattar et al 2019 full water supply without water stress generally reduces the quality of watermelon at the mature stage in line with the result of şimşek et al 2004 this was mainly due to an increasing in water uptake and a dilution of soluble solid in the fruits hui et al 2017 4 4 irrigation systems and growing conditions affecting crop coefficients in the present study in accordance with the et and et0 of watermelon the kc values suitable for irrigation were determined to be 0 41 0 42 during vine extension 0 72 0 76 during the flowering and fruit setting period and 0 80 1 08 during fruit expansion to the mature period previous reports allen et al 1998 shukla et al 2014 revealed a larger kc than that found in the present study possibly because the water consumption under negative pressure irrigation is less than that of traditional irrigation methods such as drip irrigation and furrow irrigation thus the kc value determined in the present study differed from that in previous studies the kc results obtained from previous studies were based on sufficient irrigation conditions which may cause extravagant water consumption including soil evaporation in the present study the appropriate kc value instead of the maximum was obtained without affecting the growth and yield of the crop 4 5 advantages and disadvantages of npis the soil water contents of traditional irrigation methods such as furrow irrigation drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation vary from high after irrigation to low before irrigation and root water uptake is also adjusted according to the soil water content that is the crop is in the passive water demand state li et al 2017 negative pressure irrigation uses a special water feeder to maintain the balance among forces such as soil water absorption atmospheric pressure and water tension to reach a stable soil water content by adjusting water supply that is crops can actively demand water according to their growth state compared with precision irrigation based on electronic sensors and evapotranspiration models miller et al 2014 sharma et al 2017 negative pressure irrigation can provide real time water supply according to crop water demand without energy consumption and without the predetermination of many parameters saving energy and equipment investment cost and achieving precision irrigation more simply li et al 2017 gao et al 2019 yang et al 2020 clogging is generally a problem that should be taken care of when using low flow irrigation systems in this study tap water was used which eliminate the filtration issue to the irrigation water if other water sources being used for the npis a good filter should be used to clean the water before and after irrigation season the infiltration pipe should be cleaned with hydrochloric acid to remove the precipitation formed by calcium and magnesium salts in the pipe peragón et al 2017 pitts et al 1986 salinity might be another issue using the npis soil osmotic potential is a component of soil water potential the change in soil osmotic potential will cause the changes in soil water potential and then cause the changes in water supply fresh water should be used for the npis and it was suggested that flooding irrigation be applied to leach soil salt when salt accumulated to a certain level wang et al 2016a 2016b the negative pressure irrigation is a new type of irrigation system and the whole system needs to be manufactured and installed manually which increases the cost in irrigation during irrigation it is necessary to maintain the sealing of the whole system to prevent air from entering the pipeline and forming an air embolism regular inspection is needed to eliminate air in the pipeline compared with traditional water saving irrigation methods such as drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation or surface irrigation this system needs skill for operation and maintenance although the system is expensive its water saving effect is significant and therefore can be considered for use in serious water shortage areas 5 conclusion the results obtained from this study indicated a significant reduction in water consumption and increased wp achieved using the npis compared with furrow irrigation the negative water pressure imposed on the emitters under npis can be further regulated based on the water requirements of watermelon during its different growth stages to improve wp and fruit quality the findings of this study indicated that this new type of irrigation system can be used in water shortage regions to reduce irrigation water use in growing cash crops using an optimized irrigation scheduling besides the water saving effects the use of the npis has the advantage of reducing air humidity inside the greenhouse due to the buried emitters reduce the soil evaporation a reduction in humidity would be beneficial for disease control of crops grown in greenhouse conditions the continuous low water supply under npis also avoids deep drainage that usually occurs when a large amount of water is applied to the crop one time using traditional irrigation methods using npis not only saves water but also has the advantages to improve fruit quality and reduce the non point pollution risks for greenhouse grown crops the disadvantages of this irrigation system include the high cost in installment and maintenance more research could be done in the future to reduce the cost of this system and make it easier and cheaper for practical use

9856,a negative pressure irrigation system npis was tested in 2016 and 2018 to determine the optimum soil water control conditions to improve water productivity wp and fruit quality for greenhouse grown watermelon four levels of negative water pressure 5 10 15 and 20 kpa were imposed continuously to a clay made emitter buried 5 cm under the soil surface during three major stages of greenhouse grown watermelon i ve vine extension 32 days ii ff flowering and fruit setting 16 days iii fm fruit expansion to maturity 28 days which created soil water conditions around the emitter being 96 80 72 and 63 of field capacity respectively except for the testing stages with the four levels of water treatments the water supply during other stages was all set with a constant 10 kpa water pressure a traditional furrow irrigation treatment was included to assess the water saving effects of the npis the irrigation timing used for the furrow irrigation treatment was decided based on the soil water contents corresponding to the 15 kpa treatment under npis the results indicated that with an increase in the negative pressure imposed on the emitters the average daily evapotranspiration linearly decreased for all three stages with the largest decrease occurring during iii fm but the watermelon yield decreased more with the decline in the water supply during vine extension due to the after effects of the reduced vine growth water stress improved watermelon quality by increasing sugar contents during ii ff and reduced acid contents during iii fm moderate water stress resulted in the highest water productivity wp as well as protein and total soluble solid contents in the melon during all three stages comparing the npis with furrow irrigation the water use of the former was 18 3 31 2 less the yield was 6 2 12 0 higher and the wp was improved by 36 6 53 8 the results indicated that npis is a water saving irrigation system and the water pressure of npis can be set at 5 to 10 kpa for vine extension and fruit expansion to maturity stages and 10 to 15 kpa for flowering and fruit setting stage to achieve good quality high wp and relatively stable yield for greenhouse grown melon keywords seepage emitter furrow irrigation watermelon quality water use 1 introduction watermelon is an important horticultural crop and the global watermelon cultivation area was nearly 5 33 million ha in 2017 fao 2017 in china the watermelon cultivation area is approximately 1 86 million ha accounting for 34 9 of the cultivation area in the world and making the country the world s largest watermelon producer fao 2017 watermelon is generally grown during warm seasons which limits its market available time currently growing small size watermelon under greenhouse conditions is becoming popular which makes watermelon available on the market the whole year growing watermelon generally requires an adequate water supply under greenhouse growing conditions watermelon will entirely depend on irrigation water therefore using suitable irrigation technologies and irrigation scheduling to improve water productivity and reduce irrigation water use while maintaining the quality of this fruit is becoming more important due to the increased water shortage problems around the world the usage of water saving irrigation can reduce the waste of water and improve water productivity wp in farmland zhen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 sandu et al 2019 for the purposes of improving irrigation water use efficiency irrigation indicators such as the irrigation amount and the threshold value of soil moisture at different growing stages can be used to establish good irrigation scheduling the irrigation amount can be decided by crop evapotranspiration et around 90 of irrigation water applied to the field is generally consumed in the form of et ding et al 2013 rana and katerji 2000 watermelon is sensitive to water stress and its yield decreases significantly when the water supply is insufficient abdelsattar et al 2019 erdem and yuksel 2003 the results from the studies of abdelsattar et al 2019 rouphael et al 2008 and leskovar et al 2004 indicated that watermelon achieves the highest yield using 100 et as the irrigation volume their results also show that the irrigation volume can be set at 75 of the actual et to maintain the stable production of watermelon when there was not enough irrigation water available the soil water contents soil matric water potential leaf water potential or crop water stress index calculated from the canopy temperature can all be used as indicators of the irrigation starting point and those indicators are referred to as the irrigation threshold values among those indicators soil water condition is a more stable indicator for determining the irrigation starting point olutobi et al 2018 crops usually respond differently to water stress at different growing stages therefore different threshold values are used to guide irrigation application at different growing stages of a crop erdem et al 2006 erdem and yuksel 2003 kumar et al 2019 watermelon is more sensitive to water stress at its flowering and fruit setting stage than at the fruit expansion or vine extension stage and the mature stage is rather insensitive to water stress erdem and yuksel 2003 ma and tian 2016 previous results have shown that soil matric potential should be maintained between 30 kpa and 20 kpa to achieve maximum yield but moderate water stress soil matric water potential at approximately 60 kpa to 50 kpa imposed during the flowering and fruit setting stage only slightly affected the yield of watermelon gonzález et al 2009 water saving irrigation depends not only on good irrigation scheduling but also on an effective irrigation system a negative pressure irrigation system npis buries a special seepage emitter underground regulates the negative pressure of the water supply through a control system and relies on atmospheric pressure and soil capillary suction to maintain a certain soil moisture condition therefore this technology ensures a continuous water supply to crops li et al 2017 the water released from the irrigation system was at a certain depth below the soil surface and the surface soil was kept dry to reduce soil evaporation especially for crops grown inside greenhouses dry soil surfaces can reduce the humidity inside the greenhouse which is beneficial to reduce diseases an npis acts like a subsurface drip irrigation system but has the advantage of providing a continuous water supply to the soil to maintain stable soil moisture and the soil water contents can be controlled by adjusting the npis the water supply from the npis can be adjusted either by mercury column wang et al 2016a 2016b 2019 or by water column pressure li et al 2017 both methods can accurately adjust the appropriate suction of negative pressure water supply to meet the crop water demand without power consumption which effectively reduces water leakage and improves wp li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 2014 previous results have shown that compared with traditional irrigation the yield wp and fruit quality of eggplant du et al 2019 li et al 2016 cucumber li et al 2010 tomato li et al 2017 liu et al 2013 and cabbage huang et al 2017 were all significantly improved by using npis technology currently most irrigation schedules for crops are based on traditional water saving irrigation techniques such as drip or sprinkler irrigation and irrigation scheduling especially for an npis is less studied due to its difference from other irrigation systems in its ability to continuously supply water to maintain a stable soil water condition irrigation scheduling for an npis should be separately developed to fully achieve the water saving potentials of npis therefore the objectives of this study were to decide the threshold soil water values at different growing stages of watermelon and to establish an optimized irrigation schedule to provide references in using npis the performance of the watermelon under npis was further compared with that under a traditional furrow irrigation system to assess the water saving effects of npis 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site this study was carried out in a greenhouse from march to june in 2016 and 2018 for two seasons the greenhouse is located at the hebei academy of agriculture and forestry sciences in shijiazhuang city hebei province china 38 14 n 114 39 e elevation of 50 m this site belongs to a warm temperate zone with an annual mean air temperature of 13 2 annual sunshine duration of 2374 h and precipitation of 487 1 mm the plastic greenhouse is a steel frame arched structure covered with dripless polyethylene film the film needs to be replaced every two years and the transmittance of the film is 90 the length of the greenhouse is 30 m the width is 8 m and the direction is east west the soil is loam with a field capacity of 24 5 g g and bulk density of 1 45 g cm3 for the 20 cm top soil layer the soil organic matter was 16 8 g kg and the available n p and k were 80 7 81 6 and 219 mg kg respectively the total soil salt content was 0 11 the saturated soil electrical conductance was 0 38 ms cm and the ph value was 7 6 2 2 the setup of the negative pressure irrigation system npis a negative pressure irrigation system npis was used in this study to automatically control the soil water contents at a certain level the device uses the potential energy difference between external water and soil water to provide irrigation power long et al 2020 li et al 2017 the external water potential is controlled by the pressure regulating pipe the soil water potential is determined by the gravitational potential pressure potential matric potential and osmotic potential when the external water potential is greater than the soil water potential external water enters into soil when the external water potential and the soil water potential are balanced the soil water content remains stable when the plant absorbs water the soil water potential decreases and the external water flows into the soil until the water potential is balanced again long et al 2020 li et al 2017 the components of npis used in this study are shown in fig 1 the major parts of this system are pressure regulating pipe the water supply column and the water seepage devices used as the emitter the three parts were connected by a water delivery pipe installed with a valve the device adjusts the water supply pressure to ρgh ρ is the density of water g is gravitational acceleration h is the height of water level in the pressure regulating pipe through the pressure regulating pipe both the air intake pipe and the pressure regulating pipe are 55 cm the water level of 50 cm in each regulating pipe corresponds to a negative water pressure change of 5 kpa in this study 1 2 3 and 4 regulating pipes were used to adjust the negative pressure to 5 10 15 and 20 kpa respectively the water supply column is 70 cm high which is equivalent to the mariotte bottle the bottom is buried in the ground and the air intake pipe is in the same level with the middle of the emitter so that the pressure in the water supply column is consistent with the water pressure at the air intake pipe a ceramic emitter is used as an interface to transform the potential energy difference between external water and soil water into matrix potential difference the emitter with porosity of 23 4 and bottom sealed is 20 cm long with an inside diameter of 1 cm and an outside diameter of 2 cm it is buried 5 cm below the soil surface it has the characteristics of water permeability but air tightness the open end of the emitter is connected with the water supply pipe all irrigating devices were connected to the 6 m long water supply pipe with a 20 cm distance between each other fig 1a four rows of water supply pipes were installed one row of watermelon the water supply pipes were spaced 10 cm apart and the watermelon plants being 50 cm apart fig 1b based on soil water content monitoring under the 0 kpa water pressure treatment the soil water content was maintained at 25 7 g g in the middle position of the soils surrounding the emitters and under 5 kpa at 23 4 under 10 kpa at 19 5 under 15 kpa at 17 6 and under 20 kpa at 15 4 soil gravimetric water contents respectively the four soil water levels were corresponding to 96 80 72 and 63 of field capacity the four negative pressures created a wide range of soil water contents for the purpose of this study fig 2 shows the correlation of the negative water pressure imposed on the emitter and the actual soil water contents surrounding the emitter 2 3 irrigation scheduling setup watermelon was divided into three growing periods vine extension i ve 32 days after transplanting flowering and fruit setting ii ff 16 days and fruit expansion to maturity iii fm 28 days four water levels of negative water pressure at 5 10 15 and 20 kpa were separately imposed for each of the stages except for the testing stage the negative water pressures at other stages were maintained at 10 kpa table 1 lists the treatments of this study the irrigation schedule for furrow irrigation was set up based on soil water monitoring and the irrigation timing was decided according to the soil water conditions corresponding to the 15 kpa negative water pressure the soil water contents of the top 20 cm of the soil inside the furrow were used to determine the timing of irrigation for each irrigation the furrow was filled with water and the irrigation amount per application was approximately 15 25 mm in total eight irrigations with amounts of 155 mm in 2016 and 175 mm in 2018 were applied to the watermelon using the furrow irrigation method table 1 there were totally 11 treatments established for this study for each treatment there were three replicates three blocks were divided inside the greenhouse for the three replicates of each treatment treatments were randomly arranged inside each block for the npis the plot size used for each replicate of the npis was 6 m in length and 3 m in width with two rows of watermelon for the replicate of the furrow irrigation system the plot size was 6 m in length and 6 m in width with four rows of watermelon planted on ridges with a width of 1 5 m and there was a 20 cm width furrow for irrigation the density of the watermelon was maintained at 18 000 plants ha between two treatments plastic film was used to prevent the lateral water infiltration the plastic film was buried vertically to 60 cm depth before planting 900 kg ha composite fertilizer with n p2o5 k2o at 15 15 15 1500 kg ha superphosphate and 4500 kg ha organic manure were applied as the base fertilizers and after fruit setting the composite fertilizer was again applied at a rate of 300 kg ha for all the treatments in the 2016 season watermelon was transplanted on march 29th and harvested on june 13th in the 2018 season it was transplanted on april 6th and harvested on june 21st before watermelon transplanting a full water supply was applied to ensure that the soil water contents reached field capacity for the top 20 cm soil layer 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 growing conditions and irrigation water use the hourly temperature humidity and radiation were

water added to the water supply column to maintain the required water level for each treatment was measured and recorded irrigation water came from a tap water supply system ec 346 μs cm 1 and water applied to each plot was monitored by a water meter for furrow irrigation 2 4 2 canopy size and soil water contents the leaf area index lai was measured at the major growing stages of the watermelon for all plots using a canopy analysis system sunscan uk soil water contents were monitored at the beginning and end of the three growing stages for all replicates down to 80 cm by increments of 10 cm using the soil auger sampling method reynolds 1970 the soil gravimetric water content was determined by drying and weighing the sampled soil which was multiplied by the soil bulk density to obtain the soil volumetric water contents for furrow irrigation extra soil moisture monitoring was performed every 5 days inside the furrow for each plot for the top 20 cm to determine the timing of irrigation this measurement was carried out by a portable tdr 100 meter delta t devices ltd burwell cambridge uk 2 4 3 yield and quality at harvest all fruits were harvested and weighed manually for all plots

by a digital refractometer td 45 zhejiang top co ltd li et al 2018 2 5 calculations 2 5 1 crop water use evapotranspiration and water productivity crop water use or actual evapotranspiration et at a certain growing period or for the whole growing duration was calculated using the water balance equation et irrigation water rainfall soil water depletion drainage runoff capillary rise irrigation water was the recorded water added to the water supply column or the irrigation amount added to the furrow irrigation treatment and soil water depletion was the change in soil water content at the beginning and the end of a growing period for the top 80 cm soil layer due to the small irrigation amount applied each time using the two irrigation systems drainage from the root zone was not observed and taken as zero because the groundwater level is 40 m below the soil surface at the experimental site capillary rise was taken as zero runoff was not observed and rainfall was zero due to the watermelon being grown in a greenhouse therefore et was the sum of irrigation and soil water depletion under the conditions of this study water productivity wp was calculated as the watermelon yield divided by the seasonal et wp yield et 2 5 2 reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc reference evapotranspiration et 0 reflects the comprehensive effect of meteorological factors on evapotranspiration the fao recommended penmen monteith equation was used to calculate the eto grass as the reference crop allen 1998 because the wind speed inside a greenhouse is near zero a modified p m equation under greenhouse conditions based on chen et al 2007 was used in this study as the follows 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 1713 t 273 e s e a 1 64 γ where rn is the net radiation at the

daily weather factors inside the greenhouse during the two seasons the seasonal average temperature t relative humidity rh photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd and reference evapotranspiration were 27 1 c 68 1 525 1 µmol m 2 s 1 and 4 52 mm d 1 in 2016 respectively and 29 2 c 54 6 467 0 µmol m 2 s 1 and 4 96 mm d 1 in 2018 respectively for the two seasons the average daily temperature during the middle growing stage in 2018 was higher than that in 2016 resulting in lower relative humidity and higher potential atmospheric evaporation the two seasons had similar weather conditions during the initial and late growing stages 3 2 canopy size under different treatments fig 4 shows that with the increase in the negative water pressure imposed on the emitter the canopy size of the crop showed a significantly declining trend as the results of the two years are consistent only the changes in lai in 2016 are shown here generally the highest lai was achieved with 5 kpa pressure imposed on the emitter at the three stages next was the treatment with 10 kpa pressure ck furrow had lai lower than 10 kpa pressure treatment although both treatments had similar soil water conditions lai of 15 kpa pressure treatment was significantly lower than 10 kpa pressure treatment the lowest soil water treatment with 20 kpa pressure resulted in the largest lai decline at all three stages the results indicated that the canopy size of watermelon was sensitive to soil water conditions and higher soil water conditions improved the leaf growth of the melon there was an after effect of the soil water condition on the lai fig 4 also shows that the difference in the lai among the different treatments at the i ve stage was maintained at the ff and fm stages and the reduction in lai caused by the low soil water condition was not completely compensated for after the improvement in water supply similarly the reduction in lai at ii ff under lower soil water contents was not compensated for when the normal water supply resumed at the iii fm stage water stress at i ve and iii fm resulted in larger lai reduction than ii ff which might be due to the longer growing period of the former than the latter 3 3 water use under different treatments fig 5 shows that with the reduction in the water pressure imposed on the emitter crop water use exhibited a significantly declining trend the daily water consumption gradually increased with increasing canopy size during the first stage of vine extension i ve et was 1 15 1 21 mm d 1 for the i ve10 treatments the et of i ve5 was approximately 23 8 25 2 greater than that of i ve10 and 34 3 51 6 greater than that of the i ve15 and i ve20 treatments during the ii ff stage the et of ff5 was 3 50 3 78 mm d 1 which was 13 8 19 3 greater than that of ff10 the et of ff20 was the lowest among all the treatments with an average value of 1 89 mm d 1 which was 38 0 less than that of ff10 during the two seasons during the iii fm stage the et of fm10 was 3 61 4 66 mm d 1 increased to 4 69 6 23 mm d 1 at fm5 and reduced to 2 22 3 42 mm d 1 at fm15 and 1 62 2 44 mm d 1 ta fm20 fig 6 indicates the positive linear correlation between the daily et of watermelon and soil water availability the results indicated that the et of watermelon would maintain an increasing trend with the increase in soil water conditions more water supply would result in more water consumption by watermelon the results also indicated that the difference among the daily water use gradually increased with the increase in the lai among the four water supply levels 3 4 yield yield quality seasonal water use and water productivity table 2 shows the watermelon yield seasonal water use and water productivity under different treatments the comparison of the furrow and npis indicated that seasonal water use yield and wp under npis was 18 3 31 2 lower 6 2 12 0 higher and 36 6 53 8 greater than those achieved with the traditional furrow irrigation respectively the results were obtained with similar soil water conditions for the two systems which were maintained at approximately 80 of the field capacity the reduction in soil evaporation using the underground emitter would promote water use in crop transpiration which was beneficial to achieving a higher yield and higher wp under the slightly water deficit condition the different water levels imposed on the three stages using the npis significantly affected seasonal et the yield and the wp the yield achieved with imposing 20 kpa water pressure on the emitter was 45 9 61 2 less than the yield achieved by imposing 5 kpa for the vine extension stage the first stage the values were 30 3 38 4 for the second stage and 44 1 48 4 for the third stage the reduction in the water supply resulted in the largest yield reduction at the first stage followed by the third stage and the lowest yield reduction occurred in the second stage although there was a smaller daily et decrease with the reduction in water supply reduced vine growth significantly reduced crop water use afterwards even when the high water supply resumed and the canopy size was not able to reach a reasonable level for high yield production a relatively high and stable yield could be observed with a water pressure set below 10 kpa for the first and third stages and below 15 kpa for the second stage the wp was the highest with the treatment of 10 kpa for stages i and iii and 15 kpa for stage ii therefore considering the wp and yield imposing 5 10 kpa negative water pressure on the emitter for stages i and ii and 10 15 kpa for stage ii would result in higher wp and high and stable yields for greenhouse watermelon the quality of watermelon was affected by the water supply the soluble sugar and protein contents in the watermelons were significantly improved and the organic acid contents were reduced with the reduction in water supply during the second stage treatment with a 10 kpa water supply during the third stage resulted in the highest sugar and protein contents and soluble solids and the most water stressed treatment produced the lowest organic acid content table 3 the results indicated that the recommended negative water pressure imposed on the emitter for achieving a high wp and stable yield would also produce watermelon with good quality 3 5 crop coefficients for watermelon grown in a greenhouse the crop coefficient is affected by the soil water condition irrigation method and canopy size under the npis when the surface soil was kept dry during the whole growth duration of greenhouse watermelon the average kc was 0 41 0 42 during the vine extension period 0 88 0 91 during the flowering and fruit setting period and 1 03 1 08 during the fruit expansion to mature period when the soil water contents being maintained around 96 field capacity table 4 the reduction in the water supply reduced the kc and the changing trend in kc with the soil water content exhibited similar trends as the daily et versus the soil water content as shown in fig 5 under the soil water conditions recommended for the npis water use during the three major growing stages could be determined by the kc et0 method with kc being 0 41 0 80 and 1 08 at the first second and third stages respectively based on the results obtained from the two seasons 4 discussion 4 1 water saving effects of the negative pressure irrigation system npis the general growth characteristics of watermelon under the npis were similar to those under furrow irrigation however the lai value of the npis was significantly higher than that of furrow irrigation with similar soil water conditions this may be because the npis can supply water continuously according to the water demand characteristics of watermelon avoiding the influence of soil moisture alternation on crop growth under furrow irrigation another aspect is that under the npis the unsaturated soil can reduce the capillary water content and the ineffective evaporation on the soil surface nalliah et al 2008 thus this part of the water can be used by the crop as transpiration especially when the water supply is not adequate at the same time the salt content of the soil around the emitter decreased which had leaching effect on the surrounding soil and alleviated the soil salt accumulation wang et al 2016a 2016b the comparison of the furrow and npis indicated that the seasonal water yield and wp achieved with the npis was 18 3 31 2 lower 6 2 12 0 higher and 36 6 53 8 better than those achieved with the traditional furrow irrigation respectively li et al 2017 applied this system to tomato and found that significantly increased yield and reduced water consumption were achieved and the fruit yield and wp were improved by 1 6 8 2 and 9 9 30 5 respectively compared with those under drip irrigation the npis has the advantage of maintaining a continuous supply of water and reducing soil evaporation and finally achieving high yield and high water use efficiency in crop production 4 2 irrigation scheduling based on the different responses to water stress a negative pressure irrigation system can accurately control soil moisture and maintain a continuous water supply which is different from other traditional irrigation systems li et al 2017 gao et al 2019 yang et al 2020 therefore it is important to design a suitable water supply level that benefits production as well as water productivity the results in this study showed that there was a slight difference among the three stages in response to the negative water pressure imposed on the emitter the negative water pressure imposed on the emitter should not be lower than 10 kpa during vine extension and fruit expansion to the mature stage and during the flowering and fruit setting stage the value should not be lower than 15 kpa the results indicated that the first and third stages were more sensitive to water stress and the second stage was less sensitive to water stress the result agreed with the findings of abdelsattar et al 2019 and gonzález et al 2009 in watermelon and duran et al 2021 in melon while erdem and yuksel 2003 suggested that flowering and fruit setting stage and fruit expanding stage were more sensitive the reason for the difference may be that the water consumption of different irrigation methods were slightly different the low water supply during vine extension significantly reduced vine growth resulting in a smaller lai fig 4 the reduction in vine growth might also inhibit the uptake of soil nutrients which might negatively affect fruit growth afterwards resuming the water supply afterwards was not able to promote vine growth to its normal level therefore a significant yield reduction was observed the fruit expansion period was generally sensitive to water stress especially for fresh fruit with large size types abdelsattar et al 2019 duran et al 2021 the soil water content threshold value obtained from this study using the npis was slightly higher than that obtained using traditional irrigation methods abdelsattar et al 2019 erdem and yuksel 2003 soil water changes under the traditional irrigation method were generally in a range and the low limit of this range was taken as the threshold for deciding irrigation the npis can supply water continuously and the soil water contents around the emitter are maintained at a stable level this level was higher than the low limit of the soil water range for traditional irrigation methods therefore the soil water contents under the npis were greater than the threshold value for deciding the irrigation timing of other irrigation methods 4 3 water melon quality under different treatments the results from this study showed that the soluble sugar protein and soluble solid contents increased gradually and the soluble acid content decreased gradually with the decrease in the water pressure imposed on the emitter during the flowering and fruit setting stage many previous studies indicated that moderate water deficit would improve fruit quality duran et al 2021 wu et al 2021 liu et al 2014 showed that medium frequency irrigation at mature stage could significantly improve the contents of soluble solids soluble protein and vc of watermelon at the mature stage the soluble sugar protein and soluble solid contents were the highest under water supply suction of 10 kpa a further reduction in the water supply would reduce the formation of carbohydrates which would reduce the sugar or protein contents in the watermelon fruit the result from this study was consistent with the previous results li et al 2018 abdelsattar et al 2019 full water supply without water stress generally reduces the quality of watermelon at the mature stage in line with the result of şimşek et al 2004 this was mainly due to an increasing in water uptake and a dilution of soluble solid in the fruits hui et al 2017 4 4 irrigation systems and growing conditions affecting crop coefficients in the present study in accordance with the et and et0 of watermelon the kc values suitable for irrigation were determined to be 0 41 0 42 during vine extension 0 72 0 76 during the flowering and fruit setting period and 0 80 1 08 during fruit expansion to the mature period previous reports allen et al 1998 shukla et al 2014 revealed a larger kc than that found in the present study possibly because the water consumption under negative pressure irrigation is less than that of traditional irrigation methods such as drip irrigation and furrow irrigation thus the kc value determined in the present study differed from that in previous studies the kc results obtained from previous studies were based on sufficient irrigation conditions which may cause extravagant water consumption including soil evaporation in the present study the appropriate kc value instead of the maximum was obtained without affecting the growth and yield of the crop 4 5 advantages and disadvantages of npis the soil water contents of traditional irrigation methods such as furrow irrigation drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation vary from high after irrigation to low before irrigation and root water uptake is also adjusted according to the soil water content that is the crop is in the passive water demand state li et al 2017 negative pressure irrigation uses a special water feeder to maintain the balance among forces such as soil water absorption atmospheric pressure and water tension to reach a stable soil water content by adjusting water supply that is crops can actively demand water according to their growth state compared with precision irrigation based on electronic sensors and evapotranspiration models miller et al 2014 sharma et al 2017 negative pressure irrigation can provide real time water supply according to crop water demand without energy consumption and without the predetermination of many parameters saving energy and equipment investment cost and achieving precision irrigation more simply li et al 2017 gao et al 2019 yang et al 2020 clogging is generally a problem that should be taken care of when using low flow irrigation systems in this study tap water was used which eliminate the filtration issue to the irrigation water if other water sources being used for the npis a good filter should be used to clean the water before and after irrigation season the infiltration pipe should be cleaned with hydrochloric acid to remove the precipitation formed by calcium and magnesium salts in the pipe peragón et al 2017 pitts et al 1986 salinity might be another issue using the npis soil osmotic potential is a component of soil water potential the change in soil osmotic potential will cause the changes in soil water potential and then cause the changes in water supply fresh water should be used for the npis and it was suggested that flooding irrigation be applied to leach soil salt when salt accumulated to a certain level wang et al 2016a 2016b the negative pressure irrigation is a new type of irrigation system and the whole system needs to be manufactured and installed manually which increases the cost in irrigation during irrigation it is necessary to maintain the sealing of the whole system to prevent air from entering the pipeline and forming an air embolism regular inspection is needed to eliminate air in the pipeline compared with traditional water saving irrigation methods such as drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation or surface irrigation this system needs skill for operation and maintenance although the system is expensive its water saving effect is significant and therefore can be considered for use in serious water shortage areas 5 conclusion the results obtained from this study indicated a significant reduction in water consumption and increased wp achieved using the npis compared with furrow irrigation the negative water pressure imposed on the emitters under npis can be further regulated based on the water requirements of watermelon during its different growth stages to improve wp and fruit quality the findings of this study indicated that this new type of irrigation system can be used in water shortage regions to reduce irrigation water use in growing cash crops using an optimized irrigation scheduling besides the water saving effects the use of the npis has the advantage of reducing air humidity inside the greenhouse due to the buried emitters reduce the soil evaporation a reduction in humidity would be beneficial for disease control of crops grown in greenhouse conditions the continuous low water supply under npis also avoids deep drainage that usually occurs when a large amount of water is applied to the crop one time using traditional irrigation methods using npis not only saves water but also has the advantages to improve fruit quality and reduce the non point pollution risks for greenhouse grown crops the disadvantages of this irrigation system include the high cost in installment and maintenance more research could be done in the future to reduce the cost of this system and make it easier and cheaper for practical use

9857,cropping system models are widely used to assess the impacts of and adaptation practices to climate change on agricultural production however crop growth simulations at large scales have often lacked consideration of variation in crop cultivars which were represented by different sets of genetic coefficients in crops models in this study taking the phenology of spring wheat triticum aestivum l as an example we compared four different strategies for upscaling genetic parameters in phenology simulations at large scales with two experimental datasets the first dataset was from field experiments comprising 40 different spring wheat cultivars at altay 2014 and yangling 2015 2017 station the second dataset was historical 2010 2014 observed phenology records from 57 national agro meteorological observation stations in china the four strategies were the representative cultivar estimated at a single site ssps the representative cultivar estimated at the 57 sites nrps the various representative cultivars estimated at different agro ecological zones rrps and the virtual cultivars generated from the posterior distributions vcps the posterior distributions aforesaid were established based on the calibrated parameter values of the 40 different spring wheat cultivars planted in yangling then 1000 sets of vcps were randomly sampled from the posterior distributions the results indicated that both the ssps and nrps strategy obtained large errors and uncertainties in spring wheat phenology simulations in china since only one representative cultivar was used the rrps strategy achieved the second high and the highest accuracy in anthesis and maturity data simulations the vcps strategy obtained the highest accuracy in anthesis simulation but relative larger errors in maturity simulation the vcps strategy can be directly used in large scale crop growth simulations without tedious process of calibration hence this strategy is recommended in areas where observations are scarce and for model users who not good at model parameter estimation keywords ceres wheat genetic parameter upscaling regional simulating phenology spring wheat 1 introduction phenology or the timing and duration of organ formation drives plant resource acquisition lieth 1974 and is a key indicator for field management practices including fertilization sakamoto et al 2010 transplantation brar et al 2015 irrigation kar and verma 2005 zhang et al 2021 accurate prediction of phenology is also essential for assessing the impacts of and adaptation to global climatic changes on agricultural production in large region angulo et al 2013 chen et al 2020b wang et al 2017 in recent years cropping system models or crop model have been widely used to schedule field management practices or simulate crop responses to climate change chen et al 2020a he et al 2019 liu et al 2020b however crop models were usually developed on plot or field scale and their applications were usually limited to single homogenous site guo et al 2010 the concomitant heterogeneities in field environment conditions need to be considered in crop growth simulations at large scales which was referred to spatializing the crop models faivre et al 2004 however field management information is always short especially for the crop cultivars planted in different fields which are described through a set of model parameters key genetic parameters related to phenological variations among crop cultivars cannot be directly measured in current crop models they were generally estimated with limited observation data using the trial and error method or different optimization algorithms wallach et al 2019 the process parameters estimation through fitting overall field measurements is normally defined as model calibration in several recent modeling studies in large regions crop cultivars were assumed to be uniform or directly obtained from literatures to simplify model calibration process and to save simulation time cammarano and tian 2018 feng et al 2019 due to the equifinality of multiple parameter combinations cultivar parameters estimated at single site with limited year observations could lead to huge simulation uncertainties he et al 2009 2017 at the same time re estimation of cultivar parameters was heavily recommended to capture spatial variations in crop growth among sub regions jiang and jin 2009 therond et al 2011 generally cultivar parameters estimated in areas with similar conditions were effective in dealing with the scale change errors in regional crop model simulations however the smaller the simulated cells were divided the greater the data and processing time required thus the question arises whether it is possible to strike a balance between easy of parameter estimation and accuracy in regional crop growth simulations in recent years the bayesian methods have seen increasing use in genetic parameter estimation in crop growth simulation models ceglar et al 2011 iizumi et al 2009 wallach et al 2012 for example he et al 2009 2010 compared different likelihood functions in genetic parameter estimations with the ceres maize model gao et al 2020 compared a frequentist approach ordinary least squares ols and two bayesian approaches for the ceres rice model calibration and found that the bayesian methods were promising for quantifying prediction uncertainty in the bayesian methods posterior distributions of genetic parameters were generated through comparisons between model simulated and field observed variables and based on posterior distributions of genetic parameters and the bayesian theorem this kind of posterior distributions could be used again as posterior distributions for the re estimation of genetic parameters of given crops when regional model simulations were conducted and the genetic characteristics of the cultivars planted were unknown iizumi et al 2009 if no information was available about the crop cultivars planted in some locations the posterior distributions derived based on experimental data from other regions might be used for parameter estimation for similar cultivars in general the bayesian methods of crop parameter estimation provides an alternative method for upscaling crop cultivars in regional simulations however how do the cultivar parameters generated from the posterior distributions performed in phenology simulation in comparing with the simulations with different representative cultivar parameters estimated in various spatial scales spring wheat is an important staple crop in china the sown area and yield of spring wheat were about 16 1 million hectares and 6 4 million tons in 2017 china ministry of agricultural 2018 in this study we taken spring wheat sown in china as an example and hypothesized that the simulation of spring wheat phenology with the dssat ceres wheat model in regional scale could be improved by using virtual cultivars generated from posterior distributions of genetic parameters the main objectives were 1 to develop a new spatial upscaling strategy for genetic parameters related to spring wheat phenology based on bayesian method and 2 to compare four different spatial upscaling strategies and choose the optimal one for the simulation of spring wheat phenology in china this work is expected to provide an alternative tool to simplify crop growth simulations at large scale with the dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer model by accounting for regional variation in crop cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the dssat ceres wheat model is a process based model originally developed by the usda ars wheat yield project and the u s government under the agristars program hoogenboom et al 2012 jones et al 2003 ritchie and otter 1985 the dssat ceres wheat model simulates daily wheat growth and development under varying climate soil and management practices photosynthetically active radiation and its interception by crop canopy are used to calculate potential growth whereas actual growth on any day is limited by soil water deficits nitrogen deficiencies and suboptimal temperature ritchie 1998 a minimum set of input data are required to run the model including weather crop soil and management practices soil inputs include physical chemical and morphological properties of each soil layer crop management information includes crop cultivar planting date depth and density row spacing irrigation fertilizer application of organic amendments etc ottman et al 2013 reported that there were 17 related parameters affecting the phenology process in dssat ceres wheat model including the cultivar type ecotype and species type parameters according to the general requirements of dssat model usage the cultivar type genetic parameters are calibrated based on observation data the ecotype parameters could be adjusted by the experienced model users and the species type parameters should not be adjusted for ordinary model users hence there were five parameters table s1 were taken into consideration in phenology simulation in this study since temperature and photoperiod are the only environmental factors affecting wheat development in the ceres wheat model the ecotype parameter veff is the maximum allowed reduction in development rate when unvernalized this parameter was estimated first since it affects a series of development processes and was finally set to 0 3 for this study the cultivar parameter phint is the thermal time required from the end of juvenile to the end of ear growing that was not calibrated due to the lack of required observations of leaf emergence dates a constant value or 95 was set for all of the related simulations in this study therefore there are only three cultivar parameters p1v p1d and p5 were estimated for each specific cultivar in this study the genetic parameters were estimated with the dssat glue package which is based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method mertens et al 2004 he et al 2009 and 2010 2 2 study areas and datasets spring wheat was grown from northeast to southwest china green shaded areas in fig 1 with obvious different climate conditions most spring wheat was sown in areas with cold and dry climate in northern china in these areas mean annual cumulative thermal time 10 c was about 2750 c d with variations from 1650 to 3620 c d the mean temperatures of the coldest month january and day were 10 c and 30 c respectively the extreme low temperatures prevent wheat from overwintering thus only spring wheat could be sown expect for the spring wheat regions there were also some areas where both spring and winter wheat were sown these regions were mainly located in the plateau areas in western china including the qinghai tibetan plateau the yunnan guizhou plateau in these areas the mean annual cumulative thermal time 10 c was about 2050 c d with variations from 84 to 4610 c d the mean temperatures of the coldest month january were close to 10 c it was noteworthy that winter temperature was mild enough in the yunnan guizhou plateau in southwest china in these areas spring wheat is sown in the fall oct dec which was also named fall sown spring wheat and is grown mainly in rotation with rice both spring sown and fall sown spring wheat were taken into consideration since the observations under these two grown schedules were both collected and used in this study two datasets of spring wheat phenology were used for different purposes in this study the first dataset was from field experiments of multiple spring wheat cultivars conducted at altay 47 43 n 88 05 e 735 m in xinjiang province in 2014 and at yangling 34 17 n 108 04 e 506 m in shaanxi province in 2015 2017 table 1 for the experiment conducted at altay the 40 cultivar experiment was sown on april 16th in 2014 for the experiment conducted at yangling spring wheat was sown at four different sowing dates in both 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing seasons table s2 which resulted in a range of different photoperiods and accumulative temperatures sufficient irrigation water and fertilizer were applied at the two sites to avoid water and nutrient stresses during the growing seasons all treatments were managed to avoid water or nutrient stress and effects of weeds and pests there were three replicates for each treatment this dataset was mainly used to establish the posterior distributions of genetic parameters related to spring wheat phenology in the dssat ceres wheat model the second dataset comprised phenology observations of rainfed spring wheat at 57 agro meteorological experimental stations which belonged to the chinese meteorology administration cma in china from 2010 to 2014 table s3 fig 1 we divided these 57 sites into six agro ecological zones aezs northeast china zone ⅰ north china zone ⅱ northwest china zone ⅲ the qinghai tibetan plateau zone ⅳ xinjiang zone ⅴ and southwest china zone ⅵ zhao 2010 liu et al 2020a it is noteworthy that in the vast subtropical and tropical climate areas zone ⅵ including the sichuan basin and the yunnan guizhou plateau spring wheat was usually sown in fall october or november yu et al 1995 information about crop management was obtained from on farm observations management practices at each site including fertilizer application and weed control were generally the same as or better than the conventional practices by local farmers plant protection management was undertaken to guarantee optimum growth and avoid weeds and pests observations included days from sowing to anthesis and maturity which were conducted by trained agricultural technicians according to standardized observation methods cma 1993 all phenology data were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic of the chinese meteorology administration this dataset comprehensively represents the production status of spring wheat in china since geographic locations of these sites roughly covered all of the spring wheat regions in china this dataset was mainly used for evaluating the four different upscaling strategies of cultivar parameters for phenology simulated with dssat ceres wheat soil water parameters including saturated soil moisture residual soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity were obtained from the china soil hydraulic parameters dataset dai et al 2013 daily weather data included daily maximum and minimum air temperature daily rainfall and daily global solar radiation for all sites weather data were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn solar radiation data were not available so daily cumulative solar radiation was estimated based on daylength and sunshine hours with the angstrom prescott formula angstrom 1924 prescott et al 1940 2 3 upscaling strategies for cultivar parameters in regional simulation of spring wheat growth four upscaling strategies for cultivar genetic parameter estimations of spring wheat were established and evaluated in this study based on the two experimental datasets fig 2 these four strategies could be divided into two kinds of solutions the first kind directly estimated the genetic parameters of representative cultivar at different geographic scales which was established based on the 5 year field records of anthesis and maturity dates at the 57 agro meteorological obsevation stations in china the second sloution tried to summarize the distributions of genetic parameters for the spring wheat cultivars sown in china this solution was established based on the field observations of the experiments conducted at altay in 2014 and yangling in 2015 2017 with 40 widely sown spring wheat cultivars the four upscaling strategies were compared in simulations of anthesis date maturity date and grain filling duration at all of the 57 gero meteorological stations 2 3 1 strategy 1 single site parameters ssps in many studies cultivars planted in a given region were assumed to be the same to simplify modeling and reduce simulation time cultivar genetic parameters which were estimated only based on the observations of a single site were then used in crop growth simulations in large regions following this strategy we assumed that the different spring wheat cultivars were sown at the 57 agro meteorological observation station to explore the simulation uncertainties caused by various cultivars at large scale each of the 57 different cultivars was parameterized at its individual station and then validated at the other 56 stations all the 5 year observed anthesis and maturity dates were used to estimate the cultivar genetic parameters for each site with the dssat glue package in this study we mainly focused on the variability of the ssps in phenology simulations since 57 different ssps were generated we did not compare this strategy with the rest upscaling strategies at site scale 2 3 2 strategy 2 national representative parameters nrps due to the equifinality of multiple parameter combinations cultivar parameters estimated at a single site under limited years could lead to large uncertainties he et al 2009 2017 in this strategy the observed anthesis and maturity dates from all of the 57 sites in 2010 were used for the estimation of genetic parameters of a national representative cultivar or nrps then this set of national representative parameters or nrps were validated based on the data of 2011 2014 for all of the 57 sites 2 3 3 strategy 3 regional representative parameters rrps in this strategy we assumed that an individual representative cultivar was sown in each agro ecological zone aez of spring wheat production in china in each aez the observed anthesis and maturity dates from all local sites in 2010 were used to estimate the genetic parameters of the regional representative cultivar or rrps then the rrps were validated with the rest observations in 2011 2014 in each aez 2 3 4 strategy 4 virtual cultivar parameters vcps generated from the posterior parameter distributions for the 40 cultivars sown at altay and yangling the genetic parameters of each cultivar were estimated based on the observations of four sowing date treatments in the experiment conducted at yangling in the 2015 2016 growing season next the estimated genetic parameters were further validated at altay in 2014 and yangling in 2016 2017 growing seasons third the distributions of the estimated values of the three genetic parameters p1v p1d and p5 were tested using the fitdistrplus package of r delignette muller and dutang 2015 r core team 2020 the judgement of potential distribution of the target dataset by the fitdistrplus package relies on the specific relationship between skewness and kurtosis then 1000 sets of genetic parameters were randomly sampled following the established posterior distributions with r all these 1000 virtual spring wheat cultivars were then used to simulate the spring wheat experiment conducted in altay red triangle in fig 1 to validate the posterior distributions and the sampling method finally the 1000 virtual cultivars were used to simulate the anthesis and maturity dates of spring wheat at all the 57 agro meteorological observation stations in 2010 2014 to compare with the other three upscaling strategies the average value of the 1000 model runs with the 1000 virtual cultivars were treated as the final simulation result for each site 2 4 statistics for model performance evaluation since a total of 40 different spring wheat cultivars were grown at yangling at each sowing date were repeated three times the standard deviation sd eq 1 were used to evaluate the variations in anthesis and maturity dates of these cultivar 1 sd 1 n i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and o were the observed and their mean value of given variables n was the repeated times many different indices have been proposed to evaluate the discrepancies between simulations and measurements wallach et al 2019 in this study we concentrated on three measures to show the different aspects of regional simulation accuracy with the four upscaling strategies for cultivar genetic parameters of spring wheat the root mean square error rmse eq 2 has the advantage to express errors in the same unit as the variable 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 where s i and o i were simulated and observed values of given variables respectively and n was the number of simulation times to compare the variables likely to give a broad range of crop response the relative error could provide another sight from the absolute error for example anthesis dates of spring wheat mainly ranged from 50 to 100 days after sowing das while maturity dates were nearly 1 5 times of it thus we also calculated the relative root mean square error rrmse eq 3 and coefficient of determination r2 eq 4 to evaluate the simulation accuracy of anthesis and maturity with different upscaling strategies 3 r r m s e r m s e o 100 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 3 results 3 1 uncertainties in phenology simulation using the ssps small rmses were achieved for the both phenology stages during calibration with an average value of 3 7 d and 3 9 d from 0 9 to 8 5 for anthesis and maturity dates fig 3 respectively as expected rmse values increased during validation with an average value of 6 4 5 4 10 7 d and 10 8 8 5 18 4 d for anthesis and maturity respectively the results indicated that large errors and uncertainties were caused when using the site specific cultivar simulate in phenology simulations in large area especially in maturity date fig 3b the lowest errors were obtained with the parameters calibrated in zone 1 northeast china for anthesis and maturity in both calibration and validation processes in addition there were no obvious differences in the simulation accuracies with the genetic parameters calibrated in different aezs 3 2 calibration and validation of the nrps and rrps the nrps national representative parameters and rrps regional representative parameters were calibrated and validated based on the observations from the 57 stations in 2010 and 2011 2014 fig 4 respectively there were six sets of rrps since this up scaling strategy were conducted in each of the six different aez generally the simulation errors of anthesis were smaller than maturity during both calibration and validation processes the rmse values were ranged from 5 7 to 6 9 d and from 8 3 to 10 3 d for the two phenology stages respectively additionally the estimation errors of the nrps were greater than the rrps for both anthesis and maturity date simulations both in calibration and calibration compared with the nrps the rmse values of the rrps reduced by 0 8 d and 0 4 d for calibrations and validations of anthesis but 2 0 d and 0 7 d for calibrations and validations of maturity the results indicated that the rrps improved regional maturity simulations in addition it was noteworthy that the ceres wheat model was able to simulate phenology of the autumn sown spring wheat the five points in the top right corner of each sub figure fig 4 small simulation errors were obtained in most years of this experiment even with the nrps fig 4a which employed only one cultivar to represent spring wheat in the whole china 3 3 generation and evaluation of the vcps 3 3 1 calibration and validation of the genetic parameters of the 40 cultivars the genetic parameters of the 40 spring wheat cultivars were calibrated based on the field observation in 2015 2016 growing season at yangling and validated at altay in 2014 and yangling in the 2016 2017 growing seasons fig 5 great variations were obtained for the durations from sowing to anthesis and to maturity which were resulted from the four sowing dates the anthesis dates were 76 201 das and 97 189 das in the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing season and the maturity dates were 111 241 das and 124 228 das respectively overall the 40 sets of estimated cultivar genetic parameters simulated anthesis and maturity well for all of the four sowing date treatments since all data points were close to the 1 1 line the results showed that the 40 sets calibrated cultivar genetic parameters could reproduce the annual difference among different sowing dates the rmse values were 6 5 d and 5 2 d for anthesis and maturity simulations in the calibration process respectively then the 40 calibrated cultivar genetic parameters were validated at both yangling and altay where the climate conditions and farming schedules were greatly different from yangling however greater simulation errors were generated during calibrations compared with the results of validation at yangling the rmse values were increased by 3 6 d and 1 3 d for the two phenology stages in calibrations using observations from 2015 to 2016 smaller simulations were obtained for both the two sites during validation the rmse values were 2 9 d and 3 2 d for anthesis at yangling and altay and were 3 9 d and 4 2 d for maturity respectively 3 3 2 generation of the posterior parameter distributions and vcps the statistical distributions of p1v p1d and p5 of the 40 spring wheat cultivars were explored based on the fitdistrplus package of r figs s1 and s2 the results indicated that p1v and p5 approximately followed the uniform and logistical distributions respectively however no common distribution was found for p1d overall it was difficult to determine the real distributions of these parameters based on the limited number of estimated parameter values we then tried another three possible distributions for the parameter p1d including normal lognormal and logistical distribution and also applied the logistic distribution for the parameter p5 table s4 apart from the original uniform distributions for the three cultivar parameters three kinds of distributions of p1d were combined with the uniform distribution of p1v fig s1b and logistic distribution of p5 fig s1c respectively in each combination 1000 sets of virtual cultivar parameters vcps were generated the 1000 sets of vcps separately generated from each kind of p1d distribution were used to simulate spring wheat phenology at altay in 2014 fig s3 compared to the original uniform distribution assumption same median values of anthesis and maturity dates were provided by the logistic normal and lognormal distributions of p1d additionally the mean values of the two phenology stages were also similar to each other hence the assumption of uniform distributions for the three cultivar parameters were acceptable since the mean prediction values of multiple vcps were used to represent the daily phenology prediction within growing seasons considering the difficulty in parameter sampling the uniform distribution assumption was accepted in this study finally for simplicity we assumed that all these three parameters followed uniform distributions represented by maximum and minimum values finally the new posterior distributions of phenology related genetic parameters were established for further regional simulations eq 5 5 parameter distributions p 1 v u 8 7 16 0 p 1 d u 50 2 65 7 p 5 u 559 7 657 1 following the above posterior parameter distributions of genetic parameters 1000 sets of vcps were sampled and used to simulate the anthesis and maturity dates of the 40 spring wheat cultivars sown at altay in 2014 fig 6 compared with the observations simulations with the 40 calibrated cultivar parameters and with 1000 vcps had less variations for both anthesis and maturity dates the vcps almost obtained same anthesis and maturity simulations as the 40 calibrated cultivars since same ranges anthesis 66 68 d maturity 98 104 d and median values anthesis 67 d maturity 101 d were obtained for both the two phenology stages the results showed that the vcps which were sampled assuming a uniform distribution could well represent the parameter distributions for phenology of spring wheat besides ranges of the simulated anthesis and maturity dates were covered by the corresponding field observations which showed less variation of the vcps in phenology simulation however the median values of the simulations were close to the observations since the difference between the median values of simulations and observations were 2 d for anthesis and 0 d for maturity 3 4 comparisons among phenology simulations using nrps rrps and vcps the annual and five year rmse and rrmse values were calculated for the estimations of anthesis and maturity dates of the 57 stations using the nrps rrps and vcps fig 7 the simulated anthesis dates were better than the simulated maturity dates since values ranged 4 7 7 0 d and 8 3 11 4 d for anthesis and maturity simulations respectively however the difference between the simulation accuracies of the two phenology stages were smaller in the term of rrmse ranged 5 9 9 4 and 6 5 9 6 for anthesis and maturity dates respectively besides there were obvious differences among phenology stage simulations with different up scaling strategies simulations with nrps had the lowest accuracy for anthesis and maturity since this strategy only used one set of genetic parameters to represent the spring wheat sown in china the five year average rmse values were 6 3 d and 9 6 d and rrmse values were 8 0 and 7 9 for anthesis and maturity the rrps achieved the second highest and the highest accuracy for anthesis and maturity simulations respectively compared with the nrps the average simulation rmse errors were reduced by 0 5 d for anthesis and 1 0 d for maturity and rrmse values were reduced by 0 7 for anthesis and 0 8 for maturity respectively however the vcps achieved the smallest simulation errors in anthesis date simulations but the largest errors in maturity date simulations the average rmse values were 5 2 d and 9 6 d and rrmse values were 6 6 and 7 9 for anthesis and maturity respectively the average rmse values of the 57 sites were 5 0 d 4 7d and 4 4 d for the nrps rrps and vcps respectively the three upscaling strategies had similar performance in reducing the simulation errors fig 8 the number of stations with rmse value less than 3 d were 17 18 and 18 for the nrps rrps and vcps however the vcps performed better in the upper limit of simulation errors since no site had rmse value greater than 12 d while there were three stations for both the nrps and rrps the maximum values of rmse were 19 4 18 0 and 10 6 d for the nrps rrps and vcps respectively the results also indicated that the largest variation occurred in regional anthesis date simulations with only one national representative cultivar generally the rmse values were less than 6 d for the most stations and the numbers of such stations were 44 47 and 47 for the nrps rrps and vcps the worst regional simulation accuracies were obtained in zone ⅵ for both the nrps rmse 7 1 d and vcps rmse 9 6 d where spring wheat was sown in autumn due to the high temperature however these two upscaling strategies both used the same cultivar sets one set in the nrps and 1000 sets in the vcps in spring wheat anthesis simulation in large area without local calibration which might explain the poor performance in this region compared with the nrps and vcps the rrps obtained smaller rmse value 4 9 d in zone ⅵ the lowest regional simulation accuracy of the rrps was obtained in zone ⅱ with rmse value 5 8 d which was much smaller than the nrps and vcps the best performance in phenology simulations in aez level with the rrps were caused by the same scale of parameter calibration for this upscaling strategy compared with anthesis the simulations of maturity had larger rmse values for all 57 stations fig 8b d and f only seven or 12 of total sites investigated had a rmse value less than 3 d with the nrps while the numbers were both eight with the rrps and vcps on the contrary the number of sites with rmse values greater than 12 d were eight with the nrps seven with the rrps and 12 with the vcps the average rmse values of the 57 sites were 8 1 d 7 3 d and 8 0 d for the nrps rrps and vcps respectively the vcps generated the largest maturity estimation errors since the rmse values ranged from 1 2 to 27 2 d the rmse values ranged 1 6 26 4 d and 0 8 21 2 d for the nrps and rrps fig s4 respectively however the 95th percentilies value of rmse of vcps was smaller than those provided by the nrps finally the smallest simulation errors were all obtained in zone ⅵ with the rmse values were 6 4 5 4 and 3 8 d for the nrps rrps and vcps the lowest accuracies were in zone ⅴ for both the nrps rmse 13 8 d and vcps rmse 15 7 d and in zone ⅰ for the rrps rmse 7 9 d for the vcps strategy the 12 stations with rmse value greater than 12 d were mainly located at the high altitude places where the average elevation was 2080 m and the average annual air temperature was 6 6 table 3 the large errors in maturity simulations with the vcps rmse 7 5 d were probably caused by the poor performance in grain filling duration simulations fig 9 s5 compared with the vcps the data points provided by the nrps and rrps were closer to the 1 1 line the rmse values of the nrps rrps and vcps were 7 1 6 9 and 8 7 d respectively there were obvious underestimations of the grain filling duration with the vcps especially in areas with longer grain filling requirement observed grain filling duration 55 d besides the r2 values of the vcps was the highest among the three upscaling strategies 4 discussion 4 1 phenology simulations with single representative cultivar ssps and nrps the single representative cultivar assumption has been widely used in crop growth simulations at large scales chen et al 2018 sun et al 2018 xiao and tao 2014 in this study all of the 57 ssps provided low simulation errors for both anthesis and maturity dates at their relevant sites liu et al 2020a also reported that high accuracy was obtained at site scale with detailed inputs related to crop growth however large errors were generated by most individual ssps when using them in simulations at other stations this is mainly because parameters are often highly related to their testing conditions and are less universal he et al 2009 additionally he et al 2017 reported the equifinality of different combinations of cultivar parameters calibrated at a single site he et al 2017 hence large uncertainty would be generated in regional crop growth simulations with single site calibrated cultivar parameters the results of the ssps indicated the importance of using observations from different climate conditions in parameter calibration and model validation therefore we developed the nrps strategy by using all of the 57 station observations in 2010 to parameterize the cultivar compared with the ssps the simulation errors were reduced besides good simulation accuracy was also achieved at the nanchuan station the five points in the top right corners of fig 4a and b where spring wheat was sown in autumn however the one representative cultivar assumption was contradicted the actual production situation especially in a country with a wide range of climates such as china in addition massive data of different climatic zones were required in the estimation of cultivar genetic parameters in this strategy however field observations were usually scarce in many countries which would result in invalid simulations in the large scales xiong et al 2014 4 2 phenology simulations with multiple representative cultivars rrps and vcps compared with the ssps and nrps the highest and second highest simulation accuracies were provided by this strategy for maturity and anthesis respectively the representative cultivar parameters estimated in large scales showed great potential in regional crop growth simulations jiang and jin 2009 also reported that the genetic parameters estimated in the aez level provided the highest simulations accuracy for rice in jiangsu province in china therond et al 2011 estimated the genetic parameters of maize and wheat in regional scale and applied these parameters in the simulations across 12 european countries compared with the simulations with only one representative cultivar the accuracies were substantially improved with the regional representative cultivar however the rrps strategy increased the difficulty and time consumption in the estimations of cultivar genetic parameter besides this strategy was also invalid when observation data were scarce in this study several possible distributions uniform normal lognormal and logistic were assumed for the three cultivars parameters then different vcps were sampled from different combinations of these distributions and validated at altay the results indicated that similar anthesis and maturity dates were simulated with different parameter distributions hence we defined p1v p1d and p5 followed the uniform distributions gao et al 2020 and ma et al 2020 also accepted the uniform distribution assumption for the three parameters the results demonstrated the uniform distribution was reasonable since the similar ranges and median values of anthesis and maturity date simulations were obtained by the randomly sampled vcps and the 40 sets of calibrated parameters however variations of anthesis and maturity date simulations with the vcps and the calibrated parameters were both smaller than the observations at altay it was mainly because the parameterization of the 40 cultivars were conducted based on the experiments at yangling where phenology observations taken small variations the vcps obtained the smallest simulation errors for anthesis date which indicated good estimations for the parameter p1v and p1d hunt et al 1993 pointed that the parameter p5 was the most sensitive parameter affecting grain filling duration hence the vcps obtained second highest simulation errors in maturity date due to underestimation of the grain filling duration which indicated the parameterization deviation of the parameter p5 for the 12 stations with rmse 12 d with the vcps strategy table 2 the frigid climate conditions might let local farmers sow spring wheat cultivars different from the 40 cultivars involved in our study xiong 2009 evaluate the ceres wheat model in wheat growth simulations in china they pointed that the largest simulation errors were obtained in the 8th and 9th aze with high altitudes which was similar as the region ⅲ and ⅴ in this study with rmse values greater than 35 in general more experimental observations of more spring wheat cultivars sown in various areas were needed to modify the posterior distribution for parameter p5 4 3 comparisons among the four upscaling strategies in this study four upscaling strategies for cultivar genetic parameters of spring wheat were established and evaluated in general the simulation errors of maturity date were greater that anthesis date for all of the four strategies three sources of uncertainties were involved in the agricultural and environmental modeling namely equations input variables and parameter values wallach et al 2019 models are simplifications of the real world to some extent by using huge amount of equations however errors were introduced when using these equations to reproduce crop growth processes for example the simulation of maturity date was based on the simulation of anthesis and grain filling duration more processes with corresponding errors were involved in the simulation of maturity date than in the simulation of anthesis date wallach et al 2017 reported that the model structure generated larger uncertainty than model parameters the poor performance of the ceres wheat model in maturity date simulations might be caused by the unclear mechanism nouna et al 2003 and yao et al 2020 reported that the ceres series models provided large simulation errors under serious water stress the spring wheat was all rainfed at the 57 stations which might suffer from water stress since rainfall were mainly occurred in summer in our study area the second possible reason for the greater errors in maturity data simulation might be the erroneous maturity observation seidel et al 2019 reported that the availability of spatial and temporal data has become the main limitation for crop modeling seidel et al 2019 the input data that well represent the production situation of the target area were essential for reliable simulations xiong et al 2019 the third possible reason was the insufficient parameterization of the parameters that affect the phenology processes as reported by ottman et al 2013 17 parameters affect wheat phenology processes in the dssat ceres wheat model however we only estimated four of them and mainly focused on the three cultivar genetic parameters p1v p1d and p5 higher prediction accuracy might be achieved by taking into consideration of more parameters in addition messina et al 2006 suggested that the estimations of cultivar genetic parameters should take into account the genetic information a gene based system for estimating genetic specific parameters might offer better long term prospects for reducing simulation error making it easier to apply models at regional to global scales white et al 2008 generally there were several advantages for the vcps strategy in crop growth simulations at regional scales first variations in spring wheat cultivars were involved in regional simulations which was impossible by the ssps and nrps strategy next the uncertainties generated by crop cultivars were taken into account in regional simulations which were usually ignored in many previous studies of crop growth response to climate changes in large area third this strategy accounted for the variations of crop cultivars since 1000 sets of virtual cultivars were used in simulations which might contain the cultivar that was exactly sown in the study area fourth this strategy was possible to help explain the interactions of genotype g environment e management m finally this strategy was ideal for places where basic experimental observations were extremely scarce the virtual cultivars generated with the posterior parameter distributions could be used directly in areas lacking of field measurements however the disadvantages of the vcps strategy were also apparent first crop growth simulations and analysis became further complicated by considering the crop cultivar uncertainties next model runs and time consumption are dramatically increased if the 1000 virtual cultivars generated from the posterior parameter distributions were all applied in growth simulations the number of model runs would be 1000 times of that using only one representative cultivar with the increases available of high performance computing platforms the time consuming problem of large number of model runs could be expected to be solved finally different sampling sizes will be tried to evaluate the performance of the vcps in regional simulations through which the minimum optimal number of virtual cultivar parameters might be found 5 conclusions few simulation studies have examined the uncertainties caused by cultivar differences in large scale simulations despite the wide use of crop models among the four upscaling strategies the ssps and nrps strategies generated considerable errors in anthesis and maturity dates throughout china therefore we do not recommend these strategies in regions with obviously different field management practices the rrps strategy provided more reliable simulation accuracy comparing with the ssps and nrps but the data requirement was massive and the parameter calibration processes were complex and time consuming therefore this strategy is not recommended where observation data are scarce according to the vcps strategy using an ensemble of different spring wheat cultivars summarized as genetic parameter distributions could account for the unknown sown cultivars in large scale crop growth simulations besides the virtual spring wheat cultivars could be directly sampled from the simple uniform distributions without local calibration it was reasonable to expect that the consideration of uncertainty in crop cultivars will contribute to more reliable simulations of crop growth at large scales generally we recommended both rrps and vcps strategies in regional spring wheat phenology simulations and the rrps strategy was more suitable for maturity date estimations in large regions containing a wide range of climates declaration of competing interest the authors

9857,cropping system models are widely used to assess the impacts of and adaptation practices to climate change on agricultural production however crop growth simulations at large scales have often lacked consideration of variation in crop cultivars which were represented by different sets of genetic coefficients in crops models in this study taking the phenology of spring wheat triticum aestivum l as an example we compared four different strategies for upscaling genetic parameters in phenology simulations at large scales with two experimental datasets the first dataset was from field experiments comprising 40 different spring wheat cultivars at altay 2014 and yangling 2015 2017 station the second dataset was historical 2010 2014 observed phenology records from 57 national agro meteorological observation stations in china the four strategies were the representative cultivar estimated at a single site ssps the representative cultivar estimated at the 57 sites nrps the various representative cultivars estimated at different agro ecological zones rrps and the virtual cultivars generated from the posterior distributions vcps the posterior distributions aforesaid were established based on the calibrated parameter values of the 40 different spring wheat cultivars planted in yangling then 1000 sets of vcps were randomly sampled from the posterior distributions the results indicated that both the ssps and nrps strategy obtained large errors and uncertainties in spring wheat phenology simulations in china since only one representative cultivar was used the rrps strategy achieved the second high and the highest accuracy in anthesis and maturity data simulations the vcps strategy obtained the highest accuracy in anthesis simulation but relative larger errors in maturity simulation the vcps strategy can be directly used in large scale crop growth simulations without tedious process of calibration hence this strategy is recommended in areas where observations are scarce and for model users who not good at model parameter estimation keywords ceres wheat genetic parameter upscaling regional simulating phenology spring wheat 1 introduction phenology or the timing and duration of organ formation drives plant resource acquisition lieth 1974 and is a key indicator for field management practices including fertilization sakamoto et al 2010 transplantation brar et al 2015 irrigation kar and verma 2005 zhang et al 2021 accurate prediction of phenology is also essential for assessing the impacts of and adaptation to global climatic changes on agricultural production in large region angulo et al 2013 chen et al 2020b wang et al 2017 in recent years cropping system models or crop model have been widely used to schedule field management practices or simulate crop responses to climate change chen et al 2020a he et al 2019 liu et al 2020b however crop models were usually developed on plot or field scale and their applications were usually limited to single homogenous site guo et al 2010 the concomitant heterogeneities in field environment conditions need to be considered in crop growth simulations at large scales which was referred to spatializing the crop models faivre et al 2004 however field management information is always short especially for the crop cultivars planted in different fields which are described through a set of model parameters key genetic parameters related to phenological variations among crop cultivars cannot be directly measured in current crop models they were generally estimated with limited observation data using the trial and error method or different optimization algorithms wallach et al 2019 the process parameters estimation through fitting overall field measurements is normally defined as model calibration in several recent modeling studies in large regions crop cultivars were assumed to be uniform or directly obtained from literatures to simplify model calibration process and to save simulation time cammarano and tian 2018 feng et al 2019 due to the equifinality of multiple parameter combinations cultivar parameters estimated at single site with limited year observations could lead to huge simulation uncertainties he et al 2009 2017 at the same time re estimation of cultivar parameters was heavily recommended to capture spatial variations in crop growth among sub regions jiang and jin 2009 therond et al 2011 generally cultivar parameters estimated in areas with similar conditions were effective in dealing with the scale change errors in regional crop model simulations however the smaller the simulated cells were divided the greater the data and processing time required thus the question arises whether it is possible to strike a balance between easy of parameter estimation and accuracy in regional crop growth simulations in recent years the bayesian methods have seen increasing use in genetic parameter estimation in crop growth simulation models ceglar et al 2011 iizumi et al 2009 wallach et al 2012 for example he et al 2009 2010 compared different likelihood functions in genetic parameter estimations with the ceres maize model gao et al 2020 compared a frequentist approach ordinary least squares ols and two bayesian approaches for the ceres rice model calibration and found that the bayesian methods were promising for quantifying prediction uncertainty in the bayesian methods posterior distributions of genetic parameters were generated through comparisons between model simulated and field observed variables and based on posterior distributions of genetic parameters and the bayesian theorem this kind of posterior distributions could be used again as posterior distributions for the re estimation of genetic parameters of given crops when regional model simulations were conducted and the genetic characteristics of the cultivars planted were unknown iizumi et al 2009 if no information was available about the crop cultivars planted in some locations the posterior distributions derived based on experimental data from other regions might be used for parameter estimation for similar cultivars in general the bayesian methods of crop parameter estimation provides an alternative method for upscaling crop cultivars in regional simulations however how do the cultivar parameters generated from the posterior distributions performed in phenology simulation in comparing with the simulations with different representative cultivar parameters estimated in various spatial scales spring wheat is an important staple crop in china the sown area and yield of spring wheat were about 16 1 million hectares and 6 4 million tons in 2017 china ministry of agricultural 2018 in this study we taken spring wheat sown in china as an example and hypothesized that the simulation of spring wheat phenology with the dssat ceres wheat model in regional scale could be improved by using virtual cultivars generated from posterior distributions of genetic parameters the main objectives were 1 to develop a new spatial upscaling strategy for genetic parameters related to spring wheat phenology based on bayesian method and 2 to compare four different spatial upscaling strategies and choose the optimal one for the simulation of spring wheat phenology in china this work is expected to provide an alternative tool to simplify crop growth simulations at large scale with the dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer model by accounting for regional variation in crop cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the dssat ceres wheat model is a process based model originally developed by the usda ars wheat yield project and the u s government under the agristars program hoogenboom et al 2012 jones et al 2003 ritchie and otter 1985 the dssat ceres wheat model simulates daily wheat growth and development under varying climate soil and management practices photosynthetically active radiation and its interception by crop canopy are used to calculate potential growth whereas actual growth on any day is limited by soil water deficits nitrogen deficiencies and suboptimal temperature ritchie 1998 a minimum set of input data are required to run the model including weather crop soil and management practices soil inputs include physical chemical and morphological properties of each soil layer crop management information includes crop cultivar planting date depth and density row spacing irrigation fertilizer application of organic amendments etc ottman et al 2013 reported that there were 17 related parameters affecting the phenology process in dssat ceres wheat model including the cultivar type ecotype and species type parameters according to the general requirements of dssat model usage the cultivar type genetic parameters are calibrated based on observation data the ecotype parameters could be adjusted by the experienced model users and the species type parameters should not be adjusted for ordinary model users hence there were five parameters table s1 were taken into consideration in phenology simulation in this study since temperature and photoperiod are the only environmental factors affecting wheat development in the ceres wheat model the ecotype parameter veff is the maximum allowed reduction in development rate when unvernalized this parameter was estimated first since it affects a series of development processes and was finally set to 0 3 for this study the cultivar parameter phint is the thermal time required from the end of juvenile to the end of ear growing that was not calibrated due to the lack of required observations of leaf emergence dates a constant value or 95 was set for all of the related simulations in this study therefore there are only three cultivar parameters p1v p1d and p5 were estimated for each specific cultivar in this study the genetic parameters were estimated with the dssat glue package which is based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method mertens et al 2004 he et al 2009 and 2010 2 2 study areas and datasets spring wheat was grown from northeast to southwest china green shaded areas in fig 1 with obvious different climate conditions most spring wheat was sown in areas with cold and dry climate in northern china in these areas mean annual cumulative thermal time 10 c was about 2750 c d with variations from 1650 to 3620 c d the mean temperatures of the coldest month january and day were 10 c and 30 c respectively the extreme low temperatures prevent wheat from overwintering thus only spring wheat could be sown expect for the spring wheat regions there were also some areas where both spring and winter wheat were sown these regions were mainly located in the plateau areas in western china including the qinghai tibetan plateau the yunnan guizhou plateau in these areas the mean annual cumulative thermal time 10 c was about 2050 c d with variations from 84 to 4610 c d the mean temperatures of the coldest month january were close to 10 c it was noteworthy that winter temperature was mild enough in the yunnan guizhou plateau in southwest china in these areas spring wheat is sown in the fall oct dec which was also named fall sown spring wheat and is grown mainly in rotation with rice both spring sown and fall sown spring wheat were taken into consideration since the observations under these two grown schedules were both collected and used in this study two datasets of spring wheat phenology were used for different purposes in this study the first dataset was from field experiments of multiple spring wheat cultivars conducted at altay 47 43 n 88 05 e 735 m in xinjiang province in 2014 and at yangling 34 17 n 108 04 e 506 m in shaanxi province in 2015 2017 table 1 for the experiment conducted at altay the 40 cultivar experiment was sown on april 16th in 2014 for the experiment conducted at yangling spring wheat was sown at four different sowing dates in both 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing seasons table s2 which resulted in a range of different photoperiods and accumulative temperatures sufficient irrigation water and fertilizer were applied at the two sites to avoid water and nutrient stresses during the growing seasons all treatments were managed to avoid water or nutrient stress and effects of weeds and pests there were three replicates for each treatment this dataset was mainly used to establish the posterior distributions of genetic parameters related to spring wheat phenology in the dssat ceres wheat model the second dataset comprised phenology observations of rainfed spring wheat at 57 agro meteorological experimental stations which belonged to the chinese meteorology administration cma in china from 2010 to 2014 table s3 fig 1 we divided these 57 sites into six agro ecological zones aezs northeast china zone ⅰ north china zone ⅱ northwest china zone ⅲ the qinghai tibetan plateau zone ⅳ xinjiang zone ⅴ and southwest china zone ⅵ zhao 2010 liu et al 2020a it is noteworthy that in the vast subtropical and tropical climate areas zone ⅵ including the sichuan basin and the yunnan guizhou plateau spring wheat was usually sown in fall october or november yu et al 1995 information about crop management was obtained from on farm observations management practices at each site including fertilizer application and weed control were generally the same as or better than the conventional practices by local farmers plant protection management was undertaken to guarantee optimum growth and avoid weeds and pests observations included days from sowing to anthesis and maturity which were conducted by trained agricultural technicians according to standardized observation methods cma 1993 all phenology data were obtained from the national meteorological information center nmic of the chinese meteorology administration this dataset comprehensively represents the production status of spring wheat in china since geographic locations of these sites roughly covered all of the spring wheat regions in china this dataset was mainly used for evaluating the four different upscaling strategies of cultivar parameters for phenology simulated with dssat ceres wheat soil water parameters including saturated soil moisture residual soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity were obtained from the china soil hydraulic parameters dataset dai et al 2013 daily weather data included daily maximum and minimum air temperature daily rainfall and daily global solar radiation for all sites weather data were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn solar radiation data were not available so daily cumulative solar radiation was estimated based on daylength and sunshine hours with the angstrom prescott formula angstrom 1924 prescott et al 1940 2 3 upscaling strategies for cultivar parameters in regional simulation of spring wheat growth four upscaling strategies for cultivar genetic parameter estimations of spring wheat were established and evaluated in this study based on the two experimental datasets fig 2 these four strategies could be divided into two kinds of solutions the first kind directly estimated the genetic parameters of representative cultivar at different geographic scales which was established based on the 5 year field records of anthesis and maturity dates at the 57 agro meteorological obsevation stations in china the second sloution tried to summarize the distributions of genetic parameters for the spring wheat cultivars sown in china this solution was established based on the field observations of the experiments conducted at altay in 2014 and yangling in 2015 2017 with 40 widely sown spring wheat cultivars the four upscaling strategies were compared in simulations of anthesis date maturity date and grain filling duration at all of the 57 gero meteorological stations 2 3 1 strategy 1 single site parameters ssps in many studies cultivars planted in a given region were assumed to be the same to simplify modeling and reduce simulation time cultivar genetic parameters which were estimated only based on the observations of a single site were then used in crop growth simulations in large regions following this strategy we assumed that the different spring wheat cultivars were sown at the 57 agro meteorological observation station to explore the simulation uncertainties caused by various cultivars at large scale each of the 57 different cultivars was parameterized at its individual station and then validated at the other 56 stations all the 5 year observed anthesis and maturity dates were used to estimate the cultivar genetic parameters for each site with the dssat glue package in this study we mainly focused on the variability of the ssps in phenology simulations since 57 different ssps were generated we did not compare this strategy with the rest upscaling strategies at site scale 2 3 2 strategy 2 national representative parameters nrps due to the equifinality of multiple parameter combinations cultivar parameters estimated at a single site under limited years could lead to large uncertainties he et al 2009 2017 in this strategy the observed anthesis and maturity dates from all of the 57 sites in 2010 were used for the estimation of genetic parameters of a national representative cultivar or nrps then this set of national representative parameters or nrps were validated based on the data of 2011 2014 for all of the 57 sites 2 3 3 strategy 3 regional representative parameters rrps in this strategy we assumed that an individual representative cultivar was sown in each agro ecological zone aez of spring wheat production in china in each aez the observed anthesis and maturity dates from all local sites in 2010 were used to estimate the genetic parameters of the regional representative cultivar or rrps then the rrps were validated with the rest observations in 2011 2014 in each aez 2 3 4 strategy 4 virtual cultivar parameters vcps generated from the posterior parameter distributions for the 40 cultivars sown at altay and yangling the genetic parameters of each cultivar were estimated based on the observations of four sowing date treatments in the experiment conducted at yangling in the 2015 2016 growing season next the estimated genetic parameters were further validated at altay in 2014 and yangling in 2016 2017 growing seasons third the distributions of the estimated values of the three genetic parameters p1v p1d and p5 were tested using the fitdistrplus package of r delignette muller and dutang 2015 r core team 2020 the judgement of potential distribution of the target dataset by the fitdistrplus package relies on the specific relationship between skewness and kurtosis then 1000 sets of genetic parameters were randomly sampled following the established posterior distributions with r all these 1000 virtual spring wheat cultivars were then used to simulate the spring wheat experiment conducted in altay red triangle in fig 1 to validate the posterior distributions and the sampling method finally the 1000 virtual cultivars were used to simulate the anthesis and maturity dates of spring wheat at all the 57 agro meteorological observation stations in 2010 2014 to compare with the other three upscaling strategies the average value of the 1000 model runs with the 1000 virtual cultivars were treated as the final simulation result for each site 2 4 statistics for model performance evaluation since a total of 40 different spring wheat cultivars were grown at yangling at each sowing date were repeated three times the standard deviation sd eq 1 were used to evaluate the variations in anthesis and maturity dates of these cultivar 1 sd 1 n i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and o were the observed and their mean value of given variables n was the repeated times many different indices have been proposed to evaluate the discrepancies between simulations and measurements wallach et al 2019 in this study we concentrated on three measures to show the different aspects of regional simulation accuracy with the four upscaling strategies for cultivar genetic parameters of spring wheat the root mean square error rmse eq 2 has the advantage to express errors in the same unit as the variable 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 where s i and o i were simulated and observed values of given variables respectively and n was the number of simulation times to compare the variables likely to give a broad range of crop response the relative error could provide another sight from the absolute error for example anthesis dates of spring wheat mainly ranged from 50 to 100 days after sowing das while maturity dates were nearly 1 5 times of it thus we also calculated the relative root mean square error rrmse eq 3 and coefficient of determination r2 eq 4 to evaluate the simulation accuracy of anthesis and maturity with different upscaling strategies 3 r r m s e r m s e o 100 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 3 results 3 1 uncertainties in phenology simulation using the ssps small rmses were achieved for the both phenology stages during calibration with an average value of 3 7 d and 3 9 d from 0 9 to 8 5 for anthesis and maturity dates fig 3 respectively as expected rmse values increased during validation with an average value of 6 4 5 4 10 7 d and 10 8 8 5 18 4 d for anthesis and maturity respectively the results indicated that large errors and uncertainties were caused when using the site specific cultivar simulate in phenology simulations in large area especially in maturity date fig 3b the lowest errors were obtained with the parameters calibrated in zone 1 northeast china for anthesis and maturity in both calibration and validation processes in addition there were no obvious differences in the simulation accuracies with the genetic parameters calibrated in different aezs 3 2 calibration and validation of the nrps and rrps the nrps national representative parameters and rrps regional representative parameters were calibrated and validated based on the observations from the 57 stations in 2010 and 2011 2014 fig 4 respectively there were six sets of rrps since this up scaling strategy were conducted in each of the six different aez generally the simulation errors of anthesis were smaller than maturity during both calibration and validation processes the rmse values were ranged from 5 7 to 6 9 d and from 8 3 to 10 3 d for the two phenology stages respectively additionally the estimation errors of the nrps were greater than the rrps for both anthesis and maturity date simulations both in calibration and calibration compared with the nrps the rmse values of the rrps reduced by 0 8 d and 0 4 d for calibrations and validations of anthesis but 2 0 d and 0 7 d for calibrations and validations of maturity the results indicated that the rrps improved regional maturity simulations in addition it was noteworthy that the ceres wheat model was able to simulate phenology of the autumn sown spring wheat the five points in the top right corner of each sub figure fig 4 small simulation errors were obtained in most years of this experiment even with the nrps fig 4a which employed only one cultivar to represent spring wheat in the whole china 3 3 generation and evaluation of the vcps 3 3 1 calibration and validation of the genetic parameters of the 40 cultivars the genetic parameters of the 40 spring wheat cultivars were calibrated based on the field observation in 2015 2016 growing season at yangling and validated at altay in 2014 and yangling in the 2016 2017 growing seasons fig 5 great variations were obtained for the durations from sowing to anthesis and to maturity which were resulted from the four sowing dates the anthesis dates were 76 201 das and 97 189 das in the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 growing season and the maturity dates were 111 241 das and 124 228 das respectively overall the 40 sets of estimated cultivar genetic parameters simulated anthesis and maturity well for all of the four sowing date treatments since all data points were close to the 1 1 line the results showed that the 40 sets calibrated cultivar genetic parameters could reproduce the annual difference among different sowing dates the rmse values were 6 5 d and 5 2 d for anthesis and maturity simulations in the calibration process respectively then the 40 calibrated cultivar genetic parameters were validated at both yangling and altay where the climate conditions and farming schedules were greatly different from yangling however greater simulation errors were generated during calibrations compared with the results of validation at yangling the rmse values were increased by 3 6 d and 1 3 d for the two phenology stages in calibrations using observations from 2015 to 2016 smaller simulations were obtained for both the two sites during validation the rmse values were 2 9 d and 3 2 d for anthesis at yangling and altay and were 3 9 d and 4 2 d for maturity respectively 3 3 2 generation of the posterior parameter distributions and vcps the statistical distributions of p1v p1d and p5 of the 40 spring wheat cultivars were explored based on the fitdistrplus package of r figs s1 and s2 the results indicated that p1v and p5 approximately followed the uniform and logistical distributions respectively however no common distribution was found for p1d overall it was difficult to determine the real distributions of these parameters based on the limited number of estimated parameter values we then tried another three possible distributions for the parameter p1d including normal lognormal and logistical distribution and also applied the logistic distribution for the parameter p5 table s4 apart from the original uniform distributions for the three cultivar parameters three kinds of distributions of p1d were combined with the uniform distribution of p1v fig s1b and logistic distribution of p5 fig s1c respectively in each combination 1000 sets of virtual cultivar parameters vcps were generated the 1000 sets of vcps separately generated from each kind of p1d distribution were used to simulate spring wheat phenology at altay in 2014 fig s3 compared to the original uniform distribution assumption same median values of anthesis and maturity dates were provided by the logistic normal and lognormal distributions of p1d additionally the mean values of the two phenology stages were also similar to each other hence the assumption of uniform distributions for the three cultivar parameters were acceptable since the mean prediction values of multiple vcps were used to represent the daily phenology prediction within growing seasons considering the difficulty in parameter sampling the uniform distribution assumption was accepted in this study finally for simplicity we assumed that all these three parameters followed uniform distributions represented by maximum and minimum values finally the new posterior distributions of phenology related genetic parameters were established for further regional simulations eq 5 5 parameter distributions p 1 v u 8 7 16 0 p 1 d u 50 2 65 7 p 5 u 559 7 657 1 following the above posterior parameter distributions of genetic parameters 1000 sets of vcps were sampled and used to simulate the anthesis and maturity dates of the 40 spring wheat cultivars sown at altay in 2014 fig 6 compared with the observations simulations with the 40 calibrated cultivar parameters and with 1000 vcps had less variations for both anthesis and maturity dates the vcps almost obtained same anthesis and maturity simulations as the 40 calibrated cultivars since same ranges anthesis 66 68 d maturity 98 104 d and median values anthesis 67 d maturity 101 d were obtained for both the two phenology stages the results showed that the vcps which were sampled assuming a uniform distribution could well represent the parameter distributions for phenology of spring wheat besides ranges of the simulated anthesis and maturity dates were covered by the corresponding field observations which showed less variation of the vcps in phenology simulation however the median values of the simulations were close to the observations since the difference between the median values of simulations and observations were 2 d for anthesis and 0 d for maturity 3 4 comparisons among phenology simulations using nrps rrps and vcps the annual and five year rmse and rrmse values were calculated for the estimations of anthesis and maturity dates of the 57 stations using the nrps rrps and vcps fig 7 the simulated anthesis dates were better than the simulated maturity dates since values ranged 4 7 7 0 d and 8 3 11 4 d for anthesis and maturity simulations respectively however the difference between the simulation accuracies of the two phenology stages were smaller in the term of rrmse ranged 5 9 9 4 and 6 5 9 6 for anthesis and maturity dates respectively besides there were obvious differences among phenology stage simulations with different up scaling strategies simulations with nrps had the lowest accuracy for anthesis and maturity since this strategy only used one set of genetic parameters to represent the spring wheat sown in china the five year average rmse values were 6 3 d and 9 6 d and rrmse values were 8 0 and 7 9 for anthesis and maturity the rrps achieved the second highest and the highest accuracy for anthesis and maturity simulations respectively compared with the nrps the average simulation rmse errors were reduced by 0 5 d for anthesis and 1 0 d for maturity and rrmse values were reduced by 0 7 for anthesis and 0 8 for maturity respectively however the vcps achieved the smallest simulation errors in anthesis date simulations but the largest errors in maturity date simulations the average rmse values were 5 2 d and 9 6 d and rrmse values were 6 6 and 7 9 for anthesis and maturity respectively the average rmse values of the 57 sites were 5 0 d 4 7d and 4 4 d for the nrps rrps and vcps respectively the three upscaling strategies had similar performance in reducing the simulation errors fig 8 the number of stations with rmse value less than 3 d were 17 18 and 18 for the nrps rrps and vcps however the vcps performed better in the upper limit of simulation errors since no site had rmse value greater than 12 d while there were three stations for both the nrps and rrps the maximum values of rmse were 19 4 18 0 and 10 6 d for the nrps rrps and vcps respectively the results also indicated that the largest variation occurred in regional anthesis date simulations with only one national representative cultivar generally the rmse values were less than 6 d for the most stations and the numbers of such stations were 44 47 and 47 for the nrps rrps and vcps the worst regional simulation accuracies were obtained in zone ⅵ for both the nrps rmse 7 1 d and vcps rmse 9 6 d where spring wheat was sown in autumn due to the high temperature however these two upscaling strategies both used the same cultivar sets one set in the nrps and 1000 sets in the vcps in spring wheat anthesis simulation in large area without local calibration which might explain the poor performance in this region compared with the nrps and vcps the rrps obtained smaller rmse value 4 9 d in zone ⅵ the lowest regional simulation accuracy of the rrps was obtained in zone ⅱ with rmse value 5 8 d which was much smaller than the nrps and vcps the best performance in phenology simulations in aez level with the rrps were caused by the same scale of parameter calibration for this upscaling strategy compared with anthesis the simulations of maturity had larger rmse values for all 57 stations fig 8b d and f only seven or 12 of total sites investigated had a rmse value less than 3 d with the nrps while the numbers were both eight with the rrps and vcps on the contrary the number of sites with rmse values greater than 12 d were eight with the nrps seven with the rrps and 12 with the vcps the average rmse values of the 57 sites were 8 1 d 7 3 d and 8 0 d for the nrps rrps and vcps respectively the vcps generated the largest maturity estimation errors since the rmse values ranged from 1 2 to 27 2 d the rmse values ranged 1 6 26 4 d and 0 8 21 2 d for the nrps and rrps fig s4 respectively however the 95th percentilies value of rmse of vcps was smaller than those provided by the nrps finally the smallest simulation errors were all obtained in zone ⅵ with the rmse values were 6 4 5 4 and 3 8 d for the nrps rrps and vcps the lowest accuracies were in zone ⅴ for both the nrps rmse 13 8 d and vcps rmse 15 7 d and in zone ⅰ for the rrps rmse 7 9 d for the vcps strategy the 12 stations with rmse value greater than 12 d were mainly located at the high altitude places where the average elevation was 2080 m and the average annual air temperature was 6 6 table 3 the large errors in maturity simulations with the vcps rmse 7 5 d were probably caused by the poor performance in grain filling duration simulations fig 9 s5 compared with the vcps the data points provided by the nrps and rrps were closer to the 1 1 line the rmse values of the nrps rrps and vcps were 7 1 6 9 and 8 7 d respectively there were obvious underestimations of the grain filling duration with the vcps especially in areas with longer grain filling requirement observed grain filling duration 55 d besides the r2 values of the vcps was the highest among the three upscaling strategies 4 discussion 4 1 phenology simulations with single representative cultivar ssps and nrps the single representative cultivar assumption has been widely used in crop growth simulations at large scales chen et al 2018 sun et al 2018 xiao and tao 2014 in this study all of the 57 ssps provided low simulation errors for both anthesis and maturity dates at their relevant sites liu et al 2020a also reported that high accuracy was obtained at site scale with detailed inputs related to crop growth however large errors were generated by most individual ssps when using them in simulations at other stations this is mainly because parameters are often highly related to their testing conditions and are less universal he et al 2009 additionally he et al 2017 reported the equifinality of different combinations of cultivar parameters calibrated at a single site he et al 2017 hence large uncertainty would be generated in regional crop growth simulations with single site calibrated cultivar parameters the results of the ssps indicated the importance of using observations from different climate conditions in parameter calibration and model validation therefore we developed the nrps strategy by using all of the 57 station observations in 2010 to parameterize the cultivar compared with the ssps the simulation errors were reduced besides good simulation accuracy was also achieved at the nanchuan station the five points in the top right corners of fig 4a and b where spring wheat was sown in autumn however the one representative cultivar assumption was contradicted the actual production situation especially in a country with a wide range of climates such as china in addition massive data of different climatic zones were required in the estimation of cultivar genetic parameters in this strategy however field observations were usually scarce in many countries which would result in invalid simulations in the large scales xiong et al 2014 4 2 phenology simulations with multiple representative cultivars rrps and vcps compared with the ssps and nrps the highest and second highest simulation accuracies were provided by this strategy for maturity and anthesis respectively the representative cultivar parameters estimated in large scales showed great potential in regional crop growth simulations jiang and jin 2009 also reported that the genetic parameters estimated in the aez level provided the highest simulations accuracy for rice in jiangsu province in china therond et al 2011 estimated the genetic parameters of maize and wheat in regional scale and applied these parameters in the simulations across 12 european countries compared with the simulations with only one representative cultivar the accuracies were substantially improved with the regional representative cultivar however the rrps strategy increased the difficulty and time consumption in the estimations of cultivar genetic parameter besides this strategy was also invalid when observation data were scarce in this study several possible distributions uniform normal lognormal and logistic were assumed for the three cultivars parameters then different vcps were sampled from different combinations of these distributions and validated at altay the results indicated that similar anthesis and maturity dates were simulated with different parameter distributions hence we defined p1v p1d and p5 followed the uniform distributions gao et al 2020 and ma et al 2020 also accepted the uniform distribution assumption for the three parameters the results demonstrated the uniform distribution was reasonable since the similar ranges and median values of anthesis and maturity date simulations were obtained by the randomly sampled vcps and the 40 sets of calibrated parameters however variations of anthesis and maturity date simulations with the vcps and the calibrated parameters were both smaller than the observations at altay it was mainly because the parameterization of the 40 cultivars were conducted based on the experiments at yangling where phenology observations taken small variations the vcps obtained the smallest simulation errors for anthesis date which indicated good estimations for the parameter p1v and p1d hunt et al 1993 pointed that the parameter p5 was the most sensitive parameter affecting grain filling duration hence the vcps obtained second highest simulation errors in maturity date due to underestimation of the grain filling duration which indicated the parameterization deviation of the parameter p5 for the 12 stations with rmse 12 d with the vcps strategy table 2 the frigid climate conditions might let local farmers sow spring wheat cultivars different from the 40 cultivars involved in our study xiong 2009 evaluate the ceres wheat model in wheat growth simulations in china they pointed that the largest simulation errors were obtained in the 8th and 9th aze with high altitudes which was similar as the region ⅲ and ⅴ in this study with rmse values greater than 35 in general more experimental observations of more spring wheat cultivars sown in various areas were needed to modify the posterior distribution for parameter p5 4 3 comparisons among the four upscaling strategies in this study four upscaling strategies for cultivar genetic parameters of spring wheat were established and evaluated in general the simulation errors of maturity date were greater that anthesis date for all of the four strategies three sources of uncertainties were involved in the agricultural and environmental modeling namely equations input variables and parameter values wallach et al 2019 models are simplifications of the real world to some extent by using huge amount of equations however errors were introduced when using these equations to reproduce crop growth processes for example the simulation of maturity date was based on the simulation of anthesis and grain filling duration more processes with corresponding errors were involved in the simulation of maturity date than in the simulation of anthesis date wallach et al 2017 reported that the model structure generated larger uncertainty than model parameters the poor performance of the ceres wheat model in maturity date simulations might be caused by the unclear mechanism nouna et al 2003 and yao et al 2020 reported that the ceres series models provided large simulation errors under serious water stress the spring wheat was all rainfed at the 57 stations which might suffer from water stress since rainfall were mainly occurred in summer in our study area the second possible reason for the greater errors in maturity data simulation might be the erroneous maturity observation seidel et al 2019 reported that the availability of spatial and temporal data has become the main limitation for crop modeling seidel et al 2019 the input data that well represent the production situation of the target area were essential for reliable simulations xiong et al 2019 the third possible reason was the insufficient parameterization of the parameters that affect the phenology processes as reported by ottman et al 2013 17 parameters affect wheat phenology processes in the dssat ceres wheat model however we only estimated four of them and mainly focused on the three cultivar genetic parameters p1v p1d and p5 higher prediction accuracy might be achieved by taking into consideration of more parameters in addition messina et al 2006 suggested that the estimations of cultivar genetic parameters should take into account the genetic information a gene based system for estimating genetic specific parameters might offer better long term prospects for reducing simulation error making it easier to apply models at regional to global scales white et al 2008 generally there were several advantages for the vcps strategy in crop growth simulations at regional scales first variations in spring wheat cultivars were involved in regional simulations which was impossible by the ssps and nrps strategy next the uncertainties generated by crop cultivars were taken into account in regional simulations which were usually ignored in many previous studies of crop growth response to climate changes in large area third this strategy accounted for the variations of crop cultivars since 1000 sets of virtual cultivars were used in simulations which might contain the cultivar that was exactly sown in the study area fourth this strategy was possible to help explain the interactions of genotype g environment e management m finally this strategy was ideal for places where basic experimental observations were extremely scarce the virtual cultivars generated with the posterior parameter distributions could be used directly in areas lacking of field measurements however the disadvantages of the vcps strategy were also apparent first crop growth simulations and analysis became further complicated by considering the crop cultivar uncertainties next model runs and time consumption are dramatically increased if the 1000 virtual cultivars generated from the posterior parameter distributions were all applied in growth simulations the number of model runs would be 1000 times of that using only one representative cultivar with the increases available of high performance computing platforms the time consuming problem of large number of model runs could be expected to be solved finally different sampling sizes will be tried to evaluate the performance of the vcps in regional simulations through which the minimum optimal number of virtual cultivar parameters might be found 5 conclusions few simulation studies have examined the uncertainties caused by cultivar differences in large scale simulations despite the wide use of crop models among the four upscaling strategies the ssps and nrps strategies generated considerable errors in anthesis and maturity dates throughout china therefore we do not recommend these strategies in regions with obviously different field management practices the rrps strategy provided more reliable simulation accuracy comparing with the ssps and nrps but the data requirement was massive and the parameter calibration processes were complex and time consuming therefore this strategy is not recommended where observation data are scarce according to the vcps strategy using an ensemble of different spring wheat cultivars summarized as genetic parameter distributions could account for the unknown sown cultivars in large scale crop growth simulations besides the virtual spring wheat cultivars could be directly sampled from the simple uniform distributions without local calibration it was reasonable to expect that the consideration of uncertainty in crop cultivars will contribute to more reliable simulations of crop growth at large scales generally we recommended both rrps and vcps strategies in regional spring wheat phenology simulations and the rrps strategy was more suitable for maturity date estimations in large regions containing a wide range of climates declaration of competing interest the authors

9858,the winter wheat summer maize rotation system is one of the most successful intensification agricultural systems in china but low and unstable grain yield gy and high soil nitrate n leaching caused by erratic precipitation and inefficient management of irrigation and fertilization have attracted wide attention a two year 2018 2020 field experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of four water and nitrogen management strategies a conventional irrigation and fertilization ck and three drip fertigation treatments rain fed rf deficit irrigation di and full irrigation fi on soil water soil nitrate n residual gy water productivity wp nitrogen use efficiency nue and net income in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system the results indicated that water and nitrogen management strategies had significant effects on soil water content in the 0 320 cm soil profile more than 90 mm soil water in the 0 320 cm soil layer was consumed by winter wheat and the soil water consumption followed the order of rf di ck fi the soil water consumption can be replenished by irrigation and precipitation during the summer maize season but the soil water in 180 260 cm under rf was significantly lower than that in the other treatments which could not be fully replenished there was no significant difference in the nitrate n residual in the 0 180 cm soil layer among the treatments at harvest but the nitrate n residual rate of ck less than 40 and 30 at winter wheat and summer maize harvest was significantly lower than that of drip fertigation more than 50 and 40 at winter wheat and summer maize harvest in the 0 60 cm soil profile but significantly higher than that in the 60 180 cm soil profile these results indicate that drip fertigation had a lower risk of nitrate leaching compared with ck treatment gy and nue of di and fi treatments were significantly higher than those of ck and rf treatments but di used 25 less irrigation water than fi resulting in higher wp the wp of di was increased by 6 8 7 4 and 4 2 16 0 for winter wheat and summer maize compared with fi respectively from the perspective of winter wheat summer maize rotation system the two year average net income of di was increased by 2 8 37 9 and 59 9 compared with fi rf and ck respectively therefore deficit irrigation with nitrogen fertigation was recommended as a sustainable fertigation strategy for achieving higher grain yield nitrogen use efficiency water productivity and net income and reducing the risk of soil nitrate n leaching in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system keywords soil water dynamics nitrate n residual deficit irrigation nitrogen fertigation 1 introduction with the rapid increase of global population the food production must continue to increase in the future alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 spiertz 2013 the substantial increase of food production may need to come from the intensification agricultural systems lu et al 2021 the winter wheat summer maize rotation system is one of the most successful intensification agricultural systems in china which produced approximately 45 of the national wheat and 30 of the national maize zhang et al 2021 accounting for approximately 25 total national food production of china yang et al 2014 therefore the winter wheat summer maize rotation system should be paid more attention in coping with the food shortage caused by increased population nitrogen n is the foremost nutrient for crop growth however it was often over applied to achieve high grain yield zhang et al 2019 ju et al 2009 lambert et al 2006 in winter wheat summer maize rotation regions farmers often apply all n at once before sowing or apply 50 of the total n at sowing and top dressing the rest of n at crop jointing stage lu et al 2021a which often leads to a high risk of nitrate n leaching lu et al 2021a zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2012 in addition when the soil nitrate leached into deep soil out of the root layer in the early stage it will cause crop to suffer nitrogen stress in the middle and late growth stages zhou et al 2018 which further exacerbates the excessive use of n fertilizers excessive n application with a large amount of irrigation or intensive precipitation aggravates soil nitrate n into deeper soil layers lu et al 2019 hondebrink et al 2017 which not only increase groundwater pollution risk but also reduces nitrogen use efficiency nue gillette et al 2018 yin et al 2017 previous studies have reported that soil nitrate n leaching loss depends not only on the concentration of soil nitrate n but also on the drainage water amount from the crop root zone lu et al 2021a cameron et al 2013 therefore optimizing water and nitrogen management is essential to alleviate nitrogen leaching losses the guanzhong plain located in a temperate continental monsoon climate region is one of the main planting areas of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in china in this region the average precipitation 1985 2020 in winter wheat from oct to may of the next year and summer maize season from jun to sep were 203 9 mm ranged from 107 1 mm to 330 7 mm and 350 5 mm ranged from 139 0 mm to 672 7 mm respectively it can be clearly seen that the average precipitation during the crop growing season had an obvious gap with the water requirement of winter wheat 450 500 mm reported by liu et al 2002 and zhang et al 2002 and summer maize 423 mm reported by liu et al 2002 in addition inter annual and seasonal difference in precipitation often causes crop to suffer drought stress yan et al 2020 although more than 60 precipitation falls in the growing season of summer maize the seasonal droughts are prone to occur due to erratic and uneven precipitation shen et al 2020 although xu et al 2020 had given some suggestions for irrigation of winter wheat and summer maize in dry normal and wet years it is difficult to irrigate crop due to uncertainty of precipitation and difficulty of hydrological type determination in growth stage crop evapotranspiration etc has been widely used to guide irrigation in arid and semi arid regions by using a fixed irrigation time interval 4 day 8 day 10 day or 12 day and achieved good application effect under drip fertigation that is the crop water use efficiency and grain yield were significantly improved yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2019 however frequent irrigation with small irrigation amount is difficult to implement under traditional irrigation flood and border irrigation common irrigation method in winter wheat summer maize rotation system and the fixed time irrigation interval based on etthe c was not economic in semi humid and drought prone regions owing to erratic and relatively frequent precipitation therefore some studies have begun to use drip irrigation system by setting different irrigation amounts si et al 2020 or based on etc in semi humid and drought prone regions yan et al 2020 unfortunately the possibility of precipitation after irrigation is significantly increased in winter wheat summer maize rotation regions which significantly increases the risk of nitrate n leaching lu et al 2021a in recently years the accuracy of weather forecast has improved significantly therefore using a fixed irrigation amount based on etc combined with weather forecast may be a feasible strategy to guide irrigation in this region in the context of water scarcity making full use of the precipitation is an important means to improve water productivity alleviate the irrigation water crisis and increase crop yield yang et al 2021 deficit irrigation has been recommended to maximize water productivity and maintain high grain yield lu et al 2021b geerts and raes 2009 for winter wheat summer maize rotation system soil nitrogen and water conditions for the current crop are also influenced by fertilization and irrigation strategy of previous crops lu et al 2021 suitable water deficit can promote the assimilation and utilization of soil water and nutrients in the deep soil layer 200 cm or deeper soil layer by winter wheat roots without significant yield reduction zhang et al 2008 2009 which is beneficial to increase a soil reservoir to store more precipitation in rainy season to reduce both drainage and n leaching simultaneously previous researchers have reported that applying a fraction of total n at sowing planting and multi split top dressing other n according to the requirements of crop can promote nue and grain yield by using drip fertigation lu et al 2021a zhou et al 2018 drip fertigation changes the crop growth which in turn affects the absorption and utilization of water and nitrogen however few studies have focused on the effects of multi split top dressing n combined deficit irrigation based on weather forecast and crop evapotranspiration on the crop grain yield water productivity wp nue deeper soil water dynamic and nitrate n residual especially the effects on soil water and nitrate n residual from the perspective of winter wheat summer maize rotation system therefore a continuous two year field experiment was carried out in guanzhong plain for the purpose to 1 understand the soil water dynamics in winter wheat summer maize rotation system under different water and nitrogen strategy especially in deeper soil profile 2 clarify the soil nitrate n residual in different soil layers under different water and nitrogen strategies 3 understand the responses of grain yield wp and nue of winter wheat and summer maize to different water and nitrogen strategies this study will give a water and nitrogen management suggestion for obtaining sustainable high grain yield wp and nue and reducing the risk of soil nitrate n leaching in winter wheat summer maize rotation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description a two year field experiment of winter wheat summer maize rotation was performed at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and

published article of lu et al 2021c and table 1 according to the usda soil taxonomic system the soil texture was silty clay loam air temperature wind speed 2 m relative humidity solar radiation and precipitation were measured by a national general weather station next to the experiment field about 30 m the precipitation and daily average temperature during experiment periods are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment consisted of four treatments a conventional irrigation and fertilization ck and three drip fertigation treatments and each treatment was repeated three times a total of 12 plots each plot had an area of 25 2 m2 7 m 3 6 m separated by a buffer zone between adjacent plots to prevent mutual interaction three drip fertigations were full irrigation fi 100 etc e t c k c e t 0 mm d 1 deficit irrigation di 75 etc and rain fed rf drip system only being used for fertigation k c was the crop coefficient which was set as 0 6 and 0 4 from the emergence to jointing 1 2 and 1 1 from the jointing to milk stage and 0 6 and 0 4 from the milk stage to harvest for summer maize and winter wheat respectively allen et al 1998 wang et al 2020 gao et al 2009 reference crop evapotranspiration et0 fig 1 was estimated by using the f a o 56 penman monteith formula yan et al 2020 allen et al 1998 according to the previous field infiltration tests irrigation amount was set as 30 mm and 22 5 mm for fi treatment irrigation was applied when the accumulated etc after last irrigation including more than 30 mm precipitation reached 30 mm and no precipitation was forecasted for the next three days and the detailed irrigation scheduling was given by lu et al 2021b for ck treatment irrigation was implemented at overwintering and jointing stage of winter wheat and jointing stage of summer maize the irrigation amount was 90 mm each time which was controlled by a water meter the detailed irrigation scheduling based on etc and precipitation forecast is shown in table 2 for ck treatment the nitrogen of 255 kg ha 1 and 210 kg ha 1 were evenly split into two applications and spread at sowing and jointing stage of winter wheat and summer maize respectively considering drip fertigation can improve nue the total nitrogen amount of 170 kg ha 1 and 150 kg ha 1 was used for winter wheat and summer maize under three drip fertigation treatments respectively for winter wheat 20 of the total nitrogen was surface spread as base fertilizer before sowing and 80 of the total nitrogen was evenly split into four applications namely each 20 was applied at regreening jointing booting and grain filling stage respectively for summer maize 20 30 30 and 20 of the total nitrogen were applied at sowing seedling jointing and grain filling stage using a drip fertigation system respectively all treatments received 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 for winter wheat 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 for summer maize the drip fertigation system was placed after the sowing of winter wheat considering the economic cost the drip tapes φ16 mm were arranged 60 cm apart from that is one drip line served three rows of winter wheat and the summer maize was planted next to the old drip tapes one drip line irrigated one row of summer maize the winter wheat cv xiaoyan22 was sown manually with 20 cm row spacing on october 10 2018 and october 12 2019 respectively the seeding rate was 187 5 kg ha 1 the winter wheat was manually harvested on june 4 of 2019 and 2020 respectively after winter wheat harvest summer maize cv zhengdan 958 was directly planted without tilling the soil by a manual maize planter on june 9 2019 and june 7 2020 and was harvested around september 25 in 2019 and 2020 the planting density was 70 922 plants ha 1 plant spacing 23 5 cm and row spacing 60 cm other agronomic practices including disease and pest prevention and weeding etc were in accordance with the local farmers management in order to obtain more reliable experimental results we implemented the same field pre experiments in 2017 2018 as those in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 but the measurements of related indicators were not detailed especially for winter wheat which were not presented in the present study 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 grain yield at maturity three areas of 1 m2 winter wheat and five groups of 10 consecutive summer maize plants were harvested respectively the grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize was calculated on 13 and 14 moisture content respectively 2 3 2 soil water content and soil nitrate n content soil samples were collected by using a hand held soil auger 4 5 cm in diameter contains many 1 m extension rods at 0 and 30 cm distances to the drip irrigation tape the soil samples at each location were collected at depth of 0 500 and 0 320 cm 20 cm increments at the winter wheat and summer maize harvest time respectively in addition the soil samples at harvest time of 2018 summer maize was also collected at depth of 0 320 cm from each plot to calculate the soil water storage difference of 2018 2019 winter wheat growing season soil samples were separated into two sub samples well mixed one for measuring soil water content and another 0 180 cm soil samples for testing soil nitrate n content the measurement process can be found in lu et al 2021a 2 3 3 soil water storage and

spss inc chicago usa at the p 0 05 level based on least significant difference lsd method 3 results 3 1 soil water content at winter wheat harvest the soil water content of rf in 0 320 cm soil profile was significantly lower than other treatments ck di and fi during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons and the soil water content in 60 120 cm soil profile of di and ck was significantly lower than fi but significantly higher than rf fig 2 a and c the soil water content in 320 500 cm soil profile maintained the higher level more than 30 and there was insignificant difference among rf di fi and ck treatments at summer maize harvest in 2019 the soil water content in 0 180 cm soil layer of all treatments was more than 26 and had insignificant difference due to continuous precipitation 176 mm from september 9th to 19th during the 2019 summer maize growing season fig 1 in order to avoid the impact of pre harvest precipitation on soil water content of different treatments the soil water content was determined on september 19th in 2020 before precipitation based on weather forecast therefore the soil water content in the 0 180 cm soil layer followed the order of fi di ck rf at 2020 summer maize harvest fig 2 d which truly reflected the water consumption of summer maize under different treatments in addition another interesting phenomenon was that the soil water content in 180 260 cm soil layer of rf was significantly lower than other treatments at summer maize harvest fig 2 b and d the soil water storage difference swsd the soil water storage at harvest minus the soil water storage at sowing in the 0 320 cm soil layer was negative in winter wheat growing season but positive in summer maize growing season fig 3 this means that the soil water was consumed in winter wheat season and replenished in summer maize season in 2018 2019 winter wheat season the soil water consumption showed rf 146 4 mm di 137 2 mm fi 135 8 mm but the difference was insignificant p 0 05 in 2019 summer maize season the replenishment amount of soil water showed that rf 214 8 mm was significantly higher than di 186 1 mm and di was significantly higher than fi 141 1 mm in 2019 2020 winter wheat season the soil water consumption showed rf 177 8 mm di 128 6 mm ck 109 2 mm fi 92 6 mm the soil water consumption of rf was significantly higher than that in the other treatments and the soil water consumption of fi was significantly lower than that in the other treatments in 2020 summer maize season the replenishment amount of soil water followed the order of di 87 2 mm rf 85 2 mm fi 79 9 mm ck 64 1 mm but the difference was insignificant the two year average soil water replenishment input and consumption output were basically equal under di and fi treatments but the soil water was obviously consumed under rf treatment fig 3 3 2 soil nitrate n residual the soil nitrate n residual in the 0 180 cm soil profile of all treatments ranged from 168 8 kg ha 1 to 221 9 kg ha 1 table 3 the soil nitrate n residual in 0 180 cm soil profile of ck and rf were higher than that of di and fi treatments but the difference did not reach a significant level p 0 05 the soil nitrate n residual of ck was significantly lower than that of other treatments in 0 60 cm soil profile but significantly higher than other treatments in the 60 120 cm and 120 180 cm soil profiles in the 0 60 cm soil profile the soil nitrate n residual followed the order of rf di fi except di rf fi in 2019 summer maize season however the soil nitrate n residual followed the order of fi di rf in the 60 120 cm soil profile except fi rf di in 2019 summer maize season more than 50 and 40 soil nitrate n remained in the 0 60 cm soil profile under drip fertigation at winter wheat and summer maize harvest except 37 3 soil nitrate n of fi remained in the 0 60 cm soil profile at 2020 summer maize harvest but less than 40 and 30 remained in the 0 60 cm soil profile under ck treatment at winter wheat and summer maize harvest respectively the soil nitrate n residual in the 60 120 cm soil profile increased with the increasing irrigation amount under drip fertigation the soil nitrate n residual at winter wheat harvest was greater than that at summer maize harvest in the 0 60 cm soil profile but was lower in the 60 120 cm and 120 180 cm soil profiles table 3 3 3 grain yield for winter wheat the lowest grain yield of 6 3 t ha 1 and 5 9 t ha 1 were obtained under ck treatment in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons the highest grain yield of 9 1 t ha 1 and 9 3 t ha 1 were obtained under di treatment in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons but the grain yield was not significantly different between di and fi treatments the grain yield of di and fi was increased by 43 8 and 42 9 in 2018 2019 by 56 4 and 50 5 in 2019 2020 compared with ck treatment respectively for summer maize the lowest grain yield was 8 8 t ha 1 and 8 1 t ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons and both obtained under ck treatment the highest grain yield was 11 4 t ha 1 and 10 7 t ha 1 which was obtained under di and fi treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons respectively the grain yield of di and fi was increased by 29 8 and 29 5 in 2018 2019 summer maize season and by 30 5 and 30 8 in 2019 2020 season compared with ck respectively it should be mentioned that the grain yield of rf was significantly higher than that of ck in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 rotation year except insignificant difference in 2019 2020 winter wheat season the summer maize grain yield of rf had insignificant difference from that of di and fi in 2019 2020 season but had significant difference in 2018 2019 season fig 4 3 4 crop actual evapotranspiration and water productivity for winter wheat the actual evapotranspiration ranged from 371 4 mm to 504 6 mm over the two growing seasons the water productivity ranged from 1 23 kg m 3 to 1 97 kg m 3 table 4 the actual evapotranspiration followed the order of fi di ck rf but the water productivity showed di fi rf ck over the two winter wheat growing seasons the actual evapotranspiration in 2018 2019 winter wheat growing season was lower than that in 2019 2020 season but the water productivity in 2018 2019 season was higher than that in 2019 2020 season the water productivity of rf di and fi was increased by 25 0 54 2 and 43 6 in 2019 2020 season compared with ck treatment respectively the water productivity of di was significantly higher than that of fi in 2018 2019 but had insignificant difference in 2019 2020 growing season for summer maize the actual evapotranspiration ranged from 352 2 mm to 541 9 mm over the two growing seasons the water productivity ranged from 1 50 kg m 3 to 2 90 kg m 3 table 4 the actual evapotranspiration followed the order of ck fi di rf over the two growing seasons but the water productivity showed rf di fi ck over the two growing seasons there was no significant difference in water productivity between rf and di which was significantly higher than that of fi and ck the water productivity of rf di and fi treatments was increased by 46 4 40 4 and 34 7 in 2020 summer maize growing season compared with ck treatment respectively table 4 3 5 nitrogen use efficiency the nitrogen use efficiency ranged from 28 3 kg kg 1 to 61 9 kg kg 1 for winter wheat from 38 8 kg kg 1 to 76 2 kg kg 1 for summer maize fig 5 the highest nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat was 60 7 kg kg 1 and 61 9 kg kg 1 obtained at di treatment in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons respectively which was significantly higher than that of ck and rf treatments but had insignificant difference with fi treatment the nitrogen use efficiency of rf di and fi increased by 46 5 101 3 and 100 1 in 2018 2019 seasons winter wheat growing season increased by 49 0 118 9 and 110 8 in 2019 2020 compared with ck treatment respectively in 2018 2019 season the nitrogen use efficiency of summer maize had insignificant difference between di and fi but both significant higher than that of ck and rf in 2019 2020 season there was no significant difference in nitrogen use efficiency among rf di and fi but they were all significantly higher than that of ck the summer maize nitrogen use efficiency of rf di and fi was increased by 62 2 81 7 and 81 3 in 2018 2019 season by 78 0 82 6 and 83 1 in 2019 2020 season compared with ck respectively fig 5 3 6 economic analysis the fertilizer cost of ck was higher than drip fertigation but the piping cost of drip fertigation was higher than that of ck table 5 the gross profit of winter wheat ranged from 15 190 cny ha 1 to 21 839 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 14 242 cny ha 1 to 22 273 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season the net income of winter wheat ranged from 6218 cny ha 1 to 11 712 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 5460 cny ha 1 to 11 966 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season the gross profit of summer maize ranged from 18 506 cny ha 1 to 24 013 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 17 110 cny ha 1 to 22 374 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season the net income of summer maize ranged from 11 458 cny ha 1 to 15 660 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 10 062 cny ha 1 to 14 058 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season the two year average net income followed the order of di fi ck rf for winter wheat but showed di fi rf ck for summer maize table 5 the gross profit and net income of summer maize were higher than those of winter wheat due to higher grain yield fig 4 from the perspective of the rotation system the net income ranged from 17 866 cny ha 1 to 27 373 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 15 522 cny ha 1 to 26 024 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season from the perspective of winter wheat summer maize rotation system the two year average net income of di was increased by 2 8 37 9 and 59 9 compared with fi rf and ck respectively table 5 4 discussion our study showed that the soil water storage in 0 320 cm soil layer was consumed in the winter wheat season and replenished in the summer maize season fig 3 the possible explanation was that less than 30 precipitation fell in the winter wheat season and more than 70 precipitation fell in the summer maize season fig 1 in this study 92 6 177 8 mm soil water in the top 320 cm soil profile was consumed by winter wheat during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 winter wheat growing seasons fig 3 this results was consistent with previous results that when the total irrigation amount was less than 140 mm two irrigations during winter wheat growing season the soil water consumption by winter wheat was greater than 130 mm for the 0 200 cm soil profile in the north china plain lu et al 2021 the reason was that the sum of irrigation water and precipitation was less than the winter wheat water requirement fig 1 and table 2 and the soil water stored before sowing was thus consumed as part of the water requirement in this study the soil water consumption followed the order of rf di ck fi which indicated that rf and di was more dependent on soil water storage than ck and fi treatments this conclusion was consistent with the results that soil water consumption was significantly increased with the decreasing irrigation application lu et al 2021 in the summer maize season the precipitation and irrigation are usually greater than water requirements therefore the soil water generally accumulated in particular the short term intensive and continuous precipitation in the summer maize season makes the soil water infiltrate below the summer maize root layer 0 100 cm lu et al 2021a yang et al 2015 however the winter wheat has a deep root system down to 2 m or deeper which is conduce to use deep soil water zhang et al 2004 2008 therefore the winter wheat summer maize rotation can make full use of soil water precipitation and irrigation and improve water productivity in addition previous studies reported that slight water shortage during vegetation stage can stimulate roots to grow into deeper soil layer xu et al 2016 leading to the higher root in deeper soil layer zhang et al 2004 li et al 2010 therefore the more soil water in deep soil layer was consumed under water shortage condition than adequate irrigation moreover our study showed that the soil water content in the 180 260 cm soil layer of rf was significantly lower than that in the other treatments at summer maize harvest fig 2 b and d this was because the deep soil water was consumed by winter wheat which was not fully replenished by precipitation during the summer maize season unfortunately the root depth and distribution were not measured in this study but zhang et al 2004 reported that the root length density of winter wheat was still at a high level at 200 cm soil depth especially higher under rain fed conditions therefore we guesses that there was capillary ascending water in the 180 320 cm soil profiles in the winter wheat season and there were also a small number of roots below 200 cm soil depth in future research the soil water content and winter wheat root should be measured at the same time although precipitation may further supplement soil water after summer maize harvest fig 1 soil desiccation phenomenon may exist in the rain fed winter wheat summer maize rotation system due to drip fertigation increased crop water consumption zhang et al 2018 li et al 2013 for winter wheat summer maize rotation system suitable water deficit in winter wheat season increases soil reservoir capacity xu et al 2016 which is conducive to storing more precipitation in the soil during the summer maize season rainy season to a certain extent this helps to avoid reduce the occurrence of leaching in the summer maize season in this study the nitrogen application rate of ck was greater than that of drip feritgation but the soil nitrate n residual had insignificant difference among all treatments at winter wheat and summer maize harvest table 3 one possible reason was that large spatial variability of soil nitrate n resulted in insignificant difference in statistics but the soil nitrate n residual of ck was higher than that of drip fertigation table 3 another possible reason was that spreading a large amount of nitrogen application at one time under ck increased the loss of ammonia volatilization due to the fact that ammonia volatilization loss response to increasing n was exponential ma et al 2010 rochette et al 2013 and the loss of nitrogen fertilizer also existed in the process of fertilizer spreading the soil nitrate n residual of drip fertigation was significantly higher than that of ck in the 0 60 cm soil layer in this study and more than 50 and 40 soil nitrate n residual remained in 0 60 cm soil layer at winter wheat and summer maize harvest time under drip fertigation table 3 the reason was that the nitrogen fertilizer was mainly applied at the early growth stage of maize which led to higher soil nitrate n and higher soil nitrate n increased nitrate leaching losses during precipitation and irrigation lu et al 2021a cameron et al 2013 in this study we also found that the soil nitrate n residual in the 60 180 cm soil layer at summer maize harvest was greater than that at winter wheat harvest table 3 one possible reason was that the ca 70 precipitation fell in summer maize season fig 1 which led to part of the nitrate n leaching into deep soils yang et al 2015 another possible reason was that winter wheat root grew deeper 200 cm or deeper than summer maize 100 cm which was conducive to the absorption of soil water and nitrogen ma et al 2019 zhou et al 2008 zhang et al 2004 in this study the grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize had insignificant difference between di and fi treatments but the water productivity of di was significantly higher than that of fi table 4 the reason was that the crop actual evapotranspiration of di was lower than that of fi previous research reported that deficit irrigated winter wheat had lower luxury transpiration than fully irrigated winter wheat liang et al 2018 and reducing luxury transpiration was conducive to reducing the actual water consumption of crops and improving water productivity kang et al 2017 the similar result also was reported that suitable deficit irrigation can not only achieve higher grain yield but also improve water productivity compared with full irrigation abd el mageed et al 2018 in this study the winter wheat grain yield of ck was significantly lower than that of rf in 2018 2019 season and it had insignificant difference in 2019 2020 season the reason was that drip fertigation compensated the negative impact of water deficit on wheat grain yield and the contribution of nitrogen fertilizer application to winter wheat yield far exceeded that of irrigation in guanzhong plain lu et al 2021c for summer maize the grain yield of rf was significantly higher than that of ck and there was even no significant difference with di and fi treatments in 2020 this was mainly due to the abundant precipitation in the summer maize season and the drip fertigation significantly increased maize yield our results showed that 170 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 150 kg n ha 1 for summer maize can achieve the higher grain yield under drip fertigation the similar result was also reported by yang et al 2017 who suggested that the suitable nitrogen application rates for high grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize were 150 170 kg ha 1 and 180 200 kg ha 1 respectively however the grain yield of our study was higher than the grain yield reported by yang et al 2017 and qiang et al 2019 in this study the nitrogen use efficiency of di and fi was significantly higher than that of ck and rf the reason was that di and fi treatments can timely and accurately supply water and nitrogen to root zone matching the distribution of water nutrients and crop roots yan et al 2021 li et al 2018 maximizing the coupling effect of water and fertilizer so as to achieve high crop yield and improve water and nitrogen productivity yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 jha et al 2019 wang et al 2018 5 conclusions optimized water and nitrogen management can not only increase the grain yield water and nitrogen productivity of winter wheat and summer maize but also reduce the risk of nitrate n leaching our study showed that drip fertigation can significantly increase the soil nitrate n residual of crop main root zone 0 60 cm compared with traditional practice the soil nitrate n residual at winter wheat harvest was greater than that at summer maize harvest in the 0 60 cm soil profile and winter wheat absorbed more nitrate nitrogen than summer maize in the 60 180 cm soil profile in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system the soil water of rain fed with nitrogen fertigation could not be fully replenished by irrigation and precipitation existing soil desiccation risk in the 180 260 soil profile due to the increased crop water consumption by drip fertigation for winter wheat and summer maize the grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency of deficit irrigation and full irrigation were significantly higher than those of the other treatments under drip fertigation but deficit irrigation increased water productivity and net income than full irrigation therefore deficit irrigation with nitrogen fertigation was recommended as a sustainable fertigation strategy for achieving higher grain yield nitrogen use efficiency water productivity and net income and reducing the risk of soil nitrate n leaching in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system in future study the root distribution of winter wheat summer maize rotation system under drip fertigation condition should be clarified declaration of

9858,the winter wheat summer maize rotation system is one of the most successful intensification agricultural systems in china but low and unstable grain yield gy and high soil nitrate n leaching caused by erratic precipitation and inefficient management of irrigation and fertilization have attracted wide attention a two year 2018 2020 field experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of four water and nitrogen management strategies a conventional irrigation and fertilization ck and three drip fertigation treatments rain fed rf deficit irrigation di and full irrigation fi on soil water soil nitrate n residual gy water productivity wp nitrogen use efficiency nue and net income in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system the results indicated that water and nitrogen management strategies had significant effects on soil water content in the 0 320 cm soil profile more than 90 mm soil water in the 0 320 cm soil layer was consumed by winter wheat and the soil water consumption followed the order of rf di ck fi the soil water consumption can be replenished by irrigation and precipitation during the summer maize season but the soil water in 180 260 cm under rf was significantly lower than that in the other treatments which could not be fully replenished there was no significant difference in the nitrate n residual in the 0 180 cm soil layer among the treatments at harvest but the nitrate n residual rate of ck less than 40 and 30 at winter wheat and summer maize harvest was significantly lower than that of drip fertigation more than 50 and 40 at winter wheat and summer maize harvest in the 0 60 cm soil profile but significantly higher than that in the 60 180 cm soil profile these results indicate that drip fertigation had a lower risk of nitrate leaching compared with ck treatment gy and nue of di and fi treatments were significantly higher than those of ck and rf treatments but di used 25 less irrigation water than fi resulting in higher wp the wp of di was increased by 6 8 7 4 and 4 2 16 0 for winter wheat and summer maize compared with fi respectively from the perspective of winter wheat summer maize rotation system the two year average net income of di was increased by 2 8 37 9 and 59 9 compared with fi rf and ck respectively therefore deficit irrigation with nitrogen fertigation was recommended as a sustainable fertigation strategy for achieving higher grain yield nitrogen use efficiency water productivity and net income and reducing the risk of soil nitrate n leaching in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system keywords soil water dynamics nitrate n residual deficit irrigation nitrogen fertigation 1 introduction with the rapid increase of global population the food production must continue to increase in the future alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 spiertz 2013 the substantial increase of food production may need to come from the intensification agricultural systems lu et al 2021 the winter wheat summer maize rotation system is one of the most successful intensification agricultural systems in china which produced approximately 45 of the national wheat and 30 of the national maize zhang et al 2021 accounting for approximately 25 total national food production of china yang et al 2014 therefore the winter wheat summer maize rotation system should be paid more attention in coping with the food shortage caused by increased population nitrogen n is the foremost nutrient for crop growth however it was often over applied to achieve high grain yield zhang et al 2019 ju et al 2009 lambert et al 2006 in winter wheat summer maize rotation regions farmers often apply all n at once before sowing or apply 50 of the total n at sowing and top dressing the rest of n at crop jointing stage lu et al 2021a which often leads to a high risk of nitrate n leaching lu et al 2021a zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2012 in addition when the soil nitrate leached into deep soil out of the root layer in the early stage it will cause crop to suffer nitrogen stress in the middle and late growth stages zhou et al 2018 which further exacerbates the excessive use of n fertilizers excessive n application with a large amount of irrigation or intensive precipitation aggravates soil nitrate n into deeper soil layers lu et al 2019 hondebrink et al 2017 which not only increase groundwater pollution risk but also reduces nitrogen use efficiency nue gillette et al 2018 yin et al 2017 previous studies have reported that soil nitrate n leaching loss depends not only on the concentration of soil nitrate n but also on the drainage water amount from the crop root zone lu et al 2021a cameron et al 2013 therefore optimizing water and nitrogen management is essential to alleviate nitrogen leaching losses the guanzhong plain located in a temperate continental monsoon climate region is one of the main planting areas of winter wheat summer maize rotation system in china in this region the average precipitation 1985 2020 in winter wheat from oct to may of the next year and summer maize season from jun to sep were 203 9 mm ranged from 107 1 mm to 330 7 mm and 350 5 mm ranged from 139 0 mm to 672 7 mm respectively it can be clearly seen that the average precipitation during the crop growing season had an obvious gap with the water requirement of winter wheat 450 500 mm reported by liu et al 2002 and zhang et al 2002 and summer maize 423 mm reported by liu et al 2002 in addition inter annual and seasonal difference in precipitation often causes crop to suffer drought stress yan et al 2020 although more than 60 precipitation falls in the growing season of summer maize the seasonal droughts are prone to occur due to erratic and uneven precipitation shen et al 2020 although xu et al 2020 had given some suggestions for irrigation of winter wheat and summer maize in dry normal and wet years it is difficult to irrigate crop due to uncertainty of precipitation and difficulty of hydrological type determination in growth stage crop evapotranspiration etc has been widely used to guide irrigation in arid and semi arid regions by using a fixed irrigation time interval 4 day 8 day 10 day or 12 day and achieved good application effect under drip fertigation that is the crop water use efficiency and grain yield were significantly improved yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2019 however frequent irrigation with small irrigation amount is difficult to implement under traditional irrigation flood and border irrigation common irrigation method in winter wheat summer maize rotation system and the fixed time irrigation interval based on etthe c was not economic in semi humid and drought prone regions owing to erratic and relatively frequent precipitation therefore some studies have begun to use drip irrigation system by setting different irrigation amounts si et al 2020 or based on etc in semi humid and drought prone regions yan et al 2020 unfortunately the possibility of precipitation after irrigation is significantly increased in winter wheat summer maize rotation regions which significantly increases the risk of nitrate n leaching lu et al 2021a in recently years the accuracy of weather forecast has improved significantly therefore using a fixed irrigation amount based on etc combined with weather forecast may be a feasible strategy to guide irrigation in this region in the context of water scarcity making full use of the precipitation is an important means to improve water productivity alleviate the irrigation water crisis and increase crop yield yang et al 2021 deficit irrigation has been recommended to maximize water productivity and maintain high grain yield lu et al 2021b geerts and raes 2009 for winter wheat summer maize rotation system soil nitrogen and water conditions for the current crop are also influenced by fertilization and irrigation strategy of previous crops lu et al 2021 suitable water deficit can promote the assimilation and utilization of soil water and nutrients in the deep soil layer 200 cm or deeper soil layer by winter wheat roots without significant yield reduction zhang et al 2008 2009 which is beneficial to increase a soil reservoir to store more precipitation in rainy season to reduce both drainage and n leaching simultaneously previous researchers have reported that applying a fraction of total n at sowing planting and multi split top dressing other n according to the requirements of crop can promote nue and grain yield by using drip fertigation lu et al 2021a zhou et al 2018 drip fertigation changes the crop growth which in turn affects the absorption and utilization of water and nitrogen however few studies have focused on the effects of multi split top dressing n combined deficit irrigation based on weather forecast and crop evapotranspiration on the crop grain yield water productivity wp nue deeper soil water dynamic and nitrate n residual especially the effects on soil water and nitrate n residual from the perspective of winter wheat summer maize rotation system therefore a continuous two year field experiment was carried out in guanzhong plain for the purpose to 1 understand the soil water dynamics in winter wheat summer maize rotation system under different water and nitrogen strategy especially in deeper soil profile 2 clarify the soil nitrate n residual in different soil layers under different water and nitrogen strategies 3 understand the responses of grain yield wp and nue of winter wheat and summer maize to different water and nitrogen strategies this study will give a water and nitrogen management suggestion for obtaining sustainable high grain yield wp and nue and reducing the risk of soil nitrate n leaching in winter wheat summer maize rotation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description a two year field experiment of winter wheat summer maize rotation was performed at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and

published article of lu et al 2021c and table 1 according to the usda soil taxonomic system the soil texture was silty clay loam air temperature wind speed 2 m relative humidity solar radiation and precipitation were measured by a national general weather station next to the experiment field about 30 m the precipitation and daily average temperature during experiment periods are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment consisted of four treatments a conventional irrigation and fertilization ck and three drip fertigation treatments and each treatment was repeated three times a total of 12 plots each plot had an area of 25 2 m2 7 m 3 6 m separated by a buffer zone between adjacent plots to prevent mutual interaction three drip fertigations were full irrigation fi 100 etc e t c k c e t 0 mm d 1 deficit irrigation di 75 etc and rain fed rf drip system only being used for fertigation k c was the crop coefficient which was set as 0 6 and 0 4 from the emergence to jointing 1 2 and 1 1 from the jointing to milk stage and 0 6 and 0 4 from the milk stage to harvest for summer maize and winter wheat respectively allen et al 1998 wang et al 2020 gao et al 2009 reference crop evapotranspiration et0 fig 1 was estimated by using the f a o 56 penman monteith formula yan et al 2020 allen et al 1998 according to the previous field infiltration tests irrigation amount was set as 30 mm and 22 5 mm for fi treatment irrigation was applied when the accumulated etc after last irrigation including more than 30 mm precipitation reached 30 mm and no precipitation was forecasted for the next three days and the detailed irrigation scheduling was given by lu et al 2021b for ck treatment irrigation was implemented at overwintering and jointing stage of winter wheat and jointing stage of summer maize the irrigation amount was 90 mm each time which was controlled by a water meter the detailed irrigation scheduling based on etc and precipitation forecast is shown in table 2 for ck treatment the nitrogen of 255 kg ha 1 and 210 kg ha 1 were evenly split into two applications and spread at sowing and jointing stage of winter wheat and summer maize respectively considering drip fertigation can improve nue the total nitrogen amount of 170 kg ha 1 and 150 kg ha 1 was used for winter wheat and summer maize under three drip fertigation treatments respectively for winter wheat 20 of the total nitrogen was surface spread as base fertilizer before sowing and 80 of the total nitrogen was evenly split into four applications namely each 20 was applied at regreening jointing booting and grain filling stage respectively for summer maize 20 30 30 and 20 of the total nitrogen were applied at sowing seedling jointing and grain filling stage using a drip fertigation system respectively all treatments received 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 for winter wheat 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 for summer maize the drip fertigation system was placed after the sowing of winter wheat considering the economic cost the drip tapes φ16 mm were arranged 60 cm apart from that is one drip line served three rows of winter wheat and the summer maize was planted next to the old drip tapes one drip line irrigated one row of summer maize the winter wheat cv xiaoyan22 was sown manually with 20 cm row spacing on october 10 2018 and october 12 2019 respectively the seeding rate was 187 5 kg ha 1 the winter wheat was manually harvested on june 4 of 2019 and 2020 respectively after winter wheat harvest summer maize cv zhengdan 958 was directly planted without tilling the soil by a manual maize planter on june 9 2019 and june 7 2020 and was harvested around september 25 in 2019 and 2020 the planting density was 70 922 plants ha 1 plant spacing 23 5 cm and row spacing 60 cm other agronomic practices including disease and pest prevention and weeding etc were in accordance with the local farmers management in order to obtain more reliable experimental results we implemented the same field pre experiments in 2017 2018 as those in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 but the measurements of related indicators were not detailed especially for winter wheat which were not presented in the present study 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 grain yield at maturity three areas of 1 m2 winter wheat and five groups of 10 consecutive summer maize plants were harvested respectively the grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize was calculated on 13 and 14 moisture content respectively 2 3 2 soil water content and soil nitrate n content soil samples were collected by using a hand held soil auger 4 5 cm in diameter contains many 1 m extension rods at 0 and 30 cm distances to the drip irrigation tape the soil samples at each location were collected at depth of 0 500 and 0 320 cm 20 cm increments at the winter wheat and summer maize harvest time respectively in addition the soil samples at harvest time of 2018 summer maize was also collected at depth of 0 320 cm from each plot to calculate the soil water storage difference of 2018 2019 winter wheat growing season soil samples were separated into two sub samples well mixed one for measuring soil water content and another 0 180 cm soil samples for testing soil nitrate n content the measurement process can be found in lu et al 2021a 2 3 3 soil water storage and

spss inc chicago usa at the p 0 05 level based on least significant difference lsd method 3 results 3 1 soil water content at winter wheat harvest the soil water content of rf in 0 320 cm soil profile was significantly lower than other treatments ck di and fi during the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons and the soil water content in 60 120 cm soil profile of di and ck was significantly lower than fi but significantly higher than rf fig 2 a and c the soil water content in 320 500 cm soil profile maintained the higher level more than 30 and there was insignificant difference among rf di fi and ck treatments at summer maize harvest in 2019 the soil water content in 0 180 cm soil layer of all treatments was more than 26 and had insignificant difference due to continuous precipitation 176 mm from september 9th to 19th during the 2019 summer maize growing season fig 1 in order to avoid the impact of pre harvest precipitation on soil water content of different treatments the soil water content was determined on september 19th in 2020 before precipitation based on weather forecast therefore the soil water content in the 0 180 cm soil layer followed the order of fi di ck rf at 2020 summer maize harvest fig 2 d which truly reflected the water consumption of summer maize under different treatments in addition another interesting phenomenon was that the soil water content in 180 260 cm soil layer of rf was significantly lower than other treatments at summer maize harvest fig 2 b and d the soil water storage difference swsd the soil water storage at harvest minus the soil water storage at sowing in the 0 320 cm soil layer was negative in winter wheat growing season but positive in summer maize growing season fig 3 this means that the soil water was consumed in winter wheat season and replenished in summer maize season in 2018 2019 winter wheat season the soil water consumption showed rf 146 4 mm di 137 2 mm fi 135 8 mm but the difference was insignificant p 0 05 in 2019 summer maize season the replenishment amount of soil water showed that rf 214 8 mm was significantly higher than di 186 1 mm and di was significantly higher than fi 141 1 mm in 2019 2020 winter wheat season the soil water consumption showed rf 177 8 mm di 128 6 mm ck 109 2 mm fi 92 6 mm the soil water consumption of rf was significantly higher than that in the other treatments and the soil water consumption of fi was significantly lower than that in the other treatments in 2020 summer maize season the replenishment amount of soil water followed the order of di 87 2 mm rf 85 2 mm fi 79 9 mm ck 64 1 mm but the difference was insignificant the two year average soil water replenishment input and consumption output were basically equal under di and fi treatments but the soil water was obviously consumed under rf treatment fig 3 3 2 soil nitrate n residual the soil nitrate n residual in the 0 180 cm soil profile of all treatments ranged from 168 8 kg ha 1 to 221 9 kg ha 1 table 3 the soil nitrate n residual in 0 180 cm soil profile of ck and rf were higher than that of di and fi treatments but the difference did not reach a significant level p 0 05 the soil nitrate n residual of ck was significantly lower than that of other treatments in 0 60 cm soil profile but significantly higher than other treatments in the 60 120 cm and 120 180 cm soil profiles in the 0 60 cm soil profile the soil nitrate n residual followed the order of rf di fi except di rf fi in 2019 summer maize season however the soil nitrate n residual followed the order of fi di rf in the 60 120 cm soil profile except fi rf di in 2019 summer maize season more than 50 and 40 soil nitrate n remained in the 0 60 cm soil profile under drip fertigation at winter wheat and summer maize harvest except 37 3 soil nitrate n of fi remained in the 0 60 cm soil profile at 2020 summer maize harvest but less than 40 and 30 remained in the 0 60 cm soil profile under ck treatment at winter wheat and summer maize harvest respectively the soil nitrate n residual in the 60 120 cm soil profile increased with the increasing irrigation amount under drip fertigation the soil nitrate n residual at winter wheat harvest was greater than that at summer maize harvest in the 0 60 cm soil profile but was lower in the 60 120 cm and 120 180 cm soil profiles table 3 3 3 grain yield for winter wheat the lowest grain yield of 6 3 t ha 1 and 5 9 t ha 1 were obtained under ck treatment in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons the highest grain yield of 9 1 t ha 1 and 9 3 t ha 1 were obtained under di treatment in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons but the grain yield was not significantly different between di and fi treatments the grain yield of di and fi was increased by 43 8 and 42 9 in 2018 2019 by 56 4 and 50 5 in 2019 2020 compared with ck treatment respectively for summer maize the lowest grain yield was 8 8 t ha 1 and 8 1 t ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons and both obtained under ck treatment the highest grain yield was 11 4 t ha 1 and 10 7 t ha 1 which was obtained under di and fi treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons respectively the grain yield of di and fi was increased by 29 8 and 29 5 in 2018 2019 summer maize season and by 30 5 and 30 8 in 2019 2020 season compared with ck respectively it should be mentioned that the grain yield of rf was significantly higher than that of ck in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 rotation year except insignificant difference in 2019 2020 winter wheat season the summer maize grain yield of rf had insignificant difference from that of di and fi in 2019 2020 season but had significant difference in 2018 2019 season fig 4 3 4 crop actual evapotranspiration and water productivity for winter wheat the actual evapotranspiration ranged from 371 4 mm to 504 6 mm over the two growing seasons the water productivity ranged from 1 23 kg m 3 to 1 97 kg m 3 table 4 the actual evapotranspiration followed the order of fi di ck rf but the water productivity showed di fi rf ck over the two winter wheat growing seasons the actual evapotranspiration in 2018 2019 winter wheat growing season was lower than that in 2019 2020 season but the water productivity in 2018 2019 season was higher than that in 2019 2020 season the water productivity of rf di and fi was increased by 25 0 54 2 and 43 6 in 2019 2020 season compared with ck treatment respectively the water productivity of di was significantly higher than that of fi in 2018 2019 but had insignificant difference in 2019 2020 growing season for summer maize the actual evapotranspiration ranged from 352 2 mm to 541 9 mm over the two growing seasons the water productivity ranged from 1 50 kg m 3 to 2 90 kg m 3 table 4 the actual evapotranspiration followed the order of ck fi di rf over the two growing seasons but the water productivity showed rf di fi ck over the two growing seasons there was no significant difference in water productivity between rf and di which was significantly higher than that of fi and ck the water productivity of rf di and fi treatments was increased by 46 4 40 4 and 34 7 in 2020 summer maize growing season compared with ck treatment respectively table 4 3 5 nitrogen use efficiency the nitrogen use efficiency ranged from 28 3 kg kg 1 to 61 9 kg kg 1 for winter wheat from 38 8 kg kg 1 to 76 2 kg kg 1 for summer maize fig 5 the highest nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat was 60 7 kg kg 1 and 61 9 kg kg 1 obtained at di treatment in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons respectively which was significantly higher than that of ck and rf treatments but had insignificant difference with fi treatment the nitrogen use efficiency of rf di and fi increased by 46 5 101 3 and 100 1 in 2018 2019 seasons winter wheat growing season increased by 49 0 118 9 and 110 8 in 2019 2020 compared with ck treatment respectively in 2018 2019 season the nitrogen use efficiency of summer maize had insignificant difference between di and fi but both significant higher than that of ck and rf in 2019 2020 season there was no significant difference in nitrogen use efficiency among rf di and fi but they were all significantly higher than that of ck the summer maize nitrogen use efficiency of rf di and fi was increased by 62 2 81 7 and 81 3 in 2018 2019 season by 78 0 82 6 and 83 1 in 2019 2020 season compared with ck respectively fig 5 3 6 economic analysis the fertilizer cost of ck was higher than drip fertigation but the piping cost of drip fertigation was higher than that of ck table 5 the gross profit of winter wheat ranged from 15 190 cny ha 1 to 21 839 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 14 242 cny ha 1 to 22 273 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season the net income of winter wheat ranged from 6218 cny ha 1 to 11 712 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 5460 cny ha 1 to 11 966 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season the gross profit of summer maize ranged from 18 506 cny ha 1 to 24 013 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 17 110 cny ha 1 to 22 374 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season the net income of summer maize ranged from 11 458 cny ha 1 to 15 660 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 10 062 cny ha 1 to 14 058 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season the two year average net income followed the order of di fi ck rf for winter wheat but showed di fi rf ck for summer maize table 5 the gross profit and net income of summer maize were higher than those of winter wheat due to higher grain yield fig 4 from the perspective of the rotation system the net income ranged from 17 866 cny ha 1 to 27 373 cny ha 1 in 2018 2019 season and ranged from 15 522 cny ha 1 to 26 024 cny ha 1 in 2019 2020 season from the perspective of winter wheat summer maize rotation system the two year average net income of di was increased by 2 8 37 9 and 59 9 compared with fi rf and ck respectively table 5 4 discussion our study showed that the soil water storage in 0 320 cm soil layer was consumed in the winter wheat season and replenished in the summer maize season fig 3 the possible explanation was that less than 30 precipitation fell in the winter wheat season and more than 70 precipitation fell in the summer maize season fig 1 in this study 92 6 177 8 mm soil water in the top 320 cm soil profile was consumed by winter wheat during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 winter wheat growing seasons fig 3 this results was consistent with previous results that when the total irrigation amount was less than 140 mm two irrigations during winter wheat growing season the soil water consumption by winter wheat was greater than 130 mm for the 0 200 cm soil profile in the north china plain lu et al 2021 the reason was that the sum of irrigation water and precipitation was less than the winter wheat water requirement fig 1 and table 2 and the soil water stored before sowing was thus consumed as part of the water requirement in this study the soil water consumption followed the order of rf di ck fi which indicated that rf and di was more dependent on soil water storage than ck and fi treatments this conclusion was consistent with the results that soil water consumption was significantly increased with the decreasing irrigation application lu et al 2021 in the summer maize season the precipitation and irrigation are usually greater than water requirements therefore the soil water generally accumulated in particular the short term intensive and continuous precipitation in the summer maize season makes the soil water infiltrate below the summer maize root layer 0 100 cm lu et al 2021a yang et al 2015 however the winter wheat has a deep root system down to 2 m or deeper which is conduce to use deep soil water zhang et al 2004 2008 therefore the winter wheat summer maize rotation can make full use of soil water precipitation and irrigation and improve water productivity in addition previous studies reported that slight water shortage during vegetation stage can stimulate roots to grow into deeper soil layer xu et al 2016 leading to the higher root in deeper soil layer zhang et al 2004 li et al 2010 therefore the more soil water in deep soil layer was consumed under water shortage condition than adequate irrigation moreover our study showed that the soil water content in the 180 260 cm soil layer of rf was significantly lower than that in the other treatments at summer maize harvest fig 2 b and d this was because the deep soil water was consumed by winter wheat which was not fully replenished by precipitation during the summer maize season unfortunately the root depth and distribution were not measured in this study but zhang et al 2004 reported that the root length density of winter wheat was still at a high level at 200 cm soil depth especially higher under rain fed conditions therefore we guesses that there was capillary ascending water in the 180 320 cm soil profiles in the winter wheat season and there were also a small number of roots below 200 cm soil depth in future research the soil water content and winter wheat root should be measured at the same time although precipitation may further supplement soil water after summer maize harvest fig 1 soil desiccation phenomenon may exist in the rain fed winter wheat summer maize rotation system due to drip fertigation increased crop water consumption zhang et al 2018 li et al 2013 for winter wheat summer maize rotation system suitable water deficit in winter wheat season increases soil reservoir capacity xu et al 2016 which is conducive to storing more precipitation in the soil during the summer maize season rainy season to a certain extent this helps to avoid reduce the occurrence of leaching in the summer maize season in this study the nitrogen application rate of ck was greater than that of drip feritgation but the soil nitrate n residual had insignificant difference among all treatments at winter wheat and summer maize harvest table 3 one possible reason was that large spatial variability of soil nitrate n resulted in insignificant difference in statistics but the soil nitrate n residual of ck was higher than that of drip fertigation table 3 another possible reason was that spreading a large amount of nitrogen application at one time under ck increased the loss of ammonia volatilization due to the fact that ammonia volatilization loss response to increasing n was exponential ma et al 2010 rochette et al 2013 and the loss of nitrogen fertilizer also existed in the process of fertilizer spreading the soil nitrate n residual of drip fertigation was significantly higher than that of ck in the 0 60 cm soil layer in this study and more than 50 and 40 soil nitrate n residual remained in 0 60 cm soil layer at winter wheat and summer maize harvest time under drip fertigation table 3 the reason was that the nitrogen fertilizer was mainly applied at the early growth stage of maize which led to higher soil nitrate n and higher soil nitrate n increased nitrate leaching losses during precipitation and irrigation lu et al 2021a cameron et al 2013 in this study we also found that the soil nitrate n residual in the 60 180 cm soil layer at summer maize harvest was greater than that at winter wheat harvest table 3 one possible reason was that the ca 70 precipitation fell in summer maize season fig 1 which led to part of the nitrate n leaching into deep soils yang et al 2015 another possible reason was that winter wheat root grew deeper 200 cm or deeper than summer maize 100 cm which was conducive to the absorption of soil water and nitrogen ma et al 2019 zhou et al 2008 zhang et al 2004 in this study the grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize had insignificant difference between di and fi treatments but the water productivity of di was significantly higher than that of fi table 4 the reason was that the crop actual evapotranspiration of di was lower than that of fi previous research reported that deficit irrigated winter wheat had lower luxury transpiration than fully irrigated winter wheat liang et al 2018 and reducing luxury transpiration was conducive to reducing the actual water consumption of crops and improving water productivity kang et al 2017 the similar result also was reported that suitable deficit irrigation can not only achieve higher grain yield but also improve water productivity compared with full irrigation abd el mageed et al 2018 in this study the winter wheat grain yield of ck was significantly lower than that of rf in 2018 2019 season and it had insignificant difference in 2019 2020 season the reason was that drip fertigation compensated the negative impact of water deficit on wheat grain yield and the contribution of nitrogen fertilizer application to winter wheat yield far exceeded that of irrigation in guanzhong plain lu et al 2021c for summer maize the grain yield of rf was significantly higher than that of ck and there was even no significant difference with di and fi treatments in 2020 this was mainly due to the abundant precipitation in the summer maize season and the drip fertigation significantly increased maize yield our results showed that 170 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 150 kg n ha 1 for summer maize can achieve the higher grain yield under drip fertigation the similar result was also reported by yang et al 2017 who suggested that the suitable nitrogen application rates for high grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize were 150 170 kg ha 1 and 180 200 kg ha 1 respectively however the grain yield of our study was higher than the grain yield reported by yang et al 2017 and qiang et al 2019 in this study the nitrogen use efficiency of di and fi was significantly higher than that of ck and rf the reason was that di and fi treatments can timely and accurately supply water and nitrogen to root zone matching the distribution of water nutrients and crop roots yan et al 2021 li et al 2018 maximizing the coupling effect of water and fertilizer so as to achieve high crop yield and improve water and nitrogen productivity yan et al 2021 zou et al 2020 jha et al 2019 wang et al 2018 5 conclusions optimized water and nitrogen management can not only increase the grain yield water and nitrogen productivity of winter wheat and summer maize but also reduce the risk of nitrate n leaching our study showed that drip fertigation can significantly increase the soil nitrate n residual of crop main root zone 0 60 cm compared with traditional practice the soil nitrate n residual at winter wheat harvest was greater than that at summer maize harvest in the 0 60 cm soil profile and winter wheat absorbed more nitrate nitrogen than summer maize in the 60 180 cm soil profile in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system the soil water of rain fed with nitrogen fertigation could not be fully replenished by irrigation and precipitation existing soil desiccation risk in the 180 260 soil profile due to the increased crop water consumption by drip fertigation for winter wheat and summer maize the grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency of deficit irrigation and full irrigation were significantly higher than those of the other treatments under drip fertigation but deficit irrigation increased water productivity and net income than full irrigation therefore deficit irrigation with nitrogen fertigation was recommended as a sustainable fertigation strategy for achieving higher grain yield nitrogen use efficiency water productivity and net income and reducing the risk of soil nitrate n leaching in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system in future study the root distribution of winter wheat summer maize rotation system under drip fertigation condition should be clarified declaration of

9859,this study evaluates the accuracy of daily reference evapotranspiration eto computed according to the fao penman monteith equation by using a set of input weather variables obtained by blending era5 land era5l reanalysis data with surface incoming solar radiation rs provided by the instruments on board the meteosat geostationary satellites operationally delivered by the satellite applications facility on climate monitoring cm saf performance assessment was carried out in sicily southern italy by using data from 38 automatic ground weather stations awss for years 2003 2020 era5l and cm saf data were first downscaled and bias corrected with a calibration dataset era5l air temperature data were also downscaled by lapse rate correction eto estimates obtained with the blended era5l and cm saf validation dataset era5l cm saf were compared with two other eto estimates respectively obtained by using era5l and interpolated ground weather data igd performance indicators of the igd dataset were evaluated by recursively applying universal kriging or ordinary kriging to the observed weather data according to a cross validation procedure rs provided by cm saf outperformed rs obtained by ground interpolation thus confirming the convenience of using bias corrected cm saf data even when ground observations are available in the study area eto estimates with era5l cm saf showed a normalized rmse of 12 outperforming era5l eto estimates while performing comparably to eto estimates obtained with the igd dataset the results suggested that the proposed blended dataset is a good proxy for interpolated ground weather observations in the assessment of eto at regional scale when weather measurements cannot be easily gathered or in data sparse regions keywords satellite based models reanalysis data data sparse regions interpolated ground weather data fao penman monteith eto bias correction methods 1 introduction water resources management is one of the main global challenges of the 21st century with many areas of the world likely to struggle in coping with demands for freshwater in the coming decades moore and lobell 2014 agriculture is the economic sector with the largest consumptive water use and water withdrawal accounting for almost 70 of global water withdrawn siebert 2007 assessing irrigation water use is thus fundamental for effectively planning the allocation of water resources in agriculture as well as for designing irrigation systems iglesias and garrote 2015 also in light of the united nation s un 2030 agenda for sustainable development llop and ponce alifonso 2016 the european union in compliance with european water framework directive has planned additional investments only for those irrigation infrastructures offering potential water savings of a minimum of between 5 and 25 that should be verified by the implementation of reliable accounting systems of irrigation water use european parliament 2013 quantitative assessment of irrigation water use at regional scale is generally based on crop water balance modeling e g allen 2000 gonzález dugo et al 2009 consoli and vanella 2014 calera et al 2017 evapotranspiration is the key variable of the crop water budget especially in those regions where rainfall and groundwater contribution are negligible in the irrigation season allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2012 pereira 2017 crop evapotranspiration is commonly estimated according to the fao 56 procedure allen et al 1998 as the product of a crop coefficient representing the crop state and the grass reference evapotranspiration eto representing the evaporative demand of the atmosphere the optimal method for estimating eto is the penman monteith equation according to the fao 56 formulation provided that a complete set of meteorological data is available including air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity ground weather stations equipped with a complete and well maintained set of reliable sensors are generally sparse even in developed countries time series of weather data collected by neighboring stations often present different temporal coverage and are not subjected to rigorous quality control procedures battisti et al 2019 data access is also a critical point ground weather data are managed by regional and national services which distribute data according to different policies end users may have access to these data after complex administrative procedures with a significant latency in those regions where a ground set of weather data are available for the entire period of interest a regional assessment of eto can be obtained by spatial interpolation lewis et al 2014 strong et al 2017 the outcomes of spatial interpolations are subject not only to measurement errors but also to other uncertainties such as uncertainty in the spatial structure of the interpolated field chirico et al 2010 or the representativeness of the ground station site if the latter has not been selected according to adequate standards e g wmo 2018 methods other than the fao penman monteith have been proposed for computing eto with a reduced set of variables pereira 2004 paredes et al 2020 pelosi et al 2020b at the cost of an additional set of empirical parameters that must be calibrated with local data and if possible regionalized jung et al 2016 senatore et al 2020 such calibrated parameters are exposed to errors in the case of non stationarities as was observed in areas affected by significant climate change ren et al 2016 in the last two decades numerical weather prediction nwp models have provided additional sources of gridded weather data bauer et al 2015 nwp models are mainly designed to forecast weather conditions and several studies have been conducted to exploit real time nwp forecasts to support irrigation system operation and scheduling e g pelosi et al 2016 chirico et al 2018 medina et al 2018 longo minnolo et al 2020 vanella et al 2020 nwp models have also been implemented to reanalyze past weather conditions reanalysis data represent an efficient data source for planning and design studies applied to irrigation water management for two main reasons pelosi et al 2020a i weather agencies distribute reanalysis data which are freely available on dedicated web platforms in a consistent spatial and temporal format ii end users can easily process data also on regions extending across administrative boundaries thus avoiding the burden of collecting and homogenizing weather station data from different data providers several studies have evaluated eto prediction performance based on reanalysis data the first used era interim data provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf e g boulard et al 2016 paredes et al 2018 and reanalysis data provided by the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar e g srivastava et al 2015 martins et al 2017 in 2019 as part of the copernicus climate change service the ecmwf released era5 reanalysis and era5 land produced by replaying the land component of the era5 climate reanalysis with a horizontal resolution of 9 km pelosi et al 2020a showed that the accuracy of daily eto predicted with era5 land is comparable with that predicted by spatially interpolating ground weather data but also pointed out that the incoming shortwave solar radiation reconstructed by era5 land is the most prone to error among the weather variables involved in eto estimation alternative sources for solar radiation data are provided by satellite based products such as those based on sensors mounted on geostationary satellites like the meteosat visible and infrared imager mviri onboard the meteosat first generation and the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri on board the meteosat second generation msg satellites trigo et al 2011 urraca et al 2017 previous studies have evaluated the accuracy of eto obtained by coupling remotely sensed shortwave radiation with ground temperature observations e g cammalleri and ciraolo 2013 cruz blanco et al 2014 paredes et al 2021 evaluated the accuracy of eto estimates in portugal obtained by coupling ground data with remote sensing radiation data provided by the satellite application facility on land surface analysis lsa saf as part of the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat based on seviri images lsa saf shortwave radiation outperformed era5 solar radiation mainly due to the higher spatial resolution 4 km for lsa saf and 31 km for era5 the accuracy of eto estimates was also slightly better with lsa saf solar radiation than with era5 solar radiation however lsa saf data were affected by many gaps in the time series which made its operational use more difficult than era5 the satellite application facility on climate monitoring cm saf of eumetsat distributes surface incoming shortwave radiation rs data from year 1983 produced by processing multispectral images of mviri and seviri radiometers mounted on meteosat satellites the latest cm saf rs products based on seviri radiometer mounted on msg are released operationally from year 2018 with a two day delay urraca et al 2017 verified the quality of cm saf ra data after validating it with 313 pyranometers distributed across all european countries except portugal and italy the main motivation of this study was to assess the use of a blended weather dataset consisting of cm saf rs data and era5 land era5l weather data for estimating daily eto with fao penman monteith in regions where ground weather data are available for just short time intervals from a sparse monitoring network the study was conducted for irrigation seasons from year 2003 to year 2020 in sicily southern italy where neither cm saf radiation data nor era5 land reanalysis data had hitherto been validated we first discuss how effective downscaling and bias correction of eto at regional scale could be achieved with one season of ground weather data and we show how the spatial interpolation error of ground weather data could be statistically estimated then we compare the quality of cm saf solar radiation and era5l reanalysis weather data with the respective data obtained by spatially interpolating ground observations finally by taking eto computed with ground weather data as a benchmark we compare the accuracies of eto estimates at ungauged sites computed respectively with i spatially interpolated ground weather data ii only era5 land weather data iii the era5 land weather dataset blended with solar radiation retrieved from cm saf 2 study area and meteorological data 2 1 study area the study area was sicily southern italy the largest island in the mediterranean with an area of about 25 000 km2 fig 1 shows the location and relief map of the region with its wide range of elevations from 0 m a m s l to about 3230 m a m s l at the top of the volcano etna in the north eastern part of the island the small islands surrounding the region were omitted from the study the weather in the study area is influenced by the topographic complexity and by the presence of the mediterranean sea under the köppen geiger climate classification the region has a hot dry summer subtropical climate which is also known as a typical mediterranean climate areas with this climate typically experience hot sometimes very hot dry summers and mild wet winters peel et al 2007 summers in such areas can often be very similar to summers of semi arid climates annual rainfall in the region varies proportionally with site elevation from 400 mm to 1300 mm the mean annual temperature ranges from 11 c in mountain areas to 19 c along the coast liuzzo et al 2017 minimum precipitation and maximum temperature occur in summer mainly in july and august with mean daily values close to 0 mm and 28 c respectively maximum precipitation and minimum temperature occur between december and february with mean monthly values of 150 mm and 11 c respectively cammalleri et al 2012 field irrigation generally starts in april and lasts until the end of september although the actual time span of the irrigation season is influenced by weather fluctuations and specific cropping practices hereinafter the period from april 1st to september 30th will be referred to as the irrigation season 183 days the analyses below concern the assessment of the different weather data sources and daily reference evapotranspiration at regional scale in the irrigation seasons of the years 2003 2020 2 2 meteorological data this section illustrates the different data sources employed for retrieving the input variables required to assess daily

radiation and air barometric pressure 2 2 1 observed ground based data ground weather data were retrieved from the agrometeorological monitoring network managed by the sicilian agrometeorological information service sias servizio informativo agrometereologico siciliano www sias regione sicilia it although the network comprises 96 automatic weather stations awss in operation since 2002 only 42 awss are equipped with pyranometers many gaps in the time series are present in year 2002 thus only data collected in the irrigation seasons of years 2003 2020 were examined in this study the quality of ground data was preliminarily verified according to allen 1996 pyranometer data accuracy was verified by plotting daily rs data against computed shortwave radiation under clear sky radiation wind measurements were verified by comparing the cumulative wind runs of adjacent stations we discarded those stations where the slope of the accumulation significantly differs from those of adjacent stations moreover we discarded the wind speed measurements at 2 m above the ground in favor of wind speed measurements at 10 m due to the presence of local effects that invalidate the representativeness of the measures in the surroundings we did not find anomalies in temperature and relative humidity data and even in summer months we did not find aridity effects in recorded data after the quality check among the 42 awss that measure all the weather variables of interest four stations were discarded two cesarò monte soro and alia present many gaps in the time series a third s fratello was discarded because of wind data anomalies compared with nearby stations a fourth station was excluded because it lies on a small island north of sicily salina outside the boundaries of the

meteorological reanalysis products provide an accurate reconstruction of the climate of the past by running back in time the most advanced and updated versions of the numerical weather prediction models that obey physical laws while sequentially assimilating land surface and atmospheric observations from across the world in recent years reanalysis products have been increasingly used as a gridded data source for water resource management studies since they represent a complete and consistent climate dataset that covers several decades soci et al 2016 in this study we employed the most advanced global reanalysis data produced in europe specifically optimized for the land surface applications era5 land era5l freely available at the website https cds climate copernicus eu muñoz sabater 2019 era5 land is produced for the entire globe with a native horizontal resolution of about 9 km released on a regular 0 1 x 0 1 grid by replaying the land component of era5 climate reanalysis from 1981 to 2 3 months before present era5 is the fifth generation of ecmwf global reanalysis succeeding era interim and covering the entire globe from 1979 at a spatial resolution of about 31 km hersbach et al 2020 the atmospheric forcing in era5 land is provided by land fields of era5 atmospheric variables era5 air temperature air humidity and pressure are corrected to account for the elevation difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of era5 land according to the so called lapse rate correction muñoz sabater 2019 although era5 land runs at enhanced spatial resolution it has the drawback that data are not provided for numerical grid points falling on the sea surface thus for land areas close to the coast the assessment of weather variables must rely on the closest inland data alone fig 2 shows the numerical grid of era5 land only where data are available era5 land data are produced with an hourly time step thus minimum maximum and mean daily values of the weather variables were here derived by gathering 24 values starting from utc 2 every day to calculate the daily values according to the summer time as the ground weather data the selected weather variables of interest were air temperature at 2 m wind speed at 10 m dew point temperature at 2 m global incoming solar radiation and barometric pressure the daily mean dew point temperature was used in eq 2 e a e 0 t dew for computing the daily mean of the actual vapor pressure instead of the daily maximum and minimum relative humidity as done for the ground based data eq 1 2 2 3 satellite based surface incoming shortwave solar radiation data this subsection describes the meteosat satellite derived surface incoming global shortwave radiation products provided by the satellite application facility on climate monitoring cm saf meteosat geostationary satellites were launched by esa european space agency and operated by the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat and the european space agency esa meteosat first generation mfg satellites were equipped with the meteosat visible and infrared imager mviri since 2004 meteosat second generation msg satellites were launched msg satellites were equipped with the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri radiometers trigo et al 2011 urraca et al 2017 mviri on board of mfg satellites consists of a high resolution 3 band radiometer providing simultaneous image generation in the thermal infrared region tir in the water vapor absorption bands wv and in the visible range vis seviri on board of msg satellites allows the full earth atmosphere system to be scanned in 12 spectral channels both seviri and mviri have a spatial resolution between 3 and 5 km over most of europe schmetz et al 2002 satellite based climate and weather data records at the earth s surface are made freely available for users by three independent satellite application facilities safs i the satellite application facility on climate monitoring cm saf www cmsaf eu ii the land surface analysis satellite application facility lsa saf www landsaf meteo pt and iii the ocean and sea ice satellite application facility osi saf www osi saf org to retrieve the satellite based meteorological parameters the different safs use their own algorithms and different ancillary input data journée and bertrand 2010 currently all of them release the data in near real time with a lag of two days from the present the algorithms used for retrieving the satellite based dataset are frequently updated and improved in particular the newest update regarding the cm saf algorithms consisted in adapting the software for processing meteosat 11 imageries in operational mode starting from the year 2018 prior to 2018 cm saf focused on the off line production and distribution of coherent time series of daily and monthly averaged products lsa saf and osi saf have been following a near real time strategy since their establishment for the purpose of this study our interest was in land surface incoming shortwave radiation products that are provided by both cm saf and lsa saf journée and bertrand 2010 showed that cm saf outperformed lsa saf at both hourly and daily scales over belgium cm saf exhibited rmse and relative rmse 0 5 and 3 9 smaller than lsa saf respectively thus for the following analysis cm saf radiation data were considered although other studies successfully employed lsa saf products for analogous applications e g paredes et al 2021 the cm saf surface incoming short wave radiation products are available on the web user interface of the cm saf website http wui cmsaf eu as monthly and daily means and as 30 min instantaneous data on a regular latitude longitude grid with a spatial resolution of 0 05 x 0 05 degrees the products are part of sarah 2 1 which is a satellite based climate data record of the solar surface irradiance the surface direct irradiance direct horizontal and direct normalized the sunshine duration spectral information and the effective cloud albedo derived from satellite observations of the visible channels of the mviri and the seviri instruments onboard the geostationary meteosat satellites the cm saf algorithm is based on the evaluation of the interaction between the atmosphere clear sky reflection transmission and the top of atmosphere albedo by implementing a radiative transfer model and a look up table method mueller et al 2009 2012 conversion from the irregular satellite projection to the regular 0 05 x 0 05 geographic grid is then performed with a gridding tool based on a nearest neighbor method the cm saf daily estimates of surface solar radiation were successfully validated against ground based measurements belonging to the baseline surface radiation network bsrn ohmura et al 1998 the results of validation showed mean absolute errors on average equal to 11 8 w m 2 close to the optimal accuracy of 12 w m 2 and much lower than the target value of 20 w m 2 moreover about 83 of values met the optimal accuracy requirement while 100 of values were found to be lower than the target value

means of surface incoming short wave radiation data for the irrigation seasons of years 2003 2020 were employed fig 2 shows the cm saf grid gray mesh over the study area 3 methods 3 1 downscaling and bias correction of reanalysis and satellite based data at the aws sites the procedure that is used to transfer the weather information from the points of a regular grid to other sites within this grid is a form of downscaling which is more often referred to as the method for inferring information from a low resolution to high resolution grid here statistical downscaling techniques were used to infer reanalysis and satellite based data from the native grid of the databases of interest to the aws sites downscaled data were then bias corrected to remove the residual systematic errors from the estimates 3 1 1 downscaling of reanalysis weather data to retrieve the reanalysis weather data at the aws sites from the 0 1 x 0 1 numerical grid a triangle based bi linear interpolation method was employed lee and schachter 1980 the method consists in interpolating the three grid points closest to the examined site since evident statistical correlations were found between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and terrain elevation before proceeding with the grid interpolation of these two weather variables a so called environmental lapse rate elr correction was applied to the grid points of interest for interpolation in order to consider the elevation differences between the grid points and each aws site the elr correction was then applied to three nearest grid points to be used for interpolation to each aws site as follows 3 t elr t gd z z gd elr where z stands for the elevation of the aws site z gd refers to the elevation of the numerical grid point of interest for interpolation tgd is the raw reanalysis temperature value at this numerical grid point and telr is the elr corrected temperature value at the grid point of interest for interpolation at the chosen aws site the environmental lapse rate is defined as the rate of temperature change with elevation 4 elr dt dz it can be computed from observations of temperature at m sample sites by implementing a linear regression model with the elevation z 5 t ˆ elr z t 0 where elr is the slope of the regression line and t0 is the intercept both computed with the ordinary least squares ols method since the elr depends on complex factors such as overlying air masses the large scale situation and local effects sheridan et al 2010 its estimation represents a challenging task however the use of a linear lapse rate for elevation correction between model and station temperature is common practice in hydrological and environmental applications e g gupta and tarboton 2016 moreover the use of a linear elr computed from ground based observations when available is generally accepted and preferred to the use of the common reference value of 0 0065 c m 1 rolland 2003 gao et al 2012 especially for complex terrain this approach has two main limitations i it relies on the elevation variability among the stations and ii it assumes that temperature recorded by stations at different elevations is representative of the mean lower troposphere vertical profile even if the near surface temperature gradient may be dominated by the surface energy balance surface roughness and near surface boundary layer effects rather than by adiabatic effects and the current stratification of the atmosphere gao et al 2012 dutra et al 2020 thus downscaled reanalysis temperature data are still affected by systematic errors due to the dependence of daily temperatures on local terrain attributes other than elevation in this study the described elr correction approach was applied to daily maximum and minimum temperatures by using not only the 38 complete awss selected for the study but all the 96 awss equipped with the temperature sensor the elevations of these awss range from 10 m a s m l to 1875 m a s m l a complete list of them can be found on the sias website www sias regione sicilia it moreover elr correction was done here on a monthly basis by performing six linear regression analyses to obtain six elr values for each month from april to september 3 1 2 downscaling of satellite based radiation data to retrieve the satellite based surface shortwave radiation data at the aws sites from the 0 05 x 0 05 cm saf grid the nearest grid point was considered since the satellite product is a pixel integrated measurement of the parameter of interest an important aspect to consider for understanding the differences between ground measurements at sites and satellite derived information is the fact that satellite data are a snapshot over a large area i e the pixel which does not account for the variability of the parameter within the pixel size while ground information is a time integrated local measurement journée and bertrand 2010 3 1 3 bias correction of downscaled reanalysis and satellite based weather variables estimates from numerical weather prediction models and satellite based products suffer from systematic and non systematic errors which originate from various sources such as sub grid scale variability and inability of the models to fully describe the physical phenomena journée and bertrand 2010 pelosi et al 2017 statistical postprocessing techniques can partly remove such errors among such techniques batch statistical methods are calibrated offline with a training dataset that can be of a short length if a parsimonious number of parameters are required vannitsem 2008 moreover simple bias correction approaches are often preferred to more sophisticated post processing techniques since no significant loss in accuracy is noted despite the much lower computation costs e g paredes et al 2018 in this study a regionally uniform bias correction at monthly scale was applied to all variables except for wind speed for which no systematic bias pattern was found consistent with previous reports ricard and anctil 2019 pelosi et al 2020a the applied method consists in adding to the downscaled products the monthly regional mean difference bias between the ground based measurements and the respective downscaled data computed over the calibration period the first six years 2003 2008 were chosen as calibration period while the remaining 12 years 2009 2020 were used for creating the validation set to which the performance statistics refer the bias correction was applied in the scenario where ground weather observations were not available for the period of interest but data from few past irrigation seasons e g here six seasons were available for calibration 3 2 assessing spatial interpolation error of ground based data by cross validation at the aws sites ground based measurements are often available over irregularly spaced and sparse monitoring networks thus spatial interpolation techniques must be employed if data are required at specific ungauged locations or according to a regular grid such as those of numerical products among the extensive range of spatial interpolation methods geostatistical techniques are the most advanced and used for weather applications hofstra et al 2008 ordinary kriging is the most widely used technique to interpolate weather data such as wind speed luo et al 2008 berndt and haberlandt 2018 pelosi et al 2020a relative humidity berndt and haberlandt 2018 pelosi et al 2020a and solar radiation rehman and ghori 2000 alsamamra et al 2009 journée and bertrand 2010 pelosi et al 2020a however ordinary kriging only uses data available from observations and its performance significantly depends on the density of the available monitoring network and the spatial properties of the variable of interest prudhomme and reed 1999 pelosi and furcolo 2015 for this reason in some other applications where an evident statistical correlation exists between the weather variable of interest and an auxiliary external variable sampled with a higher spatial resolution regression kriging is preferred jarvis and stuart 2001 pelosi et al 2020a this is the case of temperature jarvis and stuart 2001 stahl et al 2006 di piazza et al 2015 pelosi et al 2020a which shows a high correlation with elevation regression kriging odeh et al 1995 also known as residual kriging holdaway 1996 and mathematically equivalent to universal kriging often referred to as kriging with external drift ahmed and de marsily 1987 applies ordinary kriging to the regression residuals of a regression model between the variable of interest and auxiliary independent variables in this study ordinary kriging was used for interpolating daily wind speed maximum and minimum relative humidity and solar radiation regression kriging was employed for daily maximum and minimum air temperature by implementing daily linear regression models of temperature with elevation appendix a summarizes the theoretical bases of the geostatistical methods applied herein more details can be found in journel and huijbregts 1978 and cressie 1993 since the focus of this study was on evaluating the performance of the spatial interpolation of ground based data a leave one out cross validation technique was recursively implemented to compute the jackknife kriging estimation of the variable of interest at each aws site after applying the kriging interpolator to the observations available at the remaining sampling sites this is a very common way to assess the predictive ability of a statistical model and specifically of a geostatistical interpolation technique the result was a set of interpolated ground based data igd at each aws site that could be compared with the measurements recorded at the same site for evaluating the performance of the kriging interpolator 3 3 computation of reference daily evapotranspiration eto in this study the daily reference evapotranspiration eto mm day 1 was computed with the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as follows 6 e t o 1 λ δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34u 2 where λ is the latent heat of vaporization equal to 2 45 mj kg 1 δ kpa c 1 is the slope of the vapor pressure curve γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 t c is the daily mean air temperature at 2 m height computed as the average between the daily maximum tmax and minimum tmin air temperature at 2 m height u2 m s 1 is the wind speed at 2 m height above ground es kpa and ea kpa are respectively the daily saturation vapor pressure and daily actual vapor pressure eqs 1 2 needed for the computation of the saturation vapor pressure deficit es ea rn mj m 2 day 1 is the net radiation at the crop surface and g mj m 2 day 1 is the soil heat flux density the net radiation rn was calculated as the difference between the incoming net shortwave radiation and the outgoing net long wave radiation the incoming net shortwave radiation is a fraction of the incoming shortwave solar radiation rs computed for the reference crop by setting the albedo equal to 0 23 the daily mean wind speed at 2 m u2 m s 1 was obtained from the wind speed at 10 m u10 m s 1 by using a logarithmic wind speed profile as suggested by allen et al 1998 7 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 10 z 5 42 where z 10 m resulting in a reduction factor to apply to uz of about 0 748 for obtaining the wind speed at the lower height of 2 m more details about the parameters in eq 6 can be found in the fao irrigation and drainage study no 56 allen et al 1998 and are omitted herein for the sake of brevity table 3 reports monthly statistics of daily eto averaged between the 38 awss over the irrigation seasons of the years 2003 2020 the minimum monthly mean of daily eto was recorded in april 3 26 mm day 1 and the maximum in july 5 75 mm day 1 the mean coefficient of variation was lowest in july 0 14 and highest in april 0 31 3 4 scenarios of eto estimates the daily reference evapotranspiration eto computed at the aws sites with ground based data was taken as the benchmark for comparing the performance of eto estimated with three alternative weather data sets igd weather data obtained by spatial interpolation with the leave one out cross validation technique era5l weather data retrieved after downscaling and bias correcting era5 land reanalysis data era5l cm saf obtained by changing era5l shortwave incoming solar radiation with downscaled and bias corrected cm saf solar radiation data the three scenarios of eto estimates examined in this study are summarized in table 4 igd refers to the scenario when ground weather data are available for the entire period of interest and thus interpolation is the only error source at regional scale era5l and era5l cm saf scenarios refer to the case when data from the ground monitoring network are available for only a limited period e g one season to be used for regional bias correction and thus era5l and cm saf are used as alternative data sources 3 5 indicators of estimation performance the performance indicators were selected among those commonly used for analogous previous studies e g paredes et al 2018 2021 i the percent bias pbias which is used as an indicator of accuracy 8 pbias 1 o i 1 n p i o i n 100 where pi and oi are respectively the variable for which the performance evaluation is desired and the corresponding observed variable benchmark at the ith day n denotes the number of examined days and o is the mean of the observations computed over the examined days the more the pbias differs from zero the less accurate is the estimate pbias 0 suggests on average underestimation while pbias 0 overestimation ii the normalized root mean square error nrmse which gives insight into both accuracy and precision 9 nrmse 1 o i 1 n p i o i 2 n 100 the greater is the nrmse the less accurate and precise are the estimates iii the coefficient of determination r2 of the ols regression model used to assess the dispersion of pairs of oi and pi independent variable values along the regression line 10 r 2 i 1 n o ˆ i o 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o ˆ i is the predicted value by the linear regression o ˆ i a b p i r2 may vary from 0 to 1 the closer r2 values are to 1 the larger the fraction of the variance of the observations explained by the model iv the nash and sutcliffe 1970 model efficiency nse is equal to one minus the sum of the absolute squared differences between the predicted and observed values normalized by the variance of the observed values during the period of interest krause et al 2005 11 nse 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the range of nse lies between 1 perfect model with an estimation error variance equal to zero and values of nse nearer to 1 suggest a model with more predictive skill nse equal to 0 indicates that the model has the same predictive skill as the mean of the data in terms of the sum of the squared error an nse value lower than zero indicates that the mean value of the observed data would have been a better predictor than the model that shows an estimation error variance which is significantly larger than the variance of the observations bias corrected reanalysis and satellite based data were employed in the hypothesis that users have only few irrigation seasons available for bias correction so the calibration period was created by one third of the available seasons 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance of weather variable products the following results refer to the performance of the spatially interpolated ground based daily weather data igd and the downscaled bias corrected era5l reanalysis and satellite based cm saf daily products at the 38 awss of the region in the irrigation seasons of the years 2018 2020 appendix b presents the performance of reanalysis era5l and satellite based cm saf daily weather variables before and after the regional mean bias correction also discussed in this section the variability of the performance indicators computed at the 38 aws sites is illustrated with boxplots on each box the central mark is the median the edges of the box are the 25th q1 and 75th q3 percentiles the whiskers extend to the most extreme data values not considered outliers and outliers are plotted individually the points are drawn as outliers if they are larger than q3 1 5 q3 q1 or smaller than q1 1 5 q3 q1 the circle mark represents the mean value among the aws sites 4 1 1 air temperature era5l reanalysis daily maximum and minimum temperature data were downscaled by monthly elr corrections as described in section 3 1 1 whose estimates were obtained by ols regression of ground based observations with elevation table 5 reports the monthly elr coefficients for tmax and tmin along with coefficient of determination r elr 2 absolute elr values are lower for the daily minimum temperature than for the daily maximum temperature in accordance with a similar study that applied lapse rate corrections to era5 reanalysis temperature data in western us dutra et al 2020 these results were expected since low level conditions during the night tend to be more stable resulting in less intense elr for the daily tmin moreover consistent with the current study dutra et al 2020 highlighted that era5 tmin bias is less dependent on elevation than tmax resulting in a lower coefficient of determination table 5 the same reason explains the lower performance of era5l tmin before and after bias correction than raw era5l tmax figs b1 and b2 the mean regional pbias values of era5l daily tmax and tmin products before bias correction are about 4 and 7 respectively figs b1 and b2 indicating a tendency to underestimate tmax and overestimate tmin similar findings were reported in the cited study by dutra et al 2020 as regards era5 products in western us and in many other studies that evaluated the era interim reanalysis database in different regions of the world among others see fu et al 2016 martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018 the ncep ncar reanalysis products also showed tmax estimates outperforming tmin estimates as well as the tendency to overestimate tmin srivastava et al 2015 despite the great progress in atmospheric modeling and resolution representation of near surface daily maximum and especially minimum temperature in reanalysis products suffers from these systematic biases due to large model limitations in representing clouds radiation boundary layer and land surface characteristics dutra et al 2020 however the random component of the errors was greatly improved in era5 with respect to the former era interim due to a better synoptic scale variability and resolution as is also evident from a recent study that compared era5 land reanalysis with uerra which is a regional reanalysis forced by era interim pelosi et al 2020a the systematic errors were successfully removed by means of the bias correction technique explained in section 3 1 4 figs b1 and b2 show that the mean pbias was reduced to almost zero for tmax and to lower than 3 for tmin the nrmse r2 and nse were also slightly improved igd shows a slight tendency to overestimate the observed tmax while era5l after bias correction has a non systematic tendency to overestimate or underestimate tmax as shown by fig 3a on average both the pbias values of igd and era5l products are quite low varying from 14 5 for igd to 0 61 for era5l indicating excellent accuracy then in terms of nrmse r2 and nse igd just slightly outperforms on average era5l the nrmse values reach 17 for igd and 10 for era5l with mean values of 5 9 and 6 3 respectively r2 is on average equal to 0 96 and 0 94 for igd and era5l respectively moreover r2 is always greater than 0 85 nse is on average equal to 0 90 and 0 89 for igd and era5l respectively it is always positive and greater than 0 43 indicating that both products have good predictive skills all over the region with regard to the daily minimum temperature tmin both igd and era5l show slightly worse performances than the results obtained for tmax the main reason for this outcome lies in the dependence of tmin on local topographic conditions besides elevation such that neither a spatial interpolation method like regression kriging with elevation nor an elr correction with elevation are able to reproduce its variability fig 4a shows that on average both the pbias values of igd and era5l products are very low varying from 0 35 for igd to 2 9 for era5l in terms of nrmse r2 and nse igd just slightly outperforms era5l the maximum nrmse is equal to 26 for igd and 28 for era5l with mean values of 11 and 14 respectively r2 is on average equal to 0 95 and 0 89 for igd and era5l respectively moreover r2 is always greater than 0 79 nse is on average 0 88 and 0 81 for igd and era5l respectively it is always positive and greater than 0 21 indicating that both products have quite good predictive skills all over the region 4 1 2 wind speed both igd and era5l products show estimation performance for daily mean wind speed at 10 m u10 with large variability in the region of interest era5l refers to the raw data since bias correction does not improve performance fig b3 consistent with previous reports ricard and anctil 2019 pelosi et al 2020a as shown by fig 5a pbias values range from 56 to 76 with a mean value of 17 for igd and from 62 to 38 with a mean of 21 for era5l nrmse values reach 86 for igd and 72 for era5l with mean values of 33 and 40 respectively fig 5b indicating poor accuracy and precision of the estimates r2 is on average equal to 0 59 and 0 44 for igd and era5l respectively while nse is on average negative for both data indicating estimation error variances that are significantly larger than the observation variance fig 5c d u10 is underestimated in more than half of the aws sites with a poor quality of estimation for both datasets mainly due to the fact that representativeness of the wind measurements at some monitoring stations can be influenced by local terrain effects however the ground records are the only available benchmark data in this study to reduce the influence of local effects measurements of wind speed at 10 m above the ground were preferred to measurements of wind speed at 2 m then the daily mean wind speed at 2 m u2 was obtained from the wind speed at 10 m u10 by using a logarithmic wind speed profile as suggested by allen et al 1998 and recalled in eq 7 the low accuracy and precision of reanalysis wind speed values were also reported in other studies among which it is worth recalling the extensive study that evaluated the performance of the former era interim reanalysis database in portugal undertaken by paredes et al 2018 and the study by pelosi et al 2020a that analyzed era5 land performance in another italian region to our knowledge studies evaluating era5 wind speed performance for hydrological and agricultural applications at regional scale are not yet available 4 1 3 actual vapor pressure the daily actual vapor pressure ea was derived herein for igd from maximum and minimum relative humidity and temperature eq 1 and for era5l from the dew point temperature eq 2 with t tdew according to the type of variables available for each dataset the performance indicators for ea show moderate spatial variability in the region both for the case of interpolated ground based data and for reanalysis products as shown by fig 6a pbias values range from 18 to 17 with a mean value of 1 7 for igd and from 20 to 13 with a mean of 0 12 for era5l with igd showing a slight overestimation raw era5l ea values show systematic overestimation mean pbias equal to 15 as shown in fig b4 which can be efficiently removed by bias correction the nrmse values reach 21 for igd and 23 for era5l with mean values of 14 for both databases fig 6b r2 is on average equal to 0 74 while nse is on average 0 64 for both igd and era5l fig 6c d in summary igd and era5l show comparable moderate accuracies in ea estimates consistent with the results of a previous study regarding the use of era5l in another region of southern italy pelosi et al 2020a 4 1 4 incoming shortwave solar radiation the era5l and cm saf incoming shortwave solar radiation rs data show a mean regional pbias of about 3 7 and 4 7 before bias correction respectively fig b5 indicating slight overestimation the nrmse of cm saf rs is about 5 smaller than era5l the chosen bias correction technique completely removes the systematic errors with slight benefits on the other indices that remain almost unchanged fig b5 below we illustrate the performance of the bias corrected era5l and cm saf rs values downscaled at the aws sites pbias values range i from 6 to 12 with a mean value of 0 10 for igd ii from 8 to 10 with a mean of 1 7 for era5l and iii from 7 to 4 with a mean of 2 4 for cm saf fig 7a nrmse values reach 21 for igd 24 for era5l and 18 for cm saf with mean values of 10 14 and 9 respectively fig 7b moreover nrmse is lower than 10 for 68 and 76 of the aws sites respectively for the igd and cm saf estimates r2 values are on average equal to 0 86 for igd 0 73 for era5l and 0 90 for cm saf for which the minimum r2 value is 0 75 average nse values are equal to 0 85 for igd 0 70 for era5l and 0 88 for cm saf for which the minimum nse value is 0 73 fig 7c d with regard to igd rs similar results were obtained in a region of southern italy with an analogous monitoring network density showing an average nrmse of ground based solar radiation data equal to 15 pelosi et al 2020a in the study area cm saf rs clearly outperforms igd rs suggesting that it is worth using satellite based data even when ground observations are available in the study area for the regional assessment of environmental variables that depend on rs a similar suggestion was made by paredes et al 2021 who advised the use of lsa saf radiation products coupled with ground based observations of other weather variables for assessing eto in near real time the performance of cm saf rs achieved in sicily was very close to that verified by paredes et al 2021 with lsa saf rs in continental portugal paredes et al 2021 also found that lsa saf rs largely outperforms era5 rs for which they found a mean nrmse of 22 thus also larger than what we verified for era5 land in sicily this result was expected since era5 land reanalysis benefits from higher spatial resolution 9 km vs 31 km and specific land corrections implemented for downscaling era5 land from era5 a similar comparative study regarding rs products from different sources was performed by urraca et al 2017 who compared cm saf rs and era interim rs with ground based data collected at a broad network of about 300 monitoring stations distributed all over europe their results showed nrmse of about 18 for cm saf in perfect accordance with our findings and about 33 for era interim era interim reanalysis products are outperformed by both era5 and era5 land as expected thanks to advances in atmospheric modeling fig 8 shows the regional spatial variability of mean pbias and nrmse computed over the validation set at the aws sites the color scales were tuned such that blue corresponds to better performances for both indices values close to zero for the case of pbias and low values for nrmse all datasets show similar spatial patterns of performance indicators although era5l is clearly outperformed by both igd and cm saf especially for nrmse fig 8b the area with the worst performance is north eastern sicily where the most complex and highest mountain chain of the region is located these findings are in agreement with the results of other studies reporting lower accuracy of reanalysis and satellite based products for hill and mountain locations journée and bertrand 2010 cristóbal and anderson 2013 paredes et al 2021 this outcome can be explained by the large sub grid scale variability and heterogeneity of the terrain and weather conditions of hill and mountain areas that result in the inability of pixel integrated data such as satellite data and coarse numerical model grids of reanalysis data to be representative of the pinpoint measurements with regard to igd the reason for the worst performances observed in mountain areas should be found in the local non stationarities of the random field as often observed in orographic areas for other variables such as rainfall furcolo et al 2016 4 2 performance of reference evapotranspiration estimates this subsection reports the performance assessment of the daily fao penman monteith eto computed according to the three scenarios summarized in table 4 the acronym igd is used for eto estimates derived by interpolating ground based weather variables era5l stands for eto estimates derived by using downscaled bias corrected era5l products and finally era5l cm saf refers to eto estimates derived by using downscaled bias corrected era5l products except for the incoming shortwave radiation that was substituted with bias corrected satellite cm saf data as shown in fig 9a pbias values range i from 12 to 22 with a mean value of 5 5 for igd ii from 17 to 19 with a mean of 2 3 for era5l and iii from 20 to 18 with a mean of 2 8 for era5l cm saf indicating good accuracy for all three methods the nrmse values reach maximum values of 27 for igd 22 for era5l and 20 for era5l cm saf and mean values of 13 14 and 12 respectively fig 9b r2 values are on average equal to 0 85 for igd 0 76 for era5l and 0 83 for era5l cm saf while average nse values are equal to 0 66 for igd 0 67 for era5l and 0 73 for era5l cm saf fig 9c d these results are in agreement with a similar study conducted in another region of southern italy for which the mean nrmse of the pm eto estimates computed with era5l data was 17 while it was 22 with the former uerra regional reanalysis forced by era interim pelosi et al 2020a neither performance in the above study was far from those obtained by kriging interpolation which presented the same average nrmse of 14 table 6 shows the nrmse with a monthly aggregation for the three scenarios era5l cm saf always outperforms the others especially in april may and september when the overall performances are slightly worst due to the more possible presence of weather instabilities the eto in june july and august are better described by all three methods than in the remaining months fig 10 shows the regional spatial variability of mean pbias and nrmse computed with the validation sets at the aws sites these indices do not replicate any spatial trend since they are the outcomes of multiple weather variables processed through a nonlinear model such as the fao penman monteith equation however eto estimates tend to be less accurate in mountainous areas similarly to what was observed for rs in fig 8 and on the coast in addition those sites with large errors in wind speed estimates are also subject to major errors in eto estimates era5l cm saf eto estimates outperform era5l eto estimates everywhere in the region especially in terms of nrmse r2 and nse due to the better performance of cm saf rs products in comparison with era5l rs as shown above however the impact of the improvements using the era5l cm saf method rather than era5l is less than expected judging from the performance of cm saf radiation products in comparison with era5l section 4 1 4 this is mainly due to the slight sensitivity of eto to the differences between era5 land and cms saf solar radiation data as illustrated in fig 11a b which show that the pbias and nrmse of the eto estimates computed with ground based weather variables change after substituting one at a time a ground based weather variable with the respective reanalysis or satellite based estimation as indicated on the x axis fig 11a confirms that by using all observed weather variables except era5l radiation the mean nrmse increases by almost 3 about 0 2 mm day 1 by using all observed weather variables except cm saf radiation the mean nrmse increases by almost 2 about 0 1 mm day 1 similar results were obtained by paredes et al 2021 who proposed the use of a satellite based radiation product instead of ground measurements and era5 radiation products in their study for continental portugal the mean rmse of the eto estimates decreased by 0 2 mm day 1 when lsa saf radiation was used instead of era5 radiation here by using cm saf rs instead of era5 land rs rmse decreased by 0 1 mm day 1 this smaller difference in rmse with respect to paredes et al 2021 is due to era5 land outperforming era5 moreover fig 11 show that the largest errors in eto estimates are obtained when wind speed ground data are changed with igd or era5l wind data eto errors with igd rs are similar to those obtained with cm saf rs analogously eto errors with igd temperature are similar to those obtained with era5l temperature in accordance with the results presented in section 4 1 1 5 conclusions remote sensing and reanalysis products represent important data sources for regional assessment of the hydrological variables relevant to water resource planning and climate studies however proper regional scale analyses must be implemented to evaluate their added value with respect to what could be achieved by spatially interpolating sparse ground observations in this study a cross validation procedure consisting in recursively interpolating data by universal kriging and ordinary kriging was adopted to evaluate the performance of a regional spatial interpolation this study confirmed that satellite based solar radiation data delivered by cm saf can be effectively employed for water resources management applications especially in those regions where it is difficult to gather weather data recorded by ground weather stations in the examined region served by a relatively dense network of ground weather stations bias corrected solar radiation estimates provided by cm saf outperformed those estimates obtained by spatially interpolating solar radiation data recorded by the pyranometers at the ground weather stations performance indicators of eto estimates computed with a weather dataset consisting of cm saf solar radiation data and era5 land weather data are comparable to those computed with spatially interpolated weather data ground weather observations are still fundamental for bias correcting remotely sensed data however a relatively short time series is sufficient to achieve valid bias correction in this study six irrigation seasons out of 18 these results confirm the hypothesis that an optimal blending of reanalysis and satellite based data can be used with high accuracy and confidence for the regional assessment of eto when ground weather data cannot be easily gathered due to the inaccessibility and lack of interoperability of ground based weather databases moreover it might be even better to use cm saf blended with era5 land for the assessment of eto in regions where the spatial interpolation of ground weather data is prone to large uncertainties due to the poor spatial distribution and density of the weather sensors as very often occurs for pyranometers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

of the space x z x and the set of observed values at the m sampling locations z x 1 z x 2 z x m represents one realization of this random function the kriging interpolator allows the predicted value of the variable of interest at an ungauged location x k to be expressed as a linear combination of z x 1 z x 2 z x m as follows a 1 z ˆ x k i 1 m w i z x i where the weights w i for i 1 m are obtained by solving the kriging system that provides the optimal with minimum variance criterion unbiased linear estimator blue best linear unbiased estimator ordinary kriging assumes the hypothesis of constant unknown mean μ over the search neighborhood of x k the ordinary kriging system can be written as follows a 2 j 1 m w j γ z x i x j μ γ z x i x for i 1 m j 1 m w j 1 where γ is the semi variogram of the random field z x under the hypothesis of an intrinsically stationary isotropic random field z x the semi variogram unambiguously describes the spatial autocorrelation of the sampling locations and it can be estimated from data i e experimental semi variogram as follows a 3 γ ˆ z h 1 2 e z x h z x 2 where h is the varying distance lag between two sampling locations then by fitting the experimental semi variogram with a suitable parametric analytic function the theoretical semi variogram of the field γ z is defined among various analytical functions used to fit the experimental semi variograms the exponential curve is here employed a 4 γ z h n g s 1 exp h r where h is the varying lag distance n g r and s are parameters of the curve called nugget partial sill and range respectively the nugget is the value of the semi variogram at lag equal to zero and it is theoretically zero however in the presence of small scale variability and or measurements errors the nugget is not zero nugget effect the range defines the distance within the sample locations are spatially correlated the value reached by the semi variogram model at a lag equal to the range is called the sill the partial sill is the sill minus the nugget for the regression kriging a regression analysis is first carried out between the variable of interest and an auxiliary variable y x a 5 z x a y x b where z x is the fitted value of the variable of interest and a and b are the regression coefficients estimated by the ols method the kriging estimator of eqs a 1 a 6 is then applied to the regression

9859,this study evaluates the accuracy of daily reference evapotranspiration eto computed according to the fao penman monteith equation by using a set of input weather variables obtained by blending era5 land era5l reanalysis data with surface incoming solar radiation rs provided by the instruments on board the meteosat geostationary satellites operationally delivered by the satellite applications facility on climate monitoring cm saf performance assessment was carried out in sicily southern italy by using data from 38 automatic ground weather stations awss for years 2003 2020 era5l and cm saf data were first downscaled and bias corrected with a calibration dataset era5l air temperature data were also downscaled by lapse rate correction eto estimates obtained with the blended era5l and cm saf validation dataset era5l cm saf were compared with two other eto estimates respectively obtained by using era5l and interpolated ground weather data igd performance indicators of the igd dataset were evaluated by recursively applying universal kriging or ordinary kriging to the observed weather data according to a cross validation procedure rs provided by cm saf outperformed rs obtained by ground interpolation thus confirming the convenience of using bias corrected cm saf data even when ground observations are available in the study area eto estimates with era5l cm saf showed a normalized rmse of 12 outperforming era5l eto estimates while performing comparably to eto estimates obtained with the igd dataset the results suggested that the proposed blended dataset is a good proxy for interpolated ground weather observations in the assessment of eto at regional scale when weather measurements cannot be easily gathered or in data sparse regions keywords satellite based models reanalysis data data sparse regions interpolated ground weather data fao penman monteith eto bias correction methods 1 introduction water resources management is one of the main global challenges of the 21st century with many areas of the world likely to struggle in coping with demands for freshwater in the coming decades moore and lobell 2014 agriculture is the economic sector with the largest consumptive water use and water withdrawal accounting for almost 70 of global water withdrawn siebert 2007 assessing irrigation water use is thus fundamental for effectively planning the allocation of water resources in agriculture as well as for designing irrigation systems iglesias and garrote 2015 also in light of the united nation s un 2030 agenda for sustainable development llop and ponce alifonso 2016 the european union in compliance with european water framework directive has planned additional investments only for those irrigation infrastructures offering potential water savings of a minimum of between 5 and 25 that should be verified by the implementation of reliable accounting systems of irrigation water use european parliament 2013 quantitative assessment of irrigation water use at regional scale is generally based on crop water balance modeling e g allen 2000 gonzález dugo et al 2009 consoli and vanella 2014 calera et al 2017 evapotranspiration is the key variable of the crop water budget especially in those regions where rainfall and groundwater contribution are negligible in the irrigation season allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2012 pereira 2017 crop evapotranspiration is commonly estimated according to the fao 56 procedure allen et al 1998 as the product of a crop coefficient representing the crop state and the grass reference evapotranspiration eto representing the evaporative demand of the atmosphere the optimal method for estimating eto is the penman monteith equation according to the fao 56 formulation provided that a complete set of meteorological data is available including air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity ground weather stations equipped with a complete and well maintained set of reliable sensors are generally sparse even in developed countries time series of weather data collected by neighboring stations often present different temporal coverage and are not subjected to rigorous quality control procedures battisti et al 2019 data access is also a critical point ground weather data are managed by regional and national services which distribute data according to different policies end users may have access to these data after complex administrative procedures with a significant latency in those regions where a ground set of weather data are available for the entire period of interest a regional assessment of eto can be obtained by spatial interpolation lewis et al 2014 strong et al 2017 the outcomes of spatial interpolations are subject not only to measurement errors but also to other uncertainties such as uncertainty in the spatial structure of the interpolated field chirico et al 2010 or the representativeness of the ground station site if the latter has not been selected according to adequate standards e g wmo 2018 methods other than the fao penman monteith have been proposed for computing eto with a reduced set of variables pereira 2004 paredes et al 2020 pelosi et al 2020b at the cost of an additional set of empirical parameters that must be calibrated with local data and if possible regionalized jung et al 2016 senatore et al 2020 such calibrated parameters are exposed to errors in the case of non stationarities as was observed in areas affected by significant climate change ren et al 2016 in the last two

ii end users can easily process data also on regions extending across administrative boundaries thus avoiding the burden of collecting and homogenizing weather station data from different data providers several studies have evaluated eto prediction performance based on reanalysis data the first used era interim data provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf e

with a horizontal resolution of 9 km pelosi et al 2020a showed that the accuracy of daily eto predicted with era5 land is comparable with that predicted by spatially interpolating ground weather data but also pointed out that the incoming shortwave solar radiation reconstructed by era5 land is the most prone to error among the weather variables involved in eto estimation alternative sources for solar radiation data are provided by satellite based products such as those based on sensors mounted on geostationary satellites like the meteosat visible and infrared imager mviri onboard the meteosat first generation and the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri on board the meteosat second generation msg satellites trigo et al 2011 urraca et al 2017 previous studies have

as part of the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat based on seviri images lsa saf shortwave radiation outperformed era5 solar radiation mainly due to the higher spatial resolution 4 km for lsa saf and 31 km for era5 the accuracy of eto estimates was also slightly better with lsa saf solar radiation than with era5 solar radiation however lsa saf data were affected by many gaps in the time series which made its operational use more difficult than era5 the satellite application facility on climate monitoring cm saf of eumetsat distributes surface incoming shortwave radiation rs data from year 1983 produced by processing multispectral images of mviri and seviri radiometers mounted on meteosat satellites the latest cm saf rs products based on seviri radiometer mounted on msg are released operationally from year 2018 with a two day delay urraca et al 2017 verified the quality of cm saf ra data after validating it with 313 pyranometers distributed across all european countries except portugal and italy the main motivation of this study was to assess the use of a blended weather dataset consisting of cm saf rs data and era5 land era5l weather data for estimating daily eto with fao penman monteith in regions where ground weather data are available for just short time intervals from a sparse monitoring network the study was conducted for irrigation seasons from year 2003 to year 2020 in sicily southern italy where neither cm saf radiation data nor era5 land reanalysis data had hitherto been validated we first discuss how effective downscaling and bias correction of eto at regional scale could be achieved with one season of ground weather data and we show how the spatial interpolation error of ground weather data could be statistically estimated then we compare the quality of cm saf solar radiation and era5l reanalysis weather data with the respective data obtained by spatially interpolating ground observations finally by taking eto computed with ground weather data as a benchmark we compare the accuracies of eto estimates at ungauged sites computed respectively with i spatially interpolated ground weather data ii only era5 land weather data iii the era5 land weather dataset blended with solar radiation retrieved from cm saf 2 study area and meteorological data 2 1 study area the study area was sicily southern italy the largest island in the mediterranean with an area of about 25 000 km2 fig 1 shows the location and relief map of the region with its wide range of elevations from 0 m a m s l to about 3230 m a m s l at the top of the volcano etna in the north eastern part of the island the small islands surrounding the region were omitted from the study the weather in the study area is influenced by the topographic complexity and by the presence of the mediterranean sea under the köppen geiger climate classification the region has a hot dry summer subtropical climate which is also known as a typical mediterranean climate areas with this climate typically experience hot sometimes very hot dry summers and mild wet winters peel et al 2007 summers in such areas can often be very similar to summers of semi arid climates annual rainfall in the region varies proportionally with site elevation from 400 mm to 1300 mm the mean annual temperature ranges from 11 c in mountain areas to 19 c along the coast liuzzo et al 2017 minimum precipitation and maximum temperature occur in summer mainly in july and august with mean daily values close to 0 mm and 28 c respectively maximum precipitation and minimum temperature occur between december and february with mean monthly values of 150 mm and 11 c respectively cammalleri et al 2012 field irrigation generally starts in april and lasts until the end of september although the actual time span of the irrigation season is influenced by weather fluctuations and specific cropping practices hereinafter the period from april 1st to september 30th will be referred to as the irrigation season 183 days the analyses below concern the assessment of the different weather data sources and daily reference evapotranspiration at regional scale in the irrigation seasons of the years 2003 2020 2 2 meteorological data this section illustrates the different data sources employed for retrieving the input variables required to assess daily

radiation and air barometric pressure 2 2 1 observed ground based data ground weather data were retrieved from the agrometeorological monitoring network managed by the sicilian agrometeorological information service sias servizio informativo agrometereologico siciliano www sias regione sicilia it although the network comprises 96 automatic weather stations awss in operation since 2002 only 42 awss are equipped with pyranometers many gaps in the time series are present in year 2002 thus only data collected in the irrigation seasons of years 2003 2020 were examined in this study the quality of ground data was preliminarily verified according to allen 1996 pyranometer data accuracy was verified by plotting daily rs data against computed shortwave radiation under clear sky radiation wind measurements were verified by comparing the cumulative wind runs of adjacent stations we discarded those stations where the slope of the accumulation significantly differs from those of adjacent stations moreover we discarded the wind speed measurements at 2 m above the ground in favor of wind speed measurements at 10 m due to the presence of local effects that invalidate the representativeness of the measures in the surroundings we did not find anomalies in temperature and relative humidity data and even in summer months we did not find aridity effects in recorded data after the quality check among the 42 awss that measure all the weather variables of interest four stations were discarded two cesarò monte soro and alia present many gaps in the time series a third s fratello was discarded because of wind data anomalies compared with nearby stations a fourth station was excluded because it lies on a small island north of sicily salina outside the boundaries of the

meteorological reanalysis products provide an accurate reconstruction of the climate of the past by running back in time the most advanced and updated versions of the numerical weather prediction models that obey physical laws while sequentially assimilating land surface and atmospheric observations from across the world in recent years reanalysis products have been increasingly used as a gridded data source for water resource management studies since they represent a complete and consistent climate dataset that covers several decades soci et al 2016 in this study we employed the most advanced global reanalysis data produced in europe specifically optimized for the land surface applications era5 land era5l freely available at the website https cds climate copernicus eu muñoz sabater 2019 era5 land is produced for the entire globe with a native horizontal resolution of about 9 km released on a regular 0 1 x 0 1 grid by replaying the land component of era5 climate reanalysis from 1981 to 2 3 months before present era5 is the fifth generation of ecmwf global reanalysis succeeding era interim and covering the entire globe from 1979 at a spatial resolution of about 31 km hersbach et al 2020 the atmospheric forcing in era5 land is provided by land fields of era5 atmospheric variables era5 air temperature air humidity and pressure are corrected to account for the elevation difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of era5 land according to the so called lapse rate correction muñoz sabater 2019 although era5 land runs at enhanced spatial resolution it has the drawback that data are not provided for numerical grid points falling on the sea surface thus for land areas close to the coast the assessment of weather variables must rely on the closest inland data alone fig 2 shows the numerical grid of era5 land only where data are available era5 land data are produced with an hourly time step thus minimum maximum and mean daily values of the weather variables were here derived by gathering 24 values starting from utc 2 every day to calculate the daily values according to the summer time as the ground weather data the selected weather variables of interest were air temperature at 2 m wind speed at 10 m dew point temperature at 2 m global incoming solar radiation and barometric pressure the daily mean dew point temperature was used in eq 2 e a e 0 t dew for computing the daily mean of the actual vapor pressure instead of the daily maximum and minimum relative humidity as done for the ground based data eq 1 2 2 3 satellite based surface incoming shortwave solar radiation data this subsection describes the meteosat satellite derived surface incoming global shortwave radiation products provided by the satellite application facility on climate monitoring cm saf meteosat geostationary satellites were launched by esa european space agency and operated by the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat and the european space agency esa meteosat first generation mfg satellites were equipped with the meteosat visible and infrared imager mviri since 2004 meteosat second generation msg satellites were launched msg satellites were equipped with the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri radiometers trigo et al 2011 urraca et al 2017 mviri on board of mfg satellites consists of a high resolution 3 band radiometer providing simultaneous image generation in the thermal infrared region tir in the water vapor absorption bands wv and in the visible range vis seviri on board of msg satellites allows the full earth atmosphere system to be scanned in 12 spectral channels both seviri and mviri have a spatial resolution between 3 and 5 km over most of europe schmetz et al 2002 satellite based climate and weather data records at the earth s surface are made freely available for users by three independent satellite application facilities safs i the satellite application facility on climate monitoring cm saf www cmsaf eu ii the land surface analysis satellite application facility lsa saf www landsaf meteo pt and iii the ocean and sea ice satellite application facility osi saf www osi saf org to retrieve the satellite based meteorological parameters the different safs use their own algorithms and different ancillary input data journée and bertrand 2010 currently all of them release the data in near real time with a lag of two days from the present the algorithms used for retrieving the satellite based dataset are frequently updated and improved in particular the newest update regarding the cm saf algorithms consisted in adapting the software for processing meteosat 11 imageries in operational mode starting from the year 2018 prior to 2018 cm saf focused on the off line production and distribution of coherent time series of daily and monthly averaged products lsa saf and osi saf have been following a near real time strategy since their establishment for the purpose of this study our interest was in land surface incoming shortwave radiation products that are provided by both cm saf and lsa saf journée and bertrand 2010 showed that cm saf outperformed lsa saf at both hourly and daily scales over belgium cm saf exhibited rmse and relative rmse 0 5 and 3 9 smaller than lsa saf respectively thus for the following analysis cm saf radiation data were considered although other studies successfully employed lsa saf products for analogous applications e g paredes et al 2021 the cm saf surface incoming short wave radiation products are available on the web user interface of the cm saf website http wui cmsaf eu as monthly and daily means and as 30 min instantaneous data on a regular latitude longitude grid with a spatial resolution of 0 05 x 0 05 degrees the products are part of sarah 2 1 which is a satellite based climate data record of the solar surface irradiance the surface direct irradiance direct horizontal and direct normalized the sunshine duration spectral information and the effective cloud albedo derived from satellite observations of the visible channels of the mviri and the seviri instruments onboard the geostationary meteosat satellites the cm saf algorithm is based on the evaluation of the interaction between the atmosphere clear sky reflection transmission and the top of atmosphere albedo by implementing a radiative transfer model and a look up table method mueller et al 2009 2012 conversion from the irregular satellite projection to the regular 0 05 x 0 05 geographic grid is then performed with a gridding tool based on a nearest neighbor method the cm saf daily estimates of surface solar radiation were successfully validated against ground based measurements belonging to the baseline surface radiation network bsrn ohmura et al 1998 the results of validation showed mean absolute errors on average equal to 11 8 w m 2 close to the optimal accuracy of 12 w m 2 and much lower than the target value of 20 w m 2 moreover about 83 of values met the optimal accuracy requirement while 100 of values were found to be lower than the target value the cm saf user manual and validation report document the implemented algorithms and the accuracy of sarah 2 1 climate data record with reference to the bsrn pfeifroth et al 2018 in this study daily means of surface incoming short wave radiation data for the irrigation seasons of years 2003 2020 were employed fig 2 shows the cm saf grid gray mesh over the study area 3 methods 3 1 downscaling and bias correction of reanalysis and satellite based data at the aws sites the procedure that is used to transfer the weather information from the points of a regular grid to other sites within this grid is a form of downscaling which is more often referred to as the method for inferring information from a low resolution to high resolution grid here statistical downscaling techniques were used to infer reanalysis and satellite based data from the native grid of the databases of interest to the aws sites downscaled data were then bias corrected to remove the residual systematic errors from the estimates 3 1 1 downscaling of reanalysis weather data to retrieve the reanalysis weather data at the aws sites from the 0 1 x 0 1 numerical grid a triangle based bi linear interpolation method was employed lee and schachter 1980 the method consists in interpolating the three grid points closest to the examined site since evident statistical correlations were found between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and terrain elevation before proceeding with the grid interpolation of these two weather variables a so called environmental lapse rate elr correction was applied to the grid points of interest for interpolation in order to consider the elevation differences between the grid points and each aws site the elr correction was then applied to three nearest grid points to be used for interpolation to each aws site as follows 3 t elr t gd z z gd elr where z stands for the elevation of the aws site z gd refers to the elevation of the numerical grid point of interest for interpolation tgd is the raw reanalysis temperature value at this numerical grid point and telr is the elr corrected temperature value at the grid point of interest for interpolation at the chosen aws site the environmental lapse rate is defined as the rate of temperature change with elevation 4 elr dt dz it can be computed from observations of temperature at m sample sites by implementing a linear regression model with the elevation z 5 t ˆ elr z t 0 where elr is the slope of the regression line and t0 is the intercept both computed with the ordinary least squares ols method since the elr depends on complex factors such as overlying air masses the large scale situation and local effects sheridan et al 2010 its estimation represents a challenging task however the use of a linear lapse rate for elevation correction between model and station temperature is common practice in hydrological and environmental applications e g gupta and tarboton 2016 moreover the use of a linear elr computed from ground based observations when available is generally accepted and preferred to the use of the common reference value of 0 0065 c m 1 rolland 2003 gao et al 2012 especially for complex terrain this approach has two main limitations i it relies on the elevation variability among the stations and ii it assumes that temperature recorded by stations at different elevations is representative of the mean lower troposphere vertical profile even if the near surface temperature gradient may be dominated by the surface energy balance surface roughness and near surface boundary layer effects rather than by adiabatic effects and the current stratification of the atmosphere gao et al 2012 dutra et al 2020 thus downscaled reanalysis temperature data are still affected by systematic errors due to the dependence of daily temperatures on local terrain attributes other than elevation in this study the described elr correction approach was applied to daily maximum and minimum temperatures by using not only the 38 complete awss selected for the study but all the 96 awss equipped with the temperature sensor the elevations of these awss range from 10 m a s m l to 1875 m a s m l a complete list of them can be found on the sias website www sias regione sicilia it moreover elr correction was done here on a monthly basis by performing six linear regression analyses to obtain six elr values for each month from april to september 3 1 2 downscaling of satellite based radiation data to retrieve the satellite based surface shortwave radiation data at the aws sites from the 0 05 x 0 05 cm saf grid the nearest grid point was considered since the satellite product is a pixel integrated measurement of the parameter of interest an important aspect to consider for understanding the differences between ground measurements at sites and satellite derived information is the fact that satellite data are a snapshot over a large area i e the pixel which does not account for the variability of the parameter within the pixel size while ground information is a time integrated local measurement journée and bertrand 2010 3 1 3 bias correction of downscaled reanalysis and satellite based weather variables estimates from numerical weather prediction models and satellite based products suffer from systematic and non systematic errors which originate from various sources such as sub grid scale variability and inability of the models to fully describe the physical phenomena journée and bertrand 2010 pelosi et al 2017 statistical postprocessing techniques can partly remove such errors among such techniques batch statistical methods are calibrated offline with a training dataset that can be of a short length if a parsimonious number of parameters are required vannitsem 2008 moreover simple bias correction approaches are often preferred to more sophisticated post processing techniques since no significant loss in accuracy is noted despite the much lower computation costs e g paredes et al 2018 in this study a regionally uniform bias correction at monthly scale was applied to all variables except for wind speed for which no systematic bias pattern was found consistent with previous reports ricard and anctil 2019 pelosi et al 2020a the applied method consists in adding to the downscaled products the monthly regional mean difference bias between the ground based measurements and the respective downscaled data computed over the calibration period the first six years 2003 2008 were chosen as calibration period while the remaining 12 years 2009 2020 were used for creating the validation set to which the performance statistics refer the bias correction was applied in the scenario where ground weather observations were not available for the period of interest but data from few past irrigation seasons e g here six seasons were available for calibration 3 2 assessing spatial interpolation error of ground based data by cross validation at the aws sites ground based measurements are often available over irregularly spaced and sparse monitoring networks thus spatial interpolation techniques must be employed if data are required at specific ungauged locations or according to a regular grid such as those of numerical products among the extensive range of spatial interpolation methods geostatistical techniques are the most advanced and used for weather applications hofstra et al 2008 ordinary kriging is the most widely used technique to interpolate weather data such as wind speed luo et al 2008 berndt and haberlandt 2018 pelosi et al 2020a relative humidity berndt and haberlandt 2018 pelosi et al 2020a and solar radiation rehman and ghori 2000 alsamamra et al 2009 journée and bertrand 2010 pelosi et al 2020a however ordinary kriging only uses data available from observations and its performance significantly depends on the density of the available monitoring network and the spatial properties of the variable of interest prudhomme and reed 1999 pelosi and furcolo 2015 for this reason in some other applications where an evident statistical correlation exists between the weather variable of interest and an auxiliary external variable sampled with a higher spatial resolution regression kriging is preferred jarvis and stuart 2001 pelosi et al 2020a this is the case of temperature jarvis and stuart 2001 stahl et al 2006 di piazza et al 2015 pelosi et al 2020a which shows a high correlation with elevation regression kriging odeh et al 1995 also known as residual kriging holdaway 1996 and mathematically equivalent to universal kriging often referred to as kriging with external drift ahmed and de marsily 1987 applies ordinary kriging to the regression residuals of a regression model between the variable of interest and auxiliary independent variables in this study ordinary kriging was used for interpolating daily wind speed maximum and minimum relative humidity and solar radiation regression kriging was employed for daily maximum and minimum air temperature by implementing daily linear regression models of temperature with elevation appendix a summarizes the theoretical bases of the geostatistical methods applied herein more details can be found in journel and huijbregts 1978 and cressie 1993 since the focus of this study was on evaluating the performance of the spatial interpolation of ground based data a leave one out cross validation technique was recursively implemented to compute the jackknife kriging estimation of the variable of interest at each aws site after applying the kriging interpolator to the observations available at the remaining sampling sites this is a very common way to assess the predictive ability of a statistical model and specifically of a geostatistical interpolation technique the result was a set of interpolated ground based data igd at each aws site that could be compared with the measurements recorded at the same site for evaluating the performance of the kriging interpolator 3 3 computation of reference daily evapotranspiration eto in this study the daily reference evapotranspiration eto mm day 1 was computed with the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as follows 6 e t o 1 λ δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34u 2 where λ is the latent heat of vaporization equal to 2 45 mj kg 1 δ kpa c 1 is the slope of the vapor pressure curve γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 t c is the daily mean air temperature at 2 m height computed as the average between the daily maximum tmax and minimum tmin air temperature at 2 m height u2 m s 1 is the wind speed at 2 m height above ground es kpa and ea kpa are respectively the daily saturation vapor pressure and daily actual vapor pressure eqs 1 2 needed for the computation of the saturation vapor pressure deficit es ea rn mj m 2 day 1 is the net radiation at the crop surface and g mj m 2 day 1 is the soil heat flux density the net radiation rn was calculated as the difference between the incoming net shortwave radiation and the outgoing net long wave radiation the incoming net shortwave radiation is a fraction of the incoming shortwave solar radiation rs computed for the reference crop by setting the albedo equal to 0 23 the daily mean wind speed at 2 m u2 m s 1 was obtained from the wind speed at 10 m u10 m s 1 by using a logarithmic wind speed profile as suggested by allen et al 1998 7 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 10 z 5 42 where z 10 m resulting in a reduction factor to apply to uz of about 0 748 for obtaining the wind speed at the lower height of 2 m more details about the parameters in eq 6 can be found in the fao irrigation and drainage study no 56 allen et al 1998 and are omitted herein for the sake of brevity table 3 reports monthly statistics of daily eto averaged between the 38 awss over the irrigation seasons of the years 2003 2020 the minimum monthly mean of daily eto was recorded in april 3 26 mm day 1 and the maximum in july 5 75 mm day 1 the mean coefficient of variation was lowest in july 0 14 and highest in april 0 31 3 4 scenarios of eto estimates the daily reference evapotranspiration eto computed at the aws sites with ground based data was taken as the benchmark for comparing the performance of eto estimated with three alternative weather data sets igd weather data obtained by spatial interpolation with the leave one out cross validation technique era5l weather data retrieved after downscaling and bias correcting era5 land reanalysis data era5l cm saf obtained by changing era5l shortwave incoming solar radiation with downscaled and bias corrected cm saf solar radiation data the three scenarios of eto estimates examined in this study are summarized in table 4 igd refers to the scenario when ground weather data are available for the entire period of interest and thus interpolation is the only error source at regional scale era5l and era5l cm saf scenarios refer to the case when data from the ground monitoring network are available for only a limited period e g one season to be used for regional bias correction and thus era5l and cm saf are used as alternative data sources 3 5 indicators of estimation performance the performance indicators were selected among those commonly used for analogous previous studies e g paredes et al 2018 2021 i the percent bias pbias which is used as an indicator of accuracy 8 pbias 1 o i 1 n p i o i n 100 where pi and oi are respectively the variable for which the performance evaluation is desired and the corresponding observed variable benchmark at the ith day n denotes the number of examined days and o is the mean of the observations computed over the examined days the more the pbias differs from zero the less accurate is the estimate pbias 0 suggests on average underestimation while pbias 0 overestimation ii the normalized root mean square error nrmse which gives insight into both accuracy and precision 9 nrmse 1 o i 1 n p i o i 2 n 100 the greater is the nrmse the less accurate and precise are the estimates iii the coefficient of determination r2 of the ols regression model used to assess the dispersion of pairs of oi and pi independent variable values along the regression line 10 r 2 i 1 n o ˆ i o 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o ˆ i is the predicted value by the linear regression o ˆ i a b p i r2 may vary from 0 to

the absolute squared differences between the predicted and observed values normalized by the variance of the observed values during the period of interest krause et al 2005 11 nse 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the range of nse lies between 1 perfect model with an estimation error variance equal to zero and values of nse nearer to 1 suggest a model with more predictive skill nse equal to 0 indicates that the model has the same predictive skill as the mean of the data in terms of the sum of the squared error an nse value lower than zero indicates that the mean value of the observed data would have been a better predictor than the model that shows an estimation error variance which is significantly larger than the variance of the observations bias corrected reanalysis and satellite based data were employed in the hypothesis that users have only few irrigation seasons available for bias correction so the calibration period was created by one third of the available seasons 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance of weather variable products the following results refer to the performance of the spatially interpolated ground based daily weather data igd and the downscaled bias corrected era5l reanalysis and satellite based cm saf daily products at the 38 awss of the region in the irrigation seasons of the years 2018 2020 appendix b presents the performance of reanalysis era5l and satellite based cm saf daily weather variables before and after the regional mean bias correction also discussed in this section the variability of the performance indicators computed at the 38 aws sites is illustrated with boxplots on each box the central mark is the median the edges of the box are the 25th q1 and 75th q3 percentiles the whiskers extend to the most extreme data values not considered outliers and outliers are plotted individually the points are drawn as outliers if they are larger than q3 1 5 q3 q1 or smaller than q1 1 5 q3 q1 the circle mark represents the mean value among the aws sites 4 1 1 air temperature era5l reanalysis daily maximum and minimum temperature data were downscaled by monthly elr corrections as described in section 3 1 1 whose estimates were obtained by ols regression of ground based observations with elevation table 5 reports the monthly elr coefficients for tmax and tmin along with coefficient of determination r elr 2 absolute elr values are lower for the daily minimum temperature than for the daily maximum temperature in accordance with a similar study that applied lapse rate corrections to era5 reanalysis temperature data in western us dutra et al 2020 these results were expected since low level conditions during the night tend to be more stable resulting in less intense elr for the daily tmin moreover consistent with the current study dutra et al 2020 highlighted that era5 tmin bias is less dependent on elevation than tmax resulting in a lower coefficient of determination table 5 the same reason explains the lower performance of era5l tmin before and after bias correction than raw era5l tmax figs b1 and b2 the mean regional pbias values of era5l daily tmax and tmin products before bias correction are about 4 and 7 respectively figs b1 and b2 indicating a tendency to underestimate tmax and overestimate tmin similar findings were reported in the cited study by dutra et al 2020 as regards era5 products in western us and in many other studies that evaluated the era interim reanalysis database in different regions of the world among others see fu et al 2016 martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018 the ncep ncar reanalysis products also showed tmax estimates outperforming tmin estimates as well as the tendency to overestimate tmin srivastava et al 2015 despite the great progress in atmospheric modeling and resolution representation of near surface daily maximum and especially minimum temperature in reanalysis products suffers from these systematic biases due to large model limitations in representing clouds radiation boundary layer and land surface characteristics dutra et al 2020 however the random component of the errors was greatly improved in era5 with respect to the former era interim due to a better synoptic scale variability and resolution as is also evident from a recent study that compared era5 land reanalysis with uerra which is a regional reanalysis forced by era interim pelosi et al 2020a the systematic errors were successfully removed by means of the bias correction technique explained in section 3 1 4 figs b1 and b2 show that the mean pbias was reduced to almost zero for tmax and to lower than 3 for tmin the nrmse r2 and nse were also slightly improved igd shows a slight tendency to overestimate the observed tmax while era5l after bias correction has a non systematic tendency to overestimate or underestimate tmax as shown by fig 3a on average both the pbias values of igd and era5l products are quite low varying from 14 5 for igd to 0 61 for era5l indicating excellent accuracy then in terms of nrmse r2 and nse igd just slightly outperforms on average era5l the nrmse values reach 17 for igd and 10 for era5l with mean values of 5 9 and 6 3 respectively r2 is on average equal to 0 96 and 0 94 for igd and era5l respectively moreover r2 is always greater than 0 85 nse is on average equal to 0 90 and 0 89 for igd and era5l respectively it is always positive and greater than 0 43 indicating that both products have good predictive skills all over the region with regard to the daily minimum temperature tmin both igd and era5l show slightly worse performances than the results obtained for tmax the main reason for this outcome lies in the dependence of tmin on local topographic conditions besides elevation such that neither a spatial interpolation method like regression kriging with elevation nor an elr correction with elevation are able to reproduce its variability fig 4a shows that on average both the pbias values of igd and era5l products are very low varying from 0 35 for igd to 2 9 for era5l in terms of nrmse r2 and nse igd just slightly outperforms era5l the maximum nrmse is equal to 26 for igd and 28 for era5l with mean values of 11 and 14 respectively r2 is on average equal to 0 95 and 0 89 for igd and era5l respectively moreover r2 is always greater than 0 79 nse is on average 0 88 and 0 81 for igd and era5l respectively it is always positive and greater than 0 21 indicating that both products have quite good predictive skills all over the region 4 1 2 wind speed both igd and era5l products show estimation performance for daily mean wind speed at 10 m u10 with large variability in the region of interest era5l refers to the raw data since bias correction does not improve performance fig b3 consistent with previous reports ricard and anctil 2019 pelosi et al 2020a as shown by fig 5a pbias values range from 56 to 76 with a mean value of 17 for igd and from 62 to 38 with a mean of 21 for era5l nrmse values reach 86 for igd and 72 for era5l with mean values of 33 and 40 respectively fig 5b indicating poor accuracy and precision of the estimates r2 is on average equal to 0 59 and 0 44 for igd and era5l respectively while nse is on average negative for both data indicating estimation error variances that are significantly larger than the observation variance fig 5c d u10 is underestimated in more than half of the aws sites with a poor quality of estimation for both datasets mainly due to the fact that representativeness of the wind measurements at some monitoring stations can be influenced by local terrain effects however the ground records are the only available benchmark data in this study to reduce the influence of local effects measurements of wind speed at 10 m above the ground were preferred to measurements of wind speed at 2 m then the daily mean wind speed at 2 m u2 was obtained from the wind speed at 10 m u10 by using a logarithmic wind speed profile as suggested by allen et al 1998 and recalled in eq 7 the low accuracy and precision of reanalysis wind speed values were also reported in other studies among which it is worth recalling the extensive study that evaluated the performance of the former era interim reanalysis database in portugal undertaken by paredes et al 2018 and the study by pelosi et al 2020a that analyzed era5 land performance in another italian region to our knowledge studies evaluating era5 wind speed performance for hydrological and agricultural applications at regional scale are not yet available 4 1 3 actual vapor pressure the daily actual vapor pressure ea was derived herein for igd from maximum and minimum relative humidity and temperature eq 1 and for era5l from the dew point temperature eq 2 with t tdew according to the type of variables available for each dataset the performance indicators for ea show moderate spatial variability in the region both for the case of interpolated ground based data and for reanalysis products as shown by fig 6a pbias values range from 18 to 17 with a mean value of 1 7 for igd and from 20 to 13 with a mean of 0 12 for era5l with igd showing a slight overestimation raw era5l ea values show systematic overestimation mean pbias equal to 15 as shown in fig b4 which can be efficiently removed by bias correction the nrmse values reach 21 for igd and 23 for era5l with mean values of 14 for both databases fig 6b r2 is on average equal to 0 74 while nse is on average 0 64 for both igd and era5l fig 6c d in summary igd and era5l show comparable moderate accuracies in ea estimates consistent with the results of a previous study regarding the use of era5l in another region of southern italy pelosi et al 2020a 4 1 4 incoming shortwave solar radiation the era5l and cm saf incoming shortwave solar radiation rs data show a mean regional pbias of about 3 7 and 4 7 before bias correction respectively fig b5 indicating slight overestimation the nrmse of cm saf rs is about 5 smaller than era5l the chosen bias correction technique completely removes the systematic errors with slight benefits on the other indices that remain almost unchanged fig b5 below we illustrate the performance of the bias corrected era5l and cm saf rs values downscaled at the aws sites pbias values range i from 6 to 12 with a mean value of 0 10 for igd ii from 8 to 10 with a mean of 1 7 for era5l and iii from 7 to 4 with a mean of 2 4 for cm saf fig 7a nrmse values reach 21 for igd 24 for era5l and 18 for cm saf with mean values of 10 14 and 9 respectively fig 7b moreover nrmse is lower than 10 for 68 and 76 of the aws sites respectively for the igd and cm saf estimates r2 values are on average equal to 0 86 for igd 0 73 for era5l and 0 90 for cm saf for which the minimum r2 value is 0 75 average nse values are equal to 0 85 for igd 0 70 for era5l and 0 88 for cm saf for which the minimum nse value is 0 73 fig 7c d with regard to igd rs similar results were obtained in a region of southern italy with an analogous monitoring network density showing an average nrmse of ground based solar radiation data equal to 15 pelosi et al 2020a in the study area cm saf rs clearly outperforms igd rs suggesting that it is worth using satellite based data even when ground observations are available in the study area for the regional assessment of environmental variables that depend on rs a similar suggestion was made by paredes et al 2021 who advised the use of lsa saf radiation products coupled with ground based observations of other weather variables for assessing eto in near real time the performance of cm saf rs achieved in sicily was very close to that verified by paredes et al 2021 with lsa saf rs in continental portugal paredes et al 2021 also found that lsa saf rs largely outperforms era5 rs for which they found a mean nrmse of 22 thus also larger than what we verified for era5 land in sicily this result was expected since era5 land reanalysis benefits from higher spatial resolution 9 km vs 31 km and specific land corrections implemented for downscaling era5 land from era5 a similar comparative study regarding rs products from different sources was performed by urraca et al 2017 who compared cm saf rs and era interim rs with ground based data collected at a broad network of about 300 monitoring stations distributed all over europe their results showed nrmse of about 18 for cm saf in perfect accordance with our findings and about 33 for era interim era interim reanalysis products are outperformed by both era5 and era5 land as expected thanks to advances in atmospheric modeling fig 8 shows the regional spatial variability of mean pbias and nrmse computed over the validation set at the aws sites the color scales were tuned such that blue corresponds to better performances for both indices values close to zero for the case of pbias and low values for nrmse all datasets show similar spatial patterns of performance indicators although era5l is clearly outperformed by both igd and cm saf especially for nrmse fig 8b the area with the worst performance is north eastern sicily where the most complex and highest mountain chain of the region is located these findings are in agreement with the results of other studies reporting lower accuracy of reanalysis and satellite based products for hill and mountain locations journée and bertrand 2010 cristóbal and anderson 2013 paredes et al 2021 this outcome can be explained by the large sub grid scale variability and heterogeneity of the terrain and weather conditions of hill and mountain areas that result in the inability of pixel integrated data such as satellite data and coarse numerical model grids of reanalysis data to be representative of the pinpoint measurements with regard to igd the reason for the worst performances observed in mountain areas should be found in the local non stationarities of the random field as often observed in orographic areas for other variables such as rainfall furcolo et al 2016 4 2 performance of reference evapotranspiration estimates this subsection reports the performance assessment of the daily fao penman monteith eto computed according to the three scenarios summarized in table 4 the acronym igd is used for eto estimates derived by interpolating ground based weather variables era5l stands for eto estimates derived by using downscaled bias corrected era5l products and finally era5l cm saf refers to eto estimates derived by using downscaled bias corrected era5l products except for the incoming shortwave radiation that was substituted with bias corrected satellite cm saf data as shown in fig 9a pbias values range i from 12 to 22 with a mean value of 5 5 for igd ii from 17 to 19 with a mean of 2 3 for era5l and iii from 20 to 18 with a mean of 2 8 for era5l cm saf indicating good accuracy for all three methods the nrmse values reach maximum values of 27 for igd 22 for era5l and 20 for era5l cm saf and mean values of 13 14 and 12 respectively fig 9b r2 values are on average equal to 0 85 for igd 0 76 for era5l and 0 83 for era5l cm saf while average nse values are equal to 0 66 for igd 0 67 for era5l and 0 73 for era5l cm saf fig 9c d these results are in agreement with a similar study conducted in another region of southern italy for which the mean nrmse of the pm eto estimates computed with era5l data was 17 while it was 22 with the former uerra regional reanalysis forced by era interim pelosi et al 2020a neither performance in the above study was far from those obtained by kriging interpolation which presented the same average nrmse of 14 table 6 shows the nrmse with a monthly aggregation for the three scenarios era5l cm saf always outperforms the others especially in april may and september when the overall performances are slightly worst due to the more possible presence of weather instabilities the eto in june july and august are better described by all three methods than in the remaining months fig 10 shows the regional spatial variability of mean pbias and nrmse computed with the validation sets at the aws sites these indices do not replicate any spatial trend since they are the outcomes of multiple weather variables processed through a nonlinear model such as the fao penman monteith equation however eto estimates tend to be less accurate in mountainous areas similarly to what was observed for rs in fig 8 and on the coast in addition those sites with large errors in wind speed estimates are also subject to major errors in eto estimates era5l cm saf eto estimates outperform era5l eto estimates everywhere in the region especially in terms of nrmse r2 and nse due to the better performance of cm saf rs products in comparison with era5l rs as shown above however the impact of the improvements using the era5l cm saf method rather than era5l is less than expected judging from the performance of cm saf radiation products in comparison with era5l section 4 1 4 this is mainly due to the slight sensitivity of eto to the differences between era5 land and cms saf solar radiation data as illustrated in fig 11a b which show that the pbias and nrmse of the eto estimates computed with ground based weather variables change after substituting one at a time a ground based weather variable with the respective reanalysis or satellite based estimation as indicated on the x axis fig 11a confirms that by using all observed weather variables except era5l radiation the mean nrmse increases by almost 3 about 0 2 mm day 1 by using all observed weather variables except cm saf radiation the mean nrmse increases by almost 2 about 0 1 mm day 1 similar results were obtained by paredes et al 2021 who proposed the use of a satellite based radiation product instead of ground measurements and era5 radiation products in their study for continental portugal the mean rmse of the eto estimates decreased by 0 2 mm day 1 when lsa saf radiation was used instead of era5 radiation here by using cm saf rs instead of era5 land rs rmse decreased by 0 1 mm day 1 this smaller difference in rmse with respect to paredes et al 2021 is due to era5 land outperforming era5 moreover fig 11 show that the largest errors in eto estimates are obtained when wind speed ground data are changed with igd or era5l wind data eto errors with igd rs are similar to those obtained with cm saf rs analogously eto errors with igd temperature are similar to those obtained with era5l temperature in accordance with the results presented in section 4 1 1 5 conclusions remote sensing and reanalysis products represent important data sources for regional assessment of the hydrological variables relevant to water resource planning and climate studies however proper regional scale analyses must be implemented to evaluate their added value with respect to what could be achieved by spatially interpolating sparse ground observations in this study a cross validation procedure consisting in recursively interpolating data by universal kriging and ordinary kriging was adopted to evaluate the performance of a regional spatial interpolation this study confirmed that satellite based solar radiation data delivered by cm saf can be effectively employed for water resources management applications especially in those regions where it is difficult to gather weather data recorded by ground weather stations in the examined region served by a relatively dense network of ground weather stations bias corrected solar radiation estimates provided by cm saf outperformed those estimates obtained by spatially interpolating solar radiation data recorded by the pyranometers at the ground weather stations performance indicators of eto estimates computed with a weather dataset consisting of cm saf solar radiation data and era5 land weather data are comparable to those computed with spatially interpolated weather data ground weather observations are still fundamental for bias correcting remotely sensed data however a relatively short time series is sufficient to achieve valid bias correction in this study six irrigation seasons out of 18 these results confirm the hypothesis that an optimal blending of reanalysis and satellite based data can be used with high accuracy and confidence for the regional assessment of eto when ground weather data cannot be easily gathered due to the inaccessibility and lack of interoperability of ground based weather databases moreover it might be even better to use cm saf blended with era5 land for the assessment of eto in regions where the spatial interpolation of ground weather data is prone to large uncertainties due to the poor spatial distribution and

editor dr paula paredes for the constructive comments and suggestions appendix a ordinary and regression kriging in geostatistical methods the variable of interest is considered as a random function of the space x z x and the set of observed values at the m sampling locations z x 1 z x 2 z x m represents one realization of this random function the kriging interpolator allows the predicted value of the variable of interest at an ungauged location x k to be expressed as a linear combination of z x 1 z x 2 z x m as follows a 1 z ˆ x k i 1 m w i z x i where the weights w i for i 1 m are obtained by solving the kriging system that provides the optimal with minimum variance criterion unbiased linear estimator blue best linear unbiased estimator ordinary kriging assumes the hypothesis of constant unknown mean μ over the search neighborhood of x k the ordinary kriging system can be written as follows a 2 j 1 m w j γ z x i x j μ γ z x i x for i 1 m j 1 m w j 1 where γ is the semi variogram of the random field z x under the hypothesis of an intrinsically stationary isotropic random field z x the semi variogram unambiguously describes the spatial autocorrelation of the sampling locations and it can be estimated from data i e experimental semi variogram as follows a 3 γ ˆ z h 1 2 e z x h z x 2 where h is the varying distance lag between two sampling locations then by fitting the experimental semi variogram with a suitable parametric analytic function the theoretical semi variogram of the field γ z is defined among various analytical functions used to fit the experimental semi variograms the exponential curve is here employed a 4 γ z h n g s 1 exp h r where h is the varying lag distance n g r and s are parameters of the curve called nugget partial sill and range respectively the nugget is the value of the semi variogram at lag equal to zero and it is theoretically zero however in the presence of small scale variability and or measurements errors the nugget is not zero nugget effect the range defines the distance within the sample locations are spatially correlated the value reached by the semi variogram model at a lag equal to the range is called the sill the partial sill is the sill minus the nugget for the regression kriging a regression analysis is first carried out between the variable of interest and an auxiliary variable y x a 5 z x a y x b where z x is the fitted value of the variable of interest and a and b are the regression coefficients estimated by the ols method the kriging estimator of eqs a 1 a 6 is then applied to the regression residuals r x z x z x to obtain the prediction of the residual at the unsampled location x k r ˆ x k and hence the predicted value of the variable of interest z ˆ x k as follows a 6 z ˆ x k z x k r ˆ
