16870,ultrasound techniques have gained increased interest in environmental remediation because of their promising performance and reagent free nature this study investigated the effects of ultrasound coagulation on microcystis aeruginosa removal disinfection by product dbp formation during subsequent chlorination and acute toxicity and dbp associated toxicity variations in chlorinated effluents compared with coagulation using polymeric aluminum chloride 5 mg al l alone ultrasound coagulation showed significantly enhanced turbidity removal with the removal ratio increasing from 51 to 87 96 although the addition of ultrasound may not substantially improve and even deteriorate the coagulation removal of doc following the leakage of intracellular organic matter the significantly improved dbp control was achieved as the cells dominated dbp formation with the addition of ultrasound the chlorine demand aggregate dbp concentration and total organic halogen concentration reductions in the chlorinated m aeruginosa solution increased from 15 47 and 52 coagulation alone respectively to 56 78 56 80 and 68 89 the enhanced dbp mitigation was mainly attributed to the enhanced algal removal similarly the acute toxicity and dbp associated toxicity of chlorinated effluents further decreased from 100 and 0 0092 coagulation alone to 30 88 and 0 0029 0 0060 therefore ultrasound enhanced coagulation is a promising strategy for urgent algal removal dbp mitigation and toxicity abatement graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products chlorination microcystis aeruginosa ultrasound coagulation 1 introduction nutrient enrichment of surface waters resulting from anthropogenic activity eutrophication has been an objectionable water quality issue for some time smith and schindler 2009 and cyanobacterial bloom formation which is considered a potent threat to organisms especially humans codd et al 2005 richardson and ternes 2014 has occurred more frequently and intensely over the last decades algal organic matter aom which includes extracellular organic matter eom excreted during cell growth and intracellular organic matter iom resulting from cell lysis is a complex heterogeneous mixture composed of compounds including amino acids peptides proteins and organic amines pivokonsky et al 2014 both algal cells and aom have been confirmed as important precursors for carbonaceous disinfection by products c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps formed during disinfection richardson et al 2007 yang et al 2019 liu et al 2018 found that the predominant three dbp classes formed from chlorination of the aom extracted from freshwater and marine algae species were trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetaldehydes thms haas and hals respectively haloacetonitriles hans were also observed to a lesser degree and halonitromethanes hnms and haloketones hks had markedly lower concentrations fang et al 2010b indicated that aom had a larger n dbp yield following chlorination than natural organic matter nom owing to the higher toxicity of n dbps over c dbps li and mitch 2018 the effective removal of algae is of crucial importance coagulation is a conventional method employed in drinking water treatment plants dwtps for algal removal considering that algal cells are organic particles with organic coatings exhibiting negative zeta potential electrostatic repulsions steric effects and hydrophilic effects hinder their aggregation and consequently inhibit their coagulation efficiency henderson et al 2008 moreover aom can react with inorganic coagulants to form chelate complexes which impairs the coagulation ability of coagulants and consequently increases the coagulant demand to achieve a similar effectiveness takaara et al 2007 current strategies for improving the efficiency of coagulation include preoxidation qi et al 2016 xie et al 2013 oxidants with strong oxidizability can cause the desorption of the organic coatings from the cell surface xie et al 2013 which reduces the cell stability and consequently improves the coagulation efficiency because of the promoted cell aggregation the exfoliated coatings are oxidized to the products with different degrees of hydrophilicity depending on the oxidants used zeng et al 2014 in addition the potent oxidation can cause the reduction in the cell activity facilitating the capture of the cells by coagulants despite the satisfactory performance of preoxidation for coagulation improvement and cost control even in cold climates where coagulation alone may exhibit a reduced reaction rate xiao et al 2009 certain drawbacks must be fully considered notably the rupture of cells caused by potent oxidation inevitably leads to the leakage of iom resulting in increased amounts of toxins and nitrogenous compounds in drinking water given the above the development of environmentally friendly techniques reconciling efficiency security and economy is of great importance ultrasound has great potential to be classified in these techniques because only sound energy is used rajasekhar et al 2012 a large number of minute bubbles dramatically collapse after several cycles of rarefaction and compression under the action of ultrasound acoustic cavitation muthupandian 2011 each collapse is a transient process where the temperature and pressure within the bubble are reported to be as high as 5000 and 100 mpa respectively thus generating multiple forms of mechanical effects shock waves shear forces and microjets and chemical effects free radical oxidation rajasekhar et al 2012 suslick 1990 at present the relatively high energy consumption of ultrasound techniques largely impedes them from being employed in engineering applications fortunately efforts to explore the transducers with better performance e g higher power capacity and lower excitation voltage for more practicable and energy saving are ongoing lin 2007 olabi and grunwald 2008 sunny et al 2012 wang et al 2011 therefore ultrasound can be considered a promising green strategy in project engineering ultrasound has attracted increasing attention for use in environmental applications to control harmful cyanobacteria rajasekhar et al 2012 prior research explored the effectiveness of ultrasound in improving the algal removal by coagulation in terms of algal removal efficiency and the underlying mechanisms huang et al 2020b li et al 2019b in our previous work huang et al 2020b the specific mechanisms of low frequency ultrasound for enhancing the algal removal by coagulation were determined and definitely correlated with certain treatment intensities an enhanced coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells from 44 to 60 67 and 75 was achieved upon the 29 4 khz ultrasonic pretreatment at energy densities of 0 6 1 11 and 2 22 j ml respectively with polymeric aluminum chloride pac of 4 mg al l the work revealed that the low frequency pretreatment at energy density higher than 0 6 j ml can cause the significant reduction in cell activity further increasing energy density to 1 11 j ml can lead to the impairment of cell stability and the aggregation of cells and concluded that a short amount of low frequency pretreatment 0 6 2 22 j ml can effectively enhance the coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells without the undesired leakage of aom in the study of li et al 2019b the effects of high frequency ultrasound on enhancing the turbidity removal by coagulation in algae laden water and the mechanisms were fully investigated under different frequencies and treatment intensities in that study the ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 120 430 740 and 1120 khz and a constant energy density of 5 4 j ml increased the coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells by approximately 7 10 8 and 6 respectively pac 10 mg l moreover the overmuch accumulation of proteins belonging to aom and the excessive production of radicals were found to deteriorate coagulation efficiency thus the authors recommended a mild high frequency pretreatment such as the sonication at 740 khz and 6 j ml despite these advances direct data regarding the security of ultrasound coagulation process remains poorly understood particularly with respect to the formation of dbps during subsequent chlorination and the toxicity of the disinfected effluent therefore the objectives of this study were to elaborate the effects of various ultrasound coagulation scenarios covering different frequencies 29 4 470 and 780 khz and energy densities 1 77 3 42 6 84 and 17 7 j ml on the formation of c dbps and n dbps a huge group of disinfected products with disquieting health risk to humans following chlorination and on the toxicity of the disinfected effluent moreover the contributions of algal cells and aom a mixture of eom and leaked iom to dbp formation were ascertained this study provides new insights and guidance on optimizing ultrasound parameters with consideration of security for the ongoing study of algal removal by ultrasound enhanced coagulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials low frequency and high frequency ultrasonic systems were obtained from the institute of acoustics chinese academy of sciences figure s1 the low frequency ultrasound at 29 4 khz was emitted from a horn type transducer and the high frequency ultrasound at 470

settle for 30 min following a supernatant sample approximately 200 ml taken from 2 cm below the surface was carefully separated from the flocs and used to determine the characteristics of the sample and conduct chlorination experiments under simulated distribution system sds conditions ding et al 2019 specifically an appropriate chlorine demand was predetermined by adding the free chlorine stock solution of a wide concentration range into the sample to achieve a total chlorine residual of 1 0 5 mg l as cl2 after 24 h of disinfection the chlorinated sample was incubated in a 40 ml amber glass bottle in the dark and headspace free state 25 0 5 details regarding the chlorine demands are presented in table s4 following incubation a stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid was immediately added

ding et al 2019 and in table s5 the total organic halogen tox content was determined using an analytikjena multix 2500 tox analyzer equipped with a microcoulometric detector jena germany based on the standard method 5320b apha et al 1995 li et al 2010 2 4 toxicity determination a luminescence inhibition assay on a typical freshwater photobacterium vibrio qinghaiensis sp q67 q67 widely used for investigating the toxicity of herbicides pesticides and antibiotics fan et al 2017 liu et al 2009 was performed to evaluate the acute toxicity of the disinfected effluent under various ultrasound coagulation scenarios the preparation procedure is presented in text s1 for the assay 175 Œºl of each sample and 25 Œºl of the bacterial suspension were added to a 96 well standard microplate 8 rows 12 columns of which 36 wells on the boundary were filled with 200 Œºl ultrapure water to avoid edge effects yu et al 2015 the relative light unit rlu of q67 was detected in each well after 15 min of exposure at 25 0 5 using a synergy htx multi mode reader biotek instruments inc vermont usa the parameter luminescence inhibition ratio was calculated using equation 1 in which i 0 and i are the rlu of q67 exposed to ultrapure water and the filtrate respectively to determine the acute toxicity to q67 luminescence inhibition ratio i 0 i i 0 100 1 in accordance with previous research the calculated dbp associated cytotoxicity which has been demonstrated to be additive was calculated by dividing the dbp concentration by its lc50 value chuang and mitch 2017 lau et al 2020 the lc50 value indicates the dosage capable of killing half of the cells chinese hamster ovary cells after 72 h of exposure and the values wagner and plewa 2017 employed in this study are summarized in table s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of various ultrasound coagulation scenarios on coagulation efficiency and aom distribution fig 1 displays the removal of m aeruginosa cells top and doc bottom by ultrasound coagulation process both the turbidity and doc level continuously decreased with increasing pac dosage from 0 to 6 mg al l when the sample was solely coagulated however the removal performance on them was relatively poor for example the residual turbidity at a pac dosage of 6 mg al l was much higher than the effluent turbidity limit reported in the chinese national standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 1 ntu this indicates that coagulation alone does not achieve satisfactory removal efficiency at a commonly used pac dosage 6 mg al l in this study for drinking water treatment which may actually be the case due to the uncertainty and complexity of influent waters as shown in fig 1 variations in the turbidity of the m aeruginosa solution after ultrasonic treatment at various frequencies and energy densities data at 0 mg al l of pac were negligible whereas the doc level exhibited a continuous increase following the frequency order of 29 4 780 and 470 khz and with increasing energy density these results revealed a distinct difference in the actions of low frequency 20 4 khz and high frequency 470 and 780 khz ultrasound on algal cells our previous work found that the 29 4 khz ultrasound at an energy density 1 11 huang et al 2020b and 1 5 j ml huang et al 2020a was capable of damaging m aeruginosa cells suggesting that the increase in the energy density 3 42 j ml in this study of the 29 4 khz ultrasound enlarged the number of cells ruptured and increased the doc level due to the leakage of iom in comparison the doc level increases after the 470 and 780 khz ultrasonic treatments were markedly lower than that after the 29 4 khz ultrasonic treatment prior research generally confirms a conversion of the main behavior of ultrasound from mechanical effects to chemical effects with increasing ultrasound frequency mason et al 2011 tran et al 2014 therefore the temperate increase in the doc level at the two high frequencies resulted mainly from controlled cell rupture of note the 780 khz ultrasound resulted in a higher doc level increase than the 470 khz ultrasound this was ascribed to the relatively significant cell rupture that occurred at the 780 khz frequency as a result of the resonance induced collapse of gas vacuoles inside the cells the abovementioned results were confirmed by cryo sem which allows the legible capture of nanostructures of algal cells while preserving the state of the cells as originally as possible frederik and hubert 2005 fig 2 intuitively presents the integrity of m aeruginosa cells after ultrasonic treatment at various frequencies control 29 4 470 and 780 khz and the maximum energy density 17 7 j ml as illustrated in fig 2 cells that were not ultrasonically treated are spherical in shape with diameters of approximately 3 5 Œºm in comparison severely damaged cells were observed after ultrasonic treatment at 29 4 khz cell fragments and sunken surfaces were clearly observed after high frequency ultrasonic treatments the morphological integrity of the cells remained largely intact despite a small number of cells exhibiting folds on their surface the m aeruginosa solution treated with ultrasound coagulation process showed substantially enhanced turbidity removal at the low pac dosages the residual turbidity at a given pac dosage basically decreased with increasing energy density from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml except for the 29 4 khz ultrasound coagulation at 5 mg al l of pac that showed an inverse trend which was ascribed to the mechanically ruptured cells being unfavorable for coagulation the pac at 5 mg al l achieved satisfactory turbidity removal removal ratio 90 with the assistance of ultrasound even at the lowest energy density 1 77 j ml whereas the coagulation alone had a poor turbidity removal ratio approximately 51 previous studies huang et al 2020b li et al 2019b proposed that the increased cell removal was related to the weakened negative zeta potential and reduced cell activity caused by ultrasound fig 3 shows the variations in the activity and stability of m aeruginosa cells after ultrasonic treatment alone at various frequencies and energy densities the 29 4 khz ultrasound at a given energy density resulted in a significantly reduced activity the 470 and 780 khz ultrasound by contrast led to relatively weak reductions in the activity moreover the stability of algal cells exhibited a decrease followed by an increase at the 29 4 khz ultrasound with increasing energy density from 0 to 6 84 j ml and then to 17 7 j ml the reversion can be explained by that the mechanically ruptured cells with decreased sizes had stronger negative zeta potential due to the increased specific surface area in contrast the 470 and 780 khz ultrasound caused continuous and more efficient reductions in the stability with energy density from 0 to 17 7 j ml it has been demonstrated that potent oxidation can cause the desorption of organic coatings from algal cells xie et al 2013 which is a reason for the weakened negative zeta potential by ultrasound in addition the mechanical effects derived from the collapsing bubbles can cause the physical detachment of the coatings which has been demonstrated in our previous work huang et al 2020a on the other hand doc removal was not effectively improved with the addition of ultrasound even significantly deteriorated at the 29 4 khz ultrasound with the increase of energy density from 3 42 to 17 7 j ml this phenomenon was due to the conspicuously increased doc load resulting from the leakage of iom in contrast the ultrasound coagulation process at frequencies of 470 and 780 khz resulted in slightly improved doc removal when pac dosage was greater than 3 mg al l which was attributed to more efficient coagulation figure s2 enables a holistic understanding of the observed variation in the aom dissolved in water during the ultrasound coagulation process three fluorescence peaks were consistently observed in all samples among which peak a ex em 275 335 nm has been widely regarded as representing protein like substances peaks c ex em 330 405 nm and d ex em 270 440 nm were identified as humic like substances li et al 2019a wen et al 2015 as shown in figure s2 the 29 4 khz ultrasound resulted in the distinct increases of both the protein like and humic like substances compared with the control group panel c vs panel a which further deteriorated the coagulation efficiency of aom panel d vs panel b in contrast there was no obvious difference in the aom components between the high frequency scenarios and the control group panels e and g vs panel a and the coagulation removal of aom was similar panels f and h vs panel b both the doc data fig 1 and feem spectra indicate the limitation of ultrasonic pretreatment for the coagulation removal of aom this result is consistent with previous findings that coagulation and preoxidation enhanced coagulation had poor performance on aom removal ma et al 2006 widrig et al 1996 these observations verified the dramatic mechanical disruption effect of the 29 4 khz ultrasound and highlight the importance of optimizing ultrasound intensity especially low frequency ultrasound intensity for environmentally friendly applications moreover iom is characterized as containing a higher proportion of peptides proteins than eom pivokonsky et al 2006 and its leakage from mechanically ruptured cells theoretically poses a more potent toxic threat due to the increased formation of n dbps with higher cytotoxicity during chlorination fang et al 2010a 2010b 3 2 effects of various ultrasound coagulation scenarios on dbp formation during subsequent chlorination the results reported in the last section showed that the ultrasound coagulation at a pac dosage of 5 mg al l achieved prominent turbidity removal compared to coagulation alone thus the pac dosage was fixed at 5 mg al l to investigate dbp formation following subsequent chlorination fig 4 presents the chlorine demand dbp and tox formation after sds chlorination of the m aeruginosa solution treated under various ultrasound coagulation scenarios the sds chlorination of the raw m aeruginosa solution consumed 810 4 26 7 Œºm 57 5 1 9 mg l chlorine as cl2 and coagulation alone slightly reduced the chlorine demand by 15 to 688 1 40 2 Œºm 48 8 2 8 mg l however the coagulation assisted by ultrasound at frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz and a low energy density of 1 77 j ml significantly decreased the chlorine demand by 75 78 and 77 to 200 9 38 0 Œºm 14 2 2 7 mg l 176 0 24 4 Œºm 12 5 1 7 mg l and 187 2 6 4 Œºm 13 3 0 5 mg l respectively this demonstrates that m aeruginosa cells and iom can vigorously react with chlorine and consume the dominant chlorine a result that is consistent with those of previous studies zhou et al 2014 2015 moreover similar to the doc variations over ultrasound coagulation process as described in the last section increasing energy density aggravated chlorine demand due to the breakage of cells and leakage of iom especially for the 29 4 khz ultrasound whose intensification in intensity from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml obviously increased the chlorine demand by 78 from 200 9 38 0 Œºm 14 2 2 7 mg l to 356 6 18 4 Œºm 25 3 1 3 mg l in comparison the high frequency scenarios had relatively lower and mildly changed chlorine demands owing to the lack of bromide chlorinated dbps were the dominant dbps by weight the concentrations of tcam dcnm and brominated dbps were lower than the detection limits the thm haa and hal were the first three classes of dbps by weight followed by the han and ham the first two classes of n dbps by weight while the hk and hnm had distinctly low concentrations table s7 gives the specific dbp concentrations following chlorination under the various ultrasound coagulation scenarios the chlorination of the raw m aeruginosa solution produced 63 5 3 2 Œºm tox as cl 1180 5 92 1 nm tcm 635 7 53 0 nm haas 724 9 71 4 nm hals 19 8 1 6 nm tck 249 0 24 8 nm hans 5 5 0 1 nm tcnm and 132 9 9 6 nm dcam the tox tcm haa hal tck han tcnm and dcam concentrations decreased by 52 56 57 42 47 12 7 and 24 to 30 3 3 4 Œºm 524 4 75 5 nm 271 6 30 5 nm 419 1 36 6 nm 10 5 0 6 nm 218 4 15 1 nm 5 1 0 7 nm and 101 6 15 6 nm respectively upon coagulation alone the reduced concentrations of tox and dbps were attributed to the removal of algal cells and aom which was confirmed by the reduced turbidity doc level and fluorescence intensity with the addition of ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz and a low energy density of 1 77 j ml the aggregate dbp concentration further decreased by 59 60 and 61 from 1550 6 81 9 nm coagulation alone to 633 8 10 7 nm 626 1 9 6 nm and 601 7 39 5 nm respectively and tox concentration presented a similar behavior this result indicates that dbp precursors were effectively removed by ultrasound enhanced coagulation however the dbp formation under the three frequency scenarios exhibited different trends with increasing energy density from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml low frequency ultrasound at 29 4 khz dramatically enhanced aggregate dbp and tox formation with the concentrations of each increasing from 633 8 10 7 nm and 8 5 0 9 Œºm respectively to 1284 8 11 6 nm and 20 6 0 5 Œºm conversely the effects of energy density on aggregate dbp and tox formation at high frequencies 470 and 780 khz were relatively inconspicuous this was mainly due to the more residual cells and severe iom leakage at the low frequency that inevitably aggravated chlorination considering the diameter of the algal cells approximately 3 5 Œºm fig 2 the 0 22 Œºm filters were capable of effectively separating the aom a mixture of eom and leaked iom from the cells the samples that were and were not filtered by 0 22 Œºm filters consisted of the aom alone and both the cells and aom i e the m aeruginosa solution respectively this method has also been adopted in previous studies to differentiate algal cells and aom fang et al 2010b li et al 2020 fig 5 presents the chlorine demand dbp and tox formation after chlorination of m aeruginosa solution and corresponding aom respectively the three ultrasound coagulation scenarios were all fixed at the highest energy density 17 7 j ml as shown in fig 5 compared with the unfiltered sample the filtered sample had a substantially lower chlorine demand and showed reduced dbp and tox concentrations the chlorine demand aggregate dbp and tox concentrations following chlorination of the aom in the raw m aeruginosa solution were 287 7 31 9 Œºm 1047 5 46 7 nm and 24 8 2 4 Œºm respectively and accounted for 36 of the chlorine demand 810 4 26 7 Œºm 36 of the aggregate dbp concentration 2948 2 86 7 Œºm and 39 of the tox concentration 63 5 3 2 Œºm following chlorination of the raw m aeruginosa solution thus the contribution of the algal cells to dbp and tox formation was greater than that of the aom the chlorine demand aggregate dbp and tox concentrations of the chlorinated aom sample under coagulation alone were lower than those under the 29 4 khz ultrasound coagulation but higher than those under the 470 and 780 khz ultrasound coagulation which is consistent with the variations of residual doc level as shown in fig 1 bottom of note the decreases in specific dbp concentrations by filtration varied and the reduction of the n dbps was higher than that of the c dbps for example the concentration of aggregate n dbps the sum of dcan tcan tcnm and dcam was reduced by 73 from 387 3 17 3 nm to 103 8 6 5 nm but the concentration of aggregate c dbps the sum of tcm dcaa tcaa dcal tcal and tck was reduced by 63 from 2560 9 103 9 nm to 943 7 50 7 nm with filtration of the raw m aeruginosa solution this phenomenon can be explained by the iom in algal cells being rich in nitrogen containing organic compounds including amino acids peptides proteins and organic amines which are important precursors for n dbps bond et al 2012 yang et al 2010 moreover the remarkably increased fluorescence intensity of peak a protein like substances resulting from the leakage of iom from cells figure s2c vs figure s2a also supported this phenomenon this demonstrates that iom was a more dominant n dbp precursor than eom which is consistent with those reported in previous studies fang et al 2010b zhou et al 2015 although coagulation decreased the chlorine demand aggregate dbp and tox concentrations of the chlorinated raw m aeruginosa solution by 15 47 and 52 respectively to 688 1 40 2 Œºm 1550 6 81 9 Œºm and 30 3 3 4 Œºm it did not lead to distinct changes in the ratios of the chlorine demand 36 and 27 before and after coagulation respectively aggregate dbp concentration 36 and 27 and tox concentration 39 and 30 following chlorination of the aom to those following chlorination of the corresponding m aeruginosa solution in contrast the ultrasonic pretreatment at the three frequencies significantly altered the contributions of the algal cells and aom to chlorine demand and dbp and tox formation the ratios of the chlorine demand aggregate dbp concentration and tox concentration following chlorination of the aom including the eom and leaked iom to those following chlorination of the corresponding m aeruginosa solution increased to 62 63 58 72 and 64 84 respectively the increased contribution of aom to the three ratios was attributed to the highly reduced cells by ultrasound enhanced coagulation with cell participation in chlorination being dramatically reduced furthermore the three ratios at 29 4 khz were comparatively lower than those at 470 and 780 khz which was due to the relatively low turbidity and doc removal effects at 29 4 khz ultrasound coagulation scenario with energy densities of 3 42 17 7 j ml fig 1 in conclusion the enhanced mitigation of dbp precursors upon ultrasound coagulation process was mainly attributed to the enhanced removal of algal cells 3 3 effects of various ultrasound coagulation scenarios on the acute toxicity and calculated dbp associated toxicity of the chlorinated effluent fig 6 shows the luminescence inhibition effect top and calculated dbp associated cytotoxicity bottom of the chlorinated effluent under various ultrasound coagulation scenarios the results indicated a potent luminescence inhibition effect of the chlorinated m aeruginosa solution irrespective of whether the solution was treated with coagulation alone or not in contrast the m aeruginosa solution treated with the 29 4 470 and 780 khz ultrasound coagulation at a low energy density of 1 77 j ml showed significantly reduced luminescence inhibition ratios with values of 33 30 and 39 respectively this indicates that ultrasonic pretreatment significantly decreased the acute toxicity of the chlorinated effluent when the energy density was increased from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml the luminescence inhibition ratio at 29 4 khz increased from 33 to 88 while the luminescence inhibition ratios at 470 and 780 khz remained relatively stable this observation is consistent with the variations in chlorine demand and aggregate dbp and tox concentrations although the thm and haa were the dominant classes of dbps by molar weight they only accounted for a slight proportion of the total dbp associated cytotoxicity 2 due to their weaker toxic potency wagner and plewa 2017 the hal and han were the main contributors to dbp associated cytotoxicity and accounted for more than 90 of the total calculated cytotoxicity the first and second highest dbp associated cytotoxicities were 1 3 10 2 and 9 2 10 3 respectively observed from the chlorinated raw m aeruginosa solution without and with coagulation treatment the dbp associated cytotoxicity of the sample treated with ultrasound coagulation was substantially lower than that of the sample treated with coagulation alone indicating that ultrasound did play a conclusive role in reducing dbp associated cytotoxicity 4 conclusions in this study the effects of various combinations of ultrasound frequency and ultrasound energy density on the ultrasound coagulation process with respect to the removal of algal cells mitigation of dbp formation and abatement of toxicity were investigated the addition of an ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz substantially enhanced the removal of m aeruginosa cells by coagulation e g from 51 to 87 96 at a pac dosage of 5 mg al l however the doc removal showed an inconspicuous improvement and even deteriorated at the low frequency ultrasound 29 4 khz 3 42 j ml due to the increased doc load resulting from the leakage of iom both algal cells and aom were important dbp precursors among which the cells saliently contributed to dbp formation owing to the improved removal of algal cells by ultrasound enhanced coagulation the chlorine demand aggregate dbp and tox concentrations following subsequent chlorination further decreased by 48 74 17 61 and 32 77 respectively of note the comparatively lower decreases occurred at the 29 4 khz ultrasound with energy densities of 3 42 17 7 j ml which were attributed to the more residual cells and aom after coagulation the acute toxicity and calculated dbp associated toxicity of the chlorinated effluent under ultrasound coagulation scenarios can achieve effective reductions of 70 and 68 respectively compared with the toxicities under coagulation alone this study showed that ultrasound is a promising coagulation pretreatment

16870,ultrasound techniques have gained increased interest in environmental remediation because of their promising performance and reagent free nature this study investigated the effects of ultrasound coagulation on microcystis aeruginosa removal disinfection by product dbp formation during subsequent chlorination and acute toxicity and dbp associated toxicity variations in chlorinated effluents compared with coagulation using polymeric aluminum chloride 5 mg al l alone ultrasound coagulation showed significantly enhanced turbidity removal with the removal ratio increasing from 51 to 87 96 although the addition of ultrasound may not substantially improve and even deteriorate the coagulation removal of doc following the leakage of intracellular organic matter the significantly improved dbp control was achieved as the cells dominated dbp formation with the addition of ultrasound the chlorine demand aggregate dbp concentration and total organic halogen concentration reductions in the chlorinated m aeruginosa solution increased from 15 47 and 52 coagulation alone respectively to 56 78 56 80 and 68 89 the enhanced dbp mitigation was mainly attributed to the enhanced algal removal similarly the acute toxicity and dbp associated toxicity of chlorinated effluents further decreased from 100 and 0 0092 coagulation alone to 30 88 and 0 0029 0 0060 therefore ultrasound enhanced coagulation is a promising strategy for urgent algal removal dbp mitigation and toxicity abatement graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products chlorination microcystis aeruginosa ultrasound coagulation 1 introduction nutrient enrichment of surface waters resulting from anthropogenic activity eutrophication has been an objectionable water quality issue for some time smith and schindler 2009 and cyanobacterial bloom formation which is considered a potent threat to organisms especially humans codd et al 2005 richardson and ternes 2014 has occurred more frequently and intensely over the last decades algal organic matter aom which includes extracellular organic matter eom excreted during cell growth and intracellular organic matter iom resulting from cell lysis is a complex heterogeneous mixture composed of compounds including amino acids peptides proteins and organic amines pivokonsky et al 2014 both algal cells and aom have been confirmed as important precursors for carbonaceous disinfection by products c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps formed during disinfection richardson et al 2007 yang et al 2019 liu et al 2018 found that the predominant three dbp classes formed from chlorination of the aom extracted from freshwater and marine algae species were trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetaldehydes thms haas and hals respectively haloacetonitriles hans were also observed to a lesser degree and halonitromethanes hnms and haloketones hks had markedly lower concentrations fang et al 2010b indicated that aom had a larger n dbp yield following chlorination than natural organic matter nom owing to the higher toxicity of n dbps over c dbps li and mitch 2018 the effective removal of algae is of crucial importance coagulation is a conventional method employed in drinking water treatment plants dwtps for algal removal considering that algal cells are organic particles with organic coatings exhibiting negative zeta potential electrostatic repulsions steric effects and hydrophilic effects hinder their aggregation and consequently inhibit their coagulation efficiency henderson et al 2008 moreover aom can react with inorganic coagulants to form chelate complexes which impairs the coagulation ability of coagulants and consequently increases the coagulant demand to achieve a similar effectiveness takaara et al 2007 current strategies for improving the efficiency of coagulation include preoxidation qi et al 2016 xie et al 2013 oxidants with strong oxidizability can cause the desorption of the organic coatings from the cell surface xie et al 2013 which reduces the cell stability and consequently improves the coagulation efficiency because of the promoted cell aggregation the exfoliated coatings are oxidized to the products with different degrees of hydrophilicity depending on the oxidants used zeng et al 2014 in addition the potent oxidation can cause the reduction in the cell activity facilitating the capture of the cells by coagulants despite the satisfactory performance of preoxidation for coagulation improvement and cost control even in cold climates where coagulation alone may exhibit a reduced reaction rate xiao et al 2009 certain drawbacks must be fully considered notably the rupture of cells caused by potent oxidation inevitably leads to the leakage of iom resulting in increased amounts of toxins and nitrogenous compounds in drinking water given the above the development of environmentally friendly techniques reconciling efficiency security and economy is of great importance ultrasound has great potential to be classified in these techniques because only sound energy is used rajasekhar et al 2012 a large number of minute bubbles dramatically collapse after several cycles of rarefaction and compression under the action of ultrasound acoustic cavitation muthupandian 2011 each collapse is a transient process where the temperature and pressure within the bubble are reported to be as high as 5000 and 100 mpa respectively thus generating multiple forms of mechanical effects shock waves shear forces and microjets and chemical effects free radical oxidation rajasekhar et al 2012 suslick 1990 at present the relatively high energy consumption of ultrasound techniques largely impedes them from being employed in engineering applications fortunately efforts to explore the transducers with better performance e g higher power capacity and lower excitation voltage for more practicable and energy saving are ongoing lin 2007 olabi and grunwald 2008 sunny et al 2012 wang et al 2011 therefore ultrasound can be considered a promising green strategy in project engineering ultrasound has attracted increasing attention for use in environmental applications to control harmful cyanobacteria rajasekhar et al 2012 prior research explored the effectiveness of ultrasound in improving the algal removal by coagulation in terms of algal removal efficiency and the underlying mechanisms huang et al 2020b li et al 2019b in our previous work huang et al 2020b the specific mechanisms of low frequency ultrasound for enhancing the algal removal by coagulation were determined and definitely correlated with certain treatment intensities an enhanced coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells from 44 to 60 67 and 75 was achieved upon the 29 4 khz ultrasonic pretreatment at energy densities of 0 6 1 11 and 2 22 j ml respectively with polymeric aluminum chloride pac of 4 mg al l the work revealed that the low frequency pretreatment at energy density higher than 0 6 j ml can cause the significant reduction in cell activity further increasing energy density to 1 11 j ml can lead to the impairment of cell stability and the aggregation of cells and concluded that a short amount of low frequency pretreatment 0 6 2 22 j ml can effectively enhance the coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells without the undesired leakage of aom in the study of li et al 2019b the effects of high frequency ultrasound on enhancing the turbidity removal by coagulation in algae laden water and the mechanisms were fully investigated under different frequencies and treatment intensities in that study the ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 120 430 740 and 1120 khz and a constant energy density of 5 4 j ml increased the coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells by approximately 7 10 8 and 6 respectively pac 10 mg l moreover the overmuch accumulation of proteins belonging to aom and the excessive production of radicals were found to deteriorate coagulation efficiency thus the authors recommended a mild high frequency pretreatment such as the sonication at 740 khz and 6 j ml despite these advances direct data regarding the security of ultrasound coagulation process remains poorly understood particularly with respect to the formation of dbps during subsequent chlorination and the toxicity of the disinfected effluent therefore the objectives of this study were to elaborate the effects of various ultrasound coagulation scenarios covering different frequencies 29 4 470 and 780 khz and energy densities 1 77 3 42 6 84 and 17 7 j ml on the formation of c dbps and n dbps a huge group of disinfected products with disquieting health risk to humans following chlorination and on the toxicity of the disinfected effluent moreover the contributions of algal cells and aom a mixture of eom and leaked iom to dbp formation were ascertained this study provides new insights and guidance on optimizing ultrasound parameters with consideration of security for the ongoing study of algal removal by ultrasound enhanced coagulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials low frequency and high frequency ultrasonic systems were obtained from the institute of acoustics chinese academy of sciences figure s1 the low frequency ultrasound at 29 4 khz was emitted from a horn type transducer and the high frequency ultrasound at 470

settle for 30 min following a supernatant sample approximately 200 ml taken from 2 cm below the surface was carefully separated from the flocs and used to determine the characteristics of the sample and conduct chlorination experiments under simulated distribution system sds conditions ding et al 2019 specifically an appropriate chlorine demand was predetermined by adding the free chlorine stock solution of a wide concentration range into the sample to achieve a total chlorine residual of 1 0 5 mg l as cl2 after 24 h of disinfection the chlorinated sample was incubated in a 40 ml amber glass bottle in the dark and headspace free state 25 0 5 details regarding the chlorine demands are presented in table s4 following incubation a stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid was immediately added

investigating the toxicity of herbicides pesticides and antibiotics fan et al 2017 liu et al 2009 was performed to evaluate the acute toxicity of the disinfected effluent under various ultrasound coagulation scenarios the preparation procedure is presented in text s1 for the assay 175 Œºl of each sample and 25 Œºl of the bacterial suspension were added to a 96 well standard microplate 8 rows 12 columns of which 36 wells on the boundary were filled with 200 Œºl ultrapure water to avoid edge effects yu et al 2015 the relative light unit rlu of q67 was detected in each well after 15 min of exposure at 25 0 5 using a synergy htx multi mode reader biotek instruments inc vermont usa the parameter luminescence inhibition ratio was calculated using equation 1 in which i 0 and i are the rlu of q67 exposed to ultrapure water and the filtrate respectively to determine the acute toxicity to q67 luminescence inhibition ratio i 0 i i 0 100 1 in accordance with previous research the calculated dbp associated cytotoxicity which has been demonstrated to be additive was calculated by dividing the dbp concentration by its lc50 value chuang and mitch 2017 lau et al 2020 the lc50 value indicates the dosage capable of killing half of the cells chinese hamster ovary cells after 72 h of exposure and the values wagner and plewa 2017 employed in this study are summarized in table s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of various ultrasound coagulation scenarios on coagulation efficiency and aom distribution fig 1 displays the removal of m aeruginosa cells top and doc bottom by ultrasound coagulation process both the turbidity and doc level continuously decreased with increasing pac dosage from 0 to 6 mg al l when the sample was solely coagulated however the removal performance on them was relatively poor for example the residual turbidity at a pac dosage of 6 mg al l was much higher than the effluent turbidity limit reported in the chinese national standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 1 ntu this indicates that coagulation alone does not achieve satisfactory removal efficiency at a commonly used pac dosage 6 mg al l in this study for drinking water treatment which may actually be the case due to the uncertainty and complexity of influent waters as shown in fig 1 variations in the turbidity of the m aeruginosa solution after ultrasonic treatment at various frequencies and energy densities data at 0 mg al l of pac were negligible whereas the doc level exhibited a continuous increase following the frequency order of 29 4 780 and 470 khz and with increasing energy density these results revealed a distinct difference in the actions of low frequency 20 4 khz and high frequency 470 and 780 khz ultrasound on algal cells our previous work found that the 29 4 khz ultrasound at an energy density 1 11 huang et al 2020b and 1 5 j ml huang et al 2020a was capable of damaging m aeruginosa cells suggesting that the increase in the energy density 3 42 j ml in this study of the 29 4 khz ultrasound enlarged the number of cells ruptured and increased the doc level due to the leakage of iom in comparison the doc level increases after the 470 and 780 khz ultrasonic treatments were markedly lower than that after the 29 4 khz ultrasonic treatment prior research generally confirms a conversion of the main behavior of ultrasound from mechanical effects to chemical effects with increasing ultrasound frequency mason et al 2011 tran et al 2014 therefore the temperate increase in the doc level at the two high frequencies resulted mainly from controlled cell rupture of note the 780 khz ultrasound resulted in a higher doc level increase than the 470 khz ultrasound this was ascribed to the relatively significant cell rupture that occurred at the 780 khz frequency as a result of the resonance induced collapse of gas vacuoles inside the cells the abovementioned results were confirmed by cryo sem which allows the legible capture of nanostructures of algal cells while preserving the state of the cells as originally as possible frederik and hubert 2005 fig 2 intuitively presents the integrity of m aeruginosa cells after ultrasonic treatment at various frequencies control 29 4 470 and 780 khz and the maximum energy density 17 7 j ml as illustrated in fig 2 cells that were not ultrasonically treated are spherical in shape with diameters of approximately 3 5 Œºm in comparison severely damaged cells were observed after ultrasonic treatment at 29 4 khz cell fragments and sunken surfaces were clearly observed after high frequency ultrasonic treatments the morphological integrity of the cells remained largely intact despite a small number of cells exhibiting folds on their surface the m aeruginosa solution treated with ultrasound coagulation process showed substantially enhanced turbidity removal at the low pac dosages the residual turbidity at a given pac dosage basically decreased with increasing energy density from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml except for the 29 4 khz ultrasound coagulation at 5 mg al l of pac that showed an inverse trend which was ascribed to the mechanically ruptured cells being unfavorable for coagulation the pac at 5 mg al l achieved satisfactory turbidity removal removal ratio 90 with the assistance of ultrasound even at the lowest energy density 1 77 j ml whereas the coagulation alone had a poor turbidity removal ratio approximately 51 previous studies huang et al 2020b li et al 2019b proposed that the increased cell removal was related to the weakened negative zeta potential and reduced cell activity caused by ultrasound fig 3 shows the variations in the activity and stability of m aeruginosa cells after ultrasonic treatment alone at various frequencies and energy densities the 29 4 khz ultrasound at a given energy density resulted in a significantly reduced activity the 470 and 780 khz ultrasound by contrast led to relatively weak reductions in the activity moreover the stability of algal cells exhibited a decrease followed by an increase at the 29 4 khz ultrasound with increasing energy density from 0 to 6 84 j ml and then to 17 7 j ml the reversion can be explained by that the mechanically ruptured cells with decreased sizes had stronger negative zeta potential due to the increased specific surface area in contrast the 470 and 780 khz ultrasound caused continuous and more efficient reductions in the stability with energy density from 0 to 17 7 j ml it has been demonstrated that potent oxidation can cause the desorption of organic coatings from algal cells xie et al 2013 which is a reason for the weakened negative zeta potential by ultrasound in addition the mechanical effects derived from the collapsing bubbles can cause the physical detachment of the coatings which has been demonstrated in our previous work huang et al 2020a on the other hand doc removal was not effectively improved with the addition of ultrasound even significantly deteriorated at the 29 4 khz ultrasound with the increase of energy density from 3 42 to 17 7 j ml this phenomenon was due to the conspicuously increased doc load resulting from the leakage of iom in contrast the ultrasound coagulation process at frequencies of 470 and 780 khz resulted in slightly improved doc removal when pac dosage was greater than 3 mg al l which was attributed to more efficient coagulation figure s2 enables a holistic understanding of the observed variation in the aom dissolved in water during the ultrasound coagulation process three fluorescence peaks were consistently observed in all samples among which peak a ex em 275 335 nm has been widely regarded as representing protein like substances peaks c ex em 330 405 nm and d ex em 270 440 nm were identified as humic like substances li et al 2019a wen et al 2015 as shown in figure s2 the 29 4 khz ultrasound resulted in the distinct increases of both the protein like and humic like substances compared with the control group panel c vs panel a which further deteriorated the coagulation efficiency of aom panel d vs panel b in contrast there was no obvious difference in the aom components between the high frequency scenarios and the control group panels e and g vs panel a and the coagulation removal of aom was similar panels f and h vs panel b both the doc data fig 1 and feem spectra indicate the limitation of ultrasonic pretreatment for the coagulation removal of aom this result is consistent with previous findings that coagulation and preoxidation enhanced coagulation had poor performance on aom removal ma et al 2006 widrig et al 1996 these observations verified the dramatic mechanical disruption effect of the 29 4 khz ultrasound and highlight the importance of optimizing ultrasound intensity especially low frequency ultrasound intensity for environmentally friendly applications moreover iom is characterized as containing a higher proportion of peptides proteins than eom pivokonsky et al 2006 and its leakage from mechanically ruptured cells theoretically poses a more potent toxic threat due to the increased formation of n dbps with higher cytotoxicity during chlorination fang et al 2010a 2010b 3 2 effects of various ultrasound coagulation scenarios on dbp formation during subsequent chlorination the results reported in the last section showed that the ultrasound coagulation at a pac dosage of 5 mg al l achieved prominent turbidity removal compared to coagulation alone thus the pac dosage was fixed at 5 mg al l to investigate dbp formation following subsequent chlorination fig 4 presents the chlorine demand dbp and tox formation after sds chlorination of the m aeruginosa solution treated under various ultrasound coagulation scenarios the sds chlorination of the raw m aeruginosa solution consumed 810 4 26 7 Œºm 57 5 1 9 mg l chlorine as cl2 and coagulation alone slightly reduced the chlorine demand by 15 to 688 1 40 2 Œºm 48 8 2 8 mg l however the coagulation assisted by ultrasound at frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz and a low energy density of 1 77 j ml significantly decreased the chlorine demand by 75 78 and 77 to 200 9 38 0 Œºm 14 2 2 7 mg l 176 0 24 4 Œºm 12 5 1 7 mg l and 187 2 6 4 Œºm 13 3 0 5 mg l respectively this demonstrates that m aeruginosa cells and iom can vigorously react with chlorine and consume the dominant chlorine a result that is consistent with those of previous studies zhou et al 2014 2015 moreover similar to the doc variations over ultrasound coagulation process as described in the last section increasing energy density aggravated chlorine demand due to the breakage of cells and leakage of iom especially for the 29 4 khz ultrasound whose intensification in intensity from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml obviously increased the chlorine demand by 78 from 200 9 38 0 Œºm 14 2 2 7 mg l to 356 6 18 4 Œºm 25 3 1 3 mg l in comparison the high frequency scenarios had relatively lower and mildly changed chlorine demands owing to the lack of bromide chlorinated dbps were the dominant dbps by weight the concentrations of tcam dcnm and brominated dbps were lower than the detection limits the thm haa and hal were the first three classes of dbps by weight followed by the han and ham the first two classes of n dbps by weight while the hk and hnm had distinctly low concentrations table s7 gives the specific dbp concentrations following chlorination under the various ultrasound coagulation scenarios the chlorination of the raw m aeruginosa solution produced 63 5 3 2 Œºm tox as cl 1180 5 92 1

and dbps were attributed to the removal of algal cells and aom which was confirmed by the reduced turbidity doc level and fluorescence intensity with the addition of ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz and a low energy density of 1 77 j ml the aggregate dbp concentration further decreased by 59 60 and 61 from 1550 6 81 9 nm coagulation alone to 633 8 10 7 nm 626 1 9 6 nm and 601 7 39 5 nm respectively and tox concentration presented a similar behavior this result indicates that dbp precursors were effectively removed by ultrasound enhanced coagulation however the dbp formation under the three frequency scenarios exhibited different trends with increasing energy density from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml low frequency ultrasound at 29 4 khz dramatically enhanced aggregate dbp and tox formation with the concentrations of each increasing from 633 8 10 7 nm and 8 5 0 9 Œºm respectively to 1284 8 11 6 nm and 20 6 0 5 Œºm conversely the effects of energy density on aggregate dbp and tox formation at high frequencies 470 and 780 khz were relatively inconspicuous this was mainly due to the more residual cells and severe iom leakage at the low frequency that inevitably aggravated chlorination considering the diameter of the algal cells approximately 3 5 Œºm fig 2 the 0 22 Œºm filters were capable of effectively separating the aom a mixture of eom and leaked iom from the cells the samples that were and were not filtered by 0 22 Œºm filters consisted of the aom alone and both the cells and aom i e the m aeruginosa solution respectively this method has also been adopted in previous studies to differentiate algal cells and aom fang et al 2010b li et al 2020 fig 5 presents the chlorine demand dbp and tox formation after chlorination of m aeruginosa solution and corresponding aom respectively the three ultrasound coagulation scenarios were all fixed at the highest energy density 17 7 j ml as shown in fig 5 compared with the unfiltered sample the filtered sample had a substantially lower chlorine demand and showed reduced dbp and tox concentrations the chlorine demand aggregate dbp and tox concentrations following chlorination of the aom in the raw m aeruginosa solution were 287 7 31 9 Œºm 1047 5 46 7 nm and 24 8 2 4 Œºm respectively and accounted for 36 of the chlorine demand 810 4 26 7 Œºm 36 of the aggregate dbp concentration 2948 2 86 7 Œºm and 39 of the tox concentration 63 5 3 2 Œºm following chlorination of the raw m aeruginosa solution thus the contribution of the algal cells to dbp and tox formation was greater than that of the aom the chlorine demand aggregate dbp and tox concentrations of the chlorinated aom sample under coagulation alone were lower than those under the 29 4 khz ultrasound coagulation but higher than those under the 470 and 780 khz ultrasound coagulation which is consistent with the variations of residual doc level as shown in fig 1 bottom of note the decreases in specific dbp concentrations by filtration varied and the reduction of the n dbps was higher than that of the c dbps for example the concentration of aggregate n dbps the sum of dcan tcan tcnm and dcam was reduced by 73 from 387 3 17 3 nm to 103 8 6 5 nm but the concentration of aggregate c dbps the sum of tcm dcaa tcaa dcal tcal and tck was reduced by 63 from 2560 9 103 9 nm to 943 7 50 7 nm with filtration of the raw m aeruginosa solution this phenomenon can be explained by the iom in algal cells being rich in nitrogen containing organic compounds including amino acids peptides proteins and organic amines which are important precursors for n dbps bond et al 2012 yang et al 2010 moreover the remarkably increased fluorescence intensity of peak a protein like substances resulting from the leakage of iom from cells figure s2c vs figure s2a also supported this phenomenon this demonstrates that iom was a more dominant n dbp precursor than eom which is consistent with those reported in previous studies fang et al 2010b zhou et al 2015 although coagulation decreased the chlorine demand aggregate dbp and tox concentrations of the chlorinated raw m aeruginosa solution by 15 47 and 52 respectively to 688 1 40 2 Œºm 1550 6 81 9 Œºm and 30 3 3 4 Œºm it did not lead to distinct changes in the ratios of the chlorine demand 36 and 27 before and after coagulation respectively aggregate dbp concentration 36 and 27 and tox concentration 39 and 30 following chlorination of the aom to those following chlorination of the corresponding m aeruginosa solution in contrast the ultrasonic pretreatment at the three frequencies significantly altered the contributions of the algal cells and aom to chlorine demand and dbp and tox formation the ratios of the chlorine demand aggregate dbp concentration and tox concentration following chlorination of the aom including the eom and leaked iom to those following chlorination of the corresponding m aeruginosa solution increased to 62 63 58 72 and 64 84 respectively the increased contribution of aom to the three ratios was attributed to the highly reduced cells by ultrasound enhanced coagulation with cell participation in chlorination being dramatically reduced furthermore the three ratios at 29 4 khz were comparatively lower than those at 470 and 780 khz which was due to the relatively low turbidity and doc removal effects at 29 4 khz ultrasound coagulation scenario with energy densities of 3 42 17 7 j ml fig 1 in conclusion the enhanced mitigation of dbp precursors upon ultrasound coagulation process was mainly attributed to the enhanced removal of algal cells 3 3 effects of various ultrasound coagulation scenarios on the acute toxicity and calculated dbp associated toxicity of the chlorinated effluent fig 6 shows the luminescence inhibition effect top and calculated dbp associated cytotoxicity bottom of the chlorinated effluent under various ultrasound coagulation scenarios the results indicated a potent luminescence inhibition effect of the chlorinated m aeruginosa solution irrespective of whether the solution was treated with coagulation alone or not in contrast the m aeruginosa solution treated with the 29 4 470 and 780 khz ultrasound coagulation at a low energy density of 1 77 j ml showed significantly reduced luminescence inhibition ratios with values of 33 30 and 39 respectively this indicates that ultrasonic pretreatment significantly decreased the acute toxicity of the chlorinated effluent when the energy density was increased from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml the luminescence inhibition ratio at 29 4 khz increased from 33 to 88 while the luminescence inhibition ratios at 470 and 780 khz remained relatively stable this observation is consistent with the variations in chlorine demand and aggregate dbp and tox concentrations although the thm and haa were the dominant classes of dbps by molar weight they only accounted for a slight proportion of the total dbp associated cytotoxicity 2 due to their weaker toxic potency wagner and plewa 2017 the hal and han were the main contributors to dbp associated cytotoxicity and accounted for more than 90 of the total calculated cytotoxicity the first and second highest dbp associated cytotoxicities were 1 3 10 2 and 9 2 10 3 respectively observed from the chlorinated raw m aeruginosa solution without and with coagulation treatment the dbp associated cytotoxicity of the sample treated with ultrasound coagulation was substantially lower than that of the sample treated with coagulation alone indicating that ultrasound did play a conclusive role in reducing dbp associated cytotoxicity 4 conclusions in this study the effects of various combinations of ultrasound frequency and ultrasound energy density on the ultrasound coagulation process with respect to the removal of algal cells mitigation of dbp formation and abatement of toxicity were investigated the addition of an ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz substantially enhanced the removal of m aeruginosa cells by coagulation e g from 51 to 87 96 at a pac dosage of 5 mg al l however the doc removal showed an inconspicuous improvement and even deteriorated at the low frequency ultrasound 29 4 khz 3 42 j ml due to the increased doc load resulting from the leakage of iom both algal cells and aom were important dbp precursors among which the cells saliently contributed to dbp formation owing to the improved removal of algal cells by ultrasound enhanced coagulation the chlorine demand aggregate dbp and tox concentrations following subsequent chlorination further decreased by 48 74 17 61 and 32 77 respectively of note the comparatively lower decreases occurred at the 29 4 khz ultrasound with energy densities of 3 42 17 7 j ml which were attributed to the more residual cells and aom after coagulation the acute toxicity and calculated dbp associated toxicity of the chlorinated effluent under ultrasound coagulation scenarios can achieve effective reductions of 70 and 68 respectively compared with the toxicities under coagulation alone this study showed that ultrasound is a promising coagulation pretreatment method to potently remove algal cells and the dbp formation as well as toxicity of the chlorinated effluent can be effectively controlled declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

0 01 and could be considered as an indicator of as dewaterability compared with raw as conditioning led to the occurrence of the denser protein structure in tb eps and the looser one in slime the contact number between ala and water decreased in tb eps and increased in slime which indicated that the migration of water adhered in tb eps to outer layer at the dg mc and ec process while the looser protein structure in tb eps and the denser one in slime occurred as well as higher contact number between ala and water in tb eps than that in slime which indicated that more water flowed

excessive activated sludge as in the wastewater treatment plants wwtp has increased significantly eshtiaghi et al 2013 each year about 10 and 14 million tons of dried excessive as have been produced in usa and china respectively zhou et al 2014 this excessive as has become one of the challenges of wwtp in general as management accounts for up to 50 60 of total operating expense in wwtp ruiz hernando et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to pursue the feasible conditioning approaches improve as dewaterability reduce its volume and management cost advanced oxidation processes aops based on the sulfate radicals so 4 have received widespread attention in the field of sludge conditioning due to their advantages of high stability wide ph range and low cost li et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2018 zhen et al 2018 according to previous studies peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms could be activated by heat electron microwave and transition metals e g fe2 co2 etc to produce so 4 fan et al 2020 kim et al 2016 li et al 2018b moreover pms with the asymmetric structure could be more easily activated by transition metals fan et al 2020 guan et al 2013 li et al 2018a although fe2 is generally considered to be the most suitable activator with environmentally friendly nature and cost effectiveness arslan alaton et al 2017 diao et al 2020 2016 the reaction between dissolved fe2 and persulfate pms is too fast to control excessive fe2 will react with so 4 in a short time then so 4 utilization decreases and the cost increases sharply han et al 2015 wang et

addition zero valent iron was also used to activate pms for sludge conditioning diao et al 2018 xiao et al 2020 while an unstable sludge conditioning effect occurred fan et al 2020 li et al 2018a because zvi was easily covered by the passivation film of iron oxide and iron hydroxide liu et al 2020 recently siderite feco3 a natural mineral and heterogeneous catalyst has attracted attention which could slowly release fe2 and significantly increase the oxidation potential of persulfate teel et al 2011 feng et al 2018 found that compared with fe2 pms and nano magnetite pms conditioning methods siderite pms could more effectively degrade phenol in common water components with the degradation rate of 100 siderite catalyzed hydrogen peroxide and persulfate process was used to treat trichloroethylene tce in groundwater the removal rate of tce could reach 100 within 24 h yan et al 2015 although several advancements on the application of siderite activated persulfate or pms in wastewater treatment have been achieved the reports of the usage in the field of sludge conditioning are still limited thus it was necessary to further explore the effect of siderite pms on as conditioning as conditioning helps to improve the dewaterability then dewatering treatment is another important procedure for its volume reduction at current electro osmotic dewatering technology was one of the most effective dewatering methods it could induce the release of interstitial and some of the vicinal water in sludge conrardy et al 2016 feng et al 2014 mahmoud et al 2011 2013 2016 2018 tuan et al 2008 while pressure dewatering could not most previous studies indicated that the combination of flocculation conditioning and pressurized vertical electro osmotic dewatering peod technology could reduce the water content wc in as to 50 65 lee et al 2002 mahmoud et al 2018 visigalli et al 2017 both conditioning methods and peod process contributed to the solubilization and or degradation of eps which was conducive to sludge dewatering it is well known that eps is one of the critical determinants of affecting sludge dewatering analyzing the relationship between eps and dewatering performance from the perspective of different fractions slime lb eps tb eps yang and li 2009 yu et al 2008 and composition yu et al 2008 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 eps had always been the focus of aops conditioning mechanism in recent years the specific eps molecular structure had become a new hot spot to reveal the mechanism of sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 indicated that Œ± helix was a key protein secondary structure that inhibited the interstitial water removal in waste activated sludge in the report of zhang et al 2019 several types of protein secondary structure inside eps were related to sludge dewaterability for instance the cst and bound water content were correlated with aggregated strands random coil and Œ≤ turn percentages in slime r 2 0 82 p 0 05 which were also related to aggregated strands Œ≤ sheet and Œ≤ turn in tb eps r 2 0 78 p 0 05 furthermore zhu et al 2020 confirmed that the amino acids of tryptophane trp and lysine lys in eps proteinaceous compounds played an important role in sludge dewatering performance on the basis of above progress it was attractive to explore the effect of amino acids in different eps layers on sludge dewaterability during the aops conditioning process in this study siderite activated pms to generate radicals such as so 4 and ho for as conditioning and then peod technology was used to dewater conditioned as the objectives of the present study were to 1 determine the feasibility of siderite pms conditioning peod process in as volume reduction 2 unravel the conditioning and dewatering mechanisms along the siderite pms conditioning peod process 3 identify the roles of protein secondary structure and amino acids in as dewaterability 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals

moisture was measured at the same time text s2 described the detection methods of bwc and fwc 2 3 3 free radical detection the electron paramagnetic resonance epr technique was used to detect and identify free radicals and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo was selected as the spin trapping agent according to the method of gao et al 2021 the corresponding epr operational parameters were determined 2 3 4 as morphology the morphology of as was analyzed by scanning electron microscope quanta 200 fei usa before sem observation the samples were vacuum lyophilized at 60 c for 72 h and then sputter coated with gold 2 3 5 sludge bacterial viability analysis the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen usa was used to reliably and quantitatively distinguish viable and dead

transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and protein secondary structures analysis different eps layer samples were treated with lyophilized under vacuum at 60 c for 72 h and then the major functional groups of the samples were analyzed by a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy bruker germany with a wavelength of 4000 400 cm 1 in accordance with the method of zhang et al 2019 the amide i region of the protein spectra at 1700 1600 cm 1 was analyzed by the second derivative analysis and curve fitting program to extract information about the secondary structure of the protein 2 4 molecular dynamics md simulation analysis the amino acid composition of different eps layers in the whole process was analyzed by an automatic amino acid analyzer hitachi co japan hou et al 2015 at

centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through 0 22 Œºm acetate cellulose membranes the filtrate was used for the determination of amino acid content 15 systems 5 systems for each eps layer were proposed to be calculated and two types of contact numbers were used to characterize the binding ability of amino acid molecules one was the number of contacts within

statistically significant only if the confidence interval was within 95 p 0 05 all data in this study were obtained by taking the average value of two corresponding parallel samples with an analysis if the data was abnormal multiple measurements will be performed on each sample to ensure the accuracy of the experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge dewatering performance 3 1 1 siderite pms conditioning dosage optimization the single factor pre experiment was used to preliminarily determine dosage range of conditioners as indicated in text s6 and fig s2 the corresponding ranges for siderite and pms were 0 05 0 15 g gtss 0 10 0 30 g gtss respectively afterwards the response surface methodology rsm was employed to optimize the dosages of the siderite and pms table 2 presented 20 groups of experiments according to central composite design ccd siderite dosage pms dosage and voltage were regarded as independent variables and denoted as x 1 x 2 and x 3 respectively the wc of the siderite pms conditioning hed process treated as and the energy consumption of hed were considered as responses y 1 and y 2 respectively through design expert 8 0 minimizing the wc and energy consumption were regarded as the optimization goal the fitted second order polynomial eqs 1 and 2 were following 1 y 1 93 72604 5 36659 x 1 25 67174 x 2 0 21608 x 3 34 45000 x 1 x 2 5 00000 e

g g tss respectively and the corresponding wc of dewatered as reached 85 78 3 1 2 siderite pms conditioning peod process optimization in order to further evaluate the effect of sludge dewatering this study proposes a siderite pms conditioning peod process as indicated in the text s7 1 l as was selected for testing and the parameters of siderite pms conditioning peod process were optimized by rsm according to the experiments designed by the ccd in table 3 x 1 and x 2 represented two independent variables of mechanical pressure and voltage the wc of the siderite pms conditioning peod process treated as and the energy consumption of peod were used as responses y 1 and y 2 respectively after data fitting the liner eqs 3 and 4 were obtained as follows 3 y 1 83 68107 0 029189 x 1 0 53357 x 2 4 y 2 0 026746 1 60561 e 005 x 1 5 29434 e 003 x 2 the corresponding results of the anova were presented in table s4 and s5 p values less than 0 05 indicated that the models were significant at the optimum operating parameters of 600 kpa mechanical pressure and 20 v voltage the corresponding wc and energy consumption could reach 58 02 and 0 08790 kwh kg water removed respectively which were lower than most studies using peod process table s6 as observed in sem image of as samples floc rupture and cell debris occurred after the siderite pms conditioning peod treatment these implied this process can disintegrate the eps flocs and microbial cells in as text s8 the particle size of as changed slightly before and after conditioning which indicated that in situ fe iii generated through siderite pms oxidation led to flocculation of broken flocs and partially counteracted the disruption of as by oxidation at the same time the corresponding zeta potential increased from 15 00 0 62 mv of raw as to 5 57 0 91 mv of conditioned as which implied fe iii neutralized part of the negative charges on the sludge surface text s9 3 1 3 water distribution variation the variations of free water content fwc and bwc were shown in fig 1 the bwc of the raw as and siderite pms conditioned as were 11 53 0 23 g g ds and 8 62 0 01 g g ds respectively the bwc reduction rate of conditioned as reached 25 23 dg removed 97 46 of free water while the bwc of as decreased slightly at the end of ec stage the reduction rate of fwc and bwc increased to 98 64 and 91 76 in comparison with raw as respectively this change may be caused by the synergistic effects of ohmic heating and electroosmosis which resulted in the displacement of a large number of water molecules and the movement of solid particles as well as the reduction of viscosity in dewatered as mahmoud et al 2011 2016 in the previous studies magnetic micro particle conditioning pressurized vertical electro osmotic dewatering process guo et al 2018 removed 99 67 fwc and 82 97 bwc respectively and cpam conditioning peod treatment feng et al 2014 removed 93 4 fwc and 88 4 bwc respectively therefore the siderite pms peod process had a better effect on bwc reduction 3 2 radicals identification and sludge cell viability changes fig 2 presented the epr spectra obtained from the dmpo experiments at different time intervals of the conditioning reaction with siderite pms in deionized water the results were consistent with reaction eqs 5 and 6 which indicated that siderite activating pms could produce ho and so 4 after 30 min reaction the signal peak intensity of dmpo so 4 adduct slightly increased while the signal peak intensity of dmpoho adduct significantly increased some generated so 4 radicals converted into ho ones according to eq 6 this confirmed that siderite could release enough fe2 to react with pms and yield free radicals within 30 min which was consistent with the study of feng et al 2018 5 f e 2 hs o 5 f e 3 s o 4 o h 6 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 ho h the changes in cell viability and clsm images at different stages along siderite pms conditioning peod process were shown in fig 3 and fig s5 respectively in raw as 37 34 3 38 cells died siderite pms conditioning and ec treatment resulted in the increase of dead cells fractions by 15 40 and 33 72 respectively the ho and so 4 generated from siderite pms oxidation system can attack the surface of as cells and lead to the disruption of cells feng et al 2018 yu et al 2019 however ec treatment caused electrolysis and thermal decomposition in the sludge cake which led to the imbalance of osmotic pressure in more as cells and cell rupture guo et al 2018 even to cell death in addition the ph value of the mixed sludge after ec treatment decreased which may be caused by the physicochemical reactions happening on the electrode guo et al 2018 and the outmigration of oh anions near the cathode with filtrate acidic ph also caused protein denaturation and cell membranes damage zhang et al 2021 3 3 eps components and typical proteinaceous compounds 3 3 1 ftir spectra and protein secondary structure analysis text s10 described the changes of toc and scod in supernatant filtrate along siderite pms conditioning peod process text s11 showed the distributions of toc pn ps and ha in different eps layers along siderite pms conditioning peod process ftir technology further analyzed the composition and functional groups of sludge eps the corresponding spectra and the detailed results of band assignments were provided in fig s8 and table s7 respectively the ftir spectra description was also showed in text s12 the amide i region of spectra 1700 1600 cm 1 were further resolved into protein secondary structure peaks through the second derivative analysis and curve fitting program so as to obtain the subtle differences the fitted peaks and the changes of protein secondary structure in different eps layers along siderite pms conditioning peod process were shown in fig s9 and table 4 respectively the value of Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil was use to express the compactness of protein structure hou et al 2015 the smaller values the looser structure as shown in table 4 after siderite pms conditioning the Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values decreased from 0 176 of raw as to 0 090 in slime while it increased from 0 425 of raw as to 0 691 in tb eps the oxidation of radicals led to the appearance of the tighter protein structure in tb eps and the looser protein structure in slime which was conducive to the decrease of bound water content zhang et al 2019 at dg stage the Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values in slime and tb eps were 1 165 and 0 914 respectively the protein molecular structure became denser after water in as flowed out and the sludge cake was compressed by dg treatment several hours mechanical pressure treatment could cause the hydrolytic acidification of organic matters in sludge and a ph decrease li et al 2016 thereby protein denaturation and the decrease of Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values in slime and tb eps happened at ec stage the Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values in slime and tb eps decreased to 0 519 and 0 470 respectively maybe the electrolysis and thermal decomposition led to the protein denaturation and the loose protein structure in slime and tb eps at dg mc and ec stages the Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values in slime were higher than those in tb eps this result indicated that protein structure in slime presented more compact than that in tb eps along the dewatering stages and more water flowed outsider of slime than tb eps 3 3 2 amino acids amino acids were main components of proteins and by products of protein decomposition after sludge oxidation treatment hou et al 2015 20 kinds of amino acids were detected of which 8 kinds of hydrophilic amino acids and 7 kinds of hydrophobic amino acids were identified fig s10 and the concentrations of 3 kinds of amino acids asn gln and trp were below the detection limit the changes of main amino acid in different eps layers were shown in fig s11 in raw as the main amino acids were asp glu gly lys ala leu and pro after siderite pms conditioning in slime the proportions of hydrophilic amino acids glu and lys decreased while gly and asp increased and the proportion of total hydrophobic amino acids increased by 4 56 in tb eps the proportions of most hydrophilic amino acids such as glu gly asp lys etc changed slightly but the proportions of hydrophobic amino acids of ala and pro increased which led to the proportion of total hydrophobic amino acids increased by 6 90 the above changes indicated that siderite pms conditioning approach can improve the hydrophobicity of eps at mc and ec stages due to the migration of proteins proteins with high content of hydrophilic amino acid lys were easier to migrate outward with the outflow of water than proteins with high content of hydrophobic amino acid ala therefore the proportion of ala increased while the proportion of lys decreased in all eps layers these changes led to the decrease of the binding capacity between above amino acids and water which may be beneficial to improve sludge dewaterability based on the above data analysis it was found that ala and lys may be important amino acids that affect the hydrophobicity or hydrophobicity of eps therefore it was proposed to use the ratio of ala to lys ala lys to represent the damage degree of water holding capacity of protein table 5 showed the changes of ala lys values in different eps layers along the siderite pms conditioning peod process compared with raw as the ala lys values increased in slime and tb eps after siderite pms conditioning which indicated that this oxidation method can effectively destroy the protein stability in as and release the moisture of protein in slime and tb eps after mc and ec treatment the ala lys values of each eps layers stabilized at 3 00 3 50 the protein in eps were highly destroyed and its water holding capacity was weakened which may cause the release of a large amount of free water and bound water in eps 3 4 correlation between typical amino acids and as dewaterability table 6 showed the pearson correlations between amino acids and bwc or wc in as the proportion of ala showed negative correlations with bwc or wc in slime r bwc 2 0 793 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 809 p 0 01 and tb eps r bwc 2 0 688 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 630 p 0 05 while the hydrophilic amino acids lys showed a strong positive correlation with bwc or wc in slime r bwc 2 0 760 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 690 p 0 05 and tb eps r bwc 2 0 592 p 0 05 r wc 2 0 652 p 0 01 moreover ala lys also showed strong negative correlations with bwc or wc in slime r bwc 2 0 803 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 771 p 0 01 and tb eps r bwc 2 0 693 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 705 p 0 01 therefore it could be inferred that the improvement of sludge dewaterability after siderite pms conditioning peod process might be related to the changes of ala and lys 3 5 number of molecular contacts number of contacts referred to atomic contacts number during the interaction between molecules it was used to characterize the strength of the interaction between two molecules liu et al 2007 the larger values showed the stronger interaction ala was a relatively high content of hydrophobic amino acid in as and it had strong negative correlations with the sludge dewaterability figs 4 and s12 showed the changes in number of contacts between ala water in the same eps layer and ala other major amino acids in different eps layers along the siderite pms conditioning peod process where the former values were higher than the latter and this implied that ala contact with water preferentially text s13 fig 5 provided diagrams of the interaction between ala and water as shown in fig 4 siderite pms conditioning method led to the number of contacts in lb eps and tb eps decreased significantly while it increased in slime this phenomenon implied that water migrated outside from inner eps and the sludge dewaterability increased meantime the binding sites of ala and water in slime transferred from the backbone ch of raw as to the side chain nh cooh fig 5 a the binding sites between ala and water increased accordingly these changes might improve the binding capacity between ala and water molecules in slime liu et al 2007 with the progress of dewatering process the number of contact gradually decreased in all eps layers these changes implied that large amount of water was gradually removed 3 6 environmental implication in practical applications the poor effect of sludge dewatering will bring a great burden to the sludge treatment and disposal of wwtps this study proposed the siderite pms conditioning method which can effectively crack the sludge cells and eps then be conducive to the sludge dewaterability improvement at the same time siderite is a cheap natural mineral and heterogeneous catalyst at a low dosage of siderite pms can be activated and release enough free radicals to oxidize as cells in addition the siderite pms conditioning method combined with the peod technology can reduce the wc of as to 58 02 therefore this conditioning method has a good application prospect in the field of sludge treatment in the future over the past decades eps has been considered as one of the most critical factors affecting as dewatering performance most of studies have focused on the composition and characteristics of eps and their correlation with as dewaterability based on the analysis results of the protein secondary structure and amino acid composition this study proposed to analyze the water binding mechanism from the molecular level of the extracellular proteins in different eps layers this was undoubtedly a new idea to explore the role of eps in sludge dewatering performance from the results of protein secondary structure the compactness of protein structure changes during conditioning and dewatering process these changes were closely related to the interaction between amino acids and water to describe specifically after siderite pms conditioning the contact number of ala and water increased in slime while that of tb eps decreased the corresponding interactions between ala and water increased in slime and decreased in tb eps which implied the migration of water adhered in tb eps to outer layer these changes also led to the occurrence of the tighter protein structure in tb eps and the looser protein structure in slime at this stage the contact sites between ala and water molecules transferred from the backbone to the side chains in slime leading to the release of water from the inner to outer layer at the dg mc and ec stages a large amount of water was released and the interactions between ala and water continually weakened however the contact number of tb eps was higher than that of slime which indicated that more water flowed outsider of slime than tb eps meantime these changes led to a denser protein structure in slime than tb eps from the above analysis this study explored the sludge dewatering process and mechanism from the molecular level of the extracellular proteins in different eps layers the correlation between amino acids and sludge dewaterability showed that the affinity of protein and water molecules depended on the content of the hydrophobic amino acid ala and the hydrophilic amino acid lys for practical applications the improvement of ala content was the key to change the hydrophobic properties of eps in the future we can further explore the process and mechanism of sludge dewatering from the perspective of protein molecules the addition of siderite pms has some influence on sludge quality first this method will cause mineral residues in sludge however siderite is safe mineral it can slowly release fe2 to adjust the ion content of the sludge system secondly the siderite pms reaction will increase the conductivity of the sludge from 0 8ms cm of raw as to 5 5ms cm however the conductivity of dewatered sludge with siderite pms conditioning peod process was 1 7 ms cm in general the conductivity of composted sludge was 2 9 5 0 ms cm ruggieri et al 2008 dewatered sludge with low conductivity 8 0 ms cm could be directly used for composting gao et al 2010 and agricultural reuse nafez et al 2015 at the same time the siderite pms conditioning method has better effect on sludge dewatering than some aops based on siderite activating other chemicals to produce so4 and ho 4 conclusion this study explored the performance and mechanism of the siderite pms conditioning peod process on as reduction the reaction of siderite and pms can generate free radical to oxidize sludge a large number of sludge cells were cracked and the ratio of dead cells increased at this stage after the siderite pms conditioning peod treatment the wc of the sludge decreased from 98 12 in raw as to 58 02 based on the changes of amino acid composition and protein secondary structure in different eps layers of as both the increase of hydrophobic amino acid ala and the decrease of hydrophilic amino acid lys in slime and tb eps were beneficial for sludge dewaterability improvement compared with raw as siderite pms conditioning led to a denser structure of proteins in tb eps and a looser structure of protein in slime respectively while along the subsequent dewatering stages the proteins in tb eps became looser and in slime became more compact respectively this was closely related to the interactions between amino acids and water and also indicated the migration of water adhered in tb eps to outer layer at conditioning stage and more water flow outsider of slime than tb eps at dewatering stages this study suggests that the change of amino acid composition and the compactness of protein secondary structures in eps may affect sludge dewaterability credit authorship contribution statement enrui li writing

16871,in this study the siderite pms conditioning pressurized vertical electro osmotic dewatering peod process was used to reduce the volume of activated sludge as the changes in water content cell extracellular polymeric substances eps distribution protein secondary structures and typical amino acids in eps fractions of as along siderite pms conditioning peod process were investigated results showed that the final water content wc of dewatered as was 58 02 under the rsm optimized conditioning conditions of 0 05 g g tss siderite dosage 0 23 g g tss pms dosage 600 kpa mechanical pressure and 20 v voltage at conditioning and peod stages the bound water content bwc of as decreased by 25 23 and 91 76 respectively the ho and so 4 generated from siderite activating pms could lead to the

0 01 and could be considered as an indicator of as dewaterability compared with raw as conditioning led to the occurrence of the denser protein structure in tb eps and the looser one in slime the contact number between ala and water decreased in tb eps and increased in slime which indicated that the migration of water adhered in tb eps to outer layer at the dg mc and ec process while the looser protein structure in tb eps and the denser one in slime occurred as well as higher contact number between ala and water in tb eps than that in slime which indicated that more water flowed outsider of slime than tb eps this implied that the variations of the compactness of protein secondary structures and the contact number between ala and water in eps layers correlated with as

excessive activated sludge as in the wastewater treatment plants wwtp has increased significantly eshtiaghi et al 2013 each year about 10 and 14 million tons of dried excessive as have been produced in usa and china respectively zhou et al 2014 this excessive as has become one of the challenges of wwtp in general as management accounts for up to 50 60 of total operating expense in wwtp ruiz hernando et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to pursue the feasible conditioning approaches improve as dewaterability reduce its volume and management cost advanced oxidation processes aops based on the sulfate radicals so 4 have received widespread attention in the field of sludge conditioning due to their advantages of high stability wide ph range and low cost li et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2018 zhen et al 2018 according to previous studies peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms could be activated by heat electron microwave and transition metals e g fe2 co2

2018a although fe2 is generally considered to be the most suitable activator with environmentally friendly nature and cost effectiveness arslan alaton et al 2017 diao et al 2020 2016 the reaction between dissolved fe2 and persulfate pms is too fast to control excessive fe2 will react with so 4 in a short time then so 4 utilization decreases and the cost increases sharply han et al 2015 wang et

addition zero valent iron was also used to activate pms for sludge conditioning diao et al 2018 xiao et al 2020 while an unstable sludge conditioning effect occurred fan et al 2020 li et al 2018a because zvi was easily covered by the passivation film of iron oxide and iron hydroxide liu et al 2020 recently siderite feco3 a natural mineral and heterogeneous catalyst has attracted attention which could slowly release fe2 and significantly increase the oxidation potential of persulfate teel et al 2011 feng et al 2018 found that compared with fe2 pms and nano magnetite pms conditioning methods siderite pms could more effectively degrade phenol in common water components with the degradation rate of 100 siderite catalyzed hydrogen peroxide and persulfate process was used to treat trichloroethylene tce in groundwater the removal rate of tce could reach 100 within 24 h yan et al 2015 although several advancements on the application of siderite activated persulfate or pms in wastewater treatment have been achieved the reports of the usage in the field of sludge conditioning are still limited thus it was necessary to further explore the effect of siderite pms on as conditioning as conditioning helps to improve the dewaterability then dewatering treatment is another important procedure for its volume reduction at current electro osmotic dewatering technology was one of the most effective dewatering methods it could induce the release of interstitial and some of the vicinal water in sludge conrardy et al 2016 feng et al 2014 mahmoud et al 2011 2013 2016 2018 tuan et al 2008 while pressure dewatering could not most previous studies indicated that the combination of flocculation conditioning and pressurized vertical electro osmotic dewatering peod technology could reduce the water content wc in as to 50 65 lee et al 2002 mahmoud et al 2018 visigalli et al 2017 both conditioning methods and peod process contributed to the solubilization and or degradation of eps which was conducive to sludge dewatering it is well known that eps is one of the critical determinants of affecting sludge dewatering analyzing the relationship between eps and dewatering performance from the perspective of different fractions slime lb eps tb eps yang and li 2009 yu et al 2008 and composition yu et al 2008 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 eps had always been the focus of aops conditioning mechanism in recent years the specific eps molecular structure had become a new hot spot to reveal the mechanism of sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017 indicated that Œ± helix was a key protein secondary structure that inhibited the interstitial water removal in waste activated sludge in the report of zhang et al 2019 several types of protein secondary structure inside eps were related to sludge dewaterability for instance the cst and bound water content were correlated with aggregated strands random coil and Œ≤ turn percentages in slime r 2 0 82 p 0 05 which were also related to aggregated strands Œ≤ sheet and Œ≤ turn in tb eps r 2 0 78 p 0 05 furthermore zhu et al 2020 confirmed that the amino acids of tryptophane trp and lysine lys in eps proteinaceous compounds played an important role in sludge dewatering performance on the basis of above progress it was attractive to explore the effect of amino acids in different eps layers on sludge dewaterability during the aops conditioning process in this study siderite activated pms to generate radicals such as so 4 and ho for as conditioning and then peod technology was used to dewater conditioned as the objectives of the present study were to 1 determine the feasibility of siderite pms conditioning peod process in as volume reduction 2 unravel the conditioning and dewatering mechanisms along the siderite pms conditioning peod process 3 identify the roles of protein secondary structure and amino acids in as dewaterability 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals

international ltd uk the srf of as was used to assess the dewaterability which can be measured and calculated according to the method of niu et al 2013 according to the method of li et al 2018a the moisture was measured at the same time text s2 described the detection methods of bwc and fwc 2 3 3 free radical detection the electron paramagnetic resonance epr technique was used to detect and identify free radicals and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo was selected as the spin trapping agent according to the method of gao et al 2021 the corresponding epr operational parameters were determined 2 3 4 as morphology the morphology of as was analyzed by scanning electron microscope quanta 200 fei usa before sem observation the samples were vacuum lyophilized at 60 c for 72 h and then

transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and protein secondary structures analysis different eps layer samples were treated with lyophilized under vacuum at 60 c for 72 h and then the major functional groups of the samples were analyzed by a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy bruker germany with a wavelength of 4000 400 cm 1 in accordance with the method of zhang et al 2019 the amide i region of the protein spectra at 1700 1600 cm 1 was analyzed by the second derivative analysis and curve fitting program to extract information about the secondary structure of the protein 2 4 molecular dynamics md simulation analysis the amino acid composition of different eps layers in the whole process was analyzed by an automatic amino acid analyzer hitachi co japan hou et al 2015 at

centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through 0 22 Œºm acetate cellulose membranes the filtrate was used for the determination of amino acid content 15 systems 5 systems for each eps layer were proposed to be calculated and two types of contact numbers were used to characterize the binding ability of amino acid molecules one was the number of contacts within

statistically significant only if the confidence interval was within 95 p 0 05 all data in this study were obtained by taking the average value of two corresponding parallel samples with an analysis if the data was abnormal multiple measurements will be performed on each sample to ensure the accuracy of the experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge dewatering performance 3 1 1 siderite pms conditioning dosage optimization the single factor pre experiment was used to preliminarily determine dosage range of conditioners as indicated in text s6 and fig s2 the corresponding ranges for siderite and pms were 0 05 0 15 g gtss 0 10 0 30 g gtss respectively afterwards the response surface methodology rsm was employed to optimize the dosages of the siderite and pms table 2 presented 20 groups of experiments according to central composite design ccd siderite dosage pms dosage and voltage were regarded as independent variables and denoted as x 1 x 2 and x 3 respectively the wc of the siderite pms conditioning hed process treated as and the energy consumption of hed were considered as responses y 1 and y 2 respectively through design expert 8 0 minimizing the wc and energy consumption were regarded as the optimization goal the fitted second order polynomial eqs 1 and 2 were following 1 y 1 93 72604 5 36659 x 1 25 67174 x 2 0 21608 x 3 34 45000 x 1 x 2 5 00000 e

g g tss respectively and the corresponding wc of dewatered as reached 85 78 3 1 2 siderite pms conditioning peod process optimization in order to further evaluate the effect of sludge dewatering this study proposes a siderite pms conditioning peod process as indicated in the text s7 1 l as was selected for testing and the parameters of siderite pms conditioning peod process were optimized by rsm according to the experiments designed by the ccd in table 3 x 1 and x 2 represented two independent variables of mechanical pressure and voltage the wc of the siderite pms conditioning peod process treated as and the energy consumption of peod were used as responses y 1 and y 2 respectively after data fitting the liner eqs 3 and 4 were obtained as follows 3 y 1 83 68107 0 029189 x 1 0 53357 x 2 4 y 2 0 026746 1 60561 e 005 x 1 5 29434 e 003 x 2 the corresponding results of the anova were presented in table s4 and s5 p values less than 0 05 indicated that the models were significant at the optimum operating parameters of 600 kpa mechanical pressure and 20 v voltage the corresponding wc and energy consumption could reach 58 02 and 0 08790 kwh kg water removed respectively which were lower than most studies using peod process table s6 as observed in sem image of as samples floc rupture and cell debris occurred after the siderite pms conditioning peod treatment these implied this process can disintegrate the eps flocs and microbial cells in as text s8 the particle size of as changed slightly before and after conditioning which indicated that in situ fe iii generated through siderite pms oxidation led to flocculation of broken flocs and partially counteracted the disruption of as by oxidation at the same time the corresponding zeta potential increased from 15 00 0 62 mv of raw as to 5 57 0 91 mv of conditioned as which implied fe iii neutralized part of the negative charges on the sludge surface text s9 3 1 3 water distribution variation the variations of free water content fwc and bwc were shown in fig 1 the bwc of the raw as and siderite pms conditioned as were 11 53 0 23 g g ds and 8 62 0 01 g g ds respectively the bwc reduction rate of conditioned as reached 25 23 dg removed 97 46 of free water while the bwc of as decreased slightly at the end of ec stage the reduction rate of fwc and bwc increased to 98 64 and 91 76 in comparison with raw as respectively this change may be caused by the synergistic effects of ohmic heating and electroosmosis which resulted in the displacement of a large number of water molecules and the movement of solid particles as well as the reduction of viscosity in dewatered as mahmoud et al 2011 2016 in the previous studies magnetic micro particle conditioning pressurized vertical electro osmotic dewatering process guo et al 2018 removed 99 67 fwc and 82 97 bwc respectively and cpam conditioning peod treatment feng et al 2014 removed 93 4 fwc and 88 4 bwc respectively therefore the siderite pms peod process had a better effect on bwc reduction 3 2 radicals identification and sludge cell viability changes fig 2 presented the epr spectra obtained from the dmpo experiments at different time intervals of the conditioning reaction with siderite pms in deionized water the results were consistent with reaction eqs 5 and 6 which indicated that siderite activating pms could produce ho and so 4 after 30 min reaction the signal peak intensity of dmpo so 4 adduct slightly increased while the signal peak intensity of dmpoho adduct significantly increased some generated so 4 radicals converted into ho ones according to eq 6 this confirmed that siderite could release enough fe2 to react with pms and yield free radicals within 30 min which was consistent with the study of feng et al 2018 5 f e 2 hs o 5 f e 3 s o 4 o h 6 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 ho h the changes in cell viability and clsm images at different stages along siderite pms conditioning peod process were shown in fig 3 and fig s5 respectively in raw as 37 34 3 38 cells died siderite pms conditioning and ec treatment resulted in the increase of dead cells fractions by 15 40 and 33 72 respectively the ho and so 4 generated from siderite pms oxidation system can attack the surface of as cells and lead to the disruption of cells feng et al 2018 yu et al 2019 however ec treatment caused electrolysis and thermal decomposition in the sludge cake which led to the imbalance of osmotic pressure in more as cells and cell rupture guo et al 2018 even to cell death in addition the ph value of the mixed sludge after ec treatment decreased which may be caused by the physicochemical reactions happening on the electrode guo et al 2018 and the outmigration of oh anions near the cathode with filtrate acidic ph also caused protein denaturation and cell membranes damage zhang et al 2021 3 3 eps components and typical proteinaceous compounds 3 3 1 ftir spectra and protein secondary structure analysis text s10 described the changes of toc and scod in supernatant filtrate along siderite pms conditioning peod process text s11 showed the distributions of toc pn ps and ha in different eps layers along siderite pms conditioning peod process ftir technology further analyzed the composition and functional groups of sludge eps the corresponding spectra and the detailed results of band assignments were provided in fig s8 and table s7 respectively the ftir spectra description was also showed in text s12 the amide i region of spectra 1700 1600 cm 1 were further resolved into protein secondary structure peaks through the second derivative analysis and curve fitting program so as to obtain the subtle differences the fitted peaks and the changes of protein secondary structure in different eps layers along siderite pms conditioning peod process were shown in fig s9 and table 4 respectively the value of Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil was use to express the compactness of protein structure hou et al 2015 the smaller values the looser structure as shown in table 4 after siderite pms conditioning the Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values decreased from 0 176 of raw as to 0 090 in slime while it increased from 0 425 of raw as to 0 691 in tb eps the oxidation of radicals led to the appearance of the tighter protein structure in tb eps and the looser protein structure in slime which was conducive to the decrease of bound water content zhang et al 2019 at dg stage the Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values in slime and tb eps were 1 165 and 0 914 respectively the protein molecular structure became denser after water in as flowed out and the sludge cake was compressed by dg treatment several hours mechanical pressure treatment could cause the hydrolytic acidification of organic matters in sludge and a ph decrease li et al 2016 thereby protein denaturation and the decrease of Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values in slime and tb eps happened at ec stage the Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values in slime and tb eps decreased to 0 519 and 0 470 respectively maybe the electrolysis and thermal decomposition led to the protein denaturation and the loose protein structure in slime and tb eps at dg mc and ec stages the Œ± helix Œ≤ sheet random coil values in slime were higher than those in tb eps this result indicated that protein structure in slime presented more compact than that in tb eps along the dewatering stages and more water flowed outsider of slime than tb eps 3 3 2 amino acids amino acids were main components of proteins and by products of protein decomposition after sludge oxidation treatment hou et al 2015 20 kinds of amino acids were detected of which 8 kinds of hydrophilic amino acids and 7 kinds of hydrophobic amino acids were identified fig s10 and the concentrations of 3 kinds of amino acids asn gln and trp were below the detection limit the changes of main amino acid in different eps layers were shown in fig s11 in raw as the main amino acids were asp glu gly lys ala leu and pro after siderite pms conditioning in slime the proportions of hydrophilic amino acids glu and lys decreased while gly and asp increased and the proportion of total hydrophobic amino acids increased by 4 56 in tb eps the proportions of most hydrophilic amino acids such as glu gly asp lys etc changed slightly but the proportions of hydrophobic amino acids of ala and pro increased which led to the proportion of total hydrophobic amino acids increased by 6 90 the above changes indicated that siderite pms conditioning approach can improve the hydrophobicity of eps at mc and ec stages due to the migration of proteins proteins with high content of hydrophilic amino acid lys were easier to migrate outward with the outflow of water than proteins with high content of hydrophobic amino acid ala therefore the proportion of ala increased while the proportion of lys decreased in all eps layers these changes led to the decrease of the binding capacity between above amino acids and water which may be beneficial to improve sludge dewaterability based on the above data analysis it was found that ala and lys may be important amino acids that affect the hydrophobicity or hydrophobicity of eps therefore it was proposed to use the ratio of ala to lys ala lys to represent the damage degree of water holding capacity of protein table 5 showed the changes of ala lys values in different eps layers along the siderite pms conditioning peod process compared with raw as the ala lys values increased in slime and tb eps after siderite pms conditioning which indicated that this oxidation method can effectively destroy the protein stability in as and release the moisture of protein in slime and tb eps after mc and ec treatment the ala lys values of each eps layers stabilized at 3 00 3 50 the protein in eps were highly destroyed and its water holding capacity was weakened which may cause the release of a large amount of free water and bound water in eps 3 4 correlation between typical amino acids and as dewaterability table 6 showed the pearson correlations between amino acids and bwc or wc in as the proportion of ala showed negative correlations with bwc or wc in slime r bwc 2 0 793 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 809 p 0 01 and tb eps r bwc 2 0 688 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 630 p 0 05 while the hydrophilic amino acids lys showed a strong positive correlation with bwc or wc in slime r bwc 2 0 760 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 690 p 0 05 and tb eps r bwc 2 0 592 p 0 05 r wc 2 0 652 p 0 01 moreover ala lys also showed strong negative correlations with bwc or wc in slime r bwc 2 0 803 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 771 p 0 01 and tb eps r bwc 2 0 693 p 0 01 r wc 2 0 705 p 0 01 therefore it could be inferred that the improvement of sludge dewaterability after siderite pms conditioning peod process might be related to the changes of ala and lys 3 5 number of molecular contacts number of contacts referred to atomic contacts number during the interaction between molecules it was used to characterize the strength of the interaction between two molecules liu et al 2007 the larger values showed the stronger interaction ala was a relatively high content of hydrophobic amino acid in as and it had strong negative correlations with the sludge dewaterability figs 4 and s12 showed the changes in number of contacts between ala water in the same eps layer and ala other major amino acids in different eps layers along the siderite pms conditioning peod process where the former values were higher than the latter and this implied that ala contact with water preferentially text s13 fig 5 provided diagrams of the interaction between ala and water as shown in fig 4 siderite pms conditioning method led to the number of contacts in lb eps and tb eps decreased significantly while it increased in slime this phenomenon implied that water migrated outside from inner eps and the sludge dewaterability increased meantime the binding sites of ala and water in slime transferred from the backbone ch of raw as to the side chain nh cooh fig 5 a the binding sites between ala and water increased accordingly these changes might improve the binding capacity between ala and water molecules in slime liu et al 2007 with the progress of dewatering process the number of contact gradually decreased in all eps layers these changes implied that large amount of water was gradually removed 3 6 environmental implication in practical applications the poor effect of sludge dewatering will bring a great burden to the sludge treatment and disposal of wwtps this study proposed the siderite pms conditioning method which can effectively crack the sludge cells and eps then be conducive to the sludge dewaterability improvement at the same time siderite is a cheap natural mineral and heterogeneous catalyst at a low dosage of siderite pms can be activated and release enough free radicals to oxidize as cells in addition the siderite pms conditioning method combined with the peod technology can reduce the wc of as to 58 02 therefore this conditioning method has a good application prospect in the field of sludge treatment in the future over the past decades eps has been considered as one of the most critical factors affecting as dewatering performance most of studies have focused on the composition and characteristics of eps and their correlation with as dewaterability based on the analysis results of the protein secondary structure and amino acid composition this study proposed to analyze the water binding mechanism from the molecular level of the extracellular proteins in different eps layers this was undoubtedly a new idea to explore the role of eps in sludge dewatering performance from the results of protein secondary structure the compactness of protein structure changes during conditioning and dewatering process these changes were closely related to the interaction between amino acids and water to describe specifically after siderite pms conditioning the contact number of ala and water increased in slime while that of tb eps decreased the corresponding interactions between ala and water increased in slime and decreased in tb eps which implied the migration of water adhered in tb eps to outer layer these changes also led to the occurrence of the tighter protein structure in tb eps and the looser protein structure in slime at this stage the contact sites between ala and water molecules transferred from the backbone to the side chains in slime leading to the release of water from the inner to outer layer at the dg mc and ec stages a large amount of water was released and the interactions between ala and water continually weakened however the contact number of tb eps was higher than that of slime which indicated that more water flowed outsider of slime than tb eps meantime these changes led to a denser protein structure in slime than tb eps from the above analysis this study explored the sludge dewatering process and mechanism from the molecular level of the extracellular proteins in different eps layers the correlation between amino acids and sludge dewaterability showed that the affinity of protein and water molecules depended on the content of the hydrophobic amino acid ala and the hydrophilic amino acid lys for practical applications the improvement of ala content was the key to change the hydrophobic properties of eps in the future we can further explore the process and mechanism of sludge dewatering from the perspective of protein molecules the addition of siderite pms has some influence on sludge quality first this method will cause mineral residues in sludge however siderite is safe mineral it can slowly release fe2 to adjust the ion content of the sludge system secondly the siderite pms reaction will increase the conductivity of the sludge from 0 8ms cm of raw as to 5 5ms cm however the conductivity of dewatered sludge with siderite pms conditioning peod process was 1 7 ms cm in general the conductivity of composted sludge was 2 9 5 0 ms cm ruggieri et al 2008 dewatered sludge with low conductivity 8 0 ms cm could be directly used for composting gao et al 2010 and agricultural reuse nafez et al 2015 at the same time the siderite pms conditioning method has better effect on sludge dewatering than some aops based on siderite activating other chemicals to produce so4 and ho 4 conclusion this study explored the performance and mechanism of the siderite pms conditioning peod process on as reduction the reaction of siderite and pms can generate free radical to oxidize sludge a large number of sludge cells were cracked and the ratio of dead cells increased at this stage after the siderite pms conditioning peod treatment the wc of the sludge decreased from 98 12 in raw as to 58 02 based on the changes of amino acid composition and protein secondary structure in different eps layers of as both the increase of hydrophobic amino acid ala and the decrease of hydrophilic amino acid lys in slime and tb eps were beneficial for sludge dewaterability improvement compared with raw as siderite pms conditioning led to a denser structure of proteins in tb eps and a looser structure of protein in slime respectively while along the subsequent dewatering stages the proteins in tb eps became looser and in slime became more compact respectively this was closely related to the interactions between amino acids and water and also indicated the migration of water adhered in tb eps to outer layer at conditioning stage and more water flow outsider of slime than tb eps at dewatering stages this study suggests that the change of amino acid composition and the compactness of protein secondary structures in eps may affect sludge dewaterability credit authorship contribution statement enrui li writing

16872,the removal of arsenic iii as iii with nanofiltration nf was investigated with emphasis on the role of salinity ph and organic matter on retention mechanisms while no measurable impact of salinity on as iii retention with nf membranes nf270 and nf90 was observed a significant increase in as iii retention occurred from ph 9 to ph 12 this was explained by as iii deprotonation at ph 9 that enhanced donnan charge exclusion of the five different organic matter types investigated at 10 mgc l only humic acid ha increased as iii retention by up to 10 increasing ha concentration to 100 mgc l enhanced as iii retention by 40 which was attributed to as iii ha complexation complexation was confirmed by field flow fractionation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry fff icp ms measurements which showed that the bound as iii increased with ha concentration time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims showed that nf90 which exhibited lower permeability reduction than nf270 has accumulated a lower amount of as iii in the presence of ha where as iii ha complex was formed in the feed solution this finding implies that as iii retention with nf technology can be enhanced by complexation instead of using other methods such as oxidation or ph adjustement graphical asbtract image graphical abstract keywords physico chemical water treatment membrane filtration arsenite retention natural organic matter complexation speciation 1 introduction arsenic as is one of 10 chemicals of major public health concern who 2019 as can contribute during long term exposure to various forms of cancer dermatological diseases hypertension and cardiovascular disorders as well as other diseases affecting the neurological system maharjan et al 2005 globally reported as concentrations in groundwater range from 1 ¬µg l to 100 000 ¬µg l nordstrom 2002 and 150 million people are exposed to concentrations above the drinking water guidelines singh et al 2015 the world health organization who has set a guideline of 10 Œºg l for maximum arsenic who 2017 while bangladesh china and most south american countries have set a guideline of 50 ¬µg l due to the practical difficulties associated with as removal jadhav et al 2015 arsenic can be mobilised in groundwater due to geological leaching and or anthropogenic activities naturally this may occur by i reductive dissolution of as rich iron oxides biswas et al 2011 ii oxidative dissolution of as rich arsenopyrite neil et al 2014 and iii competitive adsorption with ions such as phosphate kanematsu et al 2013 in the first process anaerobic metal reducing bacteria play an important role islam et al 2004 neumann et al 2010 have found that groundwater irrigated rice fields carry biologically degradable organic matter om that enhances the process of microbial mediated oxidation to reduce and dissolve as into aquifers mcarthur et al 2012 have reported that wastewaters from septic tanks and pit latrines increase the concentration of as in groundwater due to the presence of om in areas far from the source of the contamination this highlights the role of om in the mobilisation of as in groundwater farooq et al 2010 richards et al 2018 apart from with the presence of om arsenic contamination in groundwater can co exist with high total dissolved solids tds or electrical conductivity ec as surrogate of salinity level especially in coastal regions where salt intrusion is caused by sea level rise nicolli et al 2012 yu 2010 this has been reported in many countries including bangladesh 3 29 ms cm 2 258 ¬µgas l ayers et al 2016 argentina tds 0 7 1 1 g l 4 5300 ¬µgas l smedley et al 2002 mongolia tds 1 g l 300 553 ¬µgas l jia et al 2017 and china tds 3 10 g l 1 32 367 Œºgas l li et al 2016 therefore high salinity in as contaminated groundwater presents challenges for many treatment processes arsenic occurs in water in four different oxidation forms 3 0 3 and 5 in which arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are the most prevalent ipcs 2001 as v is thermodynamically stable and generally predominates in well oxygenated waters such as surface water while as iii is more common under reducing and anoxic conditions and consequently is more prevalent in deeper groundwater ravenscroft et al 2009 this makes as iii which is known to be more toxic for the biological system than as v molin et al 2015 the most common form of as contamination in groundwater based drinking water sources martinez finley et al 2014 the speciation of as depends on both ph and redox potential eh yamaguchi et al 2014 the ph controls the degree of protonation of as iii and as v species while redox potential controls the redox couple as iii as v as v has four dissociation forms h3aso4 0 h2aso4 haso4 2 and aso4 3 while as iii exhibits only three dissociation forms h3aso3 0 h2aso3 haso3 2 wu et al 2017 at ph range 6 9 as v predominates in its charged forms h2aso4 haso4 2 whereas as iii predominates in its neutral state h3aso3 0 meng et al 2000 this correlates with the low efficiency of as iii removal with conventional processes that require a peroxidation step to convert as iii to as v kamala et al 2005 arsenic iii removal from drinking water is a well known challenge and various technologies exist chen et al 2019 namely precipitation coagulation ion exchange adsorption and membrane separation electrodialysis nanofiltration and reverse osmosis aliaskari and sch√§fer 2021 bryjak et al 2016 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 in adsorption iron oxides are generally efficient for as iii removal bai et al 2016 wei et al 2019 whereas removal efficiency depends on ionic strength and ph conditions hence effectiveness is susceptible to changes in water quality korngold et al 2001 in precipitation coagulation and ion exchange processes as iii removal is not very effective and can be affected by the ph and the competing anions litter et al 2010 the challenges in removal are attributed to the fact that as iii is uncharged and hence an oxidation step to form charged as v species is necessary in membrane separation the retention of as iii was reported as 60 to 85 for reverse osmosis ro while only 10 to 50 can be achieved by nanofiltration nf depending on membrane characteristics bryjak et al 2016 the advantages of membrane processes are scalability relatively low space requirements robustness to changes in water quality and minimal operation and maintenance requirements litter et al 2010 nf has lower specific energy consumption than ro and operates at comparatively higher recoveries khedr 2008 furthermore ro alters the organoleptic properties of the treated water more compared to nf with lower monovalent ion removal litter et al 2010 this makes nf a strong case where partial desalination is required energy consumption is to be reduced and water quality is variable nanofiltration has been reported to retain more than 90 of as v while less than 50 retention of as iii was achieved by tight nf membranes chang et al 2014 harisha et al 2010 this difficulty in removing as iii with nf stems from its uncharged form h3aso3 0 at ph 9 coronell et al 2013 hence as iii retention is susceptible to ph variation and the resulting speciation which can lead to remarkably enhanced removal at ph 9 where the charged species h2aso3 haso3 2 predominate and charge repulsion is enhanced nguyen et al 2009 two possible means can improve as iii retention with nf i pre oxidation of as iii to as v which is more easily removed by nf sato et al 2002 or ii increasing the ph to the point where as iii is deprotonated to charged species which are removed more effectively than the uncharged as iii species sen et al 2010 these approaches oxidation and ph adjustment are neither cost effective nor environmental friendly in that chemicals are added that may cause membrane degradation and thus deterioration of separation performance huang et al 2020 tsehaye et al 2018 moreover chemicals are difficult to handle in remote or rural locations where such technologies are often required otter et al 2020 salinity may affect the retention of charged species stable retention with nf was observed in the case of as v showing that the shielding effect of the membrane charge does not influence the separation performance boussouga et al 2021 jiang et al 2016 as as iii is uncharged no charge effects are expected and consequently no relevant work is available in literature however the increased salt passage with the decreased water permeability through nf membranes at high ionic strength can be explained by the shrinking or the compaction of the polymeric matrix caused by reduced charge shielding braghetta et al 1997 eriksson 1988 kilduff et al 2004 this may be relevant to as iii retention the presence of om has increased the retention of as v by nf boussouga et al 2021 xie et al 2013 yu et al 2013 such enhancement in as v retention can be explained by different mechanisms i formation of as om complexes xie et al 2013 ii increase in membrane charge with om boussouga et al 2021 and iii membrane fouling yu et al 2013 fouling can be described as the decrease in the molecular weight cut off mwco of the membrane as pores are blocked or a deposit enhances retention thus enhancing the size exclusion comerton et al 2009 sch√§fer et al 2001 however no relevant work on the impact of om on as iii retention with nf is available to date binding of as with om has been investigated buschmann et al 2006 reported that as v binding with humic acid ha was 6 10 times stronger than with as iii the maximum binding for both species was observed at ph 7 interaction as complexation or adsorption of as with om depends on the functional groups which have different dissociation constants and deprotonate at different ph conditions wang and mulligan 2006 for as iii ha complexes it has been proposed that phenolate functional groups in ha can engage in ligand exchange reaction with as iii through oh release see fig 1 a while carboxylic functional groups form a negatively charged complex with a partial bond h bridges without oh release see fig 1b buschmann et al 2006 in addition the formation of as iii ha complexes can be the result of direct association of as with metals bound to ha see fig 1c such as iron and aluminium which may also bridge as iii to ha fakour and lin 2014 such concept also known as complexation enhanced membrane filtration has been applied for the separation and or enrichment of inorganic ions khosa et al 2014 the aim of such combined process is to reduce the capital and operating costs of the dense polymeric membranes such as nf and ro where the removal of the major inorganic ions can be accomplished khosa et al 2014 likewise polymer enhanced ultrafiltration peuf has been applied which works on the principle of metal polymer binding resulting in macromolecular complexes that can be retained by uf volchek et al 1993 the major challenge in such a process is to select the suitable polymer for an effective complexation with the target inorganic ion y√ºr√ºm et al 2013 a wide range of water soluble polymers with carboxylic or amine groups were used in peuf for metal ions removal recovery from aqueous solutions poly ethylenimine pei for copper cu camarillo et al 2012 sodium polyacrylate pass for nickel ni shao et al 2013 and sericin biopolymer for lead pb cobalt co and zinc zn removal khosa et al 2014 the control of water chemistry such as ph and nacl concentration is necessary in peuf for optimal complexation and hence retention with uf mimoune and amrani 2007 trivunac and stevanovic 2006 this makes the peuf process vulnerable to water quality variations in contrast to the removal of complexed ions with membrane filtration only few works report the removal of uncharged species jana et al 2011 have investigated the removal of as iii via peuf using chitosan based ceramic uf assisted by polyvinyl alcohol pva as complexing agent the high as iii removal 90 from a feed concentration of 500 ¬µg l was explained by pva as iii complexation however the role of chitosan in the modified membrane which is known as an efficient bio adsorbent for as kwok et al 2014 on as iii removal was not discussed results showed a drastic decrease in the water flux from 2 7 to 0 9 l m2 h in filtration this was attributed to gel formation of the pva which decreased the mwco of the uf membrane that would have induced a higher retention in nf complexation enhanced retention has been applied for boron also neutral at neutral ph like as iii using sorbitol as a complexation additive in dual stage nf seawater desalination liu et al 2013 boron concentration in permeate reached 1 mg l from 5 7 mg l at ph 8 3 similarly boron retention with nf ro was enhanced using polyols glycerol and mannitol tu et al 2013 in this work as iii om complexation was used to enhance the performance of nf using different om of different fractions this was motivated by the fact that the different fractions of om can exhibit distinct binding capacity to as in which humic substances have the strongest affinity to as zhang et al 2021 the solute solute interactions defined as the interactions between as iii and om feature prominently in literature as the mechanism responsible for enhancing as retention in the presence of om xia et al 2007 xie et al 2013 yu et al 2013 these studies however were unable to quantify such mechanisms solute solute interactions occurring during the nf separation conversely several other studies have quantified as iii om interactions by using models and analytical methods fakour and lin 2014 liu et al 2011 neubauer et al 2013 liu et al 2011 have investigated as iii ha complexation via iron bridge by using size exclusion chromatography sec uv inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms fakour and lin 2014 performed a high performance liquid chromatography with on line hydride generation and atomic fluorescence spectrometry hplc hg afs to measure the free as iii after as iii ha complexation while the bound as iii was calculated from the difference between the free as iii and total as iii measured by icp coupled with an optical emission spectrometer icp oes neubauer et al 2013 investigated arsenic association to om in boreal catchments by using flow field flow fractionation coupled to icp ms fff icp ms and found that as iii om complexation is ph dependent these studies were conducted for the purpose of understanding as iii om interactions it remains an exciting challenge to link this as iii om complexation to membrane retention mechanisms in the previous investigation on as v boussouga et al 2021 it was found that as v permeability decreased in the presence of ha this means that ha hinders the penetration of as and probably affects the distribution of as onto the membrane active layer with ha deposition that enhances the negative surface charge childress and elimelech 1996 in the case of as iii as iii om complexes may play a role in such behaviour in addition static adsorption experiments revealed low adsorption of as iii 0 2 mg g to a polyamide based nf membrane he et al 2016 to investigate this contribution time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims was used for as iii detection in the vicinity of the membrane active layer this method which offers sensitive analysis greater chemical selectivity and lower probing depth than x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps has been widely used for detection of trace elements in polymeric membranes alayemieka et al 2009 dixon et al 2012 this method allows the detection and distribution of arsenic in the membrane active layer and thus differentiates arsenic adsorbed to the active layer and penetration hindrance caused by ha arsenic v can be retained 90 by nf membranes despite variable water chemistry boussouga et al 2021 as iii which is the most toxic form of as and occurs in groundwater of reducing conditions low dissolved oxygen cannot be effectively removed in order to better understand the retention mechanisms of as iii nf performance was investigated with regard to ph salinity and the presence of different om the implication of as iii ha complexation on as iii retention with nf was studied through fff icp ms to quantify the bound as iii tof sims analysis was performed to evaluate as iii deposition adsorption in the membrane active layer in the presence of ha 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanofiltration system nanofiltration

collection was based on labview 2014 software 32bit national instruments usa this setting was required due to the different membrane permeability and rejection characteristics in presence of om and at high salinity conditions the filtration protocol see table s1 with controlled qp was adapted from imbrogno and sch√§fer 2019 in which the pressure was the controlled parameter 2 2 data analysis as iii retention as iii flux jas iii and as iii permeability pas iii were the main parameters used to evaluate the performance of the studied nf membranes p as iii was calculated using the combined solution diffusion film theory model murthy and gupta 1997 in this case the diffusion was assumed to be the only factor affecting transport while the contribution of the convection in the solute transport was assumed to be constant due to the controlled solvent water flux the same approach was applied in the previous study where the retention of as v was investigated boussouga et al 2021 the equations used are listed in table 1 while the detailed calculations of the error analysis are described in section 18 of si 2 3 nanofiltration membranes two nf membranes namely nf90 tight nf and nf270 loose nf from

nguyen et al 2021 2 6 field flow fractionation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry asymmetric flow field flow fractionation fff was coupled on line with icp ms to evaluate the as iii ha complexation as a function of ha concentration for this the concentrate flow detector flow outlet of the fff af2000 multiflow fff system postnova landsberg germany was connected in turn to a uv vis detector prominence spd 20a shimadzu japan and then to icp ms agilent model j8403a 7900 icp ms japan icp ms data acquisition was synchronised with the novafff af2000 2 0 9 9 software postnova of the fff by enabling remote data acquisition in the mass hunter 4 4 software agilent japan of the icp ms the calibration was performed using standard solutions of as iii from 0 to 250 ¬µg l injected in fff sample acidification was performed prior to the icp ms in the nebuliser by mixing it with the internal standard icp ms internal standard mix 5188 6525 agilent at 5 hno3 the calibration curve was plotted with respect to the peak area of the icp ms signals see figure s14 the icp ms signal was recorded corresponding to as m z 75 with a set detector flow rate of 0 3 ml min in the fff step a 1 kda ultrafiltration uf membrane plhac ultracel millipore was used in the fff channel equipped with a 500 ¬µm thick spacer and placed in a cooling chamber fff channel thermostat pn4020 postnova landsberg germany with a fixed temperature of 25 c the 1 kda uf membrane was used because it is capable of retaining ha average mw 4 kda nghiem et al 2008 sch√§fer et al 2001 while as iii mw 1 kda can pass through the membrane was thoroughly washed with 1 l of milli q before installation in the channel prior to analysis the membrane was flushed with milli q and eluent 10 mm nacl ph 8 each for 1h at feed flow rate 1 5 ml min focus flow rate 0 5 ml min and permeate flow rate 1 5 ml min the elution program consisted of three steps namely i injection and focusing ii elution and iii rinsing steps with a total run time of 34 min during the injection and focusing step 50 ¬µl of samples were injected into the fff channel using the autosampler pn5300 postnova landsberg germany at an injection flow rate of 0 2 ml min duration 0 8 min focus flow rate of 1 1 ml min for the duration of 0 8 min and then reduced to 0 ml min in 0 2 min and permeate flow rate of 1 ml min during the elution step the permeate flow rate was reduced from 1 to 0 ml min in 15 minutes by a power function with an exponent 3 these flows were found to provide the best particle separation based on size or mw for the chosen membrane 2 7 time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims was performed using a tof sims 5 ion tof gmbh germany for as detection throughout the membrane during the fouling deposits at different ha concentrations the instrument was equipped with a bi cluster primary ion source and a reflection type tof analyser 25 kev bi3 ions were used as primary ions 0 3 pa target current 125 ¬µs cycle time field of view 500 500 ¬µm2 mass scale calibration was performed on the ch ch2 ch3 k ca and fe signals deviations were below 1 5 mu the method was adapted from benz et al 2020 in which the same instrument was used for the total as deposited in the nf membranes sims dual beam depth profiling experiments eroding the specimen with an argon cluster beam while constantly recording mass spectra with the bi primary ion beam were performed independent of the oxidation and charging state of as species used in aqueous media arsenic is always detected as a single charged secondary ion as in sims for the nf90 membranes from filtration experiments with varying ha concentrations the dual beam depth profiling was performed with 5 kev ar1300 cluster ions target current 3 2 na and crater size 700 700 ¬µm2 in a non interlaced sequence after two imaging scans 4 sputter frames were performed followed by a 1 s pause for charge compensation 20 ev electron flood gun for the nf270 membranes from filtration experiments with varying ha concentrations harsher erosion conditions were needed to pass through the ha deposit and the active membrane layer for these samples the dual beam depth profiling was performed using 10 kev ar1500 cluster ions target current 8 5 na and crater size 750 750 ¬µm2 in a non interlaced sequence after two imaging scans 3 sputter frames were performed followed by a 1 s pause for charge compensation 20 ev electron flood gun therefore data from both sets are not directly comparable prior to tof sims measurements the membrane samples were dried using a vacuum freeze dryer martin christ model alpha 2 4 lscplus germany and kept in a desiccator to avoid absorption of water from the air before the analysis 3 results and discussion arsenic iii retention was investigated with two selected nf membranes nf270 and nf90 while varying ph and ionic strength at constant permeate flow rate qp conditions the implication of different om on as iii retention was studied with a focus on the effect of ha concentration in which as iii ha interaction was evaluated by fff icp ms and as iii membrane interaction with tof sims the first parameter investigated was ph to establish as iii retention mechanisms with nf 3 1 mechanisms of as iii retention with nanofiltration in aqueous solutions as iii species remain neutral h3aso3 0 until ph 9 where the monovalent h2aso3 species dominates meng et al 2000 to establish how as iii speciation influences the performance of nf the retention of as iii was investigated over a wide range of ph 2 to 12 see fig 3 given that as iii is uncharged from ph 2 to 9 it was expected that low as iii retention would be observed with the negatively charged nf membranes studied supplementary data on the salt retention water flux and transmembrane pressure tmp changes can be found in figure s9 at neutral ph as iii retention with nf90 40 and nf270 20 is lower than the target retention to comply with who and bangladesh guidelines for a typical 250 ¬µg l as iii feed concentration fig 3a and b however from ph 9 to 12 the retention increased to 59 and 77 for nf270 and nf90 respectively this was attributed to as iii deprotonation that formed the monovalent h2aso3 while it appears that increasing the ph is the solution for enhancing as iii retention polyamide thin film composite tfc membranes are typically not designed for long term treatment of strong alkaline solutions it has been reported that operating such membranes at high ph 10 12 increases their pore size and active layer thickness and thus losing their integrity al amoudi et al 2008 dalwani et al 2011 freger et al 2005 for this reason the long term operation of nf270 and nf90 is recommended at ph range 3 10 dupont 2021 however in this study the nf membranes were used for short term operation and their performance in terms of pure water flux was maintained after the filtration at the studied ph range 2 12 see figure s18 at ph 9 as iii remains uncharged in the feed solutions and thus the size exclusion is the predominant mechanism furthermore nf90 with tighter pores rp 0 29 0 02 nm table s3 showed higher as iii retention than the nf270 with more open pores rp 0 34 0 04 nm table s3 above ph 9 h2aso3 predominates in the feed solutions and thus donnan exclusion occurs in the retention mechanisms with both nf membranes this explains the drastic decrease in jas iii and pas iii see fig 3c and d especially for nf270 which is more negative than nf90 at ph 9 idil mouhoumed et al 2014 therefore the retention of as iii at ph 9 depends on the size exclusion with no contribution by charge repulsion it is anticipated that charge shielding by ionic strength plays no role in as iii retention and this is subsequently investigated 3 2 as iii retention at different salinities the increase in the ionic strength reduces the electrostatic interactions that contribute to the retention of charged species shang et al 2014 for the uncharged species such as h3aso3 0 it is expected that ionic strength 0 58 to 20 g l nacl will not alter the retention of as iii see fig 4 salt retention water flux tmp and ph data can be found in figure s8 varying nacl concentration did not have a major effect on as iii retention fig 4a this is true for jas iii where nf90 showed values around 2 10 5 mol m2 h while nf270 values were one order of magnitude 20 10 5 mol m2 h higher fig 4c however the minor effects when increasing nacl concentration from 0 58 g l to 2 g l were only observed when investigating pas iii fig 4d this could be attributed to changes in the effective pore size of the membrane due to polymer matrix shrinking kilduff et al 2004 it should be noted that the increase in the driving force at constant water flux conditions when increasing nacl concentration did not contribute to as iii retention this is in contrast to nacl see figure s8 in summary high salinity in groundwater had no significant effects on the nf performance for as iii removal at constant water flux conditions however the presence of om in groundwater may influence the performance of nf separation as it was observed in the previous study on as v boussouga et al 2021 which showed higher as v retention in the presence of ha that enhances the charge repulsion between the membrane and as v species this mechanism might not be so significant in the case of as iii which is present as an uncharged species at ph 9 for this reason the impact of om on as iii rejection is the next parameter to be investigated 3 3 implication of organic matter on as iii retention the presence of om in as iii contaminated groundwater may influence the performance of nf with as iii retention it has been found that as iii tends to interact with om such as ha to form complexes buschmann et al 2006 for this reason as iii retention with nf membranes was investigated in the presence of different om types ha wf fp ta and aa fig 5 formation of as iii om complexes can be observed by enhanced as iii retention salt retention water flux tmp and ph data can be found in figure s10 the retention of as iii varied in the presence of different om types at 10 mgc l the highest as iii retention was achieved with ha whereas the lowest retention was observed in the presence of aa fig 5a in contrast to different om aa had a significant impact on pas iii that increased from 182 to 701 l m2 h and from 25 to 68 l m2 h with nf270 and nf90 respectively fig 5d this can be attributed to the formation of a fouling layer in the presence of aa known as a complex polymer and model fouling meng and liu 2013 that increased the tmp when operating at constant water fluxes figure s10 such behaviour can also be explained by the significant impact on cm cp and thus as iii retention wf fp and ta showed no measurable effect on as iii retention in contrast to aa while ha indicated higher as iii retention this means that i either no significant solute solute interactions occurred or ii concentration polarisation and thus cm has been altered by fouling formation particularly for aa see figure s11 such behaviour can be linked to molecular composition and hence om fractions that may i interact with as iii or ii affect as iii transport through the membrane to clarify the retention of om fractions lc ocd characterisation was performed 3 4 characteristics of organic matter in feed and permeates ha has been shown to cause a marginally higher as iii retention compared to other om or without om to evaluate which fractions were responsible and to establish the mechanisms involved ha wf fp and aa in the feed and permeates were characterised by lc ocd see fig 6 ocd signal for ta which is an aromatic compound was not detectable due to its adsorption in the column toc retention of different oms can be found in figure s12 ha which showed higher as iii retention is mainly composed of the hs fraction which was completely retained by both nf270 and nf90 fig 6a fp which had no effect on as iii retention is composed of bb and low molecular weight lmw fractions neutral and of small size shen and sch√§fer 2015 nf270 was not able to retain lmw while nf90 achieved approximately 80 fig 6b this explains the low toc retention in the case of fp see figure s12 aa is characterised by bio fractions that were completely retained by both membranes fig 6c wf is a combination of hs and bb that was retained by nf while a small peak appeared in permeates which can be linked to some lmw fig 6c apparently the om composed of hs either increased as iii retention as the case of ha or had no impact such as wf for this reason ha was chosen for further investigation at different salinities and ph since these two parameters influence the chemistry of ha colombo et al 2015 owusu agyeman et al 2017 3 5 as iii retention in presence of ha with salinity and ph variations the negative charge of ha increases with ph due to the dissociation of the carboxylic groups pka 4 and phenol functional groups pka 9 ritchie and perdue 2003 as iii ha complexation occurs preferentially at higher ph buschmann et al 2006 liu and cai 2010 consequently ren et al 2017 concluded that the presence of ha may affect as speciation for this reason the retention of as iii was investigated in the presence of ha while varying ph fig 7 no significant enhancement of as iii retention occurred with either nf membrane in the presence of ha over the ph range 2 to 8 where the neutral as iii species dominated however at ph 9 where the monovalent h2aso3 is the predominant as iii species the presence of ha increased as iii retention by approximately 10 see fig 7a this small increase in as iii can be explained by two possible mechanisms i as iii ha complexation at higher ph in which the trace iron present in ha may have bridged as iii to ha or ii the increase in membrane charge by ha thus increasing the charge repulsion of h2aso3 species while jas iii did not reveal the impact of ha fig 7c pas iii values at the ph range 2 to 6 indicated that as iii permeance though the membrane was affected by ha particularly with nf270 in this case the two possible mechanisms are i as iii ha complexation and ii the formation of a ha fouling gel layer the fouling layer was more visible at ph 2 where the membranes were positively charged fig 7e the possible mechanisms of as iii retention in the presence of ha are depicted in fig 8 the decreased as iii permeability particularly with nf270 at low ph range 2 to 4 revealed that membrane fouling with 10 mgc l could be the main mechanism this was further investigated with tof sims as a function of different ha concentrations see section 3 8 in addition to ph the size of ha and ultimately its deposition on the membrane surface is also affected by the ionic strength due to aggregation colombo et al 2015 for this reason the increase in salinity nacl concentration was investigated in the presence of 10 mgc l ha at ph 8 fig 9 high nacl concentration could enhance membrane fouling and thus decrease as iii permeability assuming that membrane fouling is most dominant retention mechanism in the presence of ha ha in the feed solution has no measurable impact on as iii retention fig 9a as well as on jas iii fig 9c with increasing the nacl concentration however pas iii revealed that the diffusivity of as iii through nf270 decreased as the nacl concentration was increased while a low impact was observed with nf90 fig 9d this resulted in a similar performance in terms of as iii retention of both nf270 and nf90 at high nacl concentration 20g l in summary the presence of 10 mgc l ha showed no significant impact on as iii retention at different salinities however at this stage the responsible mechanisms for the observed decrease in as iii permeability attributed to the presence of ha cannot be entirely determined at ph 8 the effect of the increase in membrane charge can be excluded as as iii is uncharged while the aggregation of ha at high salinity also had no significant impact on as iii retention it is possible that the concentrations were simply too low to detect complexation effects at similar conditions 14 mgc l ha and 200 ¬µg l as iii it has been reported that only 3 of as iii was complexed at ph 7 liu and cai 2010 in addition buschmann et al 2006 reported that as iii ha complexation is measurable only at very low as iii toc ratios approximately at as iii toc 0 001 with fixed ha concentration 100 mgc l for this reason the ha concentration was increased to evaluate as iii retention 3 6 enhanced complexation through increased ha concentration filtration experiments were performed with variable ha concentration 0 100 mgc l to enhance complexation which was controlled by as iii toc ratios see fig 10 salt retention and fouling data can be found in figure s13 with increasing ha concentration from 0 to 100 mgc l as iii retention with nf was increased by around 40 for both nf membranes see fig 10a at these conditions the permeate quality was close to the bangladesh as iii guideline 50 ¬µg l at 100 mgc l ha concentration fig 10b both jas iii and pas iii decreased with the ha concentration jas iii decreased from 18 10 5 to 8 10 5 mol m2 h nf270 and 1 4 10 5 to 0 6 10 5 mol m2 h nf90 fig 10c and pas iii from 267 5 to 10 1 l m2 h nf270 and 10 to 1 6 l m2 h nf90 fig 10d the observed increase in as iii retention with nf with increasing ha concentration can be attributed to two possibilities i formation of a ha gel layer on the membrane surface and hence decrease as iii permeability or ii the formation of as ha complexes that are more likely to be retained the first mechanism may be valid for nf270 given the observed decline in permeability due to fouling when ha concentration was increased to 100 mgc l see figure s13 however the second mechanism may be also relevant for both nf membranes since the as iii toc ratio was lower 0 002 which can allow a measurable as iii ha interaction in addition it has been reported that the typical values of total acidities carboxylic and phenolate groups of ha similar type to this work were 6 5 8 0 mmol g liu et al 2011 based on these values and the toc of ha stock solution 502 mgc l in 2 g l ha the feed solutions of 100 mgc l have approximately 2 6 3 2 mmol l of total acidities these values are approximately four orders of magnitude higher than the as iii concentration 250¬µg l as iii which corresponds to 0 4 10 3 mmol l h3aso3 for this reason an fff icp ms coupling analysis was performed in order to quantify the as iii ha interaction as a function of ha concentration 3 7 as iii ha binding detection with fff icp ms as iii ha binding in the feed solution as a function of ha concentration 0 100 mgc l with a fixed as iii concentration 250 ¬µg l was investigated by fff icp ms coupling since as iii interacts with ha at very low as iii toc ratios more bound as iii was detected at high ha concentration as expected fig 11 as iii bound was calculated following eq s7 the chromatogram of as detection in fff icp ms can be found in figure s15 and the uv data in figure s16 the peak area of as signal in the icp ms directly coupled to fff increased with the increasing ha concentration fig 11 it should be noted that in the icp ms the as signal was not affected by the presence of ha in the sample matrix see figure s3 which was highly diluted by the eluent 10 mm nacl from the fff step the increase of as signal in the icp ms can be explained by the decrease of as iii passage through the uf membrane in the fff which was presumably caused by as iii ha complexation this binding of as iii to ha occurred at a low as iii toc ratio high ha concentration this concurs with the observation of buschmann et al 2006 and explains the increase of as iii retention with ha concentration in the nf experiments it can therefore be concluded that as iii ha complexation is indeed the responsible mechanism for the increase in a iii retention with nf in the presence of high ha concentration 100 mgc l ph 8 this complexation means that ha could have been deposited during the filtration experiments on the membrane in the form of an as iii ha complex rather than by permeation through the membrane the deposition of ha presumably as as iii complex has resulted in a reduction of membrane water permeability further investigations with tof sims were performed to verify the presence of as in the deposits specifically the distribution of as iii in the deposit layer the active layer or throughout the membrane was investigated at different ha concentrations 3 8 as iii ha deposition in membrane active layer the investigation with fff icp ms indicated that as iii ha interaction increases with ha concentration which prompted the investigation of whether as is found in deposits furthermore if as iii ha complexes are formed it could be expected that as deposition on the membrane surface will increase with ha deposition tof sims analysis of both nf membranes used to filter 250 ¬µg l as iii at different ha concentrations results of depth integrated as signal are shown in fig 12 whereas depth integrated images can be found in figure s17 with nf90 the amount of as in the membranes dropped on the addition of 10 mgc l ha see fig 12a further increasing the ha concentration to 100 mgc l did not yield a clear sequence correlation with as signals however for nf270 the as signal increased on the addition of 10 mgc l ha fig 12b in the absence of ha where nf90 had approximately twice the as iii retention as compared to nf270 see fig 3a the amount of as iii bound to the nf90 membrane was approximately 10 times higher than on the nf270 membrane the difference between arsenic detection in the membrane samples used for experiments without ha could be attributed to pas iii which was greater in the case of nf270 and thus less deposition of as iii may have occurred compared to nf90 see fig 10 in both cases arsenic deposition on the membranes was laterally very non uniform see figure s17 these two different behaviours of as signal in the membrane active layer can be explained by the different fouling characteristics of nf270 and nf90 it appears that the increased amount of ha in the case of nf270 caused higher as iii deposition in its complex form as iii ha and reduced water permeability while this is not the case with nf90 which exhibited lower water permeability reduction figure s13a this means that less as iii ha deposit has occurred for nf90 compared to nf270 hence higher as iii signals have been detected in the case of nf270 samples used for the ha experiments in contrasts to nf90 that exhibited less as iii adsorption in the polyamide active layer this could be hindered by as iii ha complex formation in the feed solution see fig 13 to further clarify the role of the active layer thickness and ha deposition on as iii signals depth profiles of arsenic and the membrane material signals as functions of sputtering times were investigated see fig 14 as shown in fig 14a and c arsenic is found within the active layer of the nf90 membrane during depth profiling as signal fig 14a decreased together with cn and cno fig 14c indicating the polyamine active layer s and so2 both from the polysulfone support layer are increasing around 12 min erosion time therefore it can be concluded that in the absence of ha as iii species interact with the polyamide in the active layer of nf90 and nf270 the nf90 membrane is much thicker and consequently captures more as iii in contrast to the behaviour of the arsenic depth profiles on nf90 which show a fast drop with rather mild erosion conditions applied low argon cluster energy and current the nf270 samples required much harsher erosion conditions even with this harsher erosion the actual total as iii in the sample with 100 mgc l ha concentration was underestimated since as signals from deeper layers of the membrane remained high fig 14b whereas the depth integrated signals of cn increased if the applied solutions contained increasing amounts of ha cno and s did not change strongly see table 2 although the ha does not yield very characteristic signals in sims due to its ill defined chemistry including broad mw distribution and strong intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds these data shown in table 2 indicated the deposition of ha on the nf270 membrane at ph 8 this deposit was not yet visible to the naked eye fig 7f however sims can pick up strong changes as shown ha must contain sulphur presumably in low oxidation states like thiols sulphides or disulphides but no so2 moieties karanfil et al 1996 reported a sulphur content of 0 2 to 0 7 depending on the origin of the ha the so2 signals on the other hand remained characteristic for the polysulfone supporting membrane in the nf270 their decrease with increased ha load in test solutions is due to the ha layer built on top of the polyamide active layer retarding the exposure of the polysulfone layer during the depth profiling finally it was also confirmed that ha contains nitrogen in the form of amines and possibly other groups but no amides these would yield cno signals in sims therefore cno secondary ions detected remained attributed only to the active layer of nf270 polyamide and so2 signals to the underlying polysulfone layer tof sims experiments revealed that as iii attachment to the membrane active layer is affected by the thickness and ultimately by the amount of polyamide in the active layer further in the case of nf90 which exhibited lower fouling compared to nf270 ha reduced the presence of as iii in the active layer and thus its diffusion to the permeate for nf270 which has a higher fouling potential than nf90 the increase in ha concentration presumably deposited on the membrane as as iii ha complex increased the amount of as iii in the active layer 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to evaluate the retention mechanism of as iii with nf over a broad range of ph 2 12 salinities 0 58 20 g l different om types ha wf fp ta aa and ha concentration 0 100 mgc l increasing the ph from 8 to 12 and ultimately changing the as iii speciation from h3aso3 0 to h2aso3 increased as iii retention from 13 to 59 nf270 and 34 to 77 nf90 this confirms the importance of the charge exclusion with both nf membranes for the retention of dissociated h2aso3 species while size exclusion is dominant for the neutral species h3aso3 0 arsenic iii retention in the presence of different om types revealed that only ha had a measurable increase on as iii retention om characterisation using lc ocd revealed that ha was characterised by hs fractions which may be responsible for enhancing as iii retention further experiments on as iii retention in the presence of 10 mgc l ha showed that at ph 9 ha increased as iii retention by 10 which can be attributed to the increase in the membrane charge at ph 9 where the neutral as iii species dominates the feed solution no significant enhancement of as iii retention was observed at different salinities no significant impact on as iii retention was observed in the presence of 10 mgc l ha to determine the role of ha concentration on as iii ha complexation ha concentration was increased from 0 to 100 mgc l which resulted in an increase in as iii retention of approximately 40 with both nf membranes this was attributed to the contribution of solute solute interactions as iii ha complexation to the retention mechanisms of as iii with nf complexation was confirmed with fff icp ms where the as iii bound increased with ha concentration tof sims measurements performed on the membranes used for ha free nf experiments revealed that higher amounts of as iii were found in nf90 than in nf270 this leads to the conclusion that as iii species interaction with the membrane is higher with a thicker polyamide active layer nf90 in this case in the presence of ha the amount of as iii in the active layer decreased for nf90 whereas it increased in the case of nf270 these different behaviours can be explained by ha deposition presumably as as iii ha complex on the membrane in the case of nf270 and the higher surface roughness in the case of nf90 this study highlights the significance of the role of solute solute interactions defined by as iii ha complexation on enhancing the performance of nf in terms of as iii retention this is of importance for further investigations required on i enhancing as iii ha binding by focusing on the ternary complexation where the iron content in ha can be increased and ii using a specific complex agent with similar elevated binding characteristics as ha high acidities loading that can be used for water treatment applications this will compete well with

16872,the removal of arsenic iii as iii with nanofiltration nf was investigated with emphasis on the role of salinity ph and organic matter on retention mechanisms while no measurable impact of salinity on as iii retention with nf membranes nf270 and nf90 was observed a significant increase in as iii retention occurred from ph 9 to ph 12 this was explained by as iii deprotonation at ph 9 that enhanced donnan charge exclusion of the five different organic matter types investigated at 10 mgc l only humic acid ha increased as iii retention by up to 10 increasing ha concentration to 100 mgc l enhanced as iii retention by 40 which was attributed to as iii ha complexation complexation was confirmed by field flow fractionation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry fff icp ms measurements which showed that the bound as iii increased with ha concentration time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims showed that nf90 which exhibited lower permeability reduction than nf270 has accumulated a lower amount of as iii in the presence of ha where as iii ha complex was formed in the feed solution this finding implies that as iii retention with nf technology can be

to various forms of cancer dermatological diseases hypertension and cardiovascular disorders as well as other diseases affecting the neurological system maharjan et al 2005 globally reported as concentrations in groundwater range from 1 ¬µg l to 100 000 ¬µg l nordstrom 2002 and 150 million people are exposed to concentrations above the drinking water guidelines singh et al 2015 the world health organization who has set a guideline of 10 Œºg l for maximum arsenic who 2017 while bangladesh china and most south american countries have set a guideline of 50 ¬µg l due to the practical difficulties associated with as removal jadhav et al 2015 arsenic can be mobilised in groundwater due to geological leaching and or anthropogenic activities naturally this may occur by i reductive dissolution of as rich iron oxides biswas et al 2011 ii oxidative dissolution of as rich arsenopyrite neil et al 2014 and iii competitive adsorption with ions such as phosphate kanematsu et al 2013 in the first process anaerobic metal reducing bacteria play an important role islam et al 2004 neumann et al 2010 have found that groundwater irrigated rice fields carry biologically degradable organic matter om that enhances the process of microbial mediated oxidation to reduce and dissolve as into aquifers mcarthur et al 2012 have reported that wastewaters from septic tanks and pit latrines increase the concentration of as in groundwater due to the presence of om in areas far from the source of the contamination this highlights the role of om in the mobilisation of as in groundwater farooq et al 2010 richards et al 2018 apart from with the presence of om arsenic contamination in groundwater can co exist with high total dissolved solids tds or electrical conductivity ec as surrogate of salinity level especially in coastal regions where salt intrusion is caused by sea level rise nicolli et al 2012 yu 2010 this has been reported in many countries including bangladesh 3 29 ms cm 2 258 ¬µgas l ayers et al 2016 argentina tds 0 7 1 1 g l 4 5300 ¬µgas l smedley et al 2002 mongolia tds 1 g l 300 553 ¬µgas l jia et al 2017 and china tds 3 10 g l 1 32 367 Œºgas l li et al 2016 therefore high salinity in as contaminated groundwater presents challenges for many treatment processes arsenic occurs in water in four different oxidation forms 3 0 3 and 5 in which arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are the most prevalent ipcs 2001 as v is thermodynamically stable and generally predominates in well oxygenated waters such as surface water while as iii is more common under reducing and anoxic conditions and consequently is more prevalent in deeper groundwater ravenscroft et al 2009 this makes as iii which is known to be more toxic for the biological system than as v molin et al 2015 the most common form of as contamination in groundwater based drinking water sources martinez finley et al 2014 the speciation of as depends on both ph and redox potential eh yamaguchi et al 2014 the ph controls the degree of protonation of as iii and as v species while redox potential controls the redox couple as iii as v as v has four dissociation forms h3aso4 0 h2aso4 haso4 2 and aso4 3 while as iii exhibits only three dissociation forms h3aso3 0 h2aso3 haso3 2 wu et al 2017 at ph range 6 9 as v predominates in its charged forms h2aso4 haso4 2 whereas as iii predominates in its neutral state h3aso3 0 meng et al 2000 this correlates with the low efficiency of as iii removal with conventional processes that require a peroxidation step to convert as iii to as v kamala et al 2005 arsenic iii removal from drinking water is a well known challenge and various technologies exist chen et al 2019 namely precipitation coagulation ion exchange adsorption and membrane separation electrodialysis nanofiltration and reverse osmosis aliaskari and sch√§fer 2021 bryjak et al 2016 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 in adsorption iron oxides are generally efficient for as iii removal bai et al 2016 wei et al 2019 whereas removal efficiency depends on ionic strength and ph conditions hence effectiveness is susceptible to changes in water quality korngold et al 2001 in precipitation coagulation and ion exchange processes as iii removal is not very effective and can be affected by the ph and the competing anions litter et al 2010 the challenges in removal are attributed to the fact that as iii is uncharged and hence an oxidation step to form charged as v species is necessary in membrane separation the retention of as iii was reported as 60 to 85 for reverse osmosis ro while only 10 to 50 can be achieved by nanofiltration nf depending on membrane characteristics bryjak et al 2016 the advantages of membrane processes are scalability relatively low space requirements robustness to changes in water quality and minimal operation and maintenance requirements litter et al 2010 nf has lower specific energy consumption than ro and operates at comparatively higher recoveries khedr 2008 furthermore ro alters the organoleptic properties of the treated water more compared to nf with lower monovalent ion removal litter et al 2010 this makes nf a strong case where partial desalination is required energy consumption is to be reduced and water quality is variable nanofiltration has been reported to retain more than 90 of as v while less than 50 retention of as iii was achieved by tight nf membranes chang et al 2014 harisha et al 2010 this difficulty in removing as iii with nf stems from its uncharged form h3aso3 0 at ph 9 coronell et al 2013 hence as iii retention is susceptible to ph variation and the resulting speciation which can lead to remarkably enhanced removal at ph 9 where the charged species h2aso3 haso3 2 predominate and charge repulsion is enhanced nguyen et al 2009 two possible means can improve as iii retention with nf i pre oxidation of as iii to as v which is more easily removed by nf sato et al 2002 or ii increasing the ph to the point where as iii is deprotonated to charged species which are removed more effectively than the uncharged as iii species sen et al 2010 these approaches oxidation and ph adjustment are neither cost effective nor environmental friendly in that chemicals are added that may cause membrane degradation and thus deterioration of separation performance huang et al 2020 tsehaye et al 2018 moreover chemicals are difficult to handle in remote or rural locations where such technologies are often required otter et al 2020 salinity may affect the retention of charged species stable retention with nf was observed in the case of as v showing that the shielding effect of the membrane charge does not influence the separation performance boussouga et al 2021 jiang et al 2016 as as iii is uncharged no charge effects are expected and consequently no relevant work is available in literature however the increased salt passage with the decreased water permeability through nf membranes at high ionic strength can be explained by the shrinking or the compaction of the polymeric matrix caused by reduced charge shielding braghetta et al 1997 eriksson 1988 kilduff et al 2004 this may be relevant to as iii retention the presence of om has increased the retention of as v by nf boussouga et al 2021 xie et al 2013 yu et al 2013 such enhancement in as v retention can be explained by different mechanisms i formation of as om complexes xie et al 2013 ii increase in membrane charge with om boussouga et al 2021 and iii membrane fouling yu et al 2013 fouling can be described as the decrease in the molecular weight cut off mwco of the membrane as pores are blocked or a deposit enhances retention thus enhancing the size exclusion comerton et al 2009 sch√§fer et al 2001 however no relevant work on the impact of om on as iii retention with nf is available to date binding of as with om has been investigated buschmann et al 2006 reported that as v binding with humic acid ha was 6 10 times stronger than with as iii the maximum binding for both species was observed at ph 7 interaction as complexation or adsorption of as with om depends on the functional groups which have different dissociation constants and deprotonate at different ph conditions wang and mulligan 2006 for as iii ha complexes it has been proposed that phenolate functional groups in ha can engage in ligand exchange reaction with as iii through oh release see fig 1 a while carboxylic functional groups form a negatively charged complex with a partial bond h bridges without oh release see fig 1b buschmann et al 2006 in addition the formation of as iii ha complexes can be the result of direct association of as with metals bound to ha see fig 1c such as iron and aluminium which may also bridge as iii to ha fakour and lin 2014 such concept also known as complexation enhanced membrane filtration has been applied for the separation and or enrichment of inorganic ions khosa et al 2014 the aim of such combined process is to reduce the capital and operating costs of the dense polymeric membranes such as nf and ro where the removal of the major inorganic ions can be accomplished khosa et al 2014 likewise polymer enhanced ultrafiltration peuf has been applied which works on the principle of metal polymer binding resulting in macromolecular complexes that can be retained by uf volchek et al 1993 the major challenge in such a process is to select the suitable polymer for an effective complexation with the target inorganic ion y√ºr√ºm et al 2013 a wide range of water soluble polymers with carboxylic or amine groups were used in peuf for metal ions removal recovery from aqueous solutions poly ethylenimine pei for copper cu camarillo et al 2012 sodium polyacrylate pass for nickel ni shao et al 2013 and sericin biopolymer for lead pb cobalt co and zinc zn removal khosa et al 2014 the control of water chemistry such as ph and nacl concentration is necessary in peuf for optimal complexation and hence retention with uf mimoune and amrani 2007 trivunac and stevanovic 2006 this makes the peuf process vulnerable to water quality variations in contrast to the removal of complexed ions with membrane filtration only few works report the removal of uncharged species jana et al 2011 have investigated the removal of as iii via peuf using chitosan based ceramic uf assisted by polyvinyl alcohol pva as complexing agent the high as iii removal 90 from a feed concentration of 500 ¬µg l was explained by pva as iii complexation however the role of chitosan in the modified membrane which is known as an efficient bio adsorbent for as kwok et al 2014 on as iii removal was not discussed results showed a drastic decrease in the water flux from 2 7 to 0 9 l m2 h in filtration this was attributed to gel formation of the pva which decreased the mwco of the uf membrane that would have induced a higher retention in nf complexation enhanced retention has been applied for boron also neutral at neutral ph like as iii using sorbitol as a complexation additive in dual stage nf seawater desalination liu et al 2013 boron concentration in permeate reached 1 mg l from 5 7 mg l at ph 8 3 similarly boron retention with nf ro was enhanced using polyols glycerol and mannitol tu et al 2013 in this work as iii om complexation was used to enhance the performance of nf using different om of different fractions this was motivated by the fact that the different fractions of om can exhibit distinct binding capacity to as in which humic substances have the strongest affinity to as zhang et al 2021 the solute solute interactions defined as the interactions between as iii and om feature prominently in literature as the mechanism responsible for enhancing as retention in the presence of om xia et al 2007 xie et al 2013 yu et al 2013 these studies however were unable to quantify such mechanisms solute solute interactions occurring during the nf separation conversely several other studies have quantified as iii om interactions by using models and analytical methods fakour and lin 2014 liu et al 2011 neubauer et al 2013 liu et al 2011 have investigated as iii ha complexation via iron bridge by using size exclusion chromatography sec uv inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms fakour and lin 2014 performed a high performance liquid chromatography with on line hydride generation and atomic fluorescence spectrometry hplc hg afs to measure the free as iii after as iii ha complexation while the bound as iii was calculated from the difference between the free as iii and total as iii measured by icp coupled with an optical emission spectrometer icp oes neubauer et al 2013 investigated arsenic association to om in boreal catchments by using flow field flow fractionation coupled to icp ms fff icp ms and found that as iii om complexation is ph dependent these studies were conducted for the purpose of understanding as iii om interactions it remains an exciting challenge to link this as iii om complexation to membrane retention mechanisms in the previous investigation on as v boussouga et al 2021 it was found that as v permeability decreased in the presence of ha this means that ha hinders the penetration of as and probably affects the distribution of as onto the membrane active layer with ha deposition that enhances the negative surface charge childress and elimelech 1996 in the case of as iii as iii om complexes may play a role in such behaviour in addition static adsorption experiments revealed low adsorption of as iii 0 2 mg g to a polyamide based nf membrane he et al 2016 to investigate this contribution time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims was used for as iii detection in the vicinity of the membrane active layer this method which offers sensitive analysis greater chemical selectivity and lower probing depth than x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps has been widely used for detection of trace elements in polymeric membranes alayemieka et al 2009 dixon et al 2012 this method allows the detection and distribution of arsenic in the membrane active layer and thus differentiates arsenic adsorbed to the active layer and penetration hindrance caused by ha arsenic v can be retained 90 by nf membranes despite variable water chemistry boussouga et al 2021 as iii which is the most toxic form of as and occurs in groundwater of reducing conditions low dissolved oxygen cannot be effectively removed in order to better understand the retention mechanisms of as iii nf performance was investigated with regard to ph salinity and the presence of different om the implication of as iii ha complexation on as iii retention with nf was studied through fff icp ms to quantify the bound as iii tof sims analysis was performed to evaluate as iii deposition adsorption in the membrane active layer in the presence of ha 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanofiltration system nanofiltration experiments were conducted using a cross flow unit that contained a membrane filtration cell mms membrane systems switzerland that could hold a membrane with an active membrane area of 4 7 10 3 m2 a

conditions were identical 0 45 l min for the feed flow rate qf while the permeate flow rates qp were fixed at 1 and 9 ml min for nf90 and nf270 respectively this corresponded to a controlled recovery of 0 2 and 2 for nf90 and nf270 respectively flow rates were controlled with a proportional integral derivative pid controller in a data acquisition system national instruments cdaq chassis 9184 data collection was based on labview 2014 software 32bit national instruments usa this setting was required due to the different membrane permeability and rejection characteristics in presence of om and at high salinity conditions the filtration protocol see table s1 with controlled qp was adapted from imbrogno and sch√§fer 2019 in which the pressure was the controlled parameter 2 2 data analysis as iii retention as iii flux jas iii and as iii permeability pas iii were the main parameters used to evaluate the performance of the studied nf membranes p as iii was calculated using the combined solution diffusion film theory model murthy and gupta 1997 in this case the diffusion was assumed to be the only factor affecting transport while the contribution of the convection in the solute transport was assumed to be constant due to the controlled solvent water flux the same approach was applied in the previous study where the retention of as v was investigated boussouga et al 2021 the equations used are listed in table 1 while the detailed calculations of the error analysis are described in section 18 of si 2 3 nanofiltration membranes two nf membranes namely nf90 tight nf and nf270 loose nf from dupont usa were used these polymeric membranes were of asymmetric and thin film composite type the active layer was semi aromatic piperazine based polyamide for nf270 and fully aromatic polyamide for

nguyen et al 2021 2 6 field flow fractionation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry asymmetric flow field flow fractionation fff was coupled on line with icp ms to evaluate the as iii ha complexation as a function of ha concentration for this the concentrate flow detector flow outlet of the fff af2000 multiflow fff system postnova landsberg germany was connected in turn to a uv vis detector prominence spd 20a shimadzu japan and then to icp ms agilent model j8403a 7900 icp ms japan icp ms data acquisition was synchronised with the novafff af2000 2 0 9 9 software postnova of the fff by enabling remote data acquisition in the mass hunter 4 4 software agilent japan of the icp ms the calibration was performed using standard solutions of as iii from 0 to 250 ¬µg l injected in fff sample acidification was performed prior to the icp ms in the nebuliser by mixing it with the internal standard icp ms internal standard mix 5188 6525 agilent at 5 hno3 the calibration curve was plotted with respect to the peak area of the icp ms signals see figure s14 the icp ms signal was recorded corresponding to as m z 75 with a set detector flow rate of 0 3 ml min in the fff step a 1 kda ultrafiltration uf membrane plhac ultracel millipore was used in the fff channel equipped with a 500 ¬µm thick spacer and placed in a cooling chamber fff channel thermostat pn4020 postnova landsberg germany with a fixed temperature of 25 c the 1 kda uf membrane was used because it is capable of retaining ha average mw 4 kda nghiem et al 2008 sch√§fer et al 2001 while as iii mw 1 kda can pass through the membrane was thoroughly washed with 1 l of milli q before installation in the channel prior to analysis the membrane was flushed with milli q and eluent 10 mm nacl ph 8 each for 1h at feed flow rate 1 5 ml min focus flow rate 0 5 ml min and permeate flow rate 1 5 ml min the elution program consisted of three steps namely i injection and focusing ii elution and iii rinsing steps with a total run time of 34 min during the injection and focusing step 50 ¬µl of samples were injected into the fff channel using the autosampler pn5300 postnova landsberg germany at an injection flow rate of 0 2 ml min duration 0 8 min focus flow rate of 1 1 ml min for the duration of 0 8 min and then reduced to 0 ml min in 0 2 min and permeate flow rate of 1 ml min during the elution step the permeate flow rate was reduced from 1 to 0 ml min in 15 minutes by a power function with an exponent 3 these flows were found to provide the best particle separation based on size or mw for the chosen membrane 2 7 time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims was performed using a tof sims 5 ion tof gmbh germany for as detection throughout the membrane during the fouling deposits at different ha concentrations the instrument was equipped with a bi cluster primary ion source and a reflection type tof analyser 25 kev bi3 ions were used as primary ions 0 3 pa target current 125 ¬µs cycle time field of view 500 500 ¬µm2 mass scale calibration was performed on the ch ch2 ch3 k ca and fe signals deviations were below 1 5 mu the method was adapted from benz et al 2020 in which the same instrument was used for the total as deposited in the nf membranes sims dual beam depth profiling experiments eroding the specimen with an argon cluster beam while constantly recording mass spectra with the bi primary ion beam were performed independent of the oxidation and charging state of as species used in aqueous media arsenic is always detected as a single charged secondary ion as in sims for the nf90 membranes from filtration experiments with varying ha concentrations the dual beam depth profiling was performed with 5 kev ar1300 cluster ions target current 3 2 na and crater size 700 700 ¬µm2 in a non interlaced sequence after two imaging scans 4 sputter frames were performed followed by a 1 s pause for charge compensation 20 ev electron flood gun for the nf270 membranes from filtration experiments with varying ha concentrations harsher erosion conditions were needed to pass through the ha deposit and the active membrane layer for these samples the dual beam depth profiling was performed using 10 kev ar1500 cluster ions target current 8 5 na and crater size 750 750 ¬µm2 in a non interlaced sequence after two imaging scans 3 sputter frames were performed followed by a 1 s pause for charge compensation 20 ev electron flood gun therefore data from both sets are not directly comparable prior to tof sims measurements the membrane samples were dried using a vacuum freeze dryer martin christ model alpha 2 4 lscplus germany and kept in a desiccator to avoid absorption of water from the air before the analysis 3 results and discussion arsenic iii retention was investigated with two selected nf membranes nf270 and nf90 while varying ph and ionic strength at constant permeate flow rate qp conditions the implication of different om on as iii retention was studied with a focus on the effect of ha concentration in which as iii ha interaction was evaluated by fff icp ms and as iii membrane interaction with tof sims the first parameter investigated was ph to establish as iii retention mechanisms with nf 3 1 mechanisms of as iii retention with nanofiltration in aqueous solutions as iii species remain neutral h3aso3 0 until ph 9 where the monovalent h2aso3 species dominates meng et al 2000 to establish how as iii speciation influences the performance of nf the retention of as iii was investigated over a wide range of ph 2 to 12 see fig 3 given that as iii is uncharged from ph 2 to 9 it was expected that low as iii retention would be observed with the negatively charged nf membranes studied supplementary data on the salt retention water flux and transmembrane pressure tmp changes can be found in figure s9 at neutral ph as iii retention with nf90 40 and nf270 20 is lower than the target retention to comply with who and bangladesh guidelines for a typical 250 ¬µg l as iii feed concentration fig 3a and b however from ph 9 to 12 the retention increased to 59 and 77 for nf270 and nf90 respectively this was attributed to as iii deprotonation that formed the monovalent h2aso3 while it appears that increasing the ph is the solution for enhancing as iii retention polyamide thin film composite tfc membranes are typically not designed for long term treatment of strong alkaline solutions it has been reported that operating such membranes at high ph 10 12 increases their pore size and active layer thickness and thus losing their integrity al amoudi et al 2008 dalwani et al 2011 freger et al 2005 for this reason the long term operation of nf270 and nf90 is recommended at ph range 3 10 dupont 2021 however in this study the nf membranes were used for short term operation and their performance in terms of pure water flux was maintained after the filtration at the studied ph range 2 12 see figure s18 at ph 9 as iii remains uncharged in the feed solutions and thus the size exclusion is the predominant mechanism furthermore nf90 with tighter pores rp 0 29 0 02 nm table s3 showed higher as iii retention than the nf270 with more open pores rp 0 34 0 04 nm table s3 above ph 9 h2aso3 predominates in the feed solutions and thus donnan exclusion occurs in the retention mechanisms with both nf membranes this explains the drastic decrease in jas iii and pas iii see fig 3c and d especially for nf270 which is more negative than nf90 at ph 9 idil mouhoumed et al 2014 therefore the retention of as iii at ph 9 depends on the size exclusion with no contribution by charge repulsion it is anticipated that charge shielding by ionic strength plays no role in as iii retention and this is subsequently investigated 3 2 as iii retention at different salinities the increase in the ionic strength reduces the electrostatic interactions that contribute to the retention of charged species shang et al 2014 for the uncharged species such as h3aso3 0 it is expected that ionic strength 0 58 to 20 g l nacl will not alter the retention of as iii see fig 4 salt retention water flux tmp and ph data can be found in figure s8 varying nacl concentration did not have a major effect on as iii retention fig 4a this is true for jas iii where nf90 showed values around 2 10 5 mol m2 h while nf270 values were one order of magnitude 20 10 5 mol m2 h higher fig 4c however the minor effects when increasing nacl concentration from 0 58 g l to 2 g l were only observed when investigating pas iii fig 4d this could be attributed to changes in the effective pore size of the membrane due to polymer matrix shrinking kilduff et al 2004 it should be noted that the increase in the driving force at constant water flux conditions when increasing nacl concentration did not contribute to as iii retention this is in contrast to nacl see figure s8 in summary high salinity in groundwater had no significant effects on the nf performance for as iii removal at constant water flux conditions however the presence of om in groundwater may influence the performance of nf separation as it was observed in the previous study on as v boussouga et al 2021 which showed higher as v retention in the presence of ha that enhances the charge repulsion between the membrane and as v species this mechanism might not be so significant in the case of as iii which is present as an uncharged species at ph 9 for this reason the impact of om on as iii rejection is the next parameter to be investigated 3 3 implication of organic matter on as iii retention the presence of om in as iii contaminated groundwater may influence the performance of nf with as iii retention it has been found that as iii tends to interact with om such as ha to form complexes buschmann et al 2006 for this reason as iii retention with nf membranes was investigated in the presence of different om types ha wf fp ta and aa fig 5 formation of as iii om complexes can be observed by enhanced as iii retention salt retention water flux tmp and ph data can be found in figure s10 the retention of as iii varied in the presence of different om types at 10 mgc l the highest as iii retention was achieved with ha whereas the lowest retention was observed in the presence of aa fig 5a in contrast to different om aa had a significant impact on pas iii that increased from 182 to 701 l m2 h and from 25 to 68 l m2 h with nf270 and nf90 respectively fig 5d this can be attributed to the formation of a fouling layer in the presence of aa known as a complex polymer and model fouling meng and liu 2013 that increased the tmp when operating at constant water fluxes figure s10 such behaviour can also be explained by the significant impact on cm cp and thus as iii retention wf fp and ta showed no measurable effect on as iii retention in contrast to aa while ha indicated higher as iii retention this means that i either no significant solute solute interactions occurred or ii concentration polarisation and thus cm has been altered by fouling formation particularly for aa see figure s11 such behaviour can be linked to molecular composition and hence om fractions that may i interact with as iii or ii affect as iii transport through the membrane to clarify the retention of om fractions lc ocd characterisation was performed 3 4 characteristics of organic matter in feed and permeates ha has been shown to cause a marginally higher as iii retention compared to other om or without om to evaluate which fractions were responsible and to establish the mechanisms involved ha wf fp and aa in the feed and permeates were characterised by lc ocd see fig 6 ocd signal for ta which is an aromatic compound was not detectable due to its adsorption in the column toc retention of different oms can be found in figure s12 ha which showed higher as iii retention is mainly composed of the hs fraction which was completely retained by both nf270 and nf90 fig 6a fp which had no effect on as iii retention is composed of bb and low molecular weight lmw fractions neutral and of small size shen and sch√§fer 2015 nf270 was not able to retain lmw while nf90 achieved approximately 80 fig 6b this explains the low toc retention in the case of fp see figure s12 aa is characterised by bio fractions that were completely retained by both membranes fig 6c wf is a combination of hs and bb that was retained by nf while a small peak appeared in permeates which can be linked to some lmw fig 6c apparently the om composed of hs either increased as iii retention as the case of ha or had no impact such as wf for this reason ha was chosen for further investigation at different salinities and ph since these two parameters influence the chemistry of ha colombo et al 2015 owusu agyeman et al 2017 3 5 as iii retention in presence of ha with salinity and ph variations the negative charge of ha increases with ph due to the dissociation of the carboxylic groups pka 4 and phenol functional groups pka 9 ritchie and perdue 2003 as iii ha complexation occurs preferentially at higher ph buschmann et al 2006 liu and cai 2010 consequently ren et al 2017 concluded that the presence of ha may affect as speciation for this reason the retention of as iii was investigated in the presence of ha while varying ph fig 7 no significant enhancement of as iii retention occurred with either nf membrane in the presence of ha over the ph range 2 to 8 where the neutral as iii species dominated however at ph 9 where the monovalent h2aso3 is the predominant as iii species the presence of ha increased as iii retention by approximately 10 see fig 7a this small increase in as iii can be explained by two possible mechanisms i as iii ha complexation at higher ph in which the trace iron present in ha may have bridged as iii to ha or ii the increase in membrane charge by ha thus increasing the charge repulsion of h2aso3 species while jas iii did not reveal the impact of ha fig 7c pas iii values at the ph range 2 to 6 indicated that as iii permeance though the membrane was affected by ha particularly with nf270 in this case the two possible mechanisms are i as iii ha complexation and ii the formation of a ha fouling gel layer the fouling layer was more visible at ph 2 where the membranes were positively charged fig 7e the possible mechanisms of as iii retention in the presence of ha are depicted in fig 8 the decreased as iii permeability particularly with nf270 at low ph range 2 to 4 revealed that membrane fouling with 10 mgc l could be the main mechanism this was further investigated with tof sims as a function of different ha concentrations see section 3 8 in addition to ph the size of ha and ultimately its deposition on the membrane surface is also affected by the ionic strength due to aggregation colombo et al 2015 for this reason the increase in salinity nacl concentration was investigated in the presence of 10 mgc l ha at ph 8 fig 9 high nacl concentration could enhance membrane fouling and thus decrease as iii permeability assuming that membrane fouling is most dominant retention mechanism in the presence of ha ha in the feed solution has no measurable impact on as iii retention fig 9a as well as on jas iii fig 9c with increasing the nacl concentration however pas iii revealed that the diffusivity of as iii through nf270 decreased as the nacl concentration was increased while a low impact was observed with nf90 fig 9d this resulted in a similar performance in terms of as iii retention of both nf270 and nf90 at high nacl concentration 20g l in summary the presence of 10 mgc l ha showed no significant impact on as iii retention at different salinities however at this stage the responsible mechanisms for the observed decrease in as iii permeability attributed to the presence of ha cannot be entirely determined at ph 8 the effect of the increase in membrane charge can be excluded as as iii is uncharged while the aggregation of ha at high salinity also had no significant impact on as iii retention it is possible that the concentrations were simply too low to detect complexation effects at similar conditions 14 mgc l ha and 200 ¬µg l as iii it has been reported that only 3 of as iii was complexed at ph 7 liu and cai 2010 in addition buschmann et al 2006 reported that as iii ha complexation is measurable only at very low as iii toc ratios approximately at as iii toc 0 001 with fixed ha concentration 100 mgc l for this reason the ha concentration was increased to evaluate as iii retention 3 6 enhanced complexation through increased ha concentration filtration experiments were performed with variable ha concentration 0 100 mgc l to enhance complexation which was controlled by as iii toc ratios see fig 10 salt retention and fouling data can be found in figure s13 with increasing ha concentration from 0 to 100 mgc l as iii retention with nf was increased by around 40 for both nf membranes see fig 10a at these conditions the permeate quality was close to the bangladesh as iii guideline 50 ¬µg l at 100 mgc l ha concentration fig 10b both jas iii and pas iii decreased with the ha concentration jas iii decreased from 18 10 5 to 8 10 5 mol m2 h nf270 and 1 4 10 5 to 0 6 10 5 mol m2 h nf90 fig 10c and pas iii from 267 5 to 10 1 l m2 h nf270 and 10 to 1 6 l m2 h nf90 fig 10d the observed increase in as iii retention with nf with increasing ha concentration can be attributed to two possibilities i formation of a ha gel layer on the membrane surface and hence decrease as iii permeability or ii the formation of as ha complexes that are more likely to be retained the first mechanism may be valid for nf270 given the observed decline in permeability due to fouling when ha concentration was increased to 100 mgc l see figure s13 however the second mechanism may be also relevant for both nf membranes since the as iii toc ratio was lower 0 002 which can allow a measurable as iii ha interaction in addition it has been reported that the typical values of total acidities carboxylic and phenolate groups of ha similar type to this work were 6 5 8 0 mmol g liu et al 2011 based on these values and the toc of ha stock solution 502 mgc l in 2 g l ha the feed solutions of 100 mgc l have approximately 2 6 3 2 mmol l of total acidities these values are approximately four orders of magnitude higher than the as iii concentration 250¬µg l as iii which corresponds to 0 4 10 3 mmol l h3aso3 for this reason an fff icp ms coupling analysis was performed in order to quantify the as iii ha interaction as a function of ha concentration 3 7 as iii ha binding detection with fff icp ms as iii ha binding in the feed solution as a function of ha concentration 0 100 mgc l with a fixed as iii concentration 250 ¬µg l was investigated by fff icp ms coupling since as iii interacts with ha at very low as iii toc ratios more bound as iii was detected at high ha concentration as expected fig 11 as iii bound was calculated following eq s7 the chromatogram of as detection in fff icp ms can be found in figure s15 and the uv data in figure s16 the peak area of as signal in the icp ms directly coupled to fff increased with the increasing ha concentration fig 11 it should be noted that in the icp ms the as signal was not affected by the presence of ha in the sample matrix see figure s3 which was highly diluted by the eluent 10 mm nacl from the fff step the increase of as signal in the icp ms can be explained by the decrease of as iii passage through the uf membrane in the fff which was presumably caused by as iii ha complexation this binding of as iii to ha occurred at a low as iii toc ratio high ha concentration this concurs with the observation of buschmann et al 2006 and explains the increase of as iii retention with ha concentration in the nf experiments it can therefore be concluded that as iii ha complexation is indeed the responsible mechanism for the increase in a iii retention with nf in the presence of high ha concentration 100 mgc l ph 8 this complexation means that ha could have been deposited during the filtration experiments on the membrane in the form of an as iii ha complex rather than by permeation through the membrane the deposition of ha presumably as as iii complex has resulted in a reduction of membrane water permeability further investigations with tof sims were performed to verify the presence of as in the deposits specifically the distribution of as iii in the deposit layer the active layer or throughout the membrane was investigated at different ha concentrations 3 8 as iii ha deposition in membrane active layer the investigation with fff icp ms indicated that as iii ha interaction increases with ha concentration which prompted the investigation of whether as is found in deposits furthermore if as iii ha complexes are formed it could be expected that as deposition on the membrane surface will increase with ha deposition tof sims analysis of both nf membranes used to filter 250 ¬µg l as iii at different ha concentrations results of depth integrated as signal are shown in fig 12 whereas depth integrated images can be found in figure s17 with nf90 the amount of as in the membranes dropped on the addition of 10 mgc l ha see fig 12a further increasing the ha concentration to 100 mgc l did not yield a clear sequence correlation with as signals however for nf270 the as signal increased on the addition of 10 mgc l ha fig 12b in the absence of ha where nf90 had approximately twice the as iii retention as compared to nf270 see fig 3a the amount of as iii bound to the nf90 membrane was approximately 10 times higher than on the nf270 membrane the difference between arsenic detection in the membrane samples used for experiments without ha could be attributed to pas iii which was greater in the case of nf270 and thus less deposition of as iii may have occurred compared to nf90 see fig 10 in both cases arsenic deposition on the membranes was laterally very non uniform see figure s17 these two different behaviours of as signal in the membrane active layer can be explained by the different fouling characteristics of nf270 and nf90 it appears that the increased amount of ha in the case of nf270 caused higher as iii deposition in its complex form as iii ha and reduced water permeability while this is not the case with nf90 which exhibited lower water permeability reduction figure s13a this means that less as iii ha deposit has occurred for nf90 compared to nf270 hence higher as iii signals have been detected in the case of nf270 samples used for the ha experiments in contrasts to nf90 that exhibited less as iii adsorption in the polyamide active layer this could be hindered by as iii ha complex formation in the feed solution see fig 13 to further clarify the role of the active layer thickness and ha deposition on as iii signals depth profiles of arsenic and the membrane material signals as functions of sputtering times were investigated see fig 14 as shown in fig 14a and c arsenic is found within the active layer of the nf90 membrane during depth profiling as signal fig 14a decreased together with cn and cno fig 14c indicating the polyamine active layer s and so2 both from the polysulfone support layer are increasing around 12 min erosion time therefore it can be concluded that in the absence of ha as iii species interact with the polyamide in the active layer of nf90 and nf270 the nf90 membrane is much thicker and consequently captures more as iii in contrast to the behaviour of the arsenic depth profiles on nf90 which show a fast drop with rather mild erosion conditions applied low argon cluster energy and current the nf270 samples required much harsher erosion conditions even with this harsher erosion the actual total as iii in the sample with 100 mgc l ha concentration was underestimated since as signals from deeper layers of the membrane remained high fig 14b whereas the depth integrated signals of cn increased if the applied solutions contained increasing amounts of ha cno and s did not change strongly see table 2 although the ha does not yield very characteristic signals in sims due to its ill defined chemistry including broad mw distribution and strong intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds these data shown in table 2 indicated the deposition of ha on the nf270 membrane at ph 8 this deposit was not yet visible to the naked eye fig 7f however sims can pick up strong changes as shown ha must contain sulphur presumably in low oxidation states like thiols sulphides or disulphides but no so2 moieties karanfil et al 1996 reported a sulphur content of 0 2 to 0 7 depending on the origin of the ha the so2 signals on the other hand remained characteristic for the polysulfone supporting membrane in the nf270 their decrease with increased ha load in test solutions is due to the ha layer built on top of the polyamide active layer retarding the exposure of the polysulfone layer during the depth profiling finally it was also confirmed that ha contains nitrogen in the form of amines and possibly other groups but no amides these would yield cno signals in sims therefore cno secondary ions detected remained attributed only to the active layer of nf270 polyamide and so2 signals to the underlying polysulfone layer tof sims experiments revealed that as iii attachment to the membrane active layer is affected by the thickness and ultimately by the amount of polyamide in the active layer further in the case of nf90 which exhibited lower fouling compared to nf270 ha reduced the presence of as iii in the active layer and thus its diffusion to the permeate for nf270 which has a higher fouling potential than nf90 the increase in ha concentration presumably deposited on the membrane as as iii ha complex increased the amount of as iii in the active layer 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to evaluate the retention mechanism of as iii with nf over a broad range of ph 2 12 salinities 0 58 20 g l different om types ha wf fp ta aa and ha concentration 0 100 mgc l increasing the ph from 8 to 12 and ultimately changing the as iii speciation from h3aso3 0 to h2aso3 increased as iii retention from 13 to 59 nf270 and 34 to 77 nf90 this confirms the importance of the charge exclusion with both nf membranes for the retention of dissociated h2aso3 species while size exclusion is dominant for the neutral species h3aso3 0 arsenic iii retention in the presence of different om types revealed that only ha had a measurable increase on as iii retention om characterisation using lc ocd revealed that ha was characterised by hs fractions which may be responsible for enhancing as iii retention further experiments on as iii retention in the presence of 10 mgc l ha showed that at ph 9 ha increased as iii retention by 10 which can be attributed to the increase in the membrane charge at ph 9 where the neutral as iii species dominates the feed solution no significant enhancement of as iii retention was observed at different salinities no significant impact on as iii retention was observed in the presence of 10 mgc l ha to determine the role of ha concentration on as iii ha complexation ha concentration was increased from 0 to 100 mgc l which resulted in an increase in as iii retention of approximately 40 with both nf membranes this was attributed to the contribution of solute solute interactions as iii ha complexation to the retention mechanisms of as iii with nf complexation was confirmed with fff icp ms where the as iii bound increased with ha concentration tof sims measurements performed on the membranes used for ha free nf experiments revealed that higher amounts of as iii were found in nf90 than in nf270 this leads to the conclusion that as iii species interaction with the membrane is higher with a thicker polyamide active layer nf90 in this case in the presence of ha the amount of as iii in the active layer decreased for nf90 whereas it increased in the case of nf270 these different behaviours can be explained by ha deposition presumably as as iii ha complex on the membrane in the case of nf270 and the higher surface roughness in the case of nf90 this study highlights the significance of the role of solute solute interactions defined by as iii ha complexation on enhancing the performance of nf in terms of as iii retention this is of importance for further investigations required on i enhancing as iii ha binding by focusing on the ternary complexation where the iron content in ha can be increased and ii using a specific complex agent with similar elevated binding characteristics as ha high acidities loading that can be used for water treatment applications this will compete well with

16873,the uv h2o2 process is a benchmark advanced oxidation process aop that in situ generates highly reactive and nonselective hydroxyl radical oh to oxidatively destroy a wide range of organic compounds accurately quantifying the concentration of short lived oh is essential to predict process performance optimize the operation parameters and compare with other process options the oh concentration is typically measured using organic probe molecules that react with oh but not with other oxidants in the extremely well characterized uv h2o2 system in which oh is proven to be the dominant oxidant using photolysis resistant probes such as benzoic acid and its derivatives is a widely agreed and practiced norm we herein report that certain oh probe compounds can be degraded in uv h2o2 system by unknown reactive species that has not been reported in the past several common organic probes particularly p substituted benzoic acid compounds i e p hydroxybenzoic acid p chlorobenzoic acid and p phthalic acid were found to be vulnerable to attack by the unknown reactive species leading to false quantification of oh concentration under high radical scavenging conditions lines of evidence obtained from a series of oh scavenging experiments performed under various conditions i e different concentrations of h2o2 oh probe compounds and dissolved oxygen point toward excited state h2o2 the results from this study suggest the importance of using appropriate oh probe compounds in mechanistic studies and needs for considering the unidentified role of excited state of h2o2 on the uv h2o2 process and related aops keywords hydrogen peroxide uv advanced oxidation probe excited state 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops aim at degrading a wide range of organic pollutants by highly reactive and nonselective oxidants such as hydroxyl radical oh since these radicals are short lived they are produced on site for instance through the activation of stable peroxide containing precursors such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the photolysis of h2o2 by ultraviolet irradiation at 254 nm i e uv h2o2 system is one of the most widely used aops in the uv h2o2 system the removal efficiency of target organic pollutants depends on the concentration of oh which is the main oxidant the oh concentration often reported in its steady state value oh ss is largely influenced by the water matrix constituents acting as oh scavengers e g natural organic matter nom co3 2 etc rosenfeldt and linden 2007 gligorovski et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2019 kang et al 2018 and

strategies due to its transient nature and extremely low concentration it is very challenging to directly measure oh concentration in complex water matrices burns et al 2012 fern√°ndez castro et al 2015 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 instead oh is generally quantified indirectly using probe compounds ideal probe compounds are resistant to oxidation by oxidants other than oh therefore the decrease in their concentration in the reaction system can be directly correlated to oh ss various aromatic acids have been used as oh probe compounds including benzoic acid yang et al 2014 lee et al

czili and horv√°th 2008 jing and chaplin 2017 among others these probes are used in a very small quantity such that oh consumption rate by the probe is negligible compared to that by oh scavengers i e k oh p probe i k oh s scavenger where k oh p and k oh s are the second order rate constants for the reaction of oh with probe compounds and oh scavengers respectively this ensures that the oxidation system is not perturbed by the addition of the probe consequently the oh concentration is maintained at steady state i e oh ss and the decay of probes can be assumed to follow the pseudo first order kinetics by measuring the kinetics of probe compound decay k obs which often follows the first order kinetics oh ss can be obtained as follow 1 ln probe probe 0 k obs t k oh p oh ss t this probe approach has been foundational for many if not all uv h2o2 aop studies in assessing their oh production efficiency and establishing kinetics and mechanisms of oh driven oxidation of pollutants in the literature we here question whether this long practiced convention of using probe compounds to measure oh has any unforeseen pitfall we examined the degradation of twenty organic compounds that have been employed as oh probes and model pollutants in the past studies in uv h2o2 system we employed aliphatic alcohols such as methanol meoh ethanol etoh and tert butanol t buoh in excess amount as surrogate oh quenchers note that such oh scavenging has been also widely practiced to block oh mediated oxidation pathway during mechanistic investigations this allowed us to create an nearly oh free uv h2o2 system to examine whether there is any unexpected reaction that does not involve oh a comprehensive set of experiments were performed by varying reaction conditions e g different concentrations of oh probes h2o2 and dissolved oxygen do we discovered the occurrence of previously unidentified reactive species in this decades old benchmark aop and present a critical guidance for the selection of proper probe compounds for future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals used were of reagent grade and used without further purification the following 20

all solutions 2 2 water samples three different types of water samples were collected from the cheonggye stream in seoul for natural water and from two other wastewater treatment plants in daegu for secondary effluent and ro concentrate in korea all water samples were filtered with a 0 45 Œºm filter and stored at 4 c prior to use the water quality parameters of the water samples are summarized in table s1 2 3 batch experimental procedure the uv h2o2 experiments were performed with 20 ml solutions in a 40 ml cylindrical quartz reactor at air equilibrated conditions do concentration 0 29 mm and

proceeded for 10 minutes samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals for analysis oxidation of the selected oh probes by ultrasound o3 h2o2 and fe ii h2o2 systems were also examined details of the procedures are described in text s3 all the experiments were carried out in duplicates or triplicates the average values with range of repeated results as error bars are presented 2 4 oh scavenging efficiency the degradation of oh probe obtained in this study followed the first order kinetics with the rate constant of k obs because a relatively high concentration of h2o2 i e 10 mm was applied which served as an oh scavenger note that we corrected direct uv photolysis based on the results of control experiments performed under uv irradiation without h2o2 see text s4 and figs s2 s4 for detailed procedure and results when oh scavenger is added the k obs value is reduced denoted as k obs s since oh ss is decreased from the experimentally measured k obs and k obs s values the observed oh scavenging efficiency se was evaluated using eq 2 2 observed oh se 1 k obs s k obs 100 the theoretical se can be calculated using the second order rate constants for the reactions of oh with h2o2 and a oh scavenger k oh h 2 o 2 and k oh s respectively as follows refer to text s5 for detailed derivation 3 theoretical oh se k oh s s k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 k oh s s 100 we here defined the difference between the theoretical oh se and the observed oh se as Œ¥se eq 3 eq 2 if the oh scavenger inhibited the probe compound degradation as expected based on the rate constants Œ¥se would be zero any non zero Œ¥se would indicate that there is an additional factor that leads to probe compound degradation even when oh is quenched by the scavenger 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of twenty oh probe compounds was measured using a rapid separation liquid chromatography rslc ultimate 3000 dionex the oxidation products of p pa were analyzed using rslc coupled with a quadrupole time

orion star a326 thermo scientific equipped with the relevant probes 3 results and discussion 3 1 presence of unknown reactive species kinetics of the degradation of twenty oh probe compounds k oh p 0 25 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 refer to table s2 for details in the uv h2o2 system are shown in fig 1 a they all followed pseudo first order kinetics ranging from 1 3 10 2 to 3 3 10 2 s 1 the steady state oh concentrations oh ss estimated from these kinetics and eq 1 were at fairly similar levels average 3 3 10 12 m with a standard deviation of 1 0 10 12 m adding an excess amount 1 m 106 times more than probes of oh scavenger meoh k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 to these reaction systems would theoretically reduce oh ss by 99 97 therefore the degradation of oh probe compounds by oh should be nearly completely prohibited consistent results were obtained with twelve target compounds i e o hba m hba o cba p iba p bba o pa ffa p cp apap bzf ibp and cbz as shown in the top panel of fig 1b the degradation kinetics were reduced to less than 3 0 10 4 s 1 and the oh se ranged from 98 4 to 100 close to the theoretical oh se of 99 97 the average value of oh ss estimated with these twelve probe compounds according to the kinetics in fig 1b was 142 1 times lower than that obtained with all twenty probes mentioned above confirming the underlying premise that only oh is responsible for the degradation of these oh probing compounds surprisingly eight oh probe compounds i e ba p hba m cba p cba p fba m pa p pa and phenol still showed noticeable degradation with k obs s values ranging from 1 0 10 3 to 1 6 10 2 s 1 even when 1 m meoh was added bottom panel of fig 1b for example k obs for p pa 1 7 10 2 s 1 should have been reduced by 3333 fold i e 5 0 10 6 s 1 in the presence of 1 m meoh but the obtained k obs s was only 2 3 times lower i e 7 3 10 3 s 1 than the k obs considering the extremely low oh ss i e negligible k oh p oh ss in the presence of excess radical scavenger this observation was unexpected and appears contradicting to current understanding on how probes work the results imply that in addition to oh there exists an unknown side reaction i e k obs k oh p oh ss k p ss that leads to the degradation of probe compounds the same oh scavenging experiments were conducted with meoh at 0 01 and 0 1 m the concentrations commonly used in most radical probing studies zhou and mopper 1990 keenan and sedlak 2008 jin et al 2011 zhang and huang 2020 these amounts of radical scavenger would lead to theoretical oh se of 97 23 and 99 72 respectively results are shown in fig 1c in terms of Œ¥se together with the results at 1 m meoh see fig s4 for detailed kinetic data note that a larger Œ¥se means a larger deviation from the anticipated complete inhibition of probe degradation by excess radical scavenger alternatively speaking a larger Œ¥se means that the unknown side reaction has a greater impact on a target oh probe although there were fluctuations depending on the types of probe compounds the overall Œ¥se tended to be roughly constant or slightly decreased as meoh dose increased from 0 01 to 1 m we further investigated the effect of other oh scavengers i e 1 m of etoh and t buoh on Œ¥se for the four oh probes i e ba p hba p cba and p pa and compared the results to those of meoh fig s5 fig s6 for kinetic data in the presence of etoh and t buoh the four oh probes exhibited similar levels of unexplained degradation compared to the case of meoh of the twenty oh probe compounds unexpectedly high Œ¥se values were observed with compounds that share the chemical structure of ba the Œ¥se values at 1 m meoh for the oh probe compounds containing ba structure were in the order of p bba 0 o pa 0 6 p iba 0 7 o cba 0 9 o hba 1 2 m hba 1 4 m cba 7 3 p fba 9 8 ba 10 m pa 16 7 p cba 22 8 p pa 43 7 p hba 48 4 note that this order has no correlation with how fast they react with oh k oh p fig s7 it was found that their Œ¥se values are largely influenced by the type and position of the substituents on the aromatic ring of ba for example for ba structures with different p substituents a larger Œ¥se was observed in the following order of substituents br p

the same trend to understand the selective nature of unknown reactive species we performed quantitative structure activity relationship analysis in general the oxidation of ba would be either promoted or inhibited by electron donating and withdrawing substituents respectively the electronic effect of substituent can be quantitatively expressed as the ratio of dissociation constants between ba a reference compound and its derivatives referred to as substituent constant œÉ hammett 1937 charton 1963 hansch et al 1991 it has been reported that the relative reactivity of ba carrying a given substituent denoted as ba x toward various oxidants can be linearly correlated with the œÉ value according to hammett equation i e Œ∑ œÅœÉ where Œ∑ log k oxidant ba x k oxidant ba and œÅ reaction constant anbar et al 1966 deborde and von gunten 2008 lee and von gunten 2012 in this study k obs and k obs s values were used to obtain Œ∑ values for dominant reactions by oh and the unknown reactive species respectively the hammett plots i e Œ∑ vs œÉ are provided in fig s8 note that the r2 values are small i e 0 55 and 0 45 respectively but the trend in each case showed a clear difference the œÅ value for unknown reactive species was found to be 1 9 the negative œÅ implies that the unknown reactive species is an oxidant lee and von gunten 2012 the magnitude of œÅ is much higher than that of oh 0 48 in this study which is comparable to 0 41 in the literature anbar et al 1966 reflecting a higher reaction selectivity of this unknown oxidant than oh 3 2 identity of the unknown oxidant the above results collectively suggest the existence of an unknown oxidant in uv h2o2 system in this section we investigate the identity of this unknown oxidant by testing several hypothesizes four oh probe compounds i e ba p hba p cba and p pa with high Œ¥se values and three oh scavengers i e meoh etoh and t buoh were used in the experiments one possible scenario is that the reaction between oh and excess oh scavengers produces an intermediate radical species this intermediate species might degrade an oh probe compound resulting in an overestimation of oh ss i e a high Œ¥se scheme 1 it is well known that oh abstracts a hydrogen atom from Œ± carbon of alcohols e g meoh etoh and t buoh to generate carbon centered radicals r asmus et al 1973 under oxic condition the generated r species react with o2 at a diffusion controlled rate 1 4 4 6 109 m 1 s 1 neta and grodkowski 1996 to form peroxyl radicals oor which can further yield alkoxyl radical or via a tetroxide intermediate roo oor bothe and schulte frohlinde 1978 hawkins and davies 2001 collin 2019 since the standard reduction potential values of both oor and or species are estimated to be relatively high i e e oor hoor 1 0 vnhe and e or hor 1 6 vnhe koppenol 1990 these radical species are potential candidates for the unknown oxidants if this were true a high Œ¥se should be observed in other oh production systems as well we tested this hypothesis by performing oh scavenging experiments in three different oh generating systems i e ultrasound o3 h2o2 and fe ii h2o2 fig s9 for Œ¥se and figs s10 s12 for kinetics and degradation efficiency data note that the amount of oh generated was adjusted to degrade 56 94 of oh probe compounds in the absence of oh scavengers if the oor and or species were the unknown reactive species the oh probe compounds should have been degraded in the presence of 1 m oh scavengers like in the uv h2o2 system however the Œ¥se values obtained in the three systems were less than 5 i e excess radical scavenger inhibited probe degradation disproving this hypothesis the aforementioned results obtained with alternative aop schemes that did not use uv irradiation hint the possible contribution of photo excited species scheme 2 we excluded oh scavengers meoh etoh and t buoh considering their very low uv absorbance Œµ 254 nm 0 005 m 1 cm 1 fig s13 for uv absorption spectra we first postulated that the oh probe compound could have been degraded by singlet oxygen 1o2 generated from the excited state oh probe compound scheme 2a it is well known that 1o2 reacts rapidly with various aromatic compounds but less reacts with alcohols i e radical scavengers used in this study wilkinson et al 1995 lee et al 2020a under the uv irradiation a probe compound p can be excited to its singlet state 1p this short lived 10 ns zepp et al 1985 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 species can undergo intersystem crossing to form a more stable excited triplet state 3p which coverts o2 to 1o2 via dexter energy transfer the efficiency of 1o2 production is mainly governed by two key factors abdel shafi et al 2001 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 i the intersystem crossing quantum yield of 1p œÜ isc and ii the yield of 1o2 production from the reaction between 3p and o2 Œ≥ 1 o 2 however there is a dearth of information on these two key factors for the oh probe compounds employed in this study for example in the case of ba a relatively high œÜ isc at 267 nm 0 65 yang et al 2012 was reported but Œ≥ 1 o 2 is not yet reported for other oh probe compounds i e p hba p cba and p pa neither œÜ isc nor Œ≥ 1 o 2 is known therefore we experimentally evaluated the potential occurrence of 1o2 from p using a 1o2 probe compound ffa in the presence of 1 m alcohols as oh scavenger fig s14 we did not observe any degradation of ffa regardless of the type of oh probe compounds and concluded that 1o2 is not the unknown oxidant another possibility is the reactions involving oh probe compound first excited state probe compound especially long lived triplet state may react with other species such as the aforementioned reactive intermediates ri produced from the oxidation of alcohol scavengers by oh e g oor or and h2o2 i e p ri or h2o2 scheme 2b however the reaction of p and ri is not likely considering their extremely low steady state concentrations taking the reaction between triplet excited ba and ooch2oh the oor species from the oxidation of meoh by oh as an example their steady state concentrations were estimated to be 4 0 10 17 m and 3 1 10 8 m respectively refer to text s7 for detailed calculations the remaining possibility is the reaction between ground state probe and excited state h2o2 p 1h2o2 scheme 2c if p were the mediator Œ¥se would increase as the concentration of oh probe compound increases likewise if 1h2o2 is the unknown oxidant the steady state concentration of h2o2 will increase as h2o2 concentration increases resulting in a decrease in the observed oh se and eventually an increase in Œ¥se eq 4 4 Œ¥ se theoretical oh se 100 1 k obs s k obs 100 Œ¥ se 100 1 k oh p oh ss s 0 k p ss s k oh p oh ss k p ss 100 to verify this hypothesis we conducted oh scavenging experiments by varying the concentration of h2o2 fig 2 fig s15 for kinetic data as the concentration of h2o2 with a molar absorptivity of 19 6 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm baxendale and wilson 1956 increases from 1 to 1000 mm the fraction of uv absorption by h2o2 f 254 h 2 o 2 increases from 70 96 3 to 99 96 100 while the fractions of uv absorption by each target compound f 254 p decrease from 3 7 30 2 to 0 0 04 depending on the oh probe compounds refer to table s2 and fig s16 for their molar absorptivity values as shown in fig 2 overall Œ¥se values continuously increased in response to increasing h2o2 concentration implying that 1h2o2 is likely the unknown oxidant the results also suggest that the role of p is less important since the highest Œ¥se values for each oh probe compound were found under the conditions where the oh probe compounds were barely exposed to uv light i e due to high h2o2 concentration in marked contrast Œ¥se values remained almost constant regardless of the changes in the oh probe concentration from 0 1 to 100 Œºm fig 3 fig s17 for kinetic data further excluding the possibility that p is the main factor causing unknown side reaction we further observed that the degree of radical scavenging and hence the probe compound degradation are affected by the level of do fig 4 fig s18 for kinetic data we found that Œ¥se values increased under anoxic conditions compared to ambient do conditions conversely very low Œ¥se were observed under o2 saturated conditions these results are likely related to the fact that the ground state molecular oxygen can quench the excited molecules abdel shafi and wilkinson 2000 wilkinson 2009 rohatgi mukherjee 2013 h2o2 in our system if o2 consumes h2o2 probe compounds would not degrade in the presence of high radical scavengers lowering Œ¥se when do is low h2o2 would not be quenched by o2 but rather react with probe compounds the deactivation of h2o2 to h2o2 by 3o2 may proceed through an energy transfer process that does not involve 1o2 although there are no prior studies that can confirm this pathway the bimolecular interaction between h2o2 and organic compounds has not been reported to date since there is no fluorescence emission from h2o2 and its estimated lifetime 60 fs klee et al 1986 is extremely short scherer and zewail 1987 it is impossible to directly detect h2o2 bhattacharjee and das 2007 however the occurrence of h2o2 assumed to be in its singlet state 1h2o2 during the photodissociation of h2o2 at 193 266 nm has been investigated in the gas phase using a laser induced fluorescence coupled with doppler spectroscopy anisotropic angular distribution of recoiling oh photofragments which are further pumped into excited state oh oh by the second laser pulse has been analyzed by measuring fluorescence emission from the relaxation of oh ondrey et al 1983 docker et al 1986 gericke et al 1986 gruenwald et al 1987 chang et al 2011 the occurrence of exited state h2o2 has been also supported by several ab initio simulations bersohn and shapiro 1986 chevaldonnet et al 1986 reinsch 1987 zhang and zhang 1993 cai et al 1994 the highest occupied molecular orbital of the electronic ground state of trans planar h2o2 are 4ag 25au 24bg 2 under uv irradiation at 193 266 nm one of two 4bg electrons in nonbonding orbital on the o atom is promoted to 5bu orbital along the o o axis i e √£ 1 au 4ag 25au 24bg 15bu 1 which is the predominant 1h2o2 and subsequently dissociates into two oh ondrey et al 1983 docker et al 1986 gericke et al 1986 gruenwald et al 1987 chang et al 2011 5 h 2 o 2 x 1 a g hv 193 266 nm h 2 o 2 a 1 a u 2 oh 1h2o2 is expected to be reactive since electron deficient lone pair 4b g and electron concentrated sigma antibonding orbital 5b u coexist however 1h2o2 is not likely be the oxidant responsible for directly abating organic compounds due to its extremely short lifetime 60 fs the estimated steady state concentration of 1h2o2 is 1 6 10 8 times lower than that of oh in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 without alcohols which is negligible refer to text s8 for detailed calculation an alternative possibility instead of 1h2o2 is triplet exited h2o2 3h2o2 which generally has a much longer lifetime than the singlet state in most previous studies h2o2 by uv at 193 266 nm has been almost assumed to be singlet because the ground state of h2o2 is singlet bhattacharjee and das 2007 however past ab initio calculations by evleth suggested that four triplet states with different symmetries can be correlated with uv photolysis of h2o2 evleth 1976 evleth and kassab 1978 a relatively recent study experimentally demonstrated that 3h2o2 is significantly involved in the photodissociation of h2o2 at 248 nm based on time resolved epr experiments and the intersystem crossing quantum yield of 1h2o2 was estimated to be higher than 0 5 bhattacharjee and das 2007 the most recent ab initio calculation also provided the same conclusion that h2o2 dissociates at 266 nm via the triplet excited state song et al 2016 however even assuming the 3h2o2 as prevalent excited state there is still no information of its lifetime therefore we simulated how long the lifetime of 3h2o2 should be to degrade oh probe compound as much as the experimental observation for example p cba degradation during the uv photolysis of 10 mm h2o2 fig s19 the calculation suggests that in order to obtain p cba degradation by 3h2o2 close to the actual data the lifetime of 3h2o2 should be about 600 ns which is 107 times longer than 60 fs for 1h2o2 one factor that can potentially contribute to extended lifetime of 3h2o2 is the solvent cage effect unlike the gas phase the photodissociation of h2o2 in water can be suppressed by the surrounding water molecules hunt and taube 1952 noyes 1955 herrmann 2007 franck and rabinowitsch 1932 resulting in a lower the quantum yield of oh œÜ oh in water compared to the gas phase i e œÜ oh 248 nm 2 09 0 36 œÜ oh 205 280 nm 1 11 0 07 vaghjiani and ravishankara 1990 goldstein et al 2007 previous studies showed that the solvent cage increases the lifetime of exited states of some molecules by influencing the shape of potential energy surface sur and johnson 1986 lipert et al 1988 harris et al 1988 chipman 2005 mennucci and cammi 2007 morishima et al 2015 the difference in lifetime of excited state due to the solvent cage varied up to 103 times depending on the type of solute and solvent at present there is no quantitative information in the literature for 3h2o2 especially in the aqueous phase highlighting the need for further research to address the oxidative reaction driven by the unidentified transitional state of h2o2 3 3 product study in order to gain insight into the oxidation mechanism of organic compounds by unknown side reaction presumably driven by h2o2 we examined the products of p pa since p hba with the highest Œ¥se value is relatively vulnerable to direct uv photolysis p pa which showed the next highest Œ¥se value was selected as a target compound for product study we performed uv h2o2 experiments in the presence and absence of 1 m oh scavengers i e meoh etoh and t buoh using 18o labeled h2o2 h2 18o2 90 atom 18o lc ms ms identified mono and di hydroxylated products i e 2 hydroxy p pa and 2 5 dihydroxy p pa even in the presence of excess radical scavengers fig 5 a and the o atom in their hydroxy groups formed was found to be predominantly 18o note that these products were basically the same as the products obtained without radical scavengers i e hence oxidized by oh produced from h2o2 fig 5b shows that almost all hydroxyl groups in the products of probe oxidation were 18oh originated from h2 18o2 regardless of type of radical scavengers these results imply that h2o2 is certainly involved in the oxidation of probe compounds even when oh is completely quenched as we have hypothesized above since h2o2 has an electron deficient lone pair the hydroxylation of p pa by h2o2 might be achieved via ring addition of h2o2 the observed ratio of 18oh close to the theoretical maximum i e 90 indicates that the oxidation mechanism of h2o2 favors ring addition over h abstraction if the h abstraction by h2o2 were predominant the ratio of 18oh would have been decreased by the increase in 16oh derived from the rapid combining of dissolved oxygen with aromatic radical the formation profiles of 2 hydroxy p pa and 2 5 dihydroxy p pa as a function of the p pa degradation are shown in fig 5c the production profiles for 2 hydroxy p pa the primary product of p pa during the initial stage of the reactions until ca 25 degradation of p pa appeared similar regardless of the oh scavenger addition thereafter in the absence of oh scavenger the degradation rate of 2 hydroxy p pa gradually prevailed over its formation rate and eventually 2 hydroxy p pa is completely degraded on the other hand in the presence of oh scavenger 2 hydroxy p pa concentration continued to increase linearly up to ca 90 p pa degradation like 2 hydroxy p pa the production of 2 5 hydroxy p pa the product of 2 hydroxy p pa oxidation initially increased and later decreased in the absence of oh scavenger in the presence of oh scavenger 2 5 hydroxy p pa continued to increase and did not reach an infliction point until p pa was completely exhausted in the absence of oh scavenger p pa oxidation is driven by oh which reacts with most of the aromatic substances at nearly diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 the bell shaped profiles indicate facile destruction of oxidation byproducts at the rate comparable to the parent compound in contrast h2o2 the main oxidant in the presence of oh scavenger did not degrade p pa oxidation products as efficiently as p pa although further research is warranted these results indicates that h2o2 is likely more target specific than oh 3 4 implications for oh quantification in various waters our observations suggest that the contribution of h2o2 to the degradation of these oh probe compounds would be more significant under the following conditions i presence of a high concentration of oh scavenger ii a high initial dose of h2o2 and iii a low concentration of do the greater contribution of h2o2 to the degradation of oh probe compound would mean that there is a greater chance to have a systematic error in overestimating oh ss when these probes are used the amount of background oh scavengers present is in general higher in the order of natural water wastewater effluent ro concentrate depending on the oh scavenging efficiency of a particular water matrix different doses of h2o2 are applied to ensure sufficient oh ss for example h2o2 doses used for advanced oxidation of natural waters doc 1 2 3 5 mg c l 1 rozas et al 2016 guo et al 2018 kwon et al 2019 wastewater effluents doc 4 7 26 4 mg c l 1 gerrity et al 2016 lee et al 2016b zhang et al 2016 shi et al 2021 and ro concentrates 7 5 68 2 mg c l 1 justo et al 2013 yang et al 2016 alvim et al 2020 lee et al 2020b are typically at 0 01 0 3 0 15 0 88 and 9 7 29 9 mm respectively in order to assess the possible errors in the measurement of oh ss under various conditions as above four oh probe compounds i e ba p cba o pa and p pa and different doses of h2o2 i e 0 1 1 and 10 mm were used for three types of waters i e catchments of natural water wastewater effluent and ro concentrate and the oh ss for each condition were measured using eq 1 fig 6 fig s20 for kinetic data o pa which is hardly affected by h2o2 always showed a lower oh ss than other oh probe compounds under all conditions the overestimated oh ss values obtained by other oh probe compounds were higher when oh probes were more vulnerable to h2o2 oxidation i e ba p cba p pa this trend was more pronounced as the h2o2 dose was increased the abundance of oh scavengers also greatly influenced the oh ss measurement for example for the conditions with 1 mm h2o2 the ratio of oh ss obtained by the four oh probes i e o pa ba p cba p pa was 1 1 3 1 5 2 3 in natural water whereas the ratio in ro concentrate was 1 2 2 3 1 8 6 based on the results of this study we propose to use oh probe compounds that are not affected by 1h2o2 e g o substituted ba compounds and pharmaceuticals when quantifying oh in uv h2o2 system and its related aops e g uv fe iii h2o2 uv tio2 h2o2 uv o3 h2o2 etc 4 conclusions results presented herein have demonstrated that uv h2o2 system degrades several representative oh probe compounds with chemical structure of p substituted ba e g ba p hba p cba and p pa by a previously unknown oxidant we believe we have gathered a sufficient line of evidence about h2o2 produced from excitation of h2o2 by uv irradiation although the impact of h2o2 on overall oxidation efficiency is expected to be marginal considering its weaker and more selective reactivity than oh some of the past reports on oh ss measured in these systems need to be revisited using proper probes in addition to uv h2o2 other uv based aops using different oxidant precursors e g uv free chlorine uv persulfate and uv peracetic acid might undergo similar phenomenon i e over degradation of organic compounds by the unknown side reaction considering the commonality in generating radicals through the photolysis of oxidant precursor therefore further studies are needed to investigate the occurrence of unknown side reactions across other uv based aops and to identify probe compounds that are appropriate for these processes in the meantime using an oxidant probe that forms a unique product i e distinct from the products produced by other oxidants can be an alternative to avoid the complications reported in this study declaration of competing interest the authors

16873,the uv h2o2 process is a benchmark advanced oxidation process aop that in situ generates highly reactive and nonselective hydroxyl radical oh to oxidatively destroy a wide range of organic compounds accurately quantifying the concentration of short lived oh is essential to predict process performance optimize the operation parameters and compare with other process options the oh concentration is typically measured using organic probe molecules that react with oh but not with other oxidants in the extremely well characterized uv h2o2 system in which oh is proven to be the dominant oxidant using photolysis resistant probes such as benzoic acid and its derivatives is a widely agreed and practiced norm we herein report that certain oh probe compounds can be degraded in uv h2o2 system by unknown reactive species that has not been reported in the past several common organic probes particularly p substituted benzoic acid compounds i e p hydroxybenzoic acid p chlorobenzoic acid and p phthalic acid were found to be vulnerable to attack by the unknown reactive species leading to false quantification of oh concentration under high radical scavenging conditions lines of evidence obtained from a series of oh scavenging experiments performed under various conditions i e different concentrations of h2o2 oh probe compounds and dissolved oxygen point toward excited state h2o2 the results from this study suggest the importance of using appropriate oh probe compounds in mechanistic studies and needs for considering the unidentified role of excited state of h2o2 on the uv h2o2 process and related aops keywords hydrogen peroxide uv advanced oxidation probe excited state 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops aim at degrading a wide range of organic pollutants by highly reactive and nonselective oxidants such as hydroxyl radical oh since these radicals are short lived they are produced on site for instance through the activation of stable peroxide containing precursors such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the photolysis of h2o2 by ultraviolet irradiation at 254 nm i e uv h2o2 system is one of the most widely used aops in the uv h2o2 system the removal efficiency of target organic pollutants depends on the concentration of oh which is the main oxidant the oh concentration often reported in its steady state value oh ss is largely influenced by the water matrix constituents acting as oh scavengers e g natural organic matter nom co3 2 etc rosenfeldt and linden 2007 gligorovski et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2019 kang et al 2018 and

alvim et al 2020 lee et al 2020b etc is a prerequisite for performance prediction and process design as well as cross comparison with other aops that employ oh generated via different h2o2 activation strategies due to its transient nature and extremely low concentration it is very challenging to directly measure oh concentration in complex water matrices burns et al 2012 fern√°ndez castro et al 2015 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 instead oh is generally quantified indirectly using probe compounds ideal probe compounds are resistant to oxidation by oxidants other than oh therefore the decrease in their concentration in the reaction system can be directly correlated to oh ss various aromatic acids have been used as oh probe compounds including benzoic acid yang et al 2014 lee et al

czili and horv√°th 2008 jing and chaplin 2017 among others these probes are used in a very small quantity such that oh consumption rate by the probe is negligible compared to that by oh scavengers i e k oh p probe i k oh s scavenger where k oh p and k oh s are the second order rate constants for the reaction of oh with probe compounds and oh scavengers respectively this ensures that the oxidation system is not perturbed by the addition of the probe consequently the oh concentration is maintained at steady state i e oh ss and the decay of probes can be assumed to follow the pseudo first order kinetics by measuring the kinetics of probe compound decay k obs which often follows the first order kinetics oh ss can be obtained as follow 1 ln probe probe 0 k obs t k oh p oh ss t this probe approach has been foundational for many if not all uv h2o2 aop studies in assessing their oh production efficiency and establishing kinetics and mechanisms of oh driven oxidation of pollutants in the literature we here question whether this long practiced convention of using probe compounds to measure oh has any unforeseen pitfall we examined the degradation of twenty organic compounds that have been employed as oh probes and model pollutants in the past studies in uv h2o2 system we employed aliphatic alcohols such as methanol meoh ethanol etoh and tert butanol t buoh in excess amount as surrogate oh quenchers note that such oh scavenging has been also widely practiced to block oh mediated oxidation pathway during mechanistic investigations this allowed us to create an nearly oh free uv h2o2 system to examine whether there is any unexpected reaction that does not involve oh a comprehensive set of experiments were performed by varying reaction conditions e g different concentrations of oh probes h2o2 and dissolved oxygen do we discovered the occurrence of previously unidentified reactive species in this decades old benchmark aop and present a critical guidance for the selection of proper probe compounds for future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals used were of reagent grade and used without further purification the following 20

scavenging efficiency the degradation of oh probe obtained in this study followed the first order kinetics with the rate constant of k obs because a relatively high concentration of h2o2 i e 10 mm was applied which served as an oh scavenger note that we corrected direct uv photolysis based on the results of control experiments performed under uv irradiation without h2o2 see text s4 and figs s2 s4

difference between the theoretical oh se and the observed oh se as Œ¥se eq 3 eq 2 if the oh scavenger inhibited the probe compound degradation as expected based on the rate constants Œ¥se would be

probes of oh scavenger meoh k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 to these reaction systems would theoretically reduce oh ss by 99 97 therefore the degradation of oh probe compounds by oh should be nearly completely prohibited consistent results were obtained with twelve target compounds i e o hba m hba o cba p iba p bba o pa ffa p cp apap bzf ibp and cbz as shown in the top panel of fig 1b the degradation kinetics were reduced to less than 3 0 10 4 s 1 and the oh se ranged from 98 4 to 100 close to the theoretical oh se of 99 97 the average value of oh ss estimated with these twelve probe compounds according to the kinetics in fig 1b was 142 1 times lower than that obtained with all twenty probes mentioned above confirming the underlying premise that only oh is responsible for the degradation of these oh probing compounds surprisingly eight oh probe compounds i e ba p hba m cba p cba p fba m pa p pa and phenol still showed noticeable degradation with k obs s values ranging from 1 0 10 3 to 1 6 10 2 s 1 even when 1 m meoh was added bottom panel of fig 1b for example k obs for p pa 1 7 10 2 s 1 should have been reduced by 3333 fold i e 5 0 10 6 s 1 in the presence of 1 m meoh but the obtained k obs s was only 2 3 times lower i e 7 3 10 3 s 1 than the k obs considering the extremely low oh ss i e negligible k oh p oh ss in the presence of excess radical scavenger this observation was unexpected and appears contradicting to current understanding on how probes work the results imply that in addition to oh there exists an unknown side reaction i e k obs k oh p oh ss k p ss that leads to the degradation of probe compounds the same oh scavenging experiments were conducted with meoh at 0 01 and 0 1 m the concentrations commonly used in most radical probing studies zhou and mopper 1990 keenan and sedlak 2008 jin et al 2011 zhang and huang 2020 these amounts of radical scavenger would lead to theoretical oh se of 97 23 and 99 72 respectively results are shown in fig 1c in terms of Œ¥se together with the results at 1 m meoh see fig s4 for detailed kinetic data note that a larger Œ¥se means a larger deviation from the anticipated complete inhibition of probe degradation by excess radical scavenger alternatively speaking a larger Œ¥se means that the unknown side reaction has a greater impact on a target oh probe although there were fluctuations depending on the types of probe compounds the overall Œ¥se tended to be roughly constant or slightly decreased as meoh dose increased from 0 01 to 1 m we further investigated the effect of other oh scavengers i e 1 m of etoh and t buoh on Œ¥se for the four oh probes i e ba p hba p cba and p pa and compared the results to those of meoh fig s5 fig s6 for kinetic data in the presence of etoh and t buoh the four oh probes exhibited similar levels of unexplained degradation compared to the case of meoh of the twenty oh probe compounds unexpectedly high Œ¥se values were observed with compounds that share the chemical structure of ba the Œ¥se values at 1 m meoh for the oh probe compounds containing ba structure were in the order of p bba 0 o pa 0 6 p iba 0 7 o cba 0 9 o hba 1 2 m hba 1 4 m cba 7 3 p fba 9 8 ba 10 m pa 16 7 p cba 22 8 p pa 43 7 p hba 48 4 note that this order has no correlation with how fast they react with oh k oh p fig s7 it was found that their Œ¥se values are largely influenced by the type and position of the substituents on the aromatic ring of ba for example for ba structures with different p substituents a larger Œ¥se was observed in the following order of substituents br p bba i p iba h ba f p fba cl p cba cooh p pa oh p hba for structural isomers the Œ¥se value increased further in the order of o m p e g o pa m pa p pa 0 6 16 7 43 7 at 1 m meoh hba and cba also showed the same trend to understand the selective nature of unknown reactive species we performed quantitative structure activity relationship analysis in general the oxidation of ba would be either promoted or inhibited by electron donating and withdrawing substituents respectively the electronic effect of substituent can be quantitatively expressed as the ratio of dissociation constants between ba a reference compound and its derivatives referred to as substituent constant œÉ hammett 1937 charton 1963 hansch et al 1991 it has been reported that the relative reactivity of ba carrying a given substituent denoted as ba x toward various oxidants can be linearly correlated with the œÉ value according to hammett equation i e Œ∑ œÅœÉ where Œ∑ log k oxidant ba x k oxidant ba and œÅ reaction constant anbar et al 1966 deborde and von gunten 2008 lee and von gunten 2012 in this study k obs and k obs s values were used to obtain Œ∑ values for dominant reactions by oh and the unknown reactive species respectively the hammett plots i e Œ∑ vs œÉ are provided in fig s8 note that the r2 values are small i e 0 55 and 0 45 respectively but the trend in each case showed a clear difference the œÅ value for unknown reactive species was found to be 1 9 the negative œÅ implies that the unknown reactive species is an oxidant lee and von gunten 2012 the magnitude of œÅ is much higher than that of oh 0 48 in this study which is comparable to 0 41 in the literature anbar et al 1966 reflecting a higher reaction selectivity of this unknown oxidant than oh 3 2 identity of the unknown oxidant the above results collectively suggest the existence of an unknown oxidant in uv h2o2 system in this section we investigate the identity of this unknown oxidant by testing several hypothesizes four oh probe compounds i e ba p hba p cba and p pa with high Œ¥se values and three oh scavengers i e meoh etoh and t buoh were used in the experiments one possible scenario is that the reaction between oh and excess oh scavengers produces an intermediate radical species this intermediate species might degrade an oh probe compound resulting in an overestimation of oh ss i e a high Œ¥se scheme 1 it is well known that oh abstracts a hydrogen atom from Œ± carbon of alcohols e g meoh etoh and t buoh to generate carbon centered radicals r asmus et al 1973 under oxic condition the generated r species react with o2 at a diffusion controlled rate 1 4 4 6 109 m 1 s 1 neta and grodkowski 1996 to form peroxyl radicals oor which can further yield alkoxyl radical or via a tetroxide intermediate roo oor bothe and schulte frohlinde 1978 hawkins and davies 2001 collin 2019 since the standard reduction potential values of both oor and or species are estimated to be relatively high i e e oor hoor 1 0 vnhe and e or hor 1 6 vnhe koppenol 1990 these radical species are potential candidates for the unknown oxidants if this were true a high Œ¥se should be observed in other oh production systems as well we tested this hypothesis by performing oh scavenging experiments in three different oh generating systems i e ultrasound o3 h2o2 and fe ii h2o2 fig s9 for Œ¥se and figs s10 s12 for kinetics and degradation efficiency data note that the amount of oh generated was adjusted to degrade 56 94 of oh probe compounds in the absence of oh scavengers if the oor and or species were the unknown reactive species the oh probe compounds should have been degraded in the presence of 1 m oh scavengers like in the uv h2o2 system however the Œ¥se values obtained in the three systems were less than 5 i e excess radical scavenger inhibited probe degradation disproving this hypothesis the aforementioned results obtained with alternative aop schemes that did not use uv irradiation hint the possible contribution of photo excited species scheme 2 we excluded oh scavengers meoh etoh and t buoh considering their very low uv absorbance Œµ 254 nm 0 005 m 1 cm 1 fig s13 for uv absorption spectra we first postulated that the oh probe compound could have been degraded by singlet oxygen 1o2 generated from the excited state oh probe compound scheme 2a it is well known that 1o2 reacts rapidly with various aromatic compounds but less reacts with alcohols i e radical scavengers used in this study wilkinson et al 1995 lee et al 2020a under the uv irradiation a probe compound p can be excited to its singlet state 1p this short lived 10 ns zepp et al 1985 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 species can undergo intersystem crossing to form a more stable excited triplet state 3p which coverts o2 to 1o2 via dexter energy transfer the efficiency of 1o2 production is mainly governed by two key factors abdel shafi et al 2001 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 i the intersystem crossing quantum yield of 1p œÜ isc and ii the yield of 1o2 production from the reaction between 3p and o2 Œ≥ 1 o 2 however there is a dearth of information on these two key factors for the oh probe compounds employed in this study for example in the case of ba a relatively high œÜ isc at 267 nm 0 65 yang et al 2012 was reported but Œ≥ 1 o 2 is not yet reported for other oh probe compounds i e p hba p cba and p pa neither œÜ isc nor Œ≥ 1 o 2 is known therefore we experimentally evaluated the potential occurrence of 1o2 from p using a 1o2 probe compound ffa in the presence of 1 m alcohols as oh scavenger fig s14 we did not observe any degradation of ffa regardless of the type of oh probe compounds and concluded that 1o2 is not the unknown oxidant another possibility is the reactions involving oh probe compound first excited state probe compound especially long lived triplet state may react with other species such as the aforementioned reactive intermediates ri produced from the oxidation of alcohol scavengers by oh e g oor or and h2o2 i e p ri or h2o2 scheme 2b however the reaction of p and ri is not likely considering their extremely low steady state concentrations taking the reaction between triplet excited ba and ooch2oh the oor species from the oxidation of meoh by oh as an example their steady state concentrations were estimated to be 4 0 10 17 m and 3 1 10 8 m respectively refer to text s7 for detailed calculations the remaining possibility is the reaction between ground state probe and excited state h2o2 p 1h2o2 scheme 2c if p were the mediator Œ¥se would increase as the concentration of oh probe compound increases likewise if 1h2o2 is the unknown oxidant the steady state concentration of h2o2 will increase as h2o2 concentration increases resulting in a decrease in the observed oh se and eventually an increase in Œ¥se eq 4 4 Œ¥ se theoretical oh se 100 1 k obs s k obs 100 Œ¥ se 100 1 k oh p oh ss s 0 k p ss s k oh p oh ss k p ss 100 to verify this hypothesis we conducted oh scavenging experiments by varying the concentration of h2o2 fig 2 fig s15 for kinetic data as the concentration of h2o2 with a molar absorptivity of 19 6 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm baxendale and wilson 1956 increases from 1 to 1000 mm the fraction of uv absorption by h2o2 f 254 h 2 o 2 increases from 70 96 3 to 99 96 100 while the fractions of uv absorption by each target compound f 254 p decrease from 3 7 30 2 to 0 0 04 depending on the oh probe compounds refer to table s2 and fig s16 for their molar absorptivity values as shown in fig 2 overall Œ¥se values continuously increased in response to increasing h2o2 concentration implying that 1h2o2 is likely the unknown oxidant the results also suggest that the role of p is less important since the highest Œ¥se values for each oh probe compound were found under the conditions where the oh probe compounds were barely exposed to uv light i e due to high h2o2 concentration in marked contrast Œ¥se values remained almost constant regardless of the changes in the oh probe concentration from 0 1 to 100 Œºm fig 3 fig s17 for kinetic data further excluding the possibility that p is the main factor causing unknown side reaction we further observed that the degree of radical scavenging and hence the probe compound degradation are affected by the level of do fig 4 fig s18 for kinetic data we found that Œ¥se values increased under anoxic conditions compared to ambient do conditions conversely very low Œ¥se were observed under o2 saturated conditions these results are likely related to the fact that the ground state molecular oxygen can quench the excited molecules abdel shafi and wilkinson 2000 wilkinson 2009 rohatgi mukherjee 2013 h2o2 in our system if o2 consumes h2o2 probe compounds would not degrade in the presence of high radical scavengers lowering Œ¥se when do is low h2o2 would not be quenched by o2 but rather react with probe compounds the deactivation of h2o2 to h2o2 by 3o2 may proceed through an energy transfer process that does not involve 1o2 although there are no prior studies that can confirm this pathway the bimolecular interaction between h2o2 and organic compounds has not been reported to date since there is no fluorescence emission from h2o2 and its estimated lifetime 60 fs klee et al 1986 is extremely short scherer and zewail 1987 it is impossible to directly detect h2o2 bhattacharjee and das 2007 however the occurrence of h2o2 assumed to be in its singlet state 1h2o2 during the photodissociation of h2o2 at 193 266 nm has been investigated in the gas phase using a laser induced fluorescence coupled with doppler spectroscopy anisotropic angular distribution of recoiling oh photofragments which are further pumped into excited state oh oh by the second laser pulse has been analyzed by measuring fluorescence emission from the relaxation of oh ondrey et al 1983 docker et al 1986 gericke et al 1986 gruenwald et al 1987 chang et al 2011 the occurrence of exited state h2o2 has been also supported by several ab initio simulations bersohn and shapiro 1986 chevaldonnet et al 1986 reinsch 1987 zhang and zhang 1993 cai et al 1994 the highest occupied molecular orbital of the electronic ground state of trans planar h2o2 are 4ag 25au 24bg 2 under uv irradiation at 193 266 nm one of two 4bg electrons in nonbonding orbital on the o atom is promoted to 5bu orbital along the o o axis i e √£ 1 au 4ag 25au 24bg 15bu 1 which is the predominant 1h2o2 and subsequently dissociates into two oh ondrey et al 1983 docker et al 1986 gericke et al 1986 gruenwald et al 1987 chang et al 2011 5 h 2 o 2 x 1 a g hv 193 266 nm h 2 o 2 a 1 a u 2 oh 1h2o2 is expected to be reactive since electron deficient lone pair 4b g and electron concentrated sigma antibonding orbital 5b u coexist however 1h2o2 is not likely be the oxidant responsible for directly abating organic compounds due to its extremely short lifetime 60 fs the estimated steady state concentration of 1h2o2 is 1 6 10 8 times lower than that of oh in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 without alcohols which is negligible refer to text s8 for detailed calculation an alternative possibility instead of 1h2o2 is triplet exited h2o2 3h2o2 which generally has a much longer lifetime than the singlet state in most previous studies h2o2 by uv at 193 266 nm has been almost assumed to be singlet because the ground state of h2o2 is singlet bhattacharjee and das 2007 however past ab initio calculations by evleth suggested that four triplet states with different symmetries can be correlated with uv photolysis of h2o2 evleth 1976 evleth and kassab 1978 a relatively recent study experimentally demonstrated that 3h2o2 is significantly involved in the photodissociation of h2o2 at 248 nm based on time resolved epr experiments and the intersystem crossing quantum yield of 1h2o2 was estimated to be higher than 0 5 bhattacharjee and das 2007 the most recent ab initio calculation also provided the same conclusion that h2o2 dissociates at 266 nm via the triplet excited state song et al 2016 however even assuming the 3h2o2 as prevalent excited state there is still no information of its lifetime therefore we simulated how long the lifetime of 3h2o2 should be to degrade oh probe compound as much as the experimental observation for example p cba degradation during the uv photolysis of 10 mm h2o2 fig s19 the calculation suggests that in order to obtain p cba degradation by 3h2o2 close to the actual data the lifetime of 3h2o2 should be about 600 ns which is 107 times longer than 60 fs for 1h2o2 one factor that can potentially contribute to extended lifetime of 3h2o2 is the solvent cage effect unlike the gas phase the photodissociation of h2o2 in water can be suppressed by the surrounding water molecules hunt and taube 1952 noyes 1955 herrmann 2007 franck and rabinowitsch 1932 resulting in a lower the quantum yield of oh œÜ oh in water compared to the gas phase i e œÜ oh 248 nm 2 09 0 36 œÜ oh 205 280 nm 1 11 0 07 vaghjiani and ravishankara 1990 goldstein et al 2007 previous studies showed that the solvent cage increases the lifetime of exited states of some molecules by influencing the shape of potential energy surface sur and johnson 1986 lipert et al 1988 harris et al 1988 chipman 2005 mennucci and cammi 2007 morishima et al 2015 the difference in lifetime of excited state due to the solvent cage varied up to 103 times depending on the type of solute and solvent at present there is no quantitative information in the literature for 3h2o2 especially in the aqueous phase highlighting the need for further research to address the oxidative reaction driven by the unidentified transitional state of h2o2 3 3 product study in order to gain insight into the oxidation mechanism of organic compounds by unknown side reaction presumably driven by h2o2 we examined the products of p pa since p hba with the highest Œ¥se value is relatively vulnerable to direct uv photolysis p pa which showed the next highest Œ¥se value was selected as a target compound for product study we performed uv h2o2 experiments in the presence and absence of 1 m oh scavengers i e meoh etoh and t buoh using 18o labeled h2o2 h2 18o2 90 atom 18o lc ms ms identified mono and di hydroxylated products i e 2 hydroxy p pa and 2 5 dihydroxy p pa even in the presence of excess radical scavengers fig 5 a and the o atom in their hydroxy groups formed was found to be predominantly 18o note that these products were basically the same as the products obtained without radical scavengers i e hence oxidized by oh produced from h2o2 fig 5b shows that almost all hydroxyl groups in the products of probe oxidation were 18oh originated from h2 18o2 regardless of type of radical scavengers these results imply that h2o2 is certainly involved in the oxidation of probe compounds even when oh is completely quenched as we have hypothesized above since h2o2 has an electron deficient lone pair the hydroxylation of p pa by h2o2 might be achieved via ring addition of h2o2 the observed ratio of 18oh close to the theoretical maximum i e 90 indicates that the oxidation mechanism of h2o2 favors ring addition over h abstraction if the h abstraction by h2o2 were predominant the ratio of 18oh would have been decreased by the increase in 16oh derived from the rapid combining of dissolved oxygen with aromatic radical the formation profiles of 2 hydroxy p pa and 2 5 dihydroxy p pa as a function of the p pa degradation are shown in fig 5c the production profiles for 2 hydroxy p pa the primary product of p pa during the initial stage of the reactions until ca 25 degradation of p pa appeared similar regardless of the oh scavenger addition thereafter in the absence of oh scavenger the degradation rate of 2 hydroxy p pa gradually prevailed over its formation rate and eventually 2 hydroxy p pa is completely degraded on the other hand in the presence of oh scavenger 2 hydroxy p pa concentration continued to increase linearly up to ca 90 p pa degradation like 2 hydroxy p pa the production of 2 5 hydroxy p pa the product of 2 hydroxy p pa oxidation initially increased and later decreased in the absence of oh scavenger in the presence of oh scavenger 2 5 hydroxy p pa continued to increase and did not reach an infliction point until p pa was completely exhausted in the absence of oh scavenger p pa oxidation is driven by oh which reacts with most of the aromatic substances at nearly diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 the bell shaped profiles indicate facile destruction of oxidation byproducts at the rate comparable to the parent compound in contrast h2o2 the main oxidant in the presence of oh scavenger did not degrade p pa oxidation products as efficiently as p pa although further research is warranted these results indicates that h2o2 is likely more target specific than oh 3 4 implications for oh quantification in various waters our observations suggest that the contribution of h2o2 to the degradation of these oh probe compounds would be more significant under the following conditions i presence of a high concentration of oh scavenger ii a high initial dose of h2o2 and iii a low concentration of do the greater contribution of h2o2 to the degradation of oh probe compound would mean that there is a greater chance to have a systematic error in overestimating oh ss when these probes are used the amount of background oh scavengers present is in general higher in the order of natural water wastewater effluent ro concentrate depending on the oh scavenging efficiency of a particular water matrix different doses of h2o2 are applied to ensure sufficient oh ss for example h2o2 doses used for advanced oxidation of natural waters doc 1 2 3 5 mg c l 1 rozas et al 2016 guo et al 2018 kwon et al 2019 wastewater effluents doc 4 7 26 4 mg c l 1 gerrity et al 2016 lee et al 2016b zhang et al 2016 shi et al 2021 and ro concentrates 7 5 68 2 mg c l 1 justo et al 2013 yang et al 2016 alvim et al 2020 lee et al 2020b are typically at 0 01 0 3 0 15 0 88 and 9 7 29 9 mm respectively in order to assess the possible errors in the measurement of oh ss under various conditions as above four oh probe compounds i e ba p cba o pa and p pa and different doses of h2o2 i e 0 1 1 and 10 mm were used for three types of waters i e catchments of natural water wastewater effluent and ro concentrate and the oh ss for each condition were measured using eq 1 fig 6 fig s20 for kinetic data o pa which is hardly affected by h2o2 always showed a lower oh ss than other oh probe compounds under all conditions the overestimated oh ss values obtained by other oh probe compounds were higher when oh probes were more vulnerable to h2o2 oxidation i e ba p cba p pa this trend was more pronounced as the h2o2 dose was increased the abundance of oh scavengers also greatly influenced the oh ss measurement for example for the conditions with 1 mm h2o2 the ratio of oh ss obtained by the four oh probes i e o pa ba p cba p pa was 1 1 3 1 5 2 3 in natural water whereas the ratio in ro concentrate was 1 2 2 3 1 8 6 based on the results of this study we propose to use oh probe compounds that are not affected by 1h2o2 e g o substituted ba compounds and pharmaceuticals when quantifying oh in uv h2o2 system and its related aops e g uv fe iii h2o2 uv tio2 h2o2 uv o3 h2o2 etc 4 conclusions results presented herein have demonstrated that uv h2o2 system degrades several representative oh probe compounds with chemical structure of p substituted ba e g ba p hba p cba and p pa by a previously unknown oxidant we believe we have gathered a sufficient line of evidence about h2o2 produced from excitation of h2o2 by uv irradiation although the impact of h2o2 on overall oxidation efficiency is expected to be marginal considering its weaker and more selective reactivity than oh some of the past reports on oh ss measured in these systems need to be revisited using proper probes in addition to uv h2o2 other uv based aops using different oxidant precursors e g uv free chlorine uv persulfate and uv peracetic acid might undergo similar phenomenon i e over degradation of organic compounds by the unknown side reaction considering the commonality in generating radicals through the photolysis of oxidant precursor therefore further studies are needed to investigate the occurrence of unknown side reactions across other uv based aops and to identify probe compounds that are appropriate for these processes in the meantime using an oxidant probe that forms a unique product i e distinct from the products produced by other oxidants can be an alternative to avoid the complications reported in this study declaration of competing interest the authors

cells in algae laden water however study differences in ultrasound settings algal cell conditions and coagulant properties complicate the accurate evaluation of this technique for practical applications no study has yet compared algae and algal organic matters removal among different frequencies of ultrasound in the ultrasound coagulation process in this study the ultrasound at three typical frequencies 29 4 470 and 780 khz were applied for this purpose the results showed that high frequency ultrasound at 470 and 780 khz had substantially greater improvement of coagulation than low frequency ultrasound at 29 4 khz for example the turbidity removal at 1 mg al l of polymeric aluminum chloride increased by 204 2 571 9 and 563 2 under 29 4 470 and 780 khz ultrasound coagulation respectively at 3 42 j ml algal cells exhibited irreversible physical damage and the release of intracellular organic matters such as odorous compounds under low frequency ultrasound with energy densities 3 42 j ml whereas high frequency ultrasound was characterized by nonviolent impairment including oxidative degradation and gas vacuole destruction particularly reversible resulting from ultrasound induced radicals and cell resonance respectively avoiding the severe destruction of algal cells is crucial for minimizing the toxicity and secondary pollution of the treated water to achieve satisfactory removal protected safety and better economy the optimal energy density for each frequency was also determined the findings from the analyses of the laboratory cultured sample were confirmed via real eutrophic surface water this study provides new insights and guidance for the ongoing study of harmful algal removal by ultrasound enhanced coagulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrasound coagulation frequency energy density algal organic matter mechanism toxicity 1 introduction the eutrophication of surface waters can lead to many undesired issues among which cyanobacterial blooms are of the most alarming ones and have attracted considerable attention due to their increasing frequency and intensity in recent decades rajasekhar et al 2012 coagulation has been widely employed in water treatment plants for algal liquid separation however algal cells are organic particles that have negative zeta potential and exhibit considerable stability in water due to their hydrophilic effects electrostatic repulsion steric effects and small sizes edzwald 1993 henderson et al 2008 a commonly used method to improve the efficiency of coagulation is to add oxidants prior to coagulation i e preoxidation these oxidants are characterized by strong oxidizability via which negatively charged algal organic matters aom on the cell surface can be effectively degraded leading to the destabilization and aggregation of algae cells because of the reduced electrostatic repulsion and steric effects among these cells qi et al 2016 xie et al 2013 nonetheless the addition of oxidants may introduce additional problems involving other pollutants such as intracellular organic matters iom such as algal toxins and odorous compounds and corresponding disinfection by products dbps fang et al 2010 xie et al 2013 given the above environmentally friendly and efficient techniques are urgently needed ultrasound is one such technique as only sound energy is involved during treatment ultrasonic effects in water include physical mechanical effects in multiple forms such as intense shock waves high shear forces liquid microjets and resonances and chemical effects with strong oxidizing substances such as hydroxyl radicals muthupandian 2011 rajasekhar et al 2012 discussions regarding the effectiveness of ultrasound have dominated research on harmful algae control removal in recent years rajasekhar et al 2012 wu et al 2011 this technique has been widely accepted as a potential alternative for the effective removal of cyanobacteria containing gas vacuoles fan et al 2017a 2017b especially microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa another important trait of ultrasound is its promising performance in collaboration with other techniques for algal removal such as coagulation huang et al 2020b li et al 2019b and microbubbles broekman et al 2010 previous studies have demonstrated a significantly enhanced coagulation removal of algal cells through either low frequency or high frequency ultrasonic pretreatment heng et al 2009 shi et al 2008 zhang et al 2009a however the lack of a systematic comparison between low frequency and high frequency ultrasound on the coagulation removal of algae is not conducive to the global evaluation of the application of ultrasound in practical engineering a recent study peng et al 2020b preliminarily tested the performance of ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 20 0 038 w ml 740 0 113 w ml and 1120 khz 0 108 w ml on the coagulation removal of algal cells and showed that high frequency ultrasound was preferable to low frequency ultrasound however the intensity settings among these frequencies were inconsistent and only one polymeric aluminum chloride pac dosage was used in that study 10 mg l the exact dosage of al was not reported our previous work huang et al 2020b investigated the specific mechanisms for the enhanced coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells by low frequency ultrasound and found that with the addition of 29 4 khz ultrasonic pretreatment at intensities of 0 6 1 11 and 2 22 j ml 4 mg al l of polymeric aluminum chloride pac achieved increased removal from 44 1 to 59 7 67 0 and 74 9 without the undesired leakage of aom in that work different mechanisms were definitely correlated with certain treatment intensities including the cell activity reduction 0 6 j ml cell stability impairment 1 11 j ml and cell aggregation 1 11 j ml li et al 2019b investigated the effects of high frequency ultrasound on enhancing the coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells and the corresponding mechanisms and showed that the coagulation removal was increased by approximately 7 0 10 2 8 2 and 6 3 pac 10 mg l respectively upon ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 120 430 740 and 1120 khz and an energy density of 5 4 j ml they recommended a mild high frequency ultrasonic pretreatment e g 740 khz and 6 j ml to avoid the overmuch accumulation of proteins and the excessive production of radicals for a better algae removal effect although the effects of low frequency and high frequency ultrasound on the coagulation removal of algal cells and the mechanisms involved have been investigated in different studies the conclusions cannot be compared directly due to the multifarious ultrasound settings such as frequency range and intensity the diversity of algal cell conditions including source initial concentration and growth phase and the dissimilar coagulant properties affected by reagent purity preparation method and basicity there is still a lack of studies that compare between low frequency and high frequency ultrasound combined with coagulation with respect to algae and aom removal in addition no direct proof is available regarding the safety of the ultrasound coagulation process therefore this study aimed to reveal the differences in the effects and mechanisms of ultrasound on the coagulation removal of algae and aom among a low frequency 29 4 khz and two high frequencies 470 and 780 khz of ultrasound moreover the toxicity of the treated water and the leakage of intracellular odorous compounds 2 methyl isoborneol 2 mib were determined to identify the relationships between safety and ultrasound settings for reference of note both the laboratory cultured algal sample and the field sample were employed which provides new scientific and engineering insights and guidance for the ongoing study of ultrasound techniques to enhance the coagulation removal of harmful algae 2 materials and methods

transducer employed 29 4 khz is a horn type device and has a titanium alloy ct4 head with a diameter of approximately 2 cm the two high frequency transducers are plate type devices and the diameter of the transmitting surface is approximately 9 and 7 cm for the 470 and 780 khz transducers respectively during ultrasonic irradiation the transmitting surface was immersed 1 cm below the center of the solution surface and the normal operating temperature of the low frequency transducer was maintained by a water cooling device a more detailed description of the systems is presented in our previous

ltd shanghai china at 25 with a light dark cycle of 12 h 12 h and a waveband of 400 780 nm cells of m aeruginosa were grown in sterilized culture flasks containing the bg 11 medium as presented in tables s1 and s2 of the si on the other hand the field sample dominated by pseudanabaena was collected from taihu lake on august 20 2020 of which the dissolved organic carbon doc level and turbidity

study were of at least analytical grade and were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china without further purification unless noted otherwise 2 2 experimental procedures ultrasound coagulation experiments were carried out during the exponential growth period of m aeruginosa before the experiments the m aeruginosa solution was mixed and diluted with 0 5 normal saline qu et al 2012 to obtain an optical density of 0 317 approximately 0 7 107 cells per ml at 680 nm a wavelength at which the cells exhibited high absorbance due to the presence of chlorophyll a the optical density of m aeruginosa solution was detected using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr6000 hach co loveland usa the field sample was fully homogenized prior to the experiments the influence of ultrasound frequency on the coagulation removal of algal cells was evaluated under different ultrasound intensities and pac dosages for each test 500 ml of m aeruginosa solution or field sample was transferred to a 500 ml glass beaker for ultrasonic pretreatment with a specific frequency and intensity after which 20 ml of the solution was collected for water quality detection and physiological characterization a thermostatic water bath was used to maintain the temperature of solution at 25 0 5 during the sonication then the sonicated solution was transferred to a magnetic stirrer my3000 6f

which has been widely employed to investigate the toxicity of herbicides pesticides and antibiotics fan et al 2017c liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2009b preparatory procedures are presented in the section s2 test information of the si the samples were not extracted or concentrated prior to the acute toxicity tests an exposure duration of 15 min was employed chen et al 2019 yu et al 2015 zhang et al

and aom fig 1 top displays the influence of ultrasonic pretreatment at different frequency ranges on the coagulation removal of m aeruginosa cells as indicated by turbidity ultrasound effectively enhanced the turbidity removal at low pac dosages 4 mg al l in this study for example the turbidity removal ratio at 2 mg al l of pac increased from 56 2 without ultrasound to 94 1 95 0 and 95 5 with the assistance of 29 4 470 and 780 khz ultrasound respectively at an energy density of 3 42 j ml this result is similar to that of shi et al 2008 who reported that ultrasonic pretreatment at 20 khz and 0 16 w ml for 30 s calculated energy density 4 8 j ml improved the turbidity removal ratio at a pac dosage of 17 8 mg l the exact dosage of al was not reported from approximately 95 8 to 99 2 and is similar to that of li et al 2019b who found that at frequencies of 430 and 740 khz 60 s of ultrasonic pretreatment at 0 09 w ml calculated energy density 5 4 j ml led to an approximately 10 2 and 8 2 higher turbidity removal ratio respectively with 10 mg l of pac the exact dosage of al was not reported notably the improvement in turbidity removal ratio achieved in our study was comparatively more distinct this finding can be ascribed to the differences in actual al dosages and al species affected by coagulant basicity cao et al 2016 moreover the different characteristics of algal cells as a result of different habitats laboratory cultured strains vs field samples and growth phases exponential growth period vs stabilized growth period may have contributed to this difference specifically the improvement in turbidity removal at the two high frequencies was superior to that at the low frequency when the pac dosage was 1 and 2 mg al l under either of these two pac dosages the residual turbidity at the low frequency stagnated with increasing energy density from 6 84 to 17 7 j ml whereas that at the two high frequencies showed a continuous decrease these phenomena indicate the different mechanisms of ultrasonic pretreatment in the ultrasound coagulation process at different frequency ranges the immediate effects of ultrasound on the activity and stability of algal cells were characterized to give a direct inspection of the mechanisms of ultrasonic pretreatment the inactivation of algal cells in high algae containing water facilitates their trapping by the hydrolyzed products of coagulants petrusevski et al 1996 steynberg et al 1996 additionally the reduction in activity may weaken the ability of algal cells to maintain negative charges on their surfaces by impairing ion transfer across the cell membrane ghernaout et al 2010 the resulting reduction in electrostatic repulsion accelerates the aggregation of algal cells the activity of algal cells was determined by detecting their photosynthesis an important process for algal metabolism fig 2 left presents the photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa cells and illustrates that an energy density of 3 42 j ml was sufficient to substantially weaken cell activity further increasing the energy density had little effect moreover as energy density increased from 0 to 3 42 j ml the activity decrease at the low frequency was more distinct than that at the two high frequencies for example 29 4 khz ultrasound at 1 77 j ml achieved almost the same inhibition effect on photosynthetic activity as 470 and 780 khz ultrasound at 3 42 j ml nearly twice the former intensity on the other hand the stability of algal cells was reflected by the zeta potential a decisive factor affecting electrostatic repulsion and steric effects among algal cells li et al 2014 fig 2 right presents the zeta potential of m aeruginosa cells and reveals a distinct difference in the overall behavior pattern of zeta potential between low frequency and high frequency ultrasound for the 29 4 khz frequency the absolute zeta potential first decreased 0 6 84 j ml and then increased 6 84 34 2 j ml with increasing energy density in contrast for the 470 and 780 khz frequencies the zeta potential at energy densities higher than 6 84 j ml remained approximately constant accordingly the stagnant turbidity removal at 29 4 khz ultrasound with energy density from 6 84 to 17 7 j ml fig 1 was affected by the recovery of cell stability fig 1 bottom displays the influence of ultrasonic pretreatment at different frequency ranges on the coagulation removal of aom as indicated by doc level overall doc removal did not reach an excellent level even with the addition of ultrasound the maximum doc removal ratio at 29 4 470 and 780 khz frequencies was 51 7 57 8 and 57 5 respectively these results are in agreement with the findings of ma et al 2006 who observed that neither extracellular organic matters eom nor iom were easily removed by coagulation for a given pac dosage compared with that in the control group doc removal at the 29 4 khz frequency deteriorated gradually with increasing energy density from 3 42 to 17 7 j ml whereas that at the 470 and 780 khz frequencies exhibited no obvious deterioration presenting a slight increase 0 3 42 j ml followed by a minor decrease 3 42 17 7 j ml with increasing energy density note that the doc increase at 0 mg al l of pac between the ultrasound group and the control group reflects the amount of iom leaked from m aeruginosa cells thus indicating an absolutely severe destruction of algal cells at the 29 4 khz ultrasound for instance at 6 84 j ml the 29 4 470 and 780 khz ultrasound resulted in 132 0 102 4 and 111 5 doc levels respectively moreover the higher the energy density the greater the leakage of iom peng et al 2020a investigated the effects of ultrasound on the destruction of m aeruginosa cells and the release of iom and showed that ultrasonic irradiation at frequencies of 20 calculated energy density 11 4 j ml and 740 khz calculated energy density 33 9 j ml increased doc level by approximately 15 8 and 12 4 respectively the results of their study and the present study agree in that algal cells were severely ruptured resulting in the leakage of iom but they differ in that the energy consumption in their study was higher this difference may be related to the obviously higher initial concentration of algal cells in their study 1 5 107 vs 0 7 107 cells ml which weakened the ultrasound intensity on individual cells 3 2 influences of ultrasound settings on mechanisms of ultrasonic pretreatment given that mechanisms derive from the mechanical and chemical effects of ultrasound the quantitative determinations of these effects enable a better understanding of the underlying processes figure s2 left of the si shows the amount of iom leaked from algal cells after ultrasonic pretreatment the iom leakage at a given energy density decreased in the order of 29 4 k 0 295 780 k 0 100 and 470 khz k 0 066 it is well established that the acoustic bubbles formed at low frequencies are larger and their collapse is more aggressive mason et al 2011 yusof et al 2016 hence the findings could be explained by the more violent mechanical disruption effect at the 29 4 khz frequency than at the two high frequencies the smaller transmitting surface of the 29 4 khz horn type transducer also contributed to iom leakage by delivering more concentrated energy the result was further confirmed by the morphology characterization of algal cells as shown in figure s3 see si cells in the control group had smooth surfaces extensive changes were observed at 29 4 khz frequency the cells were severely destroyed and or exhibited evident concave surfaces in contrast the cells at 470 and 780 khz frequencies did not show distinct deformation or destruction in addition as shown in figure s2 right of the si the production of hydroxyl radicals at a given energy density decreased in the inverse order of iom leakage i e 470 k 1 948 780 k 1 265 and 29 4 khz k 0 330 this finding is in accordance with some recent studies where the favorable frequencies for sonochemical yield were proposed to be within 100 500 khz pokhrel et al 2016 200 600 khz sathishkumar et al 2016 and 300 500 khz wood et al 2017 theoretically the acoustic bubbles formed at higher frequencies are smaller mason et al 2011 yusof et al 2016 as a consequence limited energy is released in the form of mechanical shock but the collapse occurs more frequently facilitating the diffusion of hydroxyl radicals to liquid phase interestingly there was an inflection point at 470 khz frequency and a higher frequency of 780 khz had an increased iom leakage and decreased hydroxyl radical production previous studies agree that the resonant collapse of gas vacuoles organelles composed of stocks of gas vesicles and endowing algal cells with the ability to float in water can occur when the algal cells are of the same size range as the acoustic bubbles resonating at the applied frequency the rupture of gas vacuoles can deteriorate the physiology of algal cells and ultimately lead to the leakage of iom according to the theoretical frequency radius equation rajasekhar et al 2012 the resonance radii of gas bubbles resonating at frequencies of 470 and 780 khz are approximately 6 98 and 4 21 Œºm respectively thus considering the radius range of m aeruginosa cells of 3 4 Œºm as displayed in figure s3 a of the si 780 khz ultrasound might evoke more significant resonance induced damage to gas vacuoles than the other frequencies of ultrasound in addition the lower radical production at 780 khz frequency was attributed to the less collapses of bubbles per unit of time because of the too short rarefaction compression cycle ashokkumar et al 1997 muthupandian 2011 the possibility of intracellular damage to gas vacuoles was validated by a 7 day growth monitoring experiment as shown in fig 3 the algal cells treated with ultrasound displayed significant sedimentation on day 1 and the overall od680 removal ratios were 36 6 68 3 32 9 48 4 and 55 6 66 4 for the frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz respectively a higher od680 removal ratio indicates a higher settling rate of algal cells and thus demonstrating that the 29 4 and 780 khz ultrasound caused more severe damage to the cells and their gas vacuoles moreover the algal cells in supernatant recovered to varying degrees after 7 days of cultivation prior research suggests that illumination is vitally important for the recovery of gas vacuoles in algal cells lee et al 2000 the rate of the od680 value at day 7 to that at day 1 in the control group was 122 3 125 8 while at 29 4 470 and 780 khz frequencies the corresponding ranges were 126 7 140 3 154 3 182 0 and 226 9 238 2 respectively compared with the control group a higher rate indicates a more significant resuspension of sedimentary cells thus the results demonstrate a milder and more effective cell resonance effect of 780 khz ultrasound in comparison 470 khz ultrasound yielded much higher production of hydroxyl radicals than the other frequencies of ultrasound thus enabling intracellular oxidation through the synergistic effect of sonoporation and radical oxidation lentacker et al 2014 xie et al 2013 demonstrated that potent oxidation can cause the desorption of negatively charged organic coatings form the cell surface in addition our previous study huang et al 2020a demonstrated that mechanical effects by ultrasound can cause the physical detachment of the coatings accordingly the decrease of negative charges on the cell surface fig 2 as indicated by zeta potential under low frequency and high frequency ultrasound was mainly attributed to the physical detachment and the oxidative degradation respectively of negatively charged aom in view of the analyses presented above 29 4 khz ultrasound caused mainly irreversible mechanical disruption to algal cells these physical attacks provided more efficient inhibition of cell activity however under a too high intensity 6 84 j ml in this study the severely destroyed cells with smaller sizes had stronger electronegativity i e better stability which impaired coagulation removal in contrast 470 and 780 khz ultrasound were characterized by nonviolent and reversible oxidation degradation and cell resonance effects under which the activity and stability of the algal cells decreased without reversal 3 3 influences of ultrasound settings on the toxicity of the treated water the energy density required to substantially enhance the coagulation removal of algal cells and either not impair or improve doc removal at low pac dosages 1 4 mg al l in this study was 1 77 17 7 and 6 84 j ml for the frequency of 29 4 470 and 780 khz respectively in these circumstances only 29 4 khz ultrasound could not achieve maximum activity inhibition and stability impairment because further increasing the energy density was impeded by the potential water quality threat from leaked iom to elucidate this problem more clearly the acute toxicity of the treated water to q67 was determined as shown in fig 4 data at 0 j ml of energy density indicated that coagulation alone was inefficient in removing the toxic substances in aom which in turn suggested that the existing toxins might be of low molecular weight and hydrophilicity with the addition of ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz the inhibition ratio decreased by 34 8 1 8 3 1 20 9 and 3 1 20 9 respectively for 29 4 khz ultrasound the inhibition effect markedly intensified with increasing energy density beyond 3 42 j ml regardless of whether subsequent coagulation was conducted or not in comparison the inhibition effects under 470 and 780 khz ultrasound coagulation treatments were obviously reduced this finding indicate that maintaining the morphological integrity of algal cells should be prioritized for controlling the toxicity of the treated water 3 4 optimization of ultrasound settings to balance the treatment efficiency of ultrasound coagulation with economy the parameter turbidity removal efficiency calculated with eq 5 was employed and the results are summarized in table 1 a higher turbidity removal efficiency indicates a more economical ultrasound setting thus the appropriate intensity at a frequency of 29 4 470 and 780 khz was 1 77 1 77 3 42 and 1 77 3 42 j ml respectively 5 turbidity removal efficiency turbidity removal ratio energy density pac dosage to examine the laboratory test results experiments were also conducted on the field sample a dosage of 4 mg al l of pac was selected to investigate the practicability of the technique because of the significant turbidity and doc removal effects achieved with the assistance of ultrasound on the laboratory cultured sample at this dosage as shown in fig 5 top the turbidity removal was satisfactory overall and similar among the three frequencies consistent with the data from the laboratory cultured sample shown in fig 1 top moreover the doc removal performance for the field sample did not improve with the application of ultrasound figure s4 see si shows the results of acute toxicity tests for the field sample nearly the same trends observed in the laboratory cultured sample were observed for the field sample except for a lower toxic threat for the field sample which may be due to the fewer algal cells in the field sample 19 37 vs 88 36 Œºg l chlorophyll a furthermore as shown in fig 5 bottom the removal of extracellular 2 mib in the field sample did not improve with the application of ultrasound and deteriorated at 29 4 khz ultrasound with energy densities 3 42 j ml indicating the leakage of intracellular odorous compounds with cell destruction and supporting the results of the acute toxicity tests of note the laboratory cultured and filed samples were characterized by round shaped m aeruginosa and chain shaped pseudanabaena algal cells respectively theoretically the larger size of the chain shaped pseudanabaena favors the trapping and aggregation processes of coagulation and the coagulant demand would be reduced in addition at the 29 4 khz frequency energy densities 3 42 j ml resulted in the significant leakage of intracellular substances from algal cells in both the laboratory cultured and field samples figs 1 and 5 with regard to the 470 and 780 khz frequencies no obvious leakage was observed with increasing energy density from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml in the two types of samples the consistency of the ultrasonic effects on algal cells between the laboratory cultured and field samples even though the number of cells in the field sample was significantly lower indicates that the intensity optimization of ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 29 4 1 77 j ml 470 1 77 3 42 j ml and 780 1 77 3 42 j ml khz was reasonable and practically useful 4 conclusions in this study the performance of low frequency and high frequency ultrasound in enhancing the coagulation removal of algal cells and the underlying mechanisms were systematically evaluated and the intensity of ultrasonic pretreatment at different frequency ranges was optimized with respect to removal efficiency safety and economy based on the results the following key conclusions can be drawn coagulation removal of algal cells at a low coagulant dosage can be substantially enhanced by applying ultrasonic pretreatment with high frequency ultrasound demonstrating better performance than low frequency ultrasound the mechanisms via which ultrasonic pretreatment enhances the coagulation removal of algal cells mainly involve the impairment of the activity and stability of algal cells and low frequency ultrasound was more effective than high frequency ultrasound in inhibiting activity with increasing ultrasound frequency the prominent ultrasonic effects on algal cells transformed from mechanical disruption at 29 4 khz frequency irreversible to chemical oxidation at 470 khz frequency and resonance induced damage at 780 khz frequency reversible avoiding the severe destruction of algal cells by restricting the energy density of ultrasonic pretreatment is an effective means to minimize the toxicity of the treated water the preferable intensity of ultrasound considering removal efficiency safety and economy was 1 77 j ml for 29 4 khz 1 77 3 42 j ml for 470 khz and 1 77 3 42 j ml for 780 khz further studies on improving the electroacoustic conversion efficiency of transducers and exploring more efficient reactors to extend the effective limits of ultrasound are of great necessity

cells in algae laden water however study differences in ultrasound settings algal cell conditions and coagulant properties complicate the accurate evaluation of this technique for practical applications no study has yet compared algae and algal organic matters removal among different frequencies of ultrasound in the ultrasound coagulation process in this study the ultrasound at three typical frequencies 29 4 470 and 780 khz were applied for this purpose the results showed that high frequency ultrasound at 470 and 780 khz had substantially greater improvement of coagulation than low frequency ultrasound at 29 4 khz for example the turbidity removal at 1 mg al l of polymeric aluminum chloride increased by 204 2 571 9 and 563 2 under 29 4 470 and 780 khz ultrasound coagulation respectively at 3 42 j ml algal cells exhibited irreversible physical damage and the release of intracellular organic matters such as odorous compounds under low frequency ultrasound with energy densities 3 42 j ml whereas high frequency ultrasound was characterized by nonviolent impairment including oxidative degradation and gas vacuole destruction particularly reversible resulting from ultrasound induced radicals and cell resonance respectively avoiding the severe destruction of algal cells is crucial for minimizing the toxicity and secondary pollution of the treated water to achieve satisfactory removal protected safety and better economy the optimal energy density for each frequency was also determined the findings from the analyses of the laboratory cultured sample were confirmed via real eutrophic surface water this study provides new insights and guidance for the ongoing study of harmful algal removal by ultrasound enhanced coagulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrasound coagulation frequency energy density algal organic matter mechanism toxicity 1 introduction the eutrophication of surface waters can lead to many undesired issues among which cyanobacterial blooms are of the most alarming ones and have attracted considerable attention due to their increasing frequency and intensity in recent decades rajasekhar et al 2012 coagulation has been widely employed in water treatment plants for algal liquid separation however algal cells are organic particles that have negative zeta potential and exhibit considerable stability in water due to their hydrophilic effects electrostatic repulsion steric effects and small sizes edzwald 1993 henderson et al 2008 a commonly used method to improve the efficiency of coagulation is to add oxidants prior to coagulation i e preoxidation these oxidants are characterized by strong oxidizability via which negatively charged algal organic matters aom on the cell surface can be effectively degraded leading to the destabilization and aggregation of algae cells because of the reduced electrostatic repulsion and steric effects among these cells qi et al 2016 xie et al 2013 nonetheless the addition of oxidants may introduce additional problems involving other pollutants such as intracellular organic matters iom such as algal toxins and odorous compounds and corresponding disinfection by products dbps fang et al 2010 xie et al 2013 given the above environmentally friendly and efficient techniques are urgently needed ultrasound is one such technique as only sound energy is involved during treatment ultrasonic effects in water include physical mechanical effects in multiple forms such as intense shock waves high shear forces liquid microjets and resonances and chemical effects with strong oxidizing substances such as hydroxyl radicals muthupandian 2011 rajasekhar et al 2012 discussions regarding the effectiveness of ultrasound have dominated research on harmful algae control removal in recent years rajasekhar et al 2012 wu et al 2011 this technique has been widely accepted as a potential alternative for the effective removal of cyanobacteria containing gas vacuoles fan et al 2017a 2017b especially microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa another important trait of ultrasound is its promising performance in collaboration with other techniques for algal removal such as coagulation huang et al 2020b li et al 2019b and microbubbles broekman et al 2010 previous studies have demonstrated a significantly enhanced coagulation removal of algal cells through either low frequency or high frequency ultrasonic pretreatment heng et al 2009 shi et al 2008 zhang et al 2009a however the lack of a systematic comparison between low frequency and high frequency ultrasound on the coagulation removal of algae is not conducive to the global evaluation of the application of ultrasound in practical engineering a recent study peng et al 2020b preliminarily tested the performance of ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 20 0 038 w ml 740 0 113 w ml and 1120 khz 0 108 w ml on the coagulation removal of algal cells and showed that high frequency ultrasound was preferable to low frequency ultrasound however the intensity settings among these frequencies were inconsistent and only one polymeric aluminum chloride pac dosage was used in that study 10 mg l the exact dosage of al was not reported our previous work huang et al 2020b investigated the specific mechanisms for the enhanced coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells by low frequency ultrasound and found that with the addition of 29 4 khz ultrasonic pretreatment at intensities of 0 6 1 11 and 2 22 j ml 4 mg al l of polymeric aluminum chloride pac achieved increased removal from 44 1 to 59 7 67 0 and 74 9 without the undesired leakage of aom in that work different mechanisms were definitely correlated with certain treatment intensities including the cell activity reduction 0 6 j ml cell stability impairment 1 11 j ml and cell aggregation 1 11 j ml li et al 2019b investigated the effects of high frequency ultrasound on enhancing the coagulation removal of cyanobacterial cells and the corresponding mechanisms and showed that the coagulation removal was increased by approximately 7 0 10 2 8 2 and 6 3 pac 10 mg l respectively upon ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 120 430 740 and 1120 khz and an energy density of 5 4 j ml they recommended a mild high frequency ultrasonic pretreatment e g 740 khz and 6 j ml to avoid the overmuch accumulation of proteins and the excessive production of radicals for a better algae removal effect although the effects of low frequency and high frequency ultrasound on the coagulation removal of algal cells and the mechanisms involved have been investigated in different studies the conclusions cannot be compared directly due to the multifarious ultrasound settings such as frequency range and intensity the diversity of algal cell conditions including source initial concentration and growth phase and the dissimilar coagulant properties affected by reagent purity preparation method and basicity there is still a lack of studies that compare between low frequency and high frequency ultrasound combined with coagulation with respect to algae and aom removal in addition no direct proof is available regarding the safety of the ultrasound coagulation process therefore this study aimed to reveal the differences in the effects and mechanisms of ultrasound on the coagulation removal of algae and aom among a low frequency 29 4 khz and two high frequencies 470 and 780 khz of ultrasound moreover the toxicity of the treated water and the leakage of intracellular odorous compounds 2 methyl isoborneol 2 mib were determined to identify the relationships between safety and ultrasound settings for reference of note both the laboratory cultured algal sample and the field sample were employed which provides new scientific and engineering insights and guidance for the ongoing study of ultrasound techniques to enhance the coagulation removal of harmful algae 2 materials and methods

solution surface and the normal operating temperature of the low frequency transducer was maintained by a water cooling device a more detailed description of the systems is presented in our previous

study were of at least analytical grade and were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china without further purification unless noted otherwise 2 2 experimental procedures ultrasound coagulation experiments were carried out during the exponential growth period of m aeruginosa before the experiments the m aeruginosa solution was mixed and diluted with 0 5 normal saline

optical density of m aeruginosa solution was detected using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr6000 hach co loveland usa the field sample was fully homogenized prior to the experiments the influence of ultrasound frequency on the coagulation removal of algal cells was evaluated under different ultrasound intensities and pac dosages for each test 500 ml of m aeruginosa solution or field sample was

characterization a thermostatic water bath was used to maintain the temperature of solution at 25 0 5 during the sonication then the sonicated solution was transferred to a magnetic stirrer my3000 6f

and aom fig 1 top displays the influence of ultrasonic pretreatment at different frequency ranges on the coagulation removal of m aeruginosa cells as indicated by turbidity ultrasound effectively enhanced the turbidity removal at low pac dosages 4 mg al l in this study for example the turbidity removal ratio at 2 mg al l of pac increased from 56 2 without ultrasound to 94 1 95 0 and 95 5 with the assistance of 29 4 470 and 780 khz ultrasound respectively at an energy density of 3 42 j ml this result is similar to that of shi et al 2008 who reported that ultrasonic pretreatment at 20 khz and 0 16 w ml for 30 s calculated energy density 4 8 j ml improved the turbidity removal ratio at a pac dosage of 17 8 mg l the exact dosage of al was not reported from approximately 95 8 to 99 2 and is similar to that of li et al 2019b who found that at frequencies of 430 and 740 khz 60 s of ultrasonic pretreatment at 0 09 w ml calculated energy density 5 4 j ml led to an approximately 10 2 and 8 2 higher turbidity removal ratio respectively with 10 mg l of pac the exact dosage of al was not reported notably the improvement in turbidity removal ratio achieved in our study was comparatively more distinct this finding can be ascribed to the differences in actual al dosages and al species affected by coagulant basicity cao et al 2016 moreover the different characteristics of algal cells as a result of different habitats laboratory cultured strains vs field samples and growth phases exponential growth period vs stabilized growth period may have contributed to this difference specifically the improvement in turbidity removal at the two high frequencies was superior to that at the low frequency when the pac dosage was 1 and 2 mg al l under either of these two pac dosages the residual turbidity at the low frequency stagnated with increasing energy density from 6 84 to 17 7 j ml whereas that at the two high frequencies showed a continuous decrease these phenomena indicate the different mechanisms of ultrasonic pretreatment in the ultrasound coagulation process at different frequency ranges the immediate effects of ultrasound on the activity and stability of algal cells were characterized to give a direct inspection of the mechanisms of ultrasonic pretreatment the inactivation of algal cells in high algae containing water facilitates their trapping by the hydrolyzed products of coagulants petrusevski et al 1996 steynberg et al 1996 additionally the reduction in activity may weaken the ability of algal cells to maintain negative charges on their surfaces by impairing ion transfer across the cell membrane ghernaout et al 2010 the resulting reduction in electrostatic repulsion accelerates the aggregation of algal cells the activity of algal cells was determined by detecting their photosynthesis an important process for algal metabolism fig 2 left presents the photosynthetic activity of m aeruginosa cells and illustrates that an energy density of 3 42 j ml was sufficient to substantially weaken cell activity further increasing the energy density had little effect moreover as energy density increased from 0 to 3 42 j ml the activity decrease at the low frequency was more distinct than that at the two high frequencies for example 29 4 khz ultrasound at 1 77 j ml achieved almost the same inhibition effect on photosynthetic activity as 470 and 780 khz ultrasound at 3 42 j ml nearly twice the former intensity on the other hand the stability of algal cells was reflected by the zeta potential a decisive factor affecting electrostatic repulsion and steric effects among algal cells li et al 2014 fig 2 right presents the zeta potential of m aeruginosa cells and reveals a distinct difference in the overall behavior pattern of zeta potential between low frequency and high frequency ultrasound for the 29 4 khz frequency the absolute zeta potential first decreased 0 6 84 j ml and then increased 6 84 34 2 j ml with increasing energy density in contrast for the 470 and 780 khz frequencies the zeta potential at energy densities higher than 6 84 j ml remained approximately constant accordingly the stagnant turbidity removal at 29 4 khz ultrasound with energy density from 6 84 to 17 7 j ml fig 1 was affected by the recovery of cell stability fig 1 bottom displays the influence of ultrasonic pretreatment at different frequency ranges on the coagulation removal of aom as indicated by doc level overall doc removal did not reach an excellent level even with the addition of ultrasound the maximum doc removal ratio at 29 4 470 and 780 khz frequencies was 51 7 57 8 and 57 5 respectively these results are in agreement with the findings of ma et al 2006 who observed that neither extracellular organic matters eom nor iom were easily removed by coagulation for a given pac dosage compared with that in the control group doc removal at the 29 4 khz frequency deteriorated gradually with increasing energy density from 3 42 to 17 7 j ml whereas that at the 470 and 780 khz frequencies exhibited no obvious deterioration presenting a slight increase 0 3 42 j ml followed by a minor decrease 3 42 17 7 j ml with increasing energy density note that the doc increase at 0 mg al l of pac between the ultrasound group and the control group reflects the amount of iom leaked from m aeruginosa cells thus indicating an absolutely severe destruction of algal cells at the 29 4 khz ultrasound for instance at 6 84 j ml the 29 4 470 and 780 khz ultrasound resulted in 132 0 102 4 and 111 5 doc levels respectively moreover the higher the energy density the greater the leakage of iom peng et al 2020a investigated the effects of ultrasound on the destruction of m aeruginosa cells and the release of iom and showed that ultrasonic irradiation at frequencies of 20 calculated energy density 11 4 j ml and 740 khz calculated energy density 33 9 j ml increased doc level by approximately 15 8 and 12 4 respectively the results of their study and the present study agree in that algal cells were severely ruptured resulting in the leakage of iom but they differ in that the energy consumption in their study was higher this difference may be related to the obviously higher initial concentration of algal cells in their study 1 5 107 vs 0 7 107 cells ml which weakened the ultrasound intensity on individual cells 3 2 influences of ultrasound settings on mechanisms of ultrasonic pretreatment given that mechanisms derive from the mechanical and chemical effects of ultrasound the quantitative determinations of these effects enable a better understanding of the underlying processes figure s2 left of the si shows the amount of iom leaked from algal cells after ultrasonic pretreatment the iom leakage at a given energy density decreased in the order of 29 4 k 0 295 780 k 0 100 and 470 khz k 0 066 it is well established that the acoustic bubbles formed at low frequencies are larger and their collapse is more aggressive mason et al 2011 yusof et al 2016 hence the findings could be explained by the more violent mechanical disruption effect at the 29 4 khz frequency than at the two high frequencies the smaller transmitting surface of the 29 4 khz horn type transducer also contributed to iom leakage by delivering more concentrated energy the result was further confirmed by the morphology characterization of algal cells as shown in figure s3 see si cells in the control group had smooth surfaces extensive changes were observed at 29 4 khz frequency the cells were severely destroyed and or exhibited evident concave surfaces in contrast the cells at 470 and 780 khz frequencies did not show distinct deformation or destruction in addition as shown in figure s2 right of the si the production of hydroxyl radicals at a given energy density decreased in the inverse order of iom leakage i e 470 k 1 948 780 k 1 265 and 29 4 khz k 0 330 this finding is in accordance with some recent studies where the favorable frequencies for sonochemical yield were proposed to be within 100 500 khz pokhrel et al 2016 200 600 khz sathishkumar et al 2016 and 300 500 khz wood et al 2017 theoretically the acoustic bubbles formed at higher frequencies are smaller mason et al 2011 yusof et al 2016 as a consequence limited energy is released in the form of mechanical shock but the collapse occurs more frequently facilitating the diffusion of hydroxyl radicals to liquid phase interestingly there was an inflection point at 470 khz frequency and a higher frequency of 780 khz had an increased iom leakage and decreased hydroxyl radical production previous studies agree that the resonant collapse of gas vacuoles organelles composed of stocks of gas vesicles and endowing algal cells with the ability to float in water can occur when the algal cells are of the same size range as the acoustic bubbles resonating at the applied frequency the rupture of gas vacuoles can deteriorate the physiology of algal cells and ultimately lead to the leakage of iom according to the theoretical frequency radius equation rajasekhar et al 2012 the resonance radii of gas bubbles resonating at frequencies of 470 and 780 khz are approximately 6 98 and 4 21 Œºm respectively thus considering the radius range of m aeruginosa cells of 3 4 Œºm as displayed in figure s3 a of the si 780 khz ultrasound might evoke more significant resonance induced damage to gas vacuoles than the other frequencies of ultrasound in addition the lower radical production at 780 khz frequency was attributed to the less collapses of bubbles per unit of time because of the too short rarefaction compression cycle ashokkumar et al 1997 muthupandian 2011 the possibility of intracellular damage to gas vacuoles was validated by a 7 day growth monitoring experiment as shown in fig 3 the algal cells treated with ultrasound displayed significant sedimentation on day 1 and the overall od680 removal ratios were 36 6 68 3 32 9 48 4 and 55 6 66 4 for the frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz respectively a higher od680 removal ratio indicates a higher settling rate of algal cells and thus demonstrating that the 29 4 and 780 khz ultrasound caused more severe damage to the cells and their gas vacuoles moreover the algal cells in supernatant recovered to varying degrees after 7 days of cultivation prior research suggests that illumination is vitally important for the recovery of gas vacuoles in algal cells lee et al 2000 the rate of the od680 value at day 7 to that at day 1 in the control group was 122 3 125 8 while at 29 4 470 and 780 khz frequencies the corresponding ranges were 126 7 140 3 154 3 182 0 and 226 9 238 2 respectively compared with the control group a higher rate indicates a more significant resuspension of sedimentary cells thus the results demonstrate a milder and more effective cell resonance effect of 780 khz ultrasound in comparison 470 khz ultrasound yielded much higher production of hydroxyl radicals than the other frequencies of ultrasound thus enabling intracellular oxidation through the synergistic effect of sonoporation and radical oxidation lentacker et al 2014 xie et al 2013 demonstrated that potent oxidation can cause the desorption of negatively charged organic coatings form the cell surface in addition our previous study huang et al 2020a demonstrated that mechanical effects by ultrasound can cause the physical detachment of the coatings accordingly the decrease of negative charges on the cell surface fig 2 as indicated by zeta potential under low frequency and high frequency ultrasound was mainly attributed to the physical detachment and the oxidative degradation respectively of negatively charged aom in view of the analyses presented above 29 4 khz ultrasound caused mainly irreversible mechanical disruption to algal cells these physical attacks provided more efficient inhibition of cell activity however under a too high intensity 6 84 j ml in this study the severely destroyed cells with smaller sizes had stronger electronegativity i e better stability which impaired coagulation removal in contrast 470 and 780 khz ultrasound were characterized by nonviolent and reversible oxidation degradation and cell resonance effects under which the activity and stability of the algal cells decreased without reversal 3 3 influences of ultrasound settings on the toxicity of the treated water the energy density required to substantially enhance the coagulation removal of algal cells and either not impair or improve doc removal at low pac dosages 1 4 mg al l in this study was 1 77 17 7 and 6 84 j ml for the frequency of 29 4 470 and 780 khz respectively in these circumstances only 29 4 khz ultrasound could not achieve maximum activity inhibition and stability impairment because further increasing the energy density was impeded by the potential water quality threat from leaked iom to elucidate this problem more clearly the acute toxicity of the treated water to q67 was determined as shown in fig 4 data at 0 j ml of energy density indicated that coagulation alone was inefficient in removing the toxic substances in aom which in turn suggested that the existing toxins might be of low molecular weight and hydrophilicity with the addition of ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 29 4 470 and 780 khz the inhibition ratio decreased by 34 8 1 8 3 1 20 9 and 3 1 20 9 respectively for 29 4 khz ultrasound the inhibition effect markedly intensified with increasing energy density beyond 3 42 j ml regardless of whether subsequent coagulation was conducted or not in comparison the inhibition effects under 470 and 780 khz ultrasound coagulation treatments were obviously reduced this finding indicate that maintaining the morphological integrity of algal cells should be prioritized for controlling the toxicity of the treated water 3 4 optimization of ultrasound settings to balance the treatment efficiency of ultrasound coagulation with economy the parameter turbidity removal efficiency calculated with eq 5 was employed and the results are summarized in table 1 a higher turbidity removal efficiency indicates a more economical ultrasound setting thus the appropriate intensity at a frequency of 29 4 470 and 780 khz was 1 77 1 77 3 42 and 1 77 3 42 j ml respectively 5 turbidity removal efficiency turbidity removal ratio energy density pac dosage to examine the laboratory test results experiments were also conducted on the field sample a dosage of 4 mg al l of pac was selected to investigate the practicability of the technique because of the significant turbidity and doc removal effects achieved with the assistance of ultrasound on the laboratory cultured sample at this dosage as shown in fig 5 top the turbidity removal was satisfactory overall and similar among the three frequencies consistent with the data from the laboratory cultured sample shown in fig 1 top moreover the doc removal performance for the field sample did not improve with the application of ultrasound figure s4 see si shows the results of acute toxicity tests for the field sample nearly the same trends observed in the laboratory cultured sample were observed for the field sample except for a lower toxic threat for the field sample which may be due to the fewer algal cells in the field sample 19 37 vs 88 36 Œºg l chlorophyll a furthermore as shown in fig 5 bottom the removal of extracellular 2 mib in the field sample did not improve with the application of ultrasound and deteriorated at 29 4 khz ultrasound with energy densities 3 42 j ml indicating the leakage of intracellular odorous compounds with cell destruction and supporting the results of the acute toxicity tests of note the laboratory cultured and filed samples were characterized by round shaped m aeruginosa and chain shaped pseudanabaena algal cells respectively theoretically the larger size of the chain shaped pseudanabaena favors the trapping and aggregation processes of coagulation and the coagulant demand would be reduced in addition at the 29 4 khz frequency energy densities 3 42 j ml resulted in the significant leakage of intracellular substances from algal cells in both the laboratory cultured and field samples figs 1 and 5 with regard to the 470 and 780 khz frequencies no obvious leakage was observed with increasing energy density from 1 77 to 17 7 j ml in the two types of samples the consistency of the ultrasonic effects on algal cells between the laboratory cultured and field samples even though the number of cells in the field sample was significantly lower indicates that the intensity optimization of ultrasonic pretreatment at frequencies of 29 4 1 77 j ml 470 1 77 3 42 j ml and 780 1 77 3 42 j ml khz was reasonable and practically useful 4 conclusions in this study the performance of low frequency and high frequency ultrasound in enhancing the coagulation removal of algal cells and the underlying mechanisms were systematically evaluated and the intensity of ultrasonic pretreatment at different frequency ranges was optimized with respect to removal efficiency safety and economy based on the results the following key conclusions can be drawn coagulation removal of algal cells at a low coagulant dosage can be substantially enhanced by applying ultrasonic pretreatment with high frequency ultrasound demonstrating better performance than low frequency ultrasound the mechanisms via which ultrasonic pretreatment enhances the coagulation removal of algal cells mainly involve the impairment of the activity and stability of algal cells and low frequency ultrasound was more effective than high frequency ultrasound in inhibiting activity with increasing ultrasound frequency the prominent ultrasonic effects on algal cells transformed from mechanical disruption at 29 4 khz frequency irreversible to chemical oxidation at 470 khz frequency and resonance induced damage at 780 khz frequency reversible avoiding the severe destruction of algal cells by restricting the energy density of ultrasonic pretreatment is an effective means to minimize the toxicity of the treated water the preferable intensity of ultrasound considering removal efficiency safety and economy was 1 77 j ml for 29 4 khz 1 77 3 42 j ml for 470 khz and 1 77 3 42 j ml for 780 khz further studies on improving the electroacoustic conversion efficiency of transducers and exploring more efficient reactors to extend the effective limits of ultrasound are of great necessity
