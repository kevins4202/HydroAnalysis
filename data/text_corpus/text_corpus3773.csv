18865,poroelastic fluid structure interaction models were coupled to experimental data to determine the effects of biofilm spatial distribution of mechanical and hydraulic properties on the biofilm hydraulic resistance and compressibility in membrane filtration processes biofilms were cultivated on ultrafiltration membranes for 20 and 30 days under high 0 28 bar and low 0 06 bar transmembrane pressure tmp in dead end filtration mode subsequently biofilms were subjected to a compression relaxation cycles by step wise tmp changes structural deformation of biofilms during compression was observed in situ using optical coherence tomography experimental results show that the observed increase in the biofilm hydraulic resistance during compression is not necessarily accompanied by a detectable biofilm thickness reduction a dual layer biofilm model with a dense base and porous top layer could explain these observed results because porosity controls indirectly the mechanical response of biofilms under compression results could be described without assuming a gradient in mechanical properties within the biofilm the biofilm surface roughness did not significantly influence the water flux in this study however the fraction of biofilm base layer directly exposed to bulk liquid could be a good indicator in the determination of water flux the main implications of this study for the design and operation of low pressure membrane systems e g mf and uf with fouling layer being the main filtration resistance lays in the selection of favorable operational tmp and biofilm morphology keywords biofilm compression hydraulic resistance poroelastic model biofilm surface roughness membrane filtration 1 introduction biofilm formation causes additional hydraulic resistance that adversely impacts water production in membrane systems mcdonogh et al 1994 radu et al 2010 in membrane systems such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf biofilm resistance is the main filtration resistance dreszer et al 2013 ko and pellegrino 1992 martin et al 2014 biofilms are often described as porous media consisting of several layers with different properties such as density zhang and bishop 1994 porosity gao et al 2011a okabe et al 1998 rosenthal et al 2018 and elastic modulus aravas and laspidou 2008 picioreanu et al 2018 in general biofilm porosity increases with the distance from substratum whereas the biofilm elastic modulus or rigidity seems to have an opposite trend the spatial distribution of porosity and mechanical properties affect the biofilm permeability as well as the structural responses under compressive forces biofilm compression has been often described as the main cause of changes in biofilm hydraulic resistance during water filtration derlon et al 2016 dreszer et al 2013 jorgensen et al 2017 poorasgari et al 2016 valladares linares et al 2015 indeed as biofilms are subjected to larger forces e g higher transmembrane pressure tmp biofilms undergo a decrease in thickness and surface roughness derlon et al 2014 2016 desmond et al 2018c dreszer et al 2014 valladares linares et al 2015 leading to a reduction in biofilm porosity blauert et al 2015 and permeability derlon et al 2016 desmond et al 2018c the magnitude of the increase in hydraulic resistance upon compression depends on biofilm composition e g eps concentration and composition desmond et al 2018a herzberg et al 2009 growth conditions e g operational tmp and growth time derlon et al 2016 dreszer et al 2014 poorasgari et al 2015 and operation mode e g dead end and cross flow poorasgari et al 2015 reported an increased hydraulic resistance of the fouling layer under elevated tmp during dead end filtration without correlating this to the physical structure of the fouling layer dreszer et al 2013 also reported that biofilm hydraulic resistance increases at higher permeate fluxes however dreszer et al 2013 calculated the biofilm thickness based on biofilm weight per specific area meaning that compression effects on biofilm morphology could not be detected later developments of in situ imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography oct enabled researchers to study biofilm development wagner et al 2010 wang et al 2017 and structural deformation in real time during compression blauert et al 2015 desmond et al 2018c biofilm thickness and hydraulic resistance were correlated using in situ oct imaging techniques during mf process dreszer et al 2014 it was observed that the biofilm hydraulic resistances increased at larger permeate fluxes and the resistance returned almost to its original value as compression forces were released however in the study of dreszer et al 2014 the severe changes in resistance were only accompanied by a slight change in biofilm thickness valladares linares et al 2015 also related the change in hydraulic resistance of mf biofouling to the biofilm thickness and structural deformation through oct imaging furthermore derlon et al 2016 measured increased biofilm hydraulic resistance with increasing tmp during a dead end uf system the correlation between biofilm resistance biofilm thickness and biofilm roughness was later studied by desmond et al 2018c in a gravity driven membrane gdm system they observed that the increase in hydraulic resistance is accompanied by a reduction of biofilm relative roughness based on oct images during compression of several model biofilms interestingly they also reported that the increase in hydraulic resistance of a river water biofilm could not be correlated to changes in biofilm thickness and roughness recently jafari et al 2018 proposed a fluid structural model that can explain the structural and hydrological responses of a smooth surface biofilm to compression during water filtration in membrane systems the numerical model enabled the quantification of mechanical and hydrological properties of different biofilms the relation between structural deformation and hydraulic resistance during compression of biofilms with different morphologies e g surface roughness is not still clear therefore this study aims at evaluating membrane biofilm compressibility and the corresponding changes in biofilm hydraulic resistance as a function of i biofilm growth conditions i e growth time and growth tmp ii spatial distribution of mechanical and hydrological properties in the biofilm and iii biofilm surface roughness to this goal a computational model was developed and supported by experimental results 2 experimental set up 2 1 biofilm cultivation and growth conditions biofilms were cultivated in a flow cell under dead end ultrafiltration mode with the membrane effective area of 18 75 cm2 biofilms developed from filtration of river water chriesbach river dübendorf switzerland during winter under growth conditions listed in table 1 the detailed characteristics total organic carbon dissolved organic carbon assimilable organic carbon etc of feed water used for biofilm growth can be found in derlon et al 2013 and in supplementary information table s1 in the first experiment we evaluated the effect of biofilm age 20 and 30 days when grown under constant transmembrane pressure tmp 0 06 bar in the second experiment the effect of tmp 0 06 and 0 28 bar during biofilm growth was studied to evaluate data reproducibility biofilms were grown in several parallel flow cells in each growth condition 2 2 biofilm compression experiments the biofilms grown in parallel flow cells were subjected to the compression relaxation tests consisting of gradual increase decrease of tmp to specific values as defined in fig 1 biofilms were subjected to an identical compression and relaxation cycle regardless of their growth tmp the tmp range between 0 06 and 0 5 bar was selected based on practical implications and construction limitations gdm systems biofilms were discarded after one compression relaxation test all compression tests were done in a 20 c temperature controlled room 2 3 hydraulic parameters the permeate flux in l m2 h was calculated from mass measurements of collected permeate the biofilm hydraulic resistance r bio m 1 resulted from the difference between the total hydraulic resistance r tot and membrane resistance r mem as explained in martin et al 2014 the total filtration resistance was calculated through darcy s law based on applied tmp and the measured permeate flux in the presence of biofilm jafari et al 2018 the intrinsic membrane resistance r mem was measured with nanopure water for 24 h prior to fouling 2 4 biofilm morphology quantification the morphological response of biofilms to compression forces was determined by means of optical coherence tomography oct ganymede gan210 thorlabs gmbh dachau germany light source center wavelength of 930 nm and refractive index of 1 33 in order to improve statistical certainty of biofilm morphological properties at least 10 images were taken at random locations in each flow cell at each pressure step mean biofilm thickness and surface roughness were quantified using a customized matlab routine mathworks natick us mean absolute surface roughness δ abs shows biofilm thickness variability averaged for a number of image locations according to eq 1 moreover mean roughness coefficient δ rough was calculated which indicates biofilm thickness distribution normalized to mean biofilm thickness based on eq 2 murga et al 1995 1 δ a b s 1 n i 1 n l f l f 2 δ r o u g h 1 n i 1 n l f l f l f δ a b s l f where n is the number of measurements l f is biofilm local thickness and l f is the mean biofilm thickness 3 model description 3 1 model geometry and physics the mathematical model used to correlate the biofilm structural deformation with the corresponding changes in hydraulic resistance during compression was presented in details in jafari et al 2018 therefore the model is here only briefly described in this poroelastic model fluid flow in the biofilm was reciprocally coupled to the structural mechanics of the biofilm the gradient of liquid pressure in biofilm pores affects the effective stress in the biofilm and leads to structural deformation while the deformation changes the permeability and consequently the pore pressure due to the dead end filtration mode the biofilm properties would change mainly in the direction of permeate flow i e perpendicular to the membrane however a two dimensional 2 d model was developed to evaluate the effect of biofilm surface roughness on permeate flux and biofilm deformation fig 2 two different geometries were used to represent both smooth cases 1 and 2 and rough surface biofilms cases 3 to 6 in table 2 average biofilm thickness l f and biofilm length l x of the model biofilms were based on experimental results the membrane was represented by an additional layer with thickness l m the biofilm base layer thickness l b and top layer thickness l t in the bi layer model biofilm were constructed so that the sum l b l t equals the average thickness l f in case of smooth surface biofilm cases 1 and 2 the model could in principle be reduced to one dimension jafari et al 2018 however for consistency we kept the 2 d model geometry for all six cases finally the biofilm depth in the third dimension z was considered to be large enough to apply the 2 d plane strain simplification coussy 2004 the velocity and pressure fields for water flow through the biofilm were calculated from darcy s law with permeability k being related to biofilm porosity φ by a linear relationship k aφ in which a is the biofilm permeability coefficient under compression local biofilm porosity φ x y is related to the porosity prior to compression φ 0 and biofilm

the balance of momentum for a saturated porous material biot poroelasticity coussy 2004 the linear elastic response depends on the elastic modulus e and poisson s ratio ν of the biofilm in case of bilayer biofilms different hydraulic and or mechanical properties were applied in each layer applied boundary conditions are presented in fig 2 and all model parameters are in table 3 3 2 model cases and their structure six biofilm cases were selected based on their morphology rough or smooth surfaces and structures mono layer or bi layer biofilms have different surface roughness properties and multi layer structure depending on their growth conditions as reported by desmond et al 2018c they also observed during dead end filtration that biofilms developed under phosphate limitation had smooth surface and mono layer structure as opposed of river water biofilms that had rough surface and bi layer structure desmond et al 2018b existence of base layer can be explained by biofilm stratification densification adjacent to the substratum e g membrane caused by different growth condition parameters such as hydrodynamic strengths carbon sources organic loading rate and culture time bishop et al 1995 derlon et al 2008 okabe et al 1996 in addition biofilm porosity and elastic modulus were selected as distinctive properties in determination of biofilm hydraulic and mechanical behaviour jafari et al 2018 thus in this study we selected smooth surface case 1 and 2 and rough surface biofilms case 3 to 6 to evaluate the importance of the bi layer structure four biofilm cases with different porosity and or elastic modulus among the layers were set up cases 2 4 5 and 6 table 2 shows biofilm morphologies and specifications of the six chosen cases 3 3 model solution the 2 d fluid structure interaction model was solved in comsol multiphysics v5 3 a comsol inc burlington ma the fluid flow in porous media was coupled with plane strain structural mechanics and computed through a stationary solver triangular mesh elements had a maximum size of 2 μm to ensure the solution independency on mesh size 4 results 4 1 correlation between biofilm hydraulic resistance and the structural deformation river water biofilms were cultivated in parallel flow cells under three different conditions fig 3 shows the biofilm mean thickness and hydraulic resistance measured during a compression and relaxation cycle as expected biofilms grown for longer time 30 days were thicker 70 10 μm average thickness than younger biofilms 40 3 μm after 20 days under the same growth tmp 0 06 bar fig 3a and b furthermore biofilms grown under high tmp 0 28 bar were thinner 50 3 μm average thickness compared to the low tmp 0 06 bar biofilms at the same age 30 days fig 3b and c interestingly when subjected to compression and relaxation phases the river water biofilms did not undergo a significant structural deformation i e change in thickness and roughness fig 3a c a relatively constant biofilm thickness is also observed in the time lapse videos in supplementary information si v1 and si v2 while the membrane displacement clearly indicates the applied pressure steps however biofilm hydraulic resistance increases significantly during compression over tmp range of 0 06 0 5 bar fig 3d f from 3 1012 to 5 1012 m 1 for the biofilm grown at 0 06 bar for 20 days and from 3 1012 to 4 1012 m 1 for the biofilm developed for 30 days biofilms grown under high tmp 0 28 bar showed greater hydraulic resistance change from 5 1012 to 8 1012 m 1 during compression tests these measurements clearly confirm that biofilms grown under higher tmp were more compact thinner fig 3b and c and associated higher hydraulic resistance fig 3e and f 4 2 effect of growth conditions on biofilm surface morphology experiments in uf flow cells have shown that the growth conditions affect not only the biofilm thickness but also the biofilm surface roughness fig 4 displays biofilm surface morphology properties i e mean absolute roughness and mean relative roughness coefficient developed in different conditions clearly the biofilms after 30 days of cultivation showed higher roughness coefficient δrough 0 3 0 05 than after 20 days δrough 0 16 0 05 when grown under tmp 0 06 bar fig 4a moreover the biofilms grown at larger pressure were smoother δrough 0 11 0 05 compared to biofilms grown at low pressures fig 4a similar trend was observed in biofilm mean absolute roughness fig 4b however change in the biofilm roughness measured during compression of river water biofilms did not follow any clear trend as also reported in other studies e g desmond et al 2018c 4 3 selection of a fluid structure biofilm model correlating thickness and resistance under compression experimental measurements of river water biofilms under compression showed a considerable increase in hydraulic resistance up to 60 while biofilm thickness only slightly changed to explain the correlation between biofilm thickness and resistance during compression we developed a fluid structural model and evaluated several biofilm possible structures with different morphological mechanical and hydrological properties table 2 three main variables mean biofilm displacement change in hydraulic resistance and water flux were calculated and compared with experimental results of biofilm grown for 20 days under tmp 0 06 bar fig 5 the fitting parameters table 3 were selected for each model biofilm individually so that the three measured variables are optimally represented the model results of mean biofilm displacement obtained by one layer rough case 3 dual porosity rough case 4 and dual porosity elasticity rough biofilm models case 6 are in agreement with experimental results however the mean displacement in other model cases was still within range of experimental results fig 5a furthermore the measured water flux was around 20 35 l m2 h which is compatible with the calculated flux for one layer flat case 1 dual porosity elasticity flat case 2 dual porosity rough case 4 and dual porosity elasticity rough biofilm models case 6 fig 5b finally fig 5c indicates that dual porosity elasticity flat case 2 dual porosity rough case 4 and dual porosity elasticity rough case 6 biofilm models could explain a significant increase in hydraulic resistance 40 60 during compression considering all three criteria the dual layer rough biofilms cases 4 and 6 are the most suitable to explain the experimental results the difference between cases 4 constant mechanical properties across the biofilm and 6 layers of different elasticity shows that a gradient of initial biofilm porosity is more important than a gradient of mechanical properties in determination of biofilm deformation and hydraulic resistance during compression therefore case 4 dual porosity rough was selected to further evaluate biofilm local properties during compression due less model parameters required compared with case 6 4 4 model calibration and parameters estimation all the model cases were calibrated with experimental results of biofilms grown for 20 days under tmp 0 06 bar model parameters used in this study are shown in table 3 geometric parameters i e biofilm average thickness base and top layers thickness and top layer coverage area were selected based on oct images and biofilm morphological properties of the specific biofilm initial porosity of top and base layers if applicable were chosen with the assumption that porosity of base layer is lower than top layer porosity prior to compression gao et al 2011b the porosity values and distribution in biofilms were in accordance with the observations reported by blauert et al 2015 gao et al 2011b wagner et al 2010 in the model calibration procedure initial biofilm porosity of both layers if applicable was kept constant and only fitting parameters permeability coefficient elastic modulus were changed to calibrate the models moreover during model selection procedure fig 5 a model was considered acceptable only if the model results were within the range of experimental data considering experimental deviations for example in fig 5a all the models were acceptable for biofilm deformation due to the large spreading of data in the experiments sensitivity analysis of the proposed fluid structure model to different parameters has been presented in our previous work jafari et al 2018 4 5 local biofilm properties during compression computed 2 d distributions of the main model variables during compression tmp 0 5 bar are presented in fig 6 the water flows at higher velocity through the thin biofilm sections 14 μm s while the water velocity in the thicker parts i e top layer is much lower 2 μm s fig 6a as expected lower biofilm thickness results in lower hydraulic resistance and higher fluxes the biofilm experiences the highest stress 2500 n m2 von mises stress near the membrane compared to the top layer 570 n m2 as shown in fig 6b in addition due to large pressure drop the stress is higher in the thick biofilm parts considering the relation of stress and strain thus greater local strain is observed in the biofilm next to the membrane fig 6c the top biofilm layer displaces more 13 μm than the base layer 1 μm due to the cumulative effect of strain on displacement fig 6d higher local strain leads to lower biofilm porosity fig 6e based on eq 3 and consequently to reduced permeability fig 6f although the biofilm top layer porosity remains almost constant φ 0 8 the base layer undergoes a significant reduction of porosity after compression φ 0 3 to 0 15 similarly biofilm permeability in top layer remained around 14 10 18 m2 after compression while the permeability decreased to 1 10 18 m2 in the base layer spatial distributions of biofilm porosity permeability and physical structure i e thickness along the membrane surface cause heterogeneity of water flux along the membrane fig 7 a shows a pronounced difference in the calculated water flux at the biofilm base along the flow cell 15 50 l m2 h whereas the flux is homogenized by flow through the membrane 37 41 l m2 h this considerable difference in flux distribution between biofilm and membrane boundaries fig 7a is correlated to flux homogenization in membrane domain caused by lower membrane resistance and greater thickness compared to the biofilm a more detailed analysis demonstrates that due to distinct biofilm properties in the top and base layers porosity and permeability undergo different behaviors during compression fig 7b shows biofilm strain in the compression direction ε y across the biofilm depth after compression at tmp 0 5 bar the strain decreases from 0 7 at the membrane side to zero at the liquid side the small change in strain gradient at the base layer top layer interface is caused by the difference in porosity of the two layers fig 7c demonstrates that the top layer porosity remains almost constant after compression while biofilm porosity in base layer drastically decreases from its initial value 0 5 to 0 3 in top of base layer and 0 15 at the membrane surface 4 6 evaluation of flux and deformation from oct biofilm images exact biofilm surface geometries initial and after compression were extracted from oct images and the water flux and biofilm deformation were calculated on these geometries using the dual porosity rough model case 4 fig 8 a and b shows oct images of the biofilm under transmembrane pressure of 0 06 and 0 5 bar respectively fig 8a and b demonstrate that the biofilm underwent a very small deformation during compression max 10 μm at the top while a significant change in hydraulic resistance was observed coupling of oct images with the fluid structural model allows for the computation of water flux and biofilm deformation under compression on the exact biofilm geometries negligible biofilm deformation was calculated under compression in accordance with oct results red line in fig 8c shows biofilm surface under compression of 0 5 bar 4 7 effect of biofilm surface morphology on flux and deformation during compression 4 7 1 biofilm roughness effect of cluster height the numerical model developed for the case 4 dual porosity rough biofilm was also used to evaluate the effect of biofilm surface roughness on the hydraulics and structural response of the biofilm to the same compression conditions tmp 0 5 bar to ensure that the area of base layer in contact with the liquid remained constant the roughness was increased by changing the half circular colonies into half ellipses with increasing semi major axes four structures shown in fig 9 a increasing the biofilm surface roughness from 20 to 80 μm i e peaks 50 200 μm high resulted in a total deformation from 8 to 13 μm respectively fig 9b shows that the total biofilm average displacement is mainly determined by the top layer displaced 10 16 μm while the base layer is less compressed 4 μm however more biofilm surface roughness just slightly decreases water flux during compression from 34 l m2 h δabs 20 μm to 32 l m2 h δabs 80 μm water flux approached a constant value as the surface roughness increased above 35 μm which implies that the contribution of top sections to the water flux becomes negligible at high roughness 4 7 2 fraction of exposed base layer since the biofilm roughness does not significantly impact the permeate flux accordingly to our model results we also evaluated other potential morphological parameters the permeate flux during compression was calculated for three biofilm geometries with different morphologies table 4 biofilm geometries were selected in which have identical average thickness and roughness values but different fractions of base layer exposed to bulk liquid to satisfy the mentioned criteria different top base layers thickness values were chosen fraction of exposed base layer was defined as area of biofilm base layer divided by the total biofilm surface area the dual porosity rough model case 4 was applied and permeate fluxes were calculated under tmp 0 5 bar model results clearly demonstrate that configurations with higher fraction of exposed base layer i e 0 71 for config ii allow higher water flux 27 4 l m2 h compared to 10 and 20 7 l m2 h for config i and config iii respectively table 4 5 discussion biofilm hydraulic resistance and structural deformation biofilms grown under high tmp showed higher hydraulic resistance and lower thickness compared to biofilms developed under low tmp fig 3 in addition biofilms grown under high tmp showed lower roughness values compared to biofilm developed under low tmp identical growth time fig 4 this could be explained by higher drag force induced by higher flux and consolidation effect caused by the long term continuous compression under high tmp these results agree with other reported observations casey 2007 derlon et al 2016 león ohl et al 2004 biofilms developed under high tmp are likely more compact i e lower porosity which reduces the biofilm permeability and ultimately increases its hydraulic resistance in this study we consistently observed that the increase in biofilm hydraulic resistance during compression was accompanied by limited biofilm deformation fig 3 and supplementary information si v1 to si v2 a similar trend was also reported previously desmond et al 2018a dreszer et al 2014 one possible explanation for the increased hydraulic resistance would be a reorganization of the biofilm material mccarthy et al 2002 at a scale lower than the oct resolution thus not observable by oct while the biofilm thickness remains approximatively constant other authors related the larger hydraulic resistance during compression to the collapse of the mushroom like biofilm structure valladares linares et al 2015 and the corresponding loss in macro porosity fortunato et al 2017 with a significant reduction in biofilm thickness in our study due to the small measured deformation during compression we propose that the hydraulic resistance increase was caused by pore particle reorganization at a scale lower than the oct detectable threshold in addition simulation results confirm that in case of the base layer deformation equal to oct detectable threshold 3 μm biofilm hydraulic resistance would rise by 110 in agreement with the observed results the biofilm model selection a bi layer morphology with a porous layer on top of a thin and dense base layer was observed by derlon et al 2016 and desmond et al 2018b for biofilms developed under dead end gdm in order to explain the observed trend in biofilm structural deformation and the corresponding hydraulic resistance several biofilm models were evaluated the poroelastic numerical model proposed in jafari et al 2018 for smooth surface biofilms was extended here to include rough surface with dual layer properties fig 5 confirms that only cases 4 and 6 i e rough and double layer biofilm as observed in experimental results from fig 5 could explain the small total biofilm deformation associated with significant rise of hydraulic resistance under compression the gradient of porosity across the biofilm is more important than the gradient of elastic modulus for fluid structural models gradients in biofilm porosity blauert et al 2015 okabe et al 1998 zhang and bishop 1994 or biofouling layer porosity gao et al 2011a were reported with generally a dense base layer and more porous top layer in this study both model cases 4 and 6 can explain the observed trends in biofilm compressibility fig 5 however the model case 4 i e same elastic modulus across both layers would be preferable as it contains less parameters and thus it is simpler table 2 the comparison between model cases shows that the biofilm deformation is mainly a result of pore compression and the variable mechanical properties can be achieved by a gradient in porosity this observation can further be used to simplify development of fluid structure models however one should note that when water is not forced through the biofilm e g biofilm developed on pipe walls a gradient in elastic modulus could be important for the mechanical response as permeate flux and porosity are not relevant picioreanu et al 2018 biofilm local properties water permeates mostly through the thin parts of the biofilm due to lower hydraulic resistance figs 6a 7a and 8 this is in accordance with the computations by martin et al 2014 for model biofilm in gdm fortunato et al 2017 reported unusual calculation results in which the permeate flux through biofilm peaks is larger than the flux through the thinner parts biofilm cavities in a submerged membrane biofilm reactor they claimed this observation is due to the effect of liquid vortices in biofilm cavities leading to lower pressure gradient however their result is physically unrealistic because small axial velocities would only lead to negligible pressure drop compared to the trans membrane pressure gradient during compression the biofilm porosity decreases mainly in the base layer near the membrane figs 6e and 7c which is in agreement with reported results by macminn et al 2016 and radu et al 2015 for soft porous materials under deformation thus during compression of the fouling layer the base layer permeability decreases much more than in the top layer due to local porosity reduction therefore the base layer becomes even more important in the determination of water flux however not all biofilms may display this bi layered structure desmond et al 2018b observed that for biofilms with smooth surface i e synthetic biofilm developed under phosphate limiting conditions biofilm hydraulic resistance is determined by the whole biofilm structure and not by a dense base layer effect of biofilm surface roughness on permeate flux although biofilm surface roughness affected the structural response during compression its impact on the total permeate flux was not significant fig 9 again this could be explained by the fact that the magnitude of the permeate flux is mainly dictated by the base layer derlon et al 2012 reported that predation by eukaryotic microorganisms leads to heterogeneous biofilm structure with larger surface roughness accompanied by lower membrane coverage the reduced membrane coverage caused higher values of the measured permeate flux at greater biofilm surface roughness fraction of exposed base layer although biofilm surface properties such as roughness coefficient and thickness are generally useful when characterizing biofilm morphology li et al 2016 zhang et al 1994 these measures are not adequate when water flux is concerned biofilms with identical roughness and thickness might lead to different water fluxes during compression table 4 fraction of exposed base layer proves to be a better indicator to correlate permeate flux and biofilm surface morphology in membrane systems a greater fraction of exposed base layer would result in a higher permeate flux through the biofilm 6 conclusions an increased biofilm hydraulic resistance during compression is not necessarily accompanied by large structural deformation i e not observable by oct the rise in resistance could be explained by micro scale particle pore reorganization of biofilms under pressure hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilm formed from river water is mainly governed by properties of their base layer i e density porosity and fraction of base layer exposed to bulk liquid while deformation is governed by biofilm roughness a poroelastic fluid structural model was proposed to explain various biofilm behaviors under compression the dual layer biofilm with a porous top layer and a dense base layer can explain the observed increase in hydraulic resistance coupled with minor structural deformation model simulations indicate that when developing fluid structural models for membrane systems considering a gradient in biofilm initial porosity is more important than a gradient in the elastic modulus this allows to reduce complexity of poroelastic models biofilm surface roughness alone does not impact significantly water permeate flux under compression the fraction of exposed base layer could be a better biofilm morphology indicator in

18865,poroelastic fluid structure interaction models were coupled to experimental data to determine the effects of biofilm spatial distribution of mechanical and hydraulic properties on the biofilm hydraulic resistance and compressibility in membrane filtration processes biofilms were cultivated on ultrafiltration membranes for 20 and 30 days under high 0 28 bar and low 0 06 bar transmembrane pressure tmp in dead end filtration mode subsequently biofilms were subjected to a compression relaxation cycles by step wise tmp changes structural deformation of biofilms during compression was observed in situ using optical coherence tomography experimental results show that the observed increase in the biofilm hydraulic resistance during compression is not necessarily accompanied by a detectable biofilm thickness reduction a dual layer biofilm model with a dense base and porous top layer could explain these observed results because porosity controls indirectly the mechanical response of biofilms under compression results could be described without assuming a gradient in mechanical properties within the biofilm the biofilm surface roughness did not significantly influence the water flux in this study however the fraction of biofilm base layer directly exposed to bulk liquid could be a good indicator in the determination of water flux the main implications of this study

zhang and bishop 1994 porosity gao et al 2011a okabe et al 1998 rosenthal et al 2018 and elastic modulus aravas and laspidou 2008 picioreanu et al 2018 in general biofilm porosity increases with the distance from substratum whereas the biofilm elastic modulus or rigidity seems to have an opposite trend the spatial distribution of porosity and mechanical properties affect the biofilm permeability

hydraulic resistance were correlated using in situ oct imaging techniques during mf process dreszer et al 2014 it was observed that the biofilm hydraulic resistances increased at larger permeate fluxes and the resistance returned almost to its original value as compression forces were released however in the study of dreszer et al 2014 the severe changes in resistance were only accompanied by a slight change in biofilm thickness valladares linares et al 2015 also related the change in hydraulic resistance of mf biofouling to the biofilm thickness and structural deformation through oct imaging furthermore derlon et al 2016 measured increased biofilm hydraulic resistance with increasing tmp during a dead end uf system the correlation between biofilm resistance biofilm thickness and biofilm roughness was later studied by desmond et al 2018c in a gravity driven membrane gdm system they observed that the increase in hydraulic resistance is accompanied by a reduction of biofilm relative roughness based on oct images during compression of several model biofilms interestingly they also reported that the increase in hydraulic resistance of a river water biofilm could not be correlated to changes in biofilm thickness and roughness recently jafari et al 2018 proposed a fluid structural model that can explain the structural and hydrological responses of a smooth surface biofilm to compression during water filtration in membrane systems the numerical model enabled the quantification of mechanical and hydrological properties of different biofilms the relation between structural deformation and hydraulic resistance during compression of biofilms with different morphologies e g surface roughness is not still clear therefore this study aims at evaluating membrane biofilm compressibility and the corresponding changes in biofilm hydraulic resistance as a function of i biofilm growth conditions i e growth time and growth tmp ii spatial distribution of mechanical and hydrological properties in the biofilm and iii biofilm surface roughness to this goal a computational model was developed and supported by experimental results 2 experimental set up 2 1 biofilm cultivation and growth conditions biofilms were cultivated in a flow cell under dead end ultrafiltration mode with the membrane effective area of 18 75 cm2 biofilms developed from filtration of river water chriesbach river dübendorf switzerland during winter under growth conditions listed in table 1 the detailed characteristics total organic carbon dissolved organic carbon assimilable organic carbon etc of feed water used for biofilm growth can be found in derlon et al 2013 and in supplementary information table s1 in the first experiment we evaluated the effect of biofilm age 20 and 30 days when grown under constant transmembrane pressure tmp 0 06 bar in the second experiment the effect of tmp 0 06 and 0 28 bar during biofilm growth was studied to evaluate data reproducibility biofilms were grown in several parallel flow cells in each growth condition 2 2 biofilm compression experiments the biofilms grown in parallel flow cells were subjected to the compression relaxation tests consisting of gradual increase decrease of tmp to specific values as defined in fig 1 biofilms were subjected to an identical compression and relaxation cycle regardless of their growth tmp the tmp range between 0 06 and 0 5 bar was selected based on practical implications and construction limitations gdm systems biofilms were discarded after one compression relaxation test all compression tests were done in a 20 c temperature controlled room 2 3 hydraulic parameters the permeate flux in l m2 h was calculated from mass measurements of collected permeate the biofilm hydraulic resistance r bio m 1 resulted from the difference between the total hydraulic resistance r tot and membrane resistance r mem as explained in martin et al 2014 the total filtration resistance was calculated through darcy s law based on applied tmp and the measured permeate flux in the presence of biofilm jafari et al 2018 the intrinsic membrane resistance r mem was measured with nanopure water for 24 h prior to fouling 2 4 biofilm morphology quantification the morphological response of biofilms to compression forces was determined by means of optical coherence tomography oct ganymede gan210 thorlabs gmbh dachau germany light source center wavelength of 930 nm and refractive index of 1 33 in order to improve statistical certainty of biofilm morphological properties at least 10 images were taken at random locations in each flow cell at each pressure step mean biofilm thickness and surface roughness were quantified using a customized matlab routine mathworks natick us mean absolute surface roughness δ abs shows biofilm thickness variability averaged for a number of image locations according to eq 1 moreover mean roughness coefficient δ rough was calculated which indicates biofilm thickness distribution normalized to mean biofilm thickness based on eq 2 murga et al 1995 1 δ a b s 1 n i 1 n l f l f 2 δ r o u g h 1 n i 1 n l f l f l f δ a b s l f where n is the number of measurements l f is biofilm local thickness and l f is the mean biofilm thickness 3 model description 3 1 model geometry and physics the mathematical model used to correlate the biofilm structural deformation with the corresponding changes in hydraulic resistance during compression was presented in details in jafari et al 2018 therefore the model is here only briefly described in this poroelastic model fluid flow in the biofilm was reciprocally coupled to the structural mechanics of the biofilm the gradient of liquid pressure in biofilm pores affects the effective stress in the biofilm and leads to structural deformation while the deformation changes the permeability and consequently the pore pressure due to the dead end filtration mode the biofilm properties would change mainly in the direction of permeate flow i e perpendicular to the membrane however a two dimensional 2 d model was developed to evaluate the effect of biofilm surface roughness on permeate flux and biofilm deformation fig 2 two different geometries were used to represent both smooth cases 1 and 2 and rough surface biofilms cases 3 to 6 in table 2 average biofilm thickness l f and biofilm length l x of the model biofilms were based on experimental results the membrane was represented by an additional layer with thickness l m the biofilm base layer thickness l b and top layer thickness l t in the bi layer model biofilm were constructed so that the sum l b l t equals the average thickness l f in case of smooth surface biofilm cases 1 and 2 the model could in principle be reduced to one dimension jafari et al 2018 however for consistency we kept the 2 d model geometry for all six cases finally the biofilm depth in the third dimension z was considered to be large enough to apply the 2 d plane strain simplification coussy 2004 the velocity and pressure fields for water flow through the biofilm were calculated from darcy s law with permeability k being related to biofilm porosity φ by a linear relationship k aφ in which a is the biofilm permeability coefficient under compression local biofilm porosity φ x y is related to the porosity prior to compression φ 0 and biofilm

the balance of momentum for a saturated porous material biot poroelasticity coussy 2004 the linear elastic response depends on the elastic modulus e and poisson s ratio ν of the biofilm in case of bilayer biofilms different hydraulic and or mechanical properties were applied in each layer applied boundary conditions are presented in fig 2 and all model parameters are in table 3 3 2 model cases and their structure six biofilm cases were selected based on their morphology rough or smooth surfaces and structures mono layer or bi layer biofilms have different surface roughness properties and multi layer structure depending on their growth conditions as reported by desmond et al 2018c they also observed during dead end filtration that biofilms developed under phosphate limitation had smooth surface and mono layer structure as opposed of river water biofilms that had rough surface and bi layer structure desmond et al 2018b existence of base layer can be explained by biofilm stratification densification adjacent to the substratum e g membrane caused by different growth condition parameters such as hydrodynamic strengths carbon sources organic loading rate and culture time bishop et al 1995 derlon et al 2008 okabe et al 1996 in addition biofilm porosity and elastic modulus were selected as distinctive properties in determination of biofilm hydraulic and mechanical behaviour jafari et al 2018 thus in this study we selected smooth surface case 1 and 2 and rough surface biofilms case 3 to 6 to evaluate the importance of the bi layer structure four biofilm cases with different porosity and or elastic modulus among the layers were set up cases 2 4 5 and 6 table 2 shows biofilm morphologies and specifications of the six chosen cases 3 3 model solution the 2 d fluid structure interaction model was solved in comsol multiphysics v5 3 a comsol inc burlington ma the fluid flow in porous media was coupled with plane strain structural mechanics and computed through a stationary solver triangular mesh elements had a maximum size of 2 μm to ensure the solution independency on mesh size 4 results 4 1 correlation between biofilm hydraulic resistance and the structural deformation river water biofilms were cultivated in parallel flow cells under three different conditions fig 3 shows the biofilm mean thickness and hydraulic resistance measured during a compression and relaxation cycle as expected biofilms grown for longer time 30 days were thicker 70 10 μm average thickness than younger biofilms 40 3 μm after 20 days under the same growth tmp 0 06 bar fig 3a and b furthermore biofilms grown under high tmp 0 28 bar were thinner 50 3 μm average thickness compared to the low tmp 0 06 bar biofilms at the same age 30 days fig 3b and c interestingly when subjected to compression and relaxation phases the river water biofilms did not undergo a significant structural deformation i e change in thickness and roughness fig 3a c a relatively constant biofilm thickness is also observed in the time lapse videos in supplementary information si v1 and si v2 while the membrane displacement clearly indicates the applied pressure steps however biofilm hydraulic resistance increases significantly during compression over tmp range of 0 06 0 5 bar fig 3d f from 3 1012 to 5 1012 m 1 for the biofilm grown at 0 06 bar for 20 days and from 3 1012 to 4 1012 m 1 for the biofilm developed for 30 days biofilms grown under high tmp 0 28 bar showed greater hydraulic resistance change from 5 1012 to 8 1012 m 1 during compression tests these measurements clearly confirm that biofilms grown under higher tmp were more compact thinner fig 3b and c and associated higher hydraulic resistance fig 3e and f 4 2 effect of growth conditions on biofilm surface morphology experiments in uf flow cells have shown that the growth conditions affect not only the biofilm thickness but also the biofilm surface roughness fig 4 displays biofilm surface morphology properties i e mean absolute roughness and mean relative roughness coefficient developed in different conditions clearly the biofilms after 30 days of cultivation showed higher roughness coefficient δrough 0 3 0 05 than after 20 days δrough 0 16 0 05 when grown under tmp 0 06 bar fig 4a moreover the biofilms grown at larger pressure were smoother δrough 0 11 0 05 compared to biofilms grown at low pressures fig 4a similar trend was observed in biofilm mean absolute roughness fig 4b however change in the biofilm roughness measured during compression of river water biofilms did not follow any clear trend as also reported in other studies e g desmond et al 2018c 4 3 selection of a fluid structure biofilm model correlating thickness and resistance under compression experimental measurements of river water biofilms under compression showed a considerable increase in hydraulic resistance up to 60 while biofilm thickness only slightly changed to explain the correlation between biofilm thickness and resistance during compression we developed a fluid structural model and evaluated several biofilm possible structures with different morphological mechanical and hydrological properties table 2 three main variables mean biofilm displacement change in hydraulic resistance and water flux were calculated and compared with experimental results of biofilm grown for 20 days under tmp 0 06 bar fig 5 the fitting parameters table 3 were selected for each model biofilm individually so that the three measured variables are optimally represented the model results of mean biofilm displacement obtained by one layer rough case 3 dual porosity rough case 4 and dual porosity elasticity rough biofilm models case 6 are in agreement with experimental results however the mean displacement in other model cases was still within range of experimental results fig 5a furthermore the measured water flux was around 20 35 l m2 h which is compatible with the calculated flux for one layer flat case 1 dual porosity elasticity flat case 2 dual porosity rough case 4 and dual porosity elasticity rough biofilm models case 6 fig 5b finally fig 5c indicates that dual porosity elasticity flat case 2 dual porosity rough case 4 and dual porosity elasticity rough case 6 biofilm models could explain a significant increase in hydraulic resistance 40 60 during compression considering all three criteria the dual layer rough biofilms cases 4 and 6 are the most suitable to explain the experimental results the difference between cases 4 constant mechanical properties across the biofilm and 6 layers of different elasticity shows that a gradient of initial biofilm porosity is more important than a gradient of mechanical properties in determination of biofilm deformation and hydraulic resistance during compression therefore case 4 dual porosity rough was selected to further evaluate biofilm local properties during compression due less model parameters required compared with case 6 4 4 model calibration and parameters estimation all the model cases were calibrated with experimental results of biofilms grown for 20 days under tmp 0 06 bar model parameters used in this study are shown in table 3 geometric parameters i e biofilm average thickness base and top layers thickness and top layer coverage area were selected based on oct images and biofilm morphological properties of the specific biofilm initial porosity of top and base layers if applicable were chosen with the assumption that porosity of base layer is lower than top layer porosity prior to compression gao et al 2011b the porosity values and distribution in biofilms were in accordance with the observations reported by blauert et al 2015 gao et al 2011b wagner et al 2010 in the model calibration procedure initial biofilm porosity of both layers if applicable was kept constant and only fitting parameters permeability coefficient elastic modulus were changed to calibrate the models moreover during model selection procedure fig 5 a model was considered acceptable only if the model results were within the range of experimental data considering experimental deviations for example in fig 5a all the models were acceptable for biofilm deformation due to the large spreading of data in the experiments sensitivity analysis of the proposed fluid structure model to different parameters has been presented in our previous work jafari et al 2018 4 5 local biofilm properties during compression computed 2 d distributions of the main model variables during compression tmp 0 5 bar are presented in fig 6 the water flows at higher velocity through the thin biofilm sections 14 μm s while the water velocity in the thicker parts i e top layer is much lower 2 μm s fig 6a as expected lower biofilm thickness results in lower hydraulic resistance and higher fluxes the biofilm experiences the highest stress 2500 n m2 von mises stress near the membrane compared to the top layer 570 n m2 as shown in fig 6b in addition due to large pressure drop the stress is higher in the thick biofilm parts considering the relation of stress and strain thus greater local strain is observed in the biofilm next to the membrane fig 6c the top biofilm layer displaces more 13 μm than the base layer 1 μm due to the cumulative effect of strain on displacement fig 6d higher local strain leads to lower biofilm porosity fig 6e based on eq 3 and consequently to reduced permeability fig 6f although the biofilm top layer porosity remains almost constant φ 0 8 the base layer undergoes a significant reduction of porosity after compression φ 0 3 to 0 15 similarly biofilm permeability in top layer remained around 14 10 18 m2 after compression while the permeability decreased to 1 10 18 m2 in the base layer spatial distributions of biofilm porosity permeability and physical structure i e thickness along the membrane surface cause heterogeneity of water flux along the membrane fig 7 a shows a pronounced difference in the calculated water flux at the biofilm base along the flow cell 15 50 l m2 h whereas the flux is homogenized by flow through the membrane 37 41 l m2 h this considerable difference in flux distribution between biofilm and membrane boundaries fig 7a is correlated to flux homogenization in membrane domain caused by lower membrane resistance and greater thickness compared to the biofilm a more detailed analysis demonstrates that due to distinct biofilm properties in the top and base layers porosity and permeability undergo different behaviors during compression fig 7b shows biofilm strain in the compression direction ε y across the biofilm depth after compression at tmp 0 5 bar the strain decreases from 0 7 at the membrane side to zero at the liquid side the small change in strain gradient at the base layer top layer interface is caused by the difference in porosity of the two layers fig 7c demonstrates that the top layer porosity remains almost constant after compression while biofilm porosity in base layer drastically decreases from its initial value 0 5 to 0 3 in top of base layer and 0 15 at the membrane surface 4 6 evaluation of flux and deformation from oct biofilm images exact biofilm surface geometries initial and after compression were extracted from oct images and the water flux and biofilm deformation were calculated on these geometries using the dual porosity rough model case 4 fig 8 a and b shows oct images of the biofilm under transmembrane pressure of 0 06 and 0 5 bar respectively fig 8a and b demonstrate that the biofilm underwent a very small deformation during compression max 10 μm at the top while a significant change in hydraulic resistance was observed coupling of oct images with the fluid structural model allows for the computation of water flux and biofilm deformation under compression on the exact biofilm geometries negligible biofilm deformation was calculated under compression in accordance with oct results red line in fig 8c shows biofilm surface under compression of 0 5 bar 4 7 effect of biofilm surface morphology on flux and deformation during compression 4 7 1 biofilm roughness effect of cluster height the numerical model developed for the case 4 dual porosity rough biofilm was also used to evaluate the effect of biofilm surface roughness on the hydraulics and structural response of the biofilm to the same compression conditions tmp 0 5 bar to ensure that the area of base layer in contact with the liquid remained constant the roughness was increased by changing the half circular colonies into half ellipses with increasing semi major axes four structures shown in fig 9 a increasing the biofilm surface roughness from 20 to 80 μm i e peaks 50 200 μm high resulted in a total deformation from 8 to 13 μm respectively fig 9b shows that the total biofilm average displacement is mainly determined by the top layer displaced 10 16 μm while the base layer is less compressed 4 μm however more biofilm surface roughness just slightly decreases water flux during compression from 34 l m2 h δabs 20 μm to 32 l m2 h δabs 80 μm water flux approached a constant value as the surface roughness increased above 35 μm which implies that the contribution of top sections to the water flux becomes negligible at high roughness 4 7 2 fraction of exposed base layer since the biofilm roughness does not significantly impact the permeate flux accordingly to our model results we also evaluated other potential morphological parameters the permeate flux during compression was calculated for three biofilm geometries with different morphologies table 4 biofilm geometries were selected in which have identical average thickness and roughness values but different fractions of base layer exposed to bulk liquid to satisfy the mentioned criteria different top base layers thickness values were chosen fraction of exposed base layer was defined as area of biofilm base layer divided by the total biofilm surface area the dual porosity rough model case 4 was applied and permeate fluxes were calculated under tmp 0 5 bar model results clearly demonstrate that configurations with higher fraction of exposed base layer i e 0 71 for config ii allow higher water flux 27 4 l m2 h compared to 10 and 20 7 l m2 h for config i and config iii respectively table 4 5 discussion biofilm hydraulic resistance and structural deformation biofilms grown under high tmp showed higher hydraulic resistance and lower thickness compared to biofilms developed under low tmp fig 3 in addition biofilms grown under high tmp showed lower roughness values compared to biofilm developed under low tmp identical growth time fig 4 this could be explained by higher drag force induced by higher flux and consolidation effect caused by the long term continuous compression under high tmp these results agree with other reported observations casey 2007 derlon et al 2016 león ohl et al 2004 biofilms developed under high tmp are likely more compact i e lower porosity which reduces the biofilm permeability and ultimately increases its hydraulic resistance in this study we consistently observed that the increase in biofilm hydraulic resistance during compression was accompanied by limited biofilm deformation fig 3 and supplementary information si v1 to si v2 a similar trend was also reported previously desmond et al 2018a dreszer et al 2014 one possible explanation for the increased hydraulic resistance would be a reorganization of the biofilm material mccarthy et al 2002 at a scale lower than the oct resolution thus not observable by oct while the biofilm thickness remains approximatively constant other authors related the larger hydraulic resistance during compression to the collapse of the mushroom like biofilm structure valladares linares et al 2015 and the corresponding loss in macro porosity fortunato et al 2017 with a significant reduction in biofilm thickness in our study due to the small measured deformation during compression we propose that the hydraulic resistance increase was caused by pore particle reorganization at a scale lower than the oct detectable threshold in addition simulation results confirm that in case of the base layer deformation equal to oct detectable threshold 3 μm biofilm hydraulic resistance would rise by 110 in agreement with the observed results the biofilm model selection a bi layer morphology with a porous layer on top of a thin and dense base layer was observed by derlon et al 2016 and desmond et al 2018b for biofilms developed under dead end gdm in order to explain the observed trend in biofilm structural deformation and the corresponding hydraulic resistance several biofilm models were evaluated the poroelastic numerical model proposed in jafari et al 2018 for smooth surface biofilms was extended here to include rough surface with dual layer properties fig 5 confirms that only cases 4 and 6 i e rough and double layer biofilm as observed in experimental results from fig 5 could explain the small total biofilm deformation associated with significant rise of hydraulic resistance under compression the gradient of porosity across the biofilm is more important than the gradient of elastic modulus for fluid structural models gradients in biofilm porosity blauert et al 2015 okabe et al 1998 zhang and bishop 1994 or biofouling layer porosity gao et al 2011a were reported with generally a dense base layer and more porous top layer in this study both model cases 4 and 6 can explain the observed trends in biofilm compressibility fig 5 however the model case 4 i e same elastic modulus across both layers would be preferable as it contains less parameters and thus it is simpler table 2 the comparison between model cases shows that the biofilm deformation is mainly a result of pore compression and the variable mechanical properties can be achieved by a gradient in porosity this observation can further be used to simplify development of fluid structure models however one should note that when water is not forced through the biofilm e g biofilm developed on pipe walls a gradient in elastic modulus could be important for the mechanical response as permeate flux and porosity are not relevant picioreanu et al 2018 biofilm local properties water permeates mostly through the thin parts of the biofilm due to lower hydraulic resistance figs 6a 7a and 8 this is in accordance with the computations by martin et al 2014 for model biofilm in gdm fortunato et al 2017 reported unusual calculation results in which the permeate flux through biofilm peaks is larger than the flux through the thinner parts biofilm cavities in a submerged membrane biofilm reactor they claimed this observation is due to the effect of liquid vortices in biofilm cavities leading to lower pressure gradient however their result is physically unrealistic because small axial velocities would only lead to negligible pressure drop compared to the trans membrane pressure gradient during compression the biofilm porosity decreases mainly in the base layer near the membrane figs 6e and 7c which is in agreement with reported results by macminn et al 2016 and radu et al 2015 for soft porous materials under deformation thus during compression of the fouling layer the base layer permeability decreases much more than in the top layer due to local porosity reduction therefore the base layer becomes even more important in the determination of water flux however not all biofilms may display this bi layered structure desmond et al 2018b observed that for biofilms with smooth surface i e synthetic biofilm developed under phosphate limiting conditions biofilm hydraulic resistance is determined by the whole biofilm structure and not by a dense base layer effect of biofilm surface roughness on permeate flux although biofilm surface roughness affected the structural response during compression its impact on the total permeate flux was not significant fig 9 again this could be explained by the fact that the magnitude of the permeate flux is mainly dictated by the base layer derlon et al 2012 reported that predation by eukaryotic microorganisms leads to heterogeneous biofilm structure with larger surface roughness accompanied by lower membrane coverage the reduced membrane coverage caused higher values of the measured permeate flux at greater biofilm surface roughness fraction of exposed base layer although biofilm surface properties such as roughness coefficient and thickness are generally useful when characterizing biofilm morphology li et al 2016 zhang et al 1994 these measures are not adequate when water flux is concerned biofilms with identical roughness and thickness might lead to different water fluxes during compression table 4 fraction of exposed base layer proves to be a better indicator to correlate permeate flux and biofilm surface morphology in membrane systems a greater fraction of exposed base layer would result in a higher permeate flux through the biofilm 6 conclusions an increased biofilm hydraulic resistance during compression is not necessarily accompanied by large structural deformation i e not observable by oct the rise in resistance could be explained by micro scale particle pore reorganization of biofilms under pressure hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilm formed from river water is mainly governed by properties of their base layer i e density porosity and fraction of base layer exposed to bulk liquid while deformation is governed by biofilm roughness a poroelastic fluid structural model was proposed to explain various biofilm behaviors under compression the dual layer biofilm with a porous top layer and a dense base layer can explain the observed increase in hydraulic resistance coupled with minor structural deformation model simulations indicate that when developing fluid structural models for membrane systems considering a gradient in biofilm initial porosity is more important than a gradient in the elastic modulus this allows to reduce complexity of poroelastic models biofilm surface roughness alone does not impact significantly water permeate flux under compression the fraction of exposed base layer could be a better biofilm morphology indicator in

18866,the uncontrolled introduction into the environment of plastic polymers have caused the dispersion of plastic fragments known as microplastics mps that represent an important topic for public health this study was the first to investigate the cause of the release of mps in mineral waters and to estimate the concentration of mps smaller than 10 μm both in number of particles and in mass

to the ph of waters and to plastic density of bottle otherwise micrograms of mps per liter and the mps diameters were strongly affected by plastic thickness the most mineral water brand contaminated by mps was the one whose bottles were made from poor quality plastic in absence of reference values it was no possible carried out a risk assessment for mps exposure it is fundamental to establish the reference method of analysis to monitoring every source of human intake graphical abstract image 10849 keywords microplastics estimated daily intake mineral water public health mps release principal

the human health risks not fully assessed bergmann et al 2015 andrady 2017 plastic replaces many materials still in use such as glass in the bottling of mineral water and soft drinks as well as food packaging and storage container halden 2010 the uncontrolled introduction into the environment of these plastic polymers together with their environmental persistence have caused the dispersion of

aims of this study were a to assess the number of mps with diameters of between 0 5 and 10 μm in mineral waters contained in plastic bottles b to evaluate if the physical chemical properties of mineral waters and bottle quality could influence the release of mps c to estimate the human daily exposure to mps due to mineral water consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection and selection ten nationally distributed brands of still or sparkling mineral waters contained in pet plastic bottles with packaging of 500 ml were purchased in different supermarkets in the province of catania italy physical chemical parameters of the sampled mineral waters were taken from the labels for each brand three different bottles of different lots were analyzed every sample has shelf life between august and october of the year 2019 so results of the study will not be influenced by variability of the shelf life at the same time three reagents blank were analyzed as controls 2 2 mps

qualitative and quantitative detection analysis of mps were carried out by scanning electron microscopy sem cambridge stereoscan s360 coupled with an energy dispersive detector sem edx oxford inca xstream with settings according to those described in the above mentioned patent 2 3 plastic density supposing that mps derived exclusively from the plastic bottles the determination of the density of the constituent plastics of each bottle is fundamental to calculate the concentration of mps in microgram per liter the density of a material is defined as the relationship between the mass of the body and its own volume it is calculated as ρ m v in the international system s i the density is expressed as g cm3 www goldbook iupac org after having cut out regular one cm2 surface sections from each bottle of the various brands of water in exam each section was weighed using a precision analytical balance subsequently to estimate the thickness of the sections and calculate the exact volume and the density small strips of plastic were transferred on the surface of an aluminum stub with a diameter of 25 mm metallized with gold and were analyzed using the cited sem the sections of the bottles analyzed to the sem for the determination of the thickness are reported in fig 1 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using r environment for statistical computing software a one way anova was performed to investigate the differences of the results compared to the blank reagents and among the brands a p value of 0 05 was considered significant the analysis of the principal components pca on the distance matrix was used to identify which brand of mineral waters was higher affected on mps release data were standardized before analysis and the results were displayed in a biplot distance legendre and legendre 2012 the analysis of the principal components pca on the correlation matrix was instead used to evaluate the trend between the average mps

study is available currently reporting data about mps with diameters smaller than 10 μm mason et al 2018 mason et al 2018 had used an optical microscope after treating the samples with nile red solution no digestion of organic and inorganic carbon was carried out the single particle was no examined by microanalysis to confirm its chemical composition finally this method can analyze only particle bigger than 6 5 μm other studies on the other hand use mps extraction methods through filtrations in polycarbonate filters a polymer that is also classified among plastics and the subsequent analyzes conducted by scanning electron microscopy do not allow the analyses to be distinguished with certainty from interferences endo et al 2001 analysis of the smaller mps is fundamental since they could be up taken from the gastrointestinal tract via endocytosis by the m cells of the peyer s patches and could be adsorbed in hematic circle powell et al 2010 wright and kelly 2017 song et al 2009 thanks to the extraction procedure developed by the environmental and food hygiene laboratory it was possible to isolate the plastic particles smaller than 10 μm from the aqueous matrix minimizing external contamination in our study the anova showed that the number of particles and their main diameters in the blank reagents were significantly different ρ 0 05 rather than those of the samples it shows how the used method is reliable to isolate the mps from water matrix the microanalysis is the best method to discriminate a carbon particle from others avoiding the use of filters and other plastic materials guarantee the minimal contamination from process and minimize analytical interferences anova on concentration expressed as μg l was no significant it could be explained by the incorrect conversion from the number of mps and their estimated average volume using the same density for each brand of water in fact the mps could not exclusively derived from packaging of waters but they could be a contamination of water before their bottling principal component analysis pca showed that the number of mps contamination in bottled mineral waters was strongly correlated to the ph of waters but only weakly to plastic density of bottle otherwise micrograms of mps per liter and the mps diameters were strongly affected by plastic thickness it seems that hard plastics cause the release biggest fragments but in a minor number instead the more deformable plastics and weakly alkaline ph would increase the number of smallest mps the brand of mineral water most contaminated by mps was the 7 whose bottles were made macroscopically and microscopically by poor quality plastic with the smallest thickness among the bottles examined 0 073 mm characterized by high deformability the estimated daily intake edi highlights the high amount of mps ingested daily by bottled mineral water if these data will be confirmed by future studies it would represent an important risk to

unit this study was carried out using a patent method regarding the extraction and analysis of mps in more kind of matrix therefore aims of this study were a to assess the number of mps with diameters of between 0 5 and 10 μm in mineral waters contained in plastic bottles b to evaluate if the physical chemical properties of mineral waters and bottle quality could influence the release of mps and finally c to estimate the human daily exposure to mps due to mineral water consumption the mps were found in every sample the main concentration of mps was 656 8 μg l 632 9 or 5 42e 07 p l 1 95e 07

perfusions wright and kelly 2017 mps have been detected in various natural habitats and in the digestive tracts of several species these particles have also been reported as pollutants in commercially available seafood salt or bottled water highlighting the importance of evaluating their potential implications for human health lancet planet health 2017 the assessment of the mps related risks needs to understand the really exposure concentrations and migration pathways in human body no certain data are yet available about mps absorption and distribution in body districts in fact the absence of

mps in 90 of 259 bottles mason et al 2018 our study is the first that assess with high accuracy the presence and the quantity of mps 10 μm in the mineral water using a new italian patented method so aims of this study were a to assess the number of mps with diameters of between 0 5 and 10 μm in mineral waters contained in plastic bottles b to evaluate if the physical chemical properties of mineral waters and bottle quality could influence the release of mps c to estimate the human daily exposure to mps due to mineral water consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection and selection ten nationally distributed brands of still or sparkling mineral waters contained in pet plastic bottles with packaging of 500 ml were purchased in different supermarkets in the province of catania italy physical chemical parameters of the sampled mineral waters were taken from the labels for each brand three different bottles of different lots were analyzed every sample has shelf life between august and october of the year 2019 so results of the study will not be influenced by variability of the shelf life at the same time three reagents blank were analyzed as controls 2 2 mps

the constituent plastics of each bottle is fundamental to calculate the concentration of mps in microgram per liter the density of a material is defined as the relationship between the mass of the body and its own volume it is calculated as ρ m v in the international system s i the density is expressed as g cm3 www goldbook iupac org after having cut out regular one cm2 surface sections from each bottle of the various brands of water in exam each section was weighed using a precision analytical balance subsequently to estimate the thickness of the sections and calculate the exact volume

18867,among natural organic matter nom oxyanions and metal hydr oxides a complicated interaction exists in natural aquatic and terrestrial systems and in waste waters effects of seven types of nom four humic acids ha three fulvic acids fa that vary in properties on the adsorption of oxyanions including phosphate arsenate and arsenite at goethite water interface were quantitatively studied results show that the adsorption of oxyanions to goethite is decreased by the presence of nom especially for phosphate and arsenate at low ph in general the effects of the three fa are similar which are more effective than ha in reducing oxyanion adsorption at low ph 6 differences were observed between the four ha in their competition with oxyanions the adsorption of phosphate arsenate and arsenite in the presence of nom are well described with both the nom cd cd charge distribution and lcd ligand and charge distribution model the nom cd model is relatively simple to use whereas the lcd model can better reveal different factors in the interaction including the spatial distribution of adsorbed nom on oxide surface according to these two models site density of carboxylic groups protonation constant of carboxylic groups and particle size of nom are major properties of nom determining its effect on oxyanion adsorption to oxides at relatively low loadings morphological change of adsorbed nom takes place and the degree of morphological change of adsorbed nom depends on the particle size site density of carboxylic groups and aromaticity of nom the influence of particle size on the interaction becomes more important at higher nom loadings the results suggested that the fixation or removal efficiency of phosphate arsenate and arsenite with iron oxides e g goethite can be significantly decreased by the presence of nom especially when nom rich in acidic and aromatic groups graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural organic matter phosphate arsenate arsenite adsorption surface complexation model 1 introduction both phosphorus p and arsenic as are elements of group 15 in the periodic table over the past decades over application of p fertilizer has led to accumulation of phosphorus in soils which in turn has led to eutrophication of surface and ground water and degradation of water quality carpenter et al 1998 on the other hand the contamination of as in drinking water has become a serious issue because of its high toxicity and carcinogenicity to human harvey et al 2002 both p and as are predominantly present as inorganic oxyanions in the natural environment i e as phosphate arsenate as v and arsenite as iii the mobility and bioavailability of p and as in both terrestrial and aquatic systems are greatly influenced by the adsorption of their oxyanions to metal hydr oxides bissen and frimmel 2003 li et al 2016 minerals of metal hydr oxides are often used as adsorbents to remove p and as in drainage and waste waters daus et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 therefore it is of significant importance to acquire good understanding and to make quantitative prediction regarding the adsorption behavior of these oxyanions to metal hydr oxides under environmental conditions natural organic matter nom contains mainly ill defined macromolecules and the composition and properties of nom vary with the source and extraction method stevenson 1994 hunt et al 2007 tsuda et al 2010 humic acids ha and fulvic acids fa are operationally defined fractions of nom and contain large amounts of carboxylic and phenolic type of functional groups which interact strongly with metal hydr oxides and change the adsorption feature of oxyanions previous studies revealed a negative correlation between adsorbed ha or fa and oxyanions e g phosphate and arsenate showing the competition effect of ha and fa with oxyanions for adsorption to metal hydr oxides antelo et al 2007 weng et al 2008 2009 hiemstra et al 2013 otero fariña et al 2017 although there are studies carried out previously a consistent understanding regarding the properties of nom that determine the effect on oxyanion adsorption to metal hydr oxides is still lacking for example weng et al 2008 2009 found that fa exerts a stronger competitive effect on phosphate and arsenate adsorption to goethite than ha the stronger effect of fa on oxyanion adsorption was attributed to the smaller size of fa than that of ha on the other hand hiemstra et al 2013 pointed out that the number of functional groups was the main cause of the different degree of competitive interactions between various ha and phosphate in addition chasse and ohno 2016 suggested that nom containing more aromatic structures with a higher molecular mass has a greater potential to compete with phosphate for surface sites on iron hydr oxide these findings show that further research is needed to obtain a more thorough and in depth understanding on the mechanism and determining factors in the oxyanion nom mineral interactions surface complexation modeling is a computational tool to simulate the physical chemical processes at the surface of adsorbents in combination with laboratory analysis model calculation can reveal the whole fingerprint of surface speciation and can make predictions during the past few decades advanced surface complexation models have been successfully developed to study the adsorption behaviors of oxyanions onto metal hydr oxides hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 stachowicz et al 2006 tian et al 2017 for instance in a previous study we have shown that the cd music charge distribution and multi site complexation model hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 can well predict the adsorption behavior of phosphate arsenate and arsenite in a multi adsorbent system at variable ph and calcium concentration in the absence of nom deng et al 2018 efforts to elucidate the effects of nom on the adsorption of ions to metal hydr oxides were made more recently weng et al 2008 2009 2012 hiemstra et al 2013 otero fariña et al 2017 one modeling approach is the nom cd natural organic matter charge distribution model proposed by hiemstra et al 2013 which takes the site competition and electrostatic interaction effect of nom on anion adsorption into consideration by representing adsorbed nom with a surface component fenom another surface complexation model the lcd ligand and charge distribution model uses the nica non ideal competitive adsorption approach to calculate the surface speciation and charge of the adsorbed nom filius et al 2003 weng et al 2006 both the nom cd and lcd model are integrated with the cd music model to calculate the adsorption of small ions to metal hydr oxides as well as the electrostatic potential at oxides surface the nom cd model has been used to describe the influence of ha on phosphate adsorption to goethite and the effect of nom on phosphate adsorption to soil hiemstra et al 2013 whereas the lcd model has been applied to explain the effect of adsorbed fa ha and soil nom on the adsorption of phosphate and arsenate to goethite and to soil samples weng et al 2008 2009 cui and weng 2013 the capability of these models in predicting and illustrating effects of adsorbed nom on oxyanion adsorption needs to be further tested using ha and fa derived from different sources anions with different adsorption behavior and over a wide ph range in the present study ha and fa were extracted from different soils and a series of adsorption experiments were conducted to determine effects of ha and fa on the adsorption of phosphate arsenate and arsenite to goethite the nom cd and lcd model were used to calculate the adsorption of these oxyanions in the presence of ha and fa the specific objectives of this work are i to quantitatively compare the influence of nom derived from different sources on the adsorption of phosphate arsenate and arsenite to goethite at different ph ii to validate and compare the capacity of the nom cd and lcd model in describing the effects of nom on the adsorption of oxyanions to metal hydr oxide and iii to obtain better understanding regarding the main properties of nom determining its interaction with oxyanion at the goethite water interface by integrating experimental and modeling methods 2 material and methods 2 1 goethite and nom preparation the goethite material was synthesized according to hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 the specific surface area and point of zero charge pzc of goethite have been measured as 89 m2 g 1 and ph 9 2 respectively deng et al 2018 three different forest soils were collected from changbai cb mountain located in jilin province from the northeast of china fujun fj mountain in tianjin from the east of china and ziwuling zw mountain in gansu province from the northwest of china ha and fa were purified from these soils following the protocol of ihss international humic substances society zomeren and comans 2007 and the purified materials were freeze dried the purified ha and fa were characterized on organic elemental analyser elementar vario el germany for elemental composition on fourier transform infra red spectrometer ftir nicolet nexus870 usa for structure characterization and on size exclusion chromatography sec for molar mass distribution the charging behavior of ha and fa was determined with acid base titration more information regarding the soil samples procedures to prepare and characterize the ha and fa materials can be found in the supporting information table s1 s3 and fig s1 s3 in addition a ha derived from a forest soil in the netherland nl ha that has been used in studying the effects of nom on phosphate and arsenate adsorption to goethite weng et al 2008 2009 was provided by wageningen university the netherlands the stock solutions of ha were prepared by dissolving the freeze dried material with a small amount of 0 10 m naoh to effectively dissolve ha samples and then the solution was diluted to 1 0 g l 1 with ultrapure water the stock solutions of fa were prepared by dissolving the dry material with ultrapure water to a concentration of 1 0 g l 1 2 2 adsorption experiment three series of batch adsorption experiments were conducted to obtain i adsorption envelopes of phosphate arsenate and arsenite oxyanion concentration 0 14 mm in the ph range of 3 12 in the absence and presence of 42 mg l 1 ha or fa exp i ii adsorption isotherms of phosphate 0 14 0 49 mm at ph 5 3 in the absence and presence of 42 mg l 1 ha or fa exp ii iii adsorption of phosphate 0 12 mm at ph 5 0 under the influence of different amount 0 200 mg l 1 of ha or fa exp iii the stock solutions of nom ha or fa and oxyanion phosphate as nah2po4 2h2o arsenite as naaso2 or arsenate as na2haso4 7h2o were simultaneously added to the goethite suspensions in 50 ml polyethylene bottles under a n2 atmosphere the final concentration of goethite was 1 35 g l 1 in a 0 10 m nacl electrolyte background the ph of the suspension was adjusted with 0 10 m naoh or hcl to the chosen values in each series a blank series without ha or fa added was included the suspension samples were shaken at 150 rpm 25 c for 72 h during the first 48 h the suspension ph was checked and would be readjusted to the target value again if necessary pre trials of kinetic experiments have shown that equilibrium was reached for both oxyanions and nom after 72 h reaction fig s4 at the end of shaking the final ph of the suspension was measured then the suspensions were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 30 min and filtered through 0 22 μm filters pes membrana the concentration of p or as in the filtrates was determined with icp ms agilent 7500i usa the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured with a toc analyser shimadzu after the supernatant was acidified to ph 3 4 to remove dissolved inorganic carbon weng et al 2008 the amount of ha or fa adsorbed was calculated from the difference of doc between the blank without goethite addition and the treatment the speciation of as in solution was determined in selected samples with hplc using an anion exchange column coupled with icp ms cui and weng 2013 which confirmed that only limited transformation took place between arsenate and arsenite and its influence on the dissolved as can be ignored 2 3 modeling in both the nom cd and lcd model the cd music model with an extended stern electrostatic sub model was used to describe the reactions of the goethite surface with adsorbates in the cd music model the primary charging behavior of goethite is attributed to the protonation and deprotonation of the singly feoh 0 5 and triply fe3o 0 5 coordinated surface groups the intrinsic protonation affinities are assumed to be equal to the pzc of goethite pzc 9 2 indifferent electrolyte ions i e na and cl in experiments of current study can form ion pairs with both the singly and triply coordinated surface sites for phosphate adsorption two types of surface species were considered in the cd music model i e a protonated monodentate feopo2oh and a bidentate fe2o2po2 species rahnemaie et al 2007 for arsenite two inner sphere complexes i e a bidentate fe2o2asoh and a monodentate feoas oh 2 surface species were considered and for arsenate three inner sphere complexes were considered i e a bidentate fe2o2aso2 a protonated bidentate fe2o2asooh and a protonated monodentate feoaso2oh surface species stachowicz et al 2006 all the cd music model parameters of the surface complexes were kept the same as used in the previous work table s4 deng et al 2018 the nom cd and lcd model in modeling effects of nom on the adsorption of oxyanions differ in the way they treat the nom adsorbed 2 3 1 nom cd model in case of the nom cd model the effects of nom on the adsorption of oxyanions is simulated by considering nom as a virtual component hnom 1 which is in fact equivalent to two carboxylic groups three surface complexes between the singly coordinated surface groups on goethite feoh 0 5 and hnom 1 were proposed by hiemstra et al 2013 i e an inner sphere fenom an outer sphere feoh2nom and a protonated inner sphere fenomh complex as given in eq 1 eq 3 1 feoh 0 5 hnom 1 fe 1 5 δ z 0 nom δ z 1 δ z 2 h 2 o 2 feoh 0 5 hnom 1 feoh 2 1 5 δ z 0 nom δ z 1 δ z 2 3 feoh 0 5 h hnom 1 fe 1 5 δ z 0 nomh δ z 1 0 5 δ z 2 0 5 h 2 o the charge distribution coefficients δz i for different surface species formed by adsorbed nom are shown in table s4 in the nom cd modeling there are two adjustable parameters i e the amount of virtual nom adsorbed i e fenom t at a certain loading of ha or fa and the protonation constant logk h in forming the fenomh complex the logk h was fitted together with fenom t using the phosphate adsorption envelop data exp i and thus fitted logk h value was kept constant for each ha or fa in modeling other data exp ii and iii the values of fenom t fitted were kept constant for each ha or fa in modeling exp ii whereas new values of fenom t were fitted in describing the results of exp iii in which different amounts of ha or fa were added 2 3 2 lcd model in the lcd model the nom present at the surface of goethite is considered as macromolecules with carboxylic and phenolic groups weng et al 2008 2009 the carboxylic type of groups rcoo of adsorbed nom present in the inner stern layer can form inner sphere complexes feoocr 0 5 with the singly coordinated surface sites on goethite weng et al 2006 as given in eq 4 4 feoh 0 5 h rcoo 1 fe 0 5 δ z 0 oocr δ z 1 h 2 o the charge distribution coefficients δz i for feoocr 0 5 are shown in table s4 both the carboxylic and phenolic groups can bind protons and other cations if present the nica approach is used to calculate reactions of the ligands on nom with ions and with the goethite surface sites which results in the calculated charge carried by nom adsorbed it was assumed that the nica model parameters for the adsorbed nom remain the same as for nom in the solution the nica donnan parameters of site density of carboxylic q max 1 and phenolic q max 2 group and the mean protonation constant and heterogeneity parameter of carboxylic group logk 1 and m 1 were derived by fitting the acid base titration data of the ha and fa materials to the nica donnan model while keeping the other model parameters as those for generic ha or fa milne et al 2001 table 1 the only adjustable parameter in the lcd model is the spatial distribution of ha and fa present on the goethite surface the thickness of the stern layer is about 0 8 nm hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2006 by assuming that the volume density of hydrated nom equals to 1250 kg m 3 xiong et al 2015 the maximum possible adsorbed amount of nom in a stern layer is about 1 0 mg m 2 in the current study the maximum amount of fa adsorbed in the experiments is at this level about 1 0 mg m 2 although the particle size of fa is around 1 2 nm larger than the thickness of the stern layer 0 8 nm certain degree of morphological change i e change of the shape of particle and its spatial distribution may happen thus we assumed that the adsorbed fa is only present in the stern layer as proposed by weng et al 2007 the distribution of fa between the inner stern layer f 1 and outer stern layer f 2 1 f 1 was fitted for each fa for ha our try out findings revealed that for a good description of the data all adsorbed ha needs to be distributed in the stern layer at a loading when 73 of the stern layer was filled i e 0 73 mg m 2 in this case the distribution of ha between the inner and outer stern layer f 1 and f 2 1 f 1 was fitted similarly to that of fa for higher adsorbed amounts of ha i e 0 73 mg m 2 part of ha was also located in the diffuse double layer ddl in this case the fraction of ha located in the outer stern layer was kept at 0 25 f 2 0 25 weng et al 2007 whereas the fraction in the inner stern layer f 1 was fitted and the fraction in the ddl was derived as f d 1 f 1 f 2 the larger particle size of ha 2 4 nm than fa 1 2 nm explains that fa can fill all the stern layer volume without extruding to the ddl whereas ha cannot this finding is similar to a recently published result of xiong et al 2018 2 4 model calculations the total concentrations of the components added and the final ph measured were used as model input for both the nom cd and lcd and the measured amounts of adsorbed ha or fa were directly used as model input in the lcd model whereas the solid solution distribution of oxyanions and the surface speciation of the adsorbates were model output in both the nom cd and lcd calculation the nom cd model calculations were carried out using the software ecosat keizer and van riemsdijk 1998 the parameter optimization was done by coupling ecosat with fit kinniburgh 1993 the lcd model calculations were carried out using the computer program orchestra meeussen 2003 and the parameterization was realized by try and error 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results effects of ph on the interaction between phosphate or arsenate and goethite in the absence and presence of 42 mg l 1 nom exp i are shown in fig 1 as soluble concentration of phosphate or arsenate it can be seen that the feature of arsenate adsorption markedly resembles phosphate adsorption at the goethite water interface above ph 4 5 the adsorption of both oxyanions decreases with the increase of ph without nom addition in the presence of ha the amount of adsorbed phosphate or arsenate is decreased especially under acidic conditions leading to an increase of soluble phosphate or arsenate the competitive effect follows the order of zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha in the presence of fa the competition effect is more significant than that of ha in the acidic ph range whereas under the alkaline conditions the effects of ha and fa on phosphate or arsenate adsorption are similar and both are weak the change in the difference between the effect of fa and ha is a result of a stronger decrease of fa adsorption with the increase of ph compared to ha the weaker effect at higher ph than at lower ph has been attributed to a stronger decrease of the adsorption of ha and fa with ph compared to that of phosphate or arsenate fig s6 weng et al 2008 2009 only very small difference was observed among the three fa studied in their effects on the adsorption of phosphate and arsenate effects of ph on the adsorption of arsenite by goethite in the absence and presence of ha or fa are shown in fig 1e and f in the absence of nom the adsorption of arsenite generally increases with the increase of ph within ph 3 9 and decreases within ph 9 12 the increase of arsenite adsorption with increase of ph between ph 3 and 9 is attributed to the decreased competition with protons for surface sites whereas the decrease of arsenite adsorption with further ph increase can be attributed to a decrease of the neutral h3aso3 species and an increase of h2aso3 species in solution compared to the effect of nom on phosphate and arsenate adsorption the presence of nom showed a much smaller effect on arsenite adsorption there are only very small differences between various ha in their effects on arsenite adsorption whereas this effect is almost the same for the three fa samples in the ph adsorption envelopes of phosphate arsenate and arsenite nom showed only a small effect on arsenite adsorption whereas the effect of nom on phosphate is similar to that on arsenate therefore in further experiments only phosphate was used as a probe ion to study the effect of surface loading of oxyanions and nom influence of phosphate loadings on the adsorption of phosphate in the absence and presence of nom at ph 5 3 exp ii is shown in fig 2 as phosphate adsorbed the maximum amount of phosphate adsorbed was reduced from 2 13 μmol m 2 to 1 75 μmol m 2 fa samples 1 77 μmol m 2 zw ha 1 85 μmol m 2 cb and fj ha and 1 90 μmol m 2 nl ha upon addition of 42 mg l 1 nom this order is the same as in exp i the largest difference among various nom in the effect on phosphate adsorbed is seen at a soluble phosphate concentration of about 80 μm at which the adsorption is approaching the conditional plateau these differences among various nom become smaller with the increase of adsorbed nom fig 3 shows the effect of the amount of nom on the adsorption of phosphate exp iii as soluble concentration of phosphate with the increase of the amount of ha or fa added the concentration of soluble phosphate increases at the same amount of nom adsorbed the effect of fa is stronger than that of ha again differences in the effect on phosphate adsorption are observed among the ha studied whereas the effects are similar for the three fa at a relatively low loading i e 0 70 mg m 2 the effect is in the order of zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha similar to that in exp i and ii at a higher loading this order becomes zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha the difference in the effect among the ha s is the largest at about 0 45 mg m 2 ha adsorbed whereas this difference becomes smaller when the ha loading is larger 3 2 nom cd and lcd modeling the effect of ph on phosphate adsorption under different ph exp i was simulated firstly and thereafter the model parameters optimized were used in modeling the adsorption envelops of arsenate and arsenite in exp i fig 1 in the absence of nom the adsorption of phosphate can be well described with the cd music model in the presence of nom the adsorption of phosphate can be well described with the nom cd model after optimization of the two adjustable parameters i e fenom t and logk h based on the fact that one fenom t contains two carboxylic groups the value of fenom t site nm 2 can be converted into the density of carboxylic groups of nom considered in the nom cd model q max nd mol kg 1 nom thus derived values of q max nd for ha 1 7 3 4 mol kg 1 is much lower than that for fa 3 9 4 9 mol kg 1 whereas the fitted values of logk h for ha 2 4 3 2 are higher than that for fa 2 3 2 5 table 1 according to the nom cd model a higher fenom t or q max nd and a lower logk h value are related to a stronger interaction between the adsorbed nom and oxyanions this is because that a higher fenom t or q max nd and a lower logk h lead to a larger amount of negative charge from adsorbed nom and consequently a stronger competitive electrostatic repulsion between the nom and oxyanions adsorbed the lcd model can also well describe phosphate adsorption in exp i with only the space distribution of adsorbed nom i e f 1 optimized table 1 for this experiment the adsorbed fa and ha is distributed only between the inner and outer stern layers without being located in the ddl similar f 1 values fraction of fa or ha located in the inner stern layer were obtained for the three fa samples 0 55 0 60 whereas the f 1 values optimized for ha range from 0 30 nl ha to 0 62 zw ha table 1 in the lcd model when the site density of acidic groups q max 1 q max 2 and the protonation constants of these groups logk 1 logk 2 are the same the larger f 1 is the stronger the interaction between nom and oxyanions becomes with the same sets of model parameters effects of different nom on the adsorption of arsenate and arsenite at various ph exp i are also well described with the nom cd and lcd model fig 1c f in addition the model descriptions of phosphate adsorption as a function of phosphate loadings onto goethite surface exp ii are also in line with the experimental results fig 2 in both exp i and ii the same amount of nom 42 mg l 1 was added further the lcd modeling approach was also successfully used to recalculate literature data from hiemstra et al 2013 after parameter optimization in which other ha materials were used table 1 fig s5 these data have already been described with the nom cd model hiemstra et al 2013 the adsorption of phosphate as a function of adsorbed nom exp iii can also be well described with the nom cd or lcd model after the parameter of fenom t or f 1 was optimized for each nom loading whereas the other parameters were kept constant fig 3 for the nom cd model the fitted values of q max nd decrease with an increase of adsorbed nom fig s8 which can be attributed to the gradual increase of the average distance between the adsorbed nom and goethite surface as found in exp i and ii there are larger differences in the q max nd values for the four ha s than for the three fa s and the differences are larger at a low ha loading whereas at high loadings no clear difference can be seen for the lcd model the optimized value of f 1 decreases with an increase of adsorbed nom fig s9 which reflects the gradual increase of the thickness of adsorbed nom layer from low to high nom loading the f 1 of ha decreased from 0 7 0 5 to 0 3 0 2 whereas the f 1 of fa decreased from about 0 8 to 0 2 at the same loading there are differences in the f 1 values for ha whereas almost no difference exists among fa the slope of the decrease is stronger for zw and cb ha than for fj and nl ha which can be attributed to the larger particle size of zw and cb ha table 1 please note that as introduced in the lcd model description above part of ha was also located in the diffuse double layer f d 0 at adsorbed ha 0 73 mg m 2 for both models the number of carboxylic groups on nom is a key factor determining effects on oxyanion adsorption in the lcd model the site density of carboxylic groups q max 1 was derived independently from the ph charge curves of nom whereas in the nom cd model it is reflected in the fitted parameter of q max nd or fenom t at a nom loading of 42 mg l 1 there is a close to 1 1 positive linear relationship r2 0 95 between q max 1 and q max nd fig 4 a a similar relationship between q max 1 and q max nd was also observed by hiemstra et al 2013 using other ha at a ha to goethite loading of 0 58 mg m 2 in the current work it is 0 35 mg m 2 at 42 mg l 1 ha added this relationship confirms that the q max nd in the nom cd model reflects to a large extent the site density of carboxylic groups on adsorbed nom however for the same nom material the relation between q max 1 and q max nd is nom loading dependent fig s10a in line with the nom loading dependency of q max nd q max 1 is constant for a certain ha or fa in the lcd modeling the ratio of q max nd to q max 1 can be regarded as the fraction of adsorbed nom attributed to the stern layer f nd considered in the nom cd model this value f nd ranges from about 0 4 at high nom loading to about 1 6 at low nom loading fig s10b a value of f nd lower than 1 0 can be explained by extruding of adsorbed nom to the ddl at high loadings whereas a value larger than 1 0 can be caused by model artifact because in the nom cd model there is no flexibility to distribute the carboxylic groups between the inner outer stern layer and ddl whereas the carboxylic groups present in the inner stern layer are the most important in competition with oxyanions therefore the ratio of q max nd to q max 1 i e f nd is related to a certain degree of the spatial distribution of nom adsorbed which is supported by a positive linear relationship r2 0 79 between f nd and f 1 fig 4b similar to the site density of carboxylic groups q max 1 the protonation constant of carboxylic groups logk 1 was derived independently from the ph charge curves of nom in the lcd modeling whereas it is an adjustable parameter in the nom cd model logk h a positive correlation was found between logk 1 and logk h fig s11a which confirms the inherent link between these two parameters used in respectively the lcd and nom cd model however the logk h values are generally lower than the logk 1 values which can be caused by the difference in the charge distribution of the protonated and deprotonated carboxylic groups between the two models table s4 in addition for ha of larger particle size 6 10 nm hiemstra et al 2013 the fitted values of logk h are a lot higher than that of logk 1 table 1 this deviation can be caused by the model artifact due to inflexibility of spatial distribution of adsorbed nom in the nom cd model the values of logk h much higher than reality were introduced in the nom cd model for ha of large particle size to mitigate the extra charge of carboxylic groups considered in the model the above results show that both the nom cd and lcd model can well describe the experimental data with limited number of adjustable model parameters the nom cd model calculation is relatively simple to carry out whereas the lcd model can better illustrate different factors including spatial distribution of adsorbed nom 3 3 factors determining the interactions it has been shown that electrostatic interaction plays the most important role in the competition between nom and oxyanions in their adsorption to metal oxides weng et al 2008 2009 to this end the negative charge that nom brings to 1 plane of goethite surface determines to a large extent its effect on phosphate and arsenate adsorption because the negative charge of nom at 1 plane is resulted mainly from the deprotonation of carboxylic groups the amount of carboxylic group located close to 1 plane and its deprotonation protonation reaction are the key factors influencing the degree of competition between nom and oxyanions besides the site density of carboxylic groups on the nom adsorbed another factor related to the amount of negative charge at 1 plane is the fraction of adsorbed nom located in the inner stern layer f 1 if there is no change in morphology of the adsorbed nom f 1 ˊ should be equal to the ratio between the thickness of the inner stern layer 0 4 nm and the size of nom particle i e 0 4 size the degree of morphological change can be defined as ζ 1 f 1 0 4 size which is the ratio of fraction of nom located in the first stern layer in the modeling f 1 to that expected when the adsorbed particle is present as a cube for the three fa studied their size 1 4 1 5 nm and fitted f 1 values 0 55 0 60 for exp i and ii 42 mg l 1 fa added are similar so do their degree of morphological change ζ 1 around 2 table 1 for higher loading of fa exp iii the f 1 values approach 0 3 and the corresponding ζ 1 is almost 1 i e there is almost no morphological change at the highest fa loading studied the comparable effect of the three fa on phosphate and arsenate adsorption is a result of compromising combination between site density of carboxylic groups q max 1 and the amount of fa adsorbed for the four ha studied their size 2 6 3 5 nm and the degree of morphological change ζ 1 2 6 are larger than that of fa a ζ 1 2 indicates that the dimension of the adsorbed particle parallel to the goethite surface is two times of that perpendicular to the surface and a ζ 1 6 indicates that the ratio of the two dimension is 6 and so forth for these ha it was found that ζ 1 increases with the increase of suva254nm and q max 1 of ha fig s11b which indicates that the more aromatic the ha particles are and the higher the site density of carboxylic groups is the closer they can get to goethite surface at a loading of 42 mg l 1 ha the effect of ha on phosphate and arsenate adsorption follows the order of zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha which is determined mainly by their difference in the site density of carboxylic groups q max 1 and to a less extent by their particle size aromaticity and protonation constant logk 1 at the highest loading of ha in exp iii 200 mg l 1 the effect on phosphate and arsenate adsorption becomes smaller than at lower loadings and follows the order of zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha which is determined to a large extent by their particle size the main cause for a stronger effect of fa on phosphate and arsenate adsorption than ha can be attributed to a higher q max 1 lower logk 1 and to a less extend to the smaller size of these fa particles the effect of nom on the adsorption of arsenite is much weaker than that on arsenate and phosphate according to the cd music model the negative charge of adsorbed arsenite attributed to the 1 plane is lower than that of arsenate and phosphate table s4 for example the charge distributed to the 1 plane of bidentate surface complex of arsenite arsenate and phosphate is 0 34 1 47 and 1 46 v u respectively the small amount of charge of arsenite located at 1 plane leads to a relatively weaker electrostatic repulsion between adsorbed nom and arsenite when compared with that between adsorbed nom and arsenate or phosphate this is also the main cause of the smaller reduction in the amount of bidentate arsenite species than bidentate arsenate and phosphate species in the presence of ha or fa fig 5 at ph 3 12 the bidentate surface complex dominates in the interaction of oxyanions and goethite in both the absence and presence of nom the presence of nom especially fa leads to a shift from the bidentate to monodentate surface complex of phosphate and for arsenate to the protonated bidentate and monodentate surface species especially at low ph ph 7 but the effect of nom on the surface speciation of arsenite is relatively unpronounced fig 5 despite that the effect of nom on arsenite adsorption is relatively small it cannot be ignored because of a higher toxicity and mobility of arsenite than arsenate in natural environment arsenite dominates in soil and water under anaerobic conditions under which the ph of soil and water tends to be neutral from these results we can see that the adsorption of arsenite to goethite is relatively strong under neutral ph but the effect of nom on the adsorption of arsenite is also the strongest fig 1 though some researchers claimed that arsenite can bind to nom buschmann et al 2006 our modeling results can describe the nom effect via adsorption competition only combining the characterization of nom with the nom cd and lcd modeling results it can be concluded that interactions between various nom and phosphate arsenate or arsenite at the goethite water interface are determined by the site density of carboxylic groups protonation constant of the carboxylic groups particle size and the aromaticity of nom although the effect of nom on the adsorption of arsenite is significantly weaker than that on phosphate and arsenate the role of particle size increases with the increase of surface loading of nom 4 conclusions in this study interactions of nom with phosphate arsenate and arsenite at the goethite water interface were investigated under different ph nom material and surface loading of nom the adsorption behaviors of oxyanions were successfully modeled with two advanced surface complexation models i e the nom cd and lcd model the main conclusions are presented as follows nom has significant implications for the mobility of phosphate and arsenate under the acidic ph whereas the effects of nom on the mobility of arsenite are relatively strong under the neutral ph the competitive interaction between nom and oxyanions at the goethite water interface is mainly determined by the difference in the site density of carboxylic groups protonation constant of the carboxylic groups and spatial distribution of the nom adsorbed the spatial distribution of nom adsorbed on the goethite surface is related to the particle size surface loading aromaticity and site density of carboxylic groups of nom in modeling the interactions of phosphate arsenate or arsenite with various nom at the goethite water interface the nom cd modeling is relatively simple to implement whereas the lcd modeling can better separate effects of different factors and mechanisms acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfd0800304 the

18867,among natural organic matter nom oxyanions and metal hydr oxides a complicated interaction exists in natural aquatic and terrestrial systems and in waste waters effects of seven types of nom four humic acids ha three fulvic acids fa that vary in properties on the adsorption of oxyanions including phosphate arsenate and arsenite at goethite water interface were quantitatively studied results show that the adsorption of oxyanions to goethite is decreased by the presence of nom especially for phosphate and arsenate at low ph in general the effects of the three fa are similar which are more effective than ha in reducing oxyanion adsorption at low ph 6 differences were observed between the four ha in their competition with oxyanions the adsorption of phosphate arsenate and arsenite in the presence of nom are well described with both the nom cd cd charge distribution and lcd ligand and charge distribution model the nom cd model is relatively simple to use whereas the lcd model can better reveal different factors in the interaction including the spatial distribution of adsorbed nom on oxide surface according to these two models site density of carboxylic groups protonation constant of carboxylic groups and particle size of nom are major properties of nom determining its effect on oxyanion adsorption to oxides at relatively low loadings morphological change of adsorbed nom takes place and the degree of morphological change of adsorbed nom depends on the particle size site density of carboxylic groups and aromaticity of nom the influence of particle size on the interaction becomes more important at higher nom loadings the results suggested that the fixation or removal efficiency of phosphate arsenate and arsenite with iron oxides e g goethite can be significantly decreased by the presence of nom especially when nom rich in acidic and aromatic groups graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural organic matter phosphate arsenate arsenite adsorption surface complexation model 1 introduction both phosphorus p and arsenic as are elements of group 15 in the periodic table over the past decades over application of p fertilizer has led to accumulation of phosphorus in soils which in turn has led to eutrophication of surface and ground water and degradation of water quality carpenter et al 1998 on the other hand the contamination of as in drinking water has become a serious issue because of its high toxicity and carcinogenicity to human harvey et al 2002 both p and as are predominantly present as inorganic oxyanions in the natural environment i

metal hydr oxides bissen and frimmel 2003 li et al 2016 minerals of metal hydr oxides are often used as adsorbents to remove p and as in drainage and waste waters daus et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 therefore it is of significant importance to acquire good understanding and to make quantitative prediction regarding the adsorption behavior of these oxyanions to metal hydr oxides under environmental conditions natural organic matter nom contains mainly ill defined macromolecules and the composition and properties of nom vary with the source and extraction method stevenson 1994 hunt et al 2007 tsuda et al 2010 humic acids ha and fulvic acids fa are operationally defined fractions of nom and contain large amounts of carboxylic and phenolic type of functional groups which interact strongly with metal hydr oxides and change the adsorption feature of oxyanions previous studies revealed a negative correlation between adsorbed ha or fa and oxyanions e g phosphate and arsenate showing the competition effect of ha and fa with oxyanions for adsorption to metal hydr oxides antelo et al 2007 weng et al 2008 2009 hiemstra et al 2013 otero fariña et al 2017 although there are studies carried out previously a consistent understanding regarding the properties of nom that determine the effect on oxyanion adsorption to metal hydr oxides is still lacking for example weng et al 2008 2009 found that fa exerts a stronger competitive effect on phosphate and arsenate adsorption to goethite than ha the stronger effect of fa on oxyanion adsorption was attributed to the smaller size of fa than that of ha on the other hand hiemstra et al 2013 pointed out that the number of functional groups was the main cause of the different degree of competitive interactions between various ha and phosphate in addition chasse and ohno 2016 suggested that nom containing more aromatic structures with a higher molecular mass has a greater potential to compete with phosphate for surface sites on iron hydr oxide these findings show that further research is needed to obtain a more thorough and in depth understanding on the mechanism and determining factors in the oxyanion nom mineral interactions surface complexation modeling is a computational tool to simulate the physical chemical processes at the surface of adsorbents in combination with laboratory analysis model calculation can reveal the whole fingerprint of surface speciation and can make predictions during the past few decades advanced surface complexation models have been successfully developed to study the adsorption behaviors of oxyanions onto metal hydr oxides hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 stachowicz et al 2006 tian et al 2017 for instance in a previous study we have shown that the cd music charge distribution and multi site complexation model hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 can well predict the adsorption behavior of phosphate arsenate and arsenite in a multi adsorbent system at variable ph and calcium concentration in the absence of nom deng et al 2018 efforts to elucidate the effects of nom on the adsorption of ions to metal hydr oxides were made more recently weng et al 2008 2009 2012 hiemstra et al 2013 otero fariña et al 2017 one modeling approach is the nom cd natural organic matter charge distribution model proposed by hiemstra et al 2013 which takes the site competition and electrostatic interaction effect of nom on anion adsorption into consideration by representing adsorbed nom with a surface component fenom another surface complexation model the lcd ligand and charge distribution model uses the nica non ideal competitive adsorption approach to calculate the surface speciation and charge of the adsorbed nom filius et al 2003 weng et al 2006 both the nom cd and lcd model are integrated with the cd music model to calculate the adsorption of small ions to metal hydr oxides as well as the electrostatic potential at oxides surface the nom cd model has been used to describe the influence of ha on phosphate adsorption to goethite and the effect of nom on phosphate adsorption to soil hiemstra et al 2013 whereas the lcd model has been applied to explain the effect of adsorbed fa ha and soil nom on the adsorption of phosphate and arsenate to goethite and to soil samples weng et al 2008 2009 cui and weng 2013 the capability of these models in predicting and illustrating effects of adsorbed nom on oxyanion adsorption needs to be further tested using ha and fa derived from different sources anions with different adsorption behavior and over a wide ph range in the present study ha and fa were extracted from different soils and a series of adsorption experiments were conducted to determine effects of ha and fa on the adsorption of phosphate arsenate and arsenite to goethite the nom cd and lcd model were used to calculate the adsorption of these oxyanions in the presence of ha and fa the specific objectives of this work are i to quantitatively compare the influence of nom derived from different sources on the adsorption of phosphate arsenate and arsenite to goethite at different ph ii to validate and compare the capacity of the nom cd and lcd model in describing the effects of nom on the adsorption of oxyanions to metal hydr oxide and iii to obtain better understanding regarding the main properties of nom determining its interaction with oxyanion at the goethite water interface by integrating experimental and modeling methods 2 material and methods 2 1 goethite and nom preparation the goethite material was synthesized according to hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 the specific surface area and point of zero charge pzc of goethite have been measured as 89 m2 g 1 and ph 9 2 respectively deng et al 2018 three different forest soils were collected from changbai cb mountain located in jilin province from the northeast of china fujun fj mountain in tianjin from the east of china and ziwuling zw mountain in gansu province from the northwest of china ha and fa were purified from these soils following the protocol of ihss international humic substances society zomeren and comans 2007 and the purified materials were freeze dried the purified ha and fa were characterized on organic elemental analyser elementar vario el germany for elemental composition on fourier transform infra red spectrometer ftir nicolet nexus870 usa for structure characterization and on size exclusion chromatography sec for molar mass distribution the charging behavior of ha and fa was determined with acid base titration more information regarding the soil samples procedures to prepare and characterize the ha and fa materials can be found in the supporting information table s1 s3 and fig s1 s3 in addition a ha derived from a forest soil in the netherland nl ha that has been used in studying the effects of nom on phosphate and arsenate adsorption to goethite weng et al 2008 2009 was provided by wageningen university the netherlands the stock solutions of ha were prepared by dissolving the freeze dried material with a small amount of 0 10 m naoh to effectively dissolve ha samples and then the solution was diluted to 1 0 g l 1 with ultrapure water the stock solutions of fa were prepared by dissolving the dry material with ultrapure water to a concentration of 1 0 g l 1 2 2 adsorption experiment three series of batch adsorption experiments were conducted to obtain i adsorption envelopes of phosphate arsenate and arsenite oxyanion concentration 0 14 mm in the ph range of 3 12 in the absence and presence of 42 mg l 1 ha or fa exp i ii adsorption isotherms of phosphate 0 14 0 49 mm at ph 5 3 in the absence and presence of 42 mg l 1 ha or fa exp ii iii adsorption of phosphate 0 12 mm at ph 5 0 under the influence of different amount 0 200 mg l 1 of ha or fa exp iii the stock solutions of nom ha or fa and oxyanion phosphate as nah2po4 2h2o arsenite as naaso2 or arsenate as na2haso4 7h2o were simultaneously added to the goethite suspensions in 50 ml polyethylene bottles under a n2 atmosphere the final concentration of goethite was 1 35 g l 1 in a 0 10 m nacl electrolyte background the ph of the suspension was adjusted with 0 10 m naoh or hcl to the chosen values in each series a blank series without ha or fa added was included the suspension samples were shaken at 150 rpm 25 c for 72 h during the first 48 h the suspension ph was checked and would be readjusted to the target value again if necessary pre trials of kinetic experiments have shown that equilibrium was reached for both oxyanions and nom after 72 h reaction fig s4 at the end of shaking the final ph of the suspension was measured then the suspensions were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 30 min and filtered through 0 22 μm filters pes membrana the concentration of p or as in the filtrates was determined with icp ms agilent 7500i usa the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured with a toc analyser shimadzu after the supernatant was acidified to ph 3 4 to remove dissolved inorganic carbon weng et al 2008 the amount of ha or fa adsorbed was calculated from the difference of doc between the blank without goethite addition and the treatment the speciation of as in solution was determined in selected samples with hplc using an anion exchange column coupled with icp ms cui and weng 2013 which confirmed that only limited transformation took place between arsenate and arsenite and its influence on the dissolved as can be ignored 2 3 modeling in both the nom cd and lcd model the cd music model with an extended stern electrostatic sub model was used to describe the reactions of the goethite surface with adsorbates in the cd music model the primary charging behavior of goethite is attributed to the protonation and deprotonation of the singly feoh 0 5 and triply fe3o 0 5 coordinated surface groups the intrinsic protonation affinities are assumed to be equal to the pzc of goethite pzc 9 2 indifferent electrolyte ions i e na and cl in experiments of current study can form ion pairs with both the singly and triply coordinated surface sites for phosphate adsorption two types of surface species were considered in the cd music model i e a protonated monodentate feopo2oh and a bidentate fe2o2po2 species rahnemaie et al 2007 for arsenite two inner sphere complexes i e a bidentate fe2o2asoh and a monodentate feoas oh 2 surface species were considered and for arsenate three inner sphere complexes were considered i e a bidentate fe2o2aso2 a protonated bidentate fe2o2asooh and a protonated monodentate feoaso2oh surface species stachowicz et al 2006 all the cd music model parameters of the surface complexes were kept the same as used in the previous work table s4 deng et al 2018 the nom cd and lcd model in modeling effects of nom on the adsorption of oxyanions differ in the way they treat the nom adsorbed 2 3 1 nom cd model in case of the nom cd model the effects of nom on the adsorption of oxyanions is simulated by considering nom as a virtual component hnom 1 which is in fact equivalent to two carboxylic groups three surface complexes between the singly coordinated surface groups on goethite feoh 0 5 and hnom 1 were proposed by hiemstra et al 2013 i e an inner sphere fenom an outer sphere feoh2nom and a protonated inner sphere fenomh complex as given in eq 1 eq 3 1 feoh 0 5 hnom 1 fe 1 5 δ z 0 nom δ z 1 δ z 2 h 2 o 2 feoh 0 5 hnom 1 feoh 2 1 5 δ z 0 nom δ z 1 δ z 2 3 feoh 0 5 h hnom 1 fe 1 5 δ z 0 nomh δ z 1 0 5 δ z 2 0 5 h 2 o the charge distribution coefficients δz i for different surface species formed by adsorbed nom are shown in table s4 in the nom cd modeling there are two adjustable parameters i e the amount of virtual nom adsorbed i e fenom t at a certain loading of ha or fa and the protonation constant logk h in forming the fenomh complex the logk h was fitted together with fenom t using the phosphate adsorption envelop data exp i and thus fitted logk h value was kept constant for each ha or fa in modeling other data exp ii and iii the values of fenom t fitted were kept constant for each ha or fa in modeling exp ii whereas new values of fenom t were fitted in describing the results of exp iii in which different amounts of ha or fa were added 2 3 2 lcd model in the lcd model the nom present at the surface of goethite is considered as macromolecules with carboxylic and phenolic groups weng et al 2008 2009 the carboxylic type of groups rcoo of adsorbed nom present in the inner stern layer can form inner sphere complexes feoocr 0 5 with the singly coordinated surface sites on goethite weng et al 2006 as given in eq 4 4 feoh 0 5 h rcoo 1 fe 0 5 δ z 0 oocr δ z 1 h 2 o the charge distribution coefficients δz i for feoocr 0 5 are shown in table s4 both the carboxylic and phenolic groups can bind protons and other cations if present the nica approach is used to calculate reactions of the ligands on nom with ions and with the goethite surface sites which results in the calculated charge carried by nom adsorbed it was assumed that the nica model parameters for the adsorbed nom remain the same as for nom in the solution the nica donnan parameters of site density of carboxylic q max 1 and phenolic q max 2 group and the mean protonation constant and heterogeneity parameter of carboxylic group logk 1 and m 1 were derived by fitting the acid base titration data of the ha and fa materials to the nica donnan model while keeping the other model parameters as those for generic ha or fa milne et al 2001 table 1 the only adjustable parameter in the lcd model is the spatial distribution of ha and fa present on the goethite surface the thickness of the stern layer is about 0 8 nm hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2006 by assuming that the volume density of hydrated nom equals to 1250 kg m 3 xiong et al 2015 the maximum possible adsorbed amount of nom in a stern layer is about 1 0 mg m 2 in the current study the maximum amount of fa adsorbed in the experiments is at this level about 1 0 mg m 2 although the particle size of fa is around 1 2 nm larger than the thickness of the stern layer 0 8 nm certain degree of morphological change i e change of the shape of particle and its spatial distribution may happen thus we assumed that the adsorbed fa is only present in the stern layer as proposed by weng et al 2007 the distribution of fa between the inner stern layer f 1 and outer stern layer f 2 1 f 1 was fitted for each fa for ha our try out findings revealed that for a good description of the data all adsorbed ha needs to be distributed in the stern layer at a loading when 73 of the stern layer was filled i e 0 73 mg m 2 in this case the distribution of ha between the inner and outer stern layer f 1 and f 2 1 f 1 was fitted similarly to that of fa for higher adsorbed amounts of ha i e 0 73 mg m 2 part of ha was also located in the diffuse double layer ddl in this case the fraction of ha located in the outer stern layer was kept at 0 25 f 2 0 25 weng et al 2007 whereas the fraction in the inner stern layer f 1 was fitted and the fraction in the ddl was derived as f d 1 f 1 f 2 the larger particle size of ha 2 4 nm than fa 1 2 nm explains that fa can fill all the stern layer volume without extruding to the ddl whereas ha cannot this finding is similar to a recently published result of xiong et al 2018 2 4 model calculations the total concentrations of the components added and the final ph measured were used as model input for both the nom cd and lcd and the measured amounts of adsorbed ha or fa were directly used as model input in the lcd model whereas the solid solution distribution of oxyanions and the surface speciation of the adsorbates were model output in both the nom cd and lcd calculation the nom cd model calculations were carried out using the software ecosat keizer and van riemsdijk 1998 the parameter optimization was done by coupling ecosat with fit kinniburgh 1993 the lcd model calculations were carried out using the computer program orchestra meeussen 2003 and the parameterization was realized by try and error 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results effects of ph on the interaction between phosphate or arsenate and goethite in the absence and presence of 42 mg l 1 nom exp i are shown in fig 1 as soluble concentration of phosphate or arsenate it can be seen that the feature of arsenate adsorption markedly resembles phosphate adsorption at the goethite water interface above ph 4 5 the adsorption of both oxyanions decreases with the increase of ph without nom addition in the presence of ha the amount of adsorbed phosphate or arsenate is decreased especially under acidic conditions leading to an increase of soluble phosphate or arsenate the competitive effect follows the order of zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha in the presence of fa the competition effect is more significant than that of ha in the acidic ph range whereas under the alkaline conditions the effects of ha and fa on phosphate or arsenate adsorption are similar and both are weak the change in the difference between the effect of fa and ha is a result of a stronger decrease of fa adsorption with the increase of ph compared to ha the weaker effect at higher ph than at lower ph has been attributed to a stronger decrease of the adsorption of ha and fa with ph compared to that of phosphate or arsenate fig s6 weng et al 2008 2009 only very small difference was observed among the three fa studied in their effects on the adsorption of phosphate and arsenate effects of ph on the adsorption of arsenite by goethite in the absence and presence of ha or fa are shown in fig 1e and f in the absence of nom the adsorption of arsenite generally increases with the increase of ph within ph 3 9 and decreases within ph 9 12 the increase of arsenite adsorption with increase of ph between ph 3 and 9 is attributed to the decreased competition with protons for surface sites whereas the decrease of arsenite adsorption with further ph increase can be attributed to a decrease of the neutral h3aso3 species and an increase of h2aso3 species in solution compared to the effect of nom on phosphate and arsenate adsorption the presence of nom showed a much smaller effect on arsenite adsorption there are only very small differences between various ha in their effects on arsenite adsorption whereas this effect is almost the same for the three fa samples in the ph adsorption envelopes of phosphate arsenate and arsenite nom showed only a small effect on arsenite adsorption whereas the effect of nom on phosphate is similar to that on arsenate therefore in further experiments only phosphate was used as a probe ion to study the effect of surface loading of oxyanions and nom influence of phosphate loadings on the adsorption of phosphate in the absence and presence of nom at ph 5 3 exp ii is shown in fig 2 as phosphate adsorbed the maximum amount of phosphate adsorbed was reduced from 2 13 μmol m 2 to 1 75 μmol m 2 fa samples 1 77 μmol m 2 zw ha 1 85 μmol m 2 cb and fj ha and 1 90 μmol m 2 nl ha upon addition of 42 mg l 1 nom this order is the same as in exp i the largest difference among various nom in the effect on phosphate adsorbed is seen at a soluble phosphate concentration of about 80 μm at which the adsorption is approaching the conditional plateau these differences among various nom become smaller with the increase of adsorbed nom fig 3 shows the effect of the amount of nom on the adsorption of phosphate exp iii as soluble concentration of phosphate with the increase of the amount of ha or fa added the concentration of soluble phosphate increases at the same amount of nom adsorbed the effect of fa is stronger than that of ha again differences in the effect on phosphate adsorption are observed among the ha studied whereas the effects are similar for the three fa at a relatively low loading i e 0 70 mg m 2 the effect is in the order of zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha similar to that in exp i and ii at a higher loading this order becomes zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha the difference in the effect among the ha s is the largest at about 0 45 mg m 2 ha adsorbed whereas this difference becomes smaller when the ha loading is larger 3 2 nom cd and lcd modeling the effect of ph on phosphate adsorption under different ph exp i was simulated firstly and thereafter the model parameters optimized were used in modeling the adsorption envelops of arsenate and arsenite in exp i fig 1 in the absence of nom the adsorption of phosphate can be well described with the cd music model in the presence of nom the adsorption of phosphate can be well described with the nom cd model after optimization of the two adjustable parameters i e fenom t and logk h based on the fact that one fenom t contains two carboxylic groups the value of fenom t site nm 2 can be converted into the density of carboxylic groups of nom considered in the nom cd model q max nd mol kg 1 nom thus derived values of q max nd for ha 1 7 3 4 mol kg 1 is much lower than that for fa 3 9 4 9 mol kg 1 whereas the fitted values of logk h for ha 2 4 3 2 are higher than that for fa 2 3 2 5 table 1 according to the nom cd model a higher fenom t or q max nd and a lower logk h value are related to a stronger interaction between the adsorbed nom and oxyanions this is because that a higher fenom t or q max nd and a lower logk h lead to a larger amount of negative charge from adsorbed nom and consequently a stronger competitive electrostatic repulsion between the nom and oxyanions adsorbed the lcd model can also well describe phosphate adsorption in exp i with only the space distribution of adsorbed nom i e f 1 optimized table 1 for this experiment the adsorbed fa and ha is distributed only between the inner and outer stern layers without being located in the ddl similar f 1 values fraction of fa or ha located in the inner stern layer were obtained for the three fa samples 0 55 0 60 whereas the f 1 values optimized for ha range from 0 30 nl ha to 0 62 zw ha table 1 in the lcd model when the site density of acidic groups q max 1 q max 2 and the protonation constants of these groups logk 1 logk 2 are the same the larger f 1 is the stronger the interaction between nom and oxyanions becomes with the same sets of model parameters effects of different nom on the adsorption of arsenate and arsenite at various ph exp i are also well described with the nom cd and lcd model fig 1c f in addition the model descriptions of phosphate adsorption as a function of phosphate loadings onto goethite surface exp ii are also in line with the experimental results fig 2 in both exp i and ii the same amount of nom 42 mg l 1 was added further the lcd modeling approach was also successfully used to recalculate literature data from hiemstra et al 2013 after parameter optimization in which other ha materials were used table 1 fig s5 these data have already been described with the nom cd model hiemstra et al 2013 the adsorption of phosphate as a function of adsorbed nom exp iii can also be well described with the nom cd or lcd model after the parameter of fenom t or f 1 was optimized for each nom loading whereas the other parameters were kept constant fig 3 for the nom cd model the fitted values of q max nd decrease with an increase of adsorbed nom fig s8 which can be attributed to the gradual increase of the average distance between the adsorbed nom and goethite surface as found in exp i and ii there are larger differences in the q max nd values for the four ha s than for the three fa s and the differences are larger at a low ha loading whereas at high loadings no clear difference can be seen for the lcd model the optimized value of f 1 decreases with an increase of adsorbed nom fig s9 which reflects the gradual increase of the thickness of adsorbed nom layer from low to high nom loading the f 1 of ha decreased from 0 7 0 5 to 0 3 0 2 whereas the f 1 of fa decreased from about 0 8 to 0 2 at the same loading there are differences in the f 1 values for ha whereas almost no difference exists among fa the slope of the decrease is stronger for zw and cb ha than for fj and nl ha which can be attributed to the larger particle size of zw and cb ha table 1 please note that as introduced in the lcd model description above part of ha was also located in the diffuse double layer f d 0 at adsorbed ha 0 73 mg m 2 for both models the number of carboxylic groups on nom is a key factor determining effects on oxyanion adsorption in the lcd model the site density of carboxylic groups q max 1 was derived independently from the ph charge curves of nom whereas in the nom cd model it is reflected in the fitted parameter of q max nd or fenom t at a nom loading of 42 mg l 1 there is a close to 1 1 positive linear relationship r2 0 95 between q max 1 and q max nd fig 4 a a similar relationship between q max 1 and q max nd was also observed by hiemstra et al 2013 using other ha at a ha to goethite loading of 0 58 mg m 2 in the current work it is 0 35 mg m 2 at 42 mg l 1 ha added this relationship confirms that the q max nd in the nom cd model reflects to a large extent the site density of carboxylic groups on adsorbed nom however for the same nom material the relation between q max 1 and q max nd is nom loading dependent fig s10a in line with the nom loading dependency of q max nd q max 1 is constant for a certain ha or fa in the lcd modeling the ratio of q max nd to q max 1 can be regarded as the fraction of adsorbed nom attributed to the stern layer f nd considered in the nom cd model this value f nd ranges from about 0 4 at high nom loading to about 1 6 at low nom loading fig s10b a value of f nd lower than 1 0 can be explained by extruding of adsorbed nom to the ddl at high loadings whereas a value larger than 1 0 can be caused by model artifact because in the nom cd model there is no flexibility to distribute the carboxylic groups between the inner outer stern layer and ddl whereas the carboxylic groups present in the inner stern layer are the most important in competition with oxyanions therefore the ratio of q max nd to q max 1 i e f nd is related to a certain degree of the spatial distribution of nom adsorbed which is supported by a positive linear relationship r2 0 79 between f nd and f 1 fig 4b similar to the site density of carboxylic groups q max 1 the protonation constant of carboxylic groups logk 1 was derived independently from the ph charge curves of nom in the lcd modeling whereas it is an adjustable parameter in the nom cd model logk h a positive correlation was found between logk 1 and logk h fig s11a which confirms the inherent link between these two parameters used in respectively the lcd and nom cd model however the logk h values are generally lower than the logk 1 values which can be caused by the difference in the charge distribution of the protonated and deprotonated carboxylic groups between the two models table s4 in addition for ha of larger particle size 6 10 nm hiemstra et al 2013 the fitted values of logk h are a lot higher than that of logk 1 table 1 this deviation can be caused by the model artifact due to inflexibility of spatial distribution of adsorbed nom in the nom cd model the values of logk h much higher than reality were introduced in the nom cd model for ha of large particle size to mitigate the extra charge of carboxylic groups considered in the model the above results show that both the nom cd and lcd model can well describe the experimental data with limited number of adjustable model parameters the nom cd model calculation is relatively simple to carry out whereas the lcd model can better illustrate different factors including spatial distribution of adsorbed nom 3 3 factors determining the interactions it has been shown that electrostatic interaction plays the most important role in the competition between nom and oxyanions in their adsorption to metal oxides weng et al 2008 2009 to this end the negative charge that nom brings to 1 plane of goethite surface determines to a large extent its effect on phosphate and arsenate adsorption because the negative charge of nom at 1 plane is resulted mainly from the deprotonation of carboxylic groups the amount of carboxylic group located close to 1 plane and its deprotonation protonation reaction are the key factors influencing the degree of competition between nom and oxyanions besides the site density of carboxylic groups on the nom adsorbed another factor related to the amount of negative charge at 1 plane is the fraction of adsorbed nom located in the inner stern layer f 1 if there is no change in morphology of the adsorbed nom f 1 ˊ should be equal to the ratio between the thickness of the inner stern layer 0 4 nm and the size of nom particle i e 0 4 size the degree of morphological change can be defined as ζ 1 f 1 0 4 size which is the ratio of fraction of nom located in the first stern layer in the modeling f 1 to that expected when the adsorbed particle is present as a cube for the three fa studied their size 1 4 1 5 nm and fitted f 1 values 0 55 0 60 for exp i and ii 42 mg l 1 fa added are similar so do their degree of morphological change ζ 1 around 2 table 1 for higher loading of fa exp iii the f 1 values approach 0 3 and the corresponding ζ 1 is almost 1 i e there is almost no morphological change at the highest fa loading studied the comparable effect of the three fa on phosphate and arsenate adsorption is a result of compromising combination between site density of carboxylic groups q max 1 and the amount of fa adsorbed for the four ha studied their size 2 6 3 5 nm and the degree of morphological change ζ 1 2 6 are larger than that of fa a ζ 1 2 indicates that the dimension of the adsorbed particle parallel to the goethite surface is two times of that perpendicular to the surface and a ζ 1 6 indicates that the ratio of the two dimension is 6 and so forth for these ha it was found that ζ 1 increases with the increase of suva254nm and q max 1 of ha fig s11b which indicates that the more aromatic the ha particles are and the higher the site density of carboxylic groups is the closer they can get to goethite surface at a loading of 42 mg l 1 ha the effect of ha on phosphate and arsenate adsorption follows the order of zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha which is determined mainly by their difference in the site density of carboxylic groups q max 1 and to a less extent by their particle size aromaticity and protonation constant logk 1 at the highest loading of ha in exp iii 200 mg l 1 the effect on phosphate and arsenate adsorption becomes smaller than at lower loadings and follows the order of zw ha cb ha fj ha nl ha which is determined to a large extent by their particle size the main cause for a stronger effect of fa on phosphate and arsenate adsorption than ha can be attributed to a higher q max 1 lower logk 1 and to a less extend to the smaller size of these fa particles the effect of nom on the adsorption of arsenite is much weaker than that on arsenate and phosphate according to the cd music model the negative charge of adsorbed arsenite attributed to the 1 plane is lower than that of arsenate and phosphate table s4 for example the charge distributed to the 1 plane of bidentate surface complex of arsenite arsenate and phosphate is 0 34 1 47 and 1 46 v u respectively the small amount of charge of arsenite located at 1 plane leads to a relatively weaker electrostatic repulsion between adsorbed nom and arsenite when compared with that between adsorbed nom and arsenate or phosphate this is also the main cause of the smaller reduction in the amount of bidentate arsenite species than bidentate arsenate and phosphate species in the presence of ha or fa fig 5 at ph 3 12 the bidentate surface complex dominates in the interaction of oxyanions and goethite in both the absence and presence of nom the presence of nom especially fa leads to a shift from the bidentate to monodentate surface complex of phosphate and for arsenate to the protonated bidentate and monodentate surface species especially at low ph ph 7 but the effect of nom on the surface speciation of arsenite is relatively unpronounced fig 5 despite that the effect of nom on arsenite adsorption is relatively small it cannot be ignored because of a higher toxicity and mobility of arsenite than arsenate in natural environment arsenite dominates in soil and water under anaerobic conditions under which the ph of soil and water tends to be neutral from these results we can see that the adsorption of arsenite to goethite is relatively strong under neutral ph but the effect of nom on the adsorption of arsenite is also the strongest fig 1 though some researchers claimed that arsenite can bind to nom buschmann et al 2006 our modeling results can describe the nom effect via adsorption competition only combining the characterization of nom with the nom cd and lcd modeling results it can be concluded that interactions between various nom and phosphate arsenate or arsenite at the goethite water interface are determined by the site density of carboxylic groups protonation constant of the carboxylic groups particle size and the aromaticity of nom although the effect of nom on the adsorption of arsenite is significantly weaker than that on phosphate and arsenate the role of particle size increases with the increase of surface loading of nom 4 conclusions in this study interactions of nom with phosphate arsenate and arsenite at the goethite water interface were investigated under different ph nom material and surface loading of nom the adsorption behaviors of oxyanions were successfully modeled with two advanced surface complexation models i e the nom cd and lcd model the main conclusions are presented as follows nom has significant implications for the mobility of phosphate and arsenate under the acidic ph whereas the effects of nom on the mobility of arsenite are relatively strong under the neutral ph the competitive interaction between nom and oxyanions at the goethite water interface is mainly determined by the difference in the site density of carboxylic groups protonation constant of the carboxylic groups and spatial distribution of the nom adsorbed the spatial distribution of nom adsorbed on the goethite surface is related to the particle size surface loading aromaticity and site density of carboxylic groups of nom in modeling the interactions of phosphate arsenate or arsenite with various nom at the goethite water interface the nom cd modeling is relatively simple to implement whereas the lcd modeling can better separate effects of different factors and mechanisms acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfd0800304 the

they can persist for years or even decades acting as a long lasting contamination source to natural ecosystems the long term persistence of hydrocarbons buried within marine sediments is typically due to the lack of molecular oxygen indeed although extensively documented the anaerobic biodegradation of ph typically proceeds at remarkably lower rates compared to its aerobic counterpart boopathy 2017 da cruz et al 2011 mapelli et al 2017 salminen et al 2004 depending on site conditions certain oil components such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah also tend to strongly bind onto hydrophobic sedimentary materials particularly when they are fine grained and constituted by clay minerals with this process markedly reducing their bioavailability and in turn reduced their biodegradability kronenberg et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 furthermore in some cases ph biodegradation in marine sediments may also be hampered by the lack of macro and micronutrients and or the lack of naturally occurring hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms atlas et al 1972 singh et al 2014 over the years different strategies have been proposed with varying degrees of success to overcome environmental and microbiological factors rate limiting ph biodegradation in contaminated marine sediments as an example addition of fertilizers and or oxygen releasing compounds e g calcium peroxide based chemicals have been considered to address nutrient and oxygen limitation issues respectively boufadel et al 1999 mosmeri et al 2018 wu et al 2018 however difficulties in delivering the amendments into the sediments as well as their low yield of utilization by ph degrading microorganisms due to the rapid consumption scavenging by side biotic and abiotic reactions make these remediation approaches both highly expensive and scarcely effective furthermore the ever increasing attention towards environmental sustainability is now catalyzing the interest towards novel bio remediation technologies which involve minimal use of chemicals and external energy and have accordingly low environmental impact in this context electrobioremediation technologies have recently attracted considerable attention particularly following the discovery of an ever increasing number of microorganisms capable to degrade environmental contaminants including ph using electrodes as virtually inexhaustible terminal electron acceptors in their metabolism aulenta et al 2009 cruz viggi et al 2015 daghio et al 2018 2016 2016 domínguez garay et al 2018 li et al 2015 mao et al 2016 modin and aulenta 2017 rakoczy et al 2013 rodrigo quejigo et al 2016 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 furthermore bioelectrochemical system have also proved as an effective mean to manipulate the redox potential of a contaminated matrix and thereby establishing in situ conditions that are conducive to contaminants biodegradation barba et al 2018 yan et al 2015 yan and reible 2015 2012 as an example in a previous microcosm study dimensionally stable anodes dsa buried within a contaminated sediment where successfully employed to fine tune oxygen generation within the sediment via low voltage i e 2 v seawater electrolysis and by so doing accelerating up to 3 times relative to non electrified controls the biodegradation of crude oil hydrocarbons bellagamba et al 2017 further to their role as direct or indirect via oxygen generation electron acceptors electrodes can also be exploited to enhance ph bioavailability indeed application of low voltage direct electric currents triggers electrokinetic transport phenomena such as electroosmosis electromigration and electrophoresis acar et al 1995 acar and alshawabkeh 1993 in the case of non ionic contaminants such as ph electroosmosis is the principal transport mechanism kuppusamy et al 2017 lim and lau 2016 luo et al 2005 electroosmosis or electroosmotic flow is the movement of pore water within the soil sediment from the anode to the cathode under the influence of an electrical potential importantly the electroosmotic flow is directly proportional to the applied electrical gradient v cm but it is virtually independent of the soil sediment porosity and hydraulic conductivity thereby making this remediation approach ideally suited for the removal of non ionic contaminants from low permeability soils and sediments the principles of electrokinetics and electrokinetic remediation have been reviewed in several previous studies acar et al 1995 acar and alshawabkeh 1993 lim et al 2014 here we examined the viability of an integrated remediation approach exploiting the synergistic effect of electrokinetic transport and bioremediation for the treatment of marine sediments contaminated by crude oil for the first time the study was carried out in a highly representative environmental setting based on the use of large scale mesocosm facilities and involved the application of a highly comprehensive suite of chemical microbiological and electrochemical tools and analytical techniques to assess the overall viability and sustainability of the proposed approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operational conditions the hereafter described mesocosm experiments were setup and conducted at the messina site of iamc cnr located on the seaside of messina harbor italy the mesocosms consisted of 2 perspex tanks length 100 cm depth 30 cm height 40 cm one equipped with electrodes electrolytic mesocosm and one without electrodes control fig 1 each tank was filled with approximately 130 kg of marine sediments that were artificially contaminated in the laboratory with danish underground consortium duc light crude oil to a final concentration of approximately 10 g kg the main organic components of the oil were paraffins 12 7 wt wt napthenes 14 6 wt wt and aromatics 4 8 wt wt the two tanks were positioned within a larger tank 500 150 50 cm that was kept under a continuous flow of seawater taken directly from the messina harbor at a flow rate of approximately 510 l h prior to be introduced within the tank the seawater was filtered through a 200 μm nylon mesh to remove large metazoans and other suspended materials electrodes employed in the electrolytic mesocosm were a rectangular titanium mesh anode coated with ru ir oxides magneto special anodes the netherlands and a stainless steel 304 mesh cathode alpha aesar usa the projected area of the cathode and the anode was approximately 0 045 m2 the anode was positioned close to the bottom of the tank whereas the cathode was placed in the overlying water outside the sediment fig 1 the electrodes were connected to a power source manson nsp 2050 manson engineering industrial hong kong using ti wires the spacing between the anode and cathode was approximately 30 cm upon setup the electrolytic systems were maintained for approximately 2 weeks at open circuit i e the electrodes kept disconnected until the establishment of anoxic conditions within the sediment thereafter the electrodes were connected to the power source and after an initial start up period of 14 days aimed at verifying the electrochemical functionality of the system as a whole during which a fixed voltage difference of 2 5 v was applied between the electrodes a fixed current of 500 ma was continuously applied to the circuit assuming a 100 faradaic efficiency for seawater electrolysis with oxygen evolution at the anode and hydrogen evolution at the cathode being the only reactions taking place at the electrodes this applied current would theoretically correspond to an oxygen generation rate of approximately 4 g per day the electrolytic and the control mesocosms were monitored for a period of approximately 230 days during which a number of analytical electrochemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed notably since one of the main objectives of the experiment was to assess the radius of influence of the electrobioremediation system the 2 mesocosms were sampled in different positions at increasing distance from the electrodes with each position being identified with a code e1 e3 e5 and c1 c3 c5 for the electrolytic and the control mesocosm respectively fig 2 at each sampling time sediment samples each of approximately 50 g were removed from the mesocosms at the different sampling positions using a stainless steel corer

e electric current and voltage difference between electrodes were taken directly from the power source manson nsp 2050 manson engineering industrial hong kong in correspondence to each sampling time the redox potential of the sediment was measured by inserting electrodes directly within the sediment at a depth of approximately 15 cm from the surface a further detailed description of individual analytical and microbiological methods is included in the following paragraphs 2 2 analysis of aromatic and aliphatic oil hydrocarbons by gc ms and changes in diagnostic ratios 2 2 1 sample

sevilla et al 2017 pseudomonas putida kt2440 pkst 1 which allows detecting benzene toluene and xylene hernández sánchez et al 2016 and novosphingobium sp hr1a pksr 1 a strain that responds to the polycyclic aromatic compounds biphenyl naphthalene phenanthrene and 2 methylnaphthalene segura et al 2017 in all cases the strains contained a plasmid in which the gene coding for the green fluorescent protein gfp is transcribed from a suitable promoter whose expression is induced in the presence of specific hydrocarbon compounds induction is achieved by means of a specific regulatory protein that senses the presence of a given hydrocarbon and responds by activating the corresponding promoter the amount of gfp produced can be easily monitored measuring the fluorescence emitted by the cells see below a borkumensis strains were cultured in onr7a artificial seawater medium containing 1 w v pyruvate as the carbon source dyksterhouse et al 1995 while p putida and novosphingobium

streptomycin for a borkumensis and p putida strains and 30 μg ml gentamycin for novosphingobium assays were performed adapting previously described protocols hernández sánchez et al 2016 sevilla et al 2015 briefly for the detection of n alkanes or pristane cultures of the a borkumensis reporter strains were cultivated to stationary phase in onr7a pyruvate at 30 c and cells were centrifuged and re suspended in fresh medium after adjusting the turbidity of the culture to 0 1 a600 nm with fresh medium 4 ml of the cell suspension were loaded into 4 5 ml crew cap glass vials containing 0 05 g of the sediment sample or no sample as control the vials were closed to avoid evaporation of the hydrocarbons and incubated at 30 c with agitation for 4 24 h as specified vials containing the sediment samples but lacking cells were used as blanks to measure the fluorescence amount of gfp of the samples 200 μl in triplicate were taken from the vials and dispensed onto a black clear bottomed microtiter plate the fluorescence excitation 480 nm emission 520 nm and absorbance 600 nm were recorded simultaneously in a tecan ch reader for microtiter plates equipped with a fluorescence detector the fluorescence signal was normalized by the number of cells present which was calculated from the turbidity of the culture a600 after detracting the turbidity of the sample with no cells the fluorescence induction ratio was obtained by dividing the normalized fluorescence of sediment containing samples by that of control samples containing no sediment three biological replicates were performed when using the p putida or novosphingobium reporter strains to detect aromatic compounds cells were grown overnight on m9 glucose medium and then diluted in 10 ml of the same fresh medium to

and gorley 2015 3 results 3 1 electrochemical measurements fig 3a shows the time profiles of electric current and cell voltage throughout the whole experimental period remarkably during steady state operation of the electrolytic mesocosm at a fixed current i of 500 ma corresponding to a current density of 11 a m2 the cell voltage v remained stably below 4 5 v hence pointing to a low electrical resistance of the system as a whole 10 ω which was most likely ensured by the high electric conductivity of the seawater accordingly under steady state conditions electric power consumption w i x v was lower than 2 25 w the application of a fixed current of 500 ma markedly affected the redox potential orp of the sediment consistently with the occurrence of electrolytic oxygen generation at the anode fig 3 b in the electrolytic mesocosm at the start of the experiment the orp was around 0 v vs ag agcl then it gradually increased at all sampling points during the initial 120 days of operation before stabilizing or slightly decreasing during the remainder of the test specifically at e1 the sediment redox potential reached a peak of 320 mv after 77 days of operation i e t1 whereas at e3 i e positioned 30 cm apart from e1 and at e5 positioned 60 cm apart from e1 the redox potential reached lower peak values of 310 v and 220 v respectively only after 135 days of operation from day 120 onward a slow decrease in the redox potential was observed at all sampling points at the end of the study however the redox potential remained between 250 mv at e1 and e3 and 150 mv at e5 a strikingly different trend was observed in the control mesocosm whereby after a period of around 120 days during which the redox potential remained nearly stable at around 0 v it gradually decreased down to 200 mv by the end of the study suggesting the establishment of anoxic conditions most likely driven by the metabolic activity of naturally occurring sulfate reducing microorganisms collectively these results provide a clear indication that application of low voltage direct current prompting seawater electrolysis allows increasing the redox potential of the sediment thereby creating conditions that are potentially conducive for the aerobic biodegradation of oil hydrocarbons most importantly the effect of electrolysis was apparent even at a distance of over 45 cm from the edge of the anode and also in the presence of a continuous flow of seawater over the surface of the sediment 3 2 gc ms analysis of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons as far as the concentration of main oil components is concerned fig 4 shows the hopane normalized concentration of c0 c4 alkylated pahs naphthalenes fluorenes dibenzothiophenes pyrenes and chrysenes in the electrolytic mesocosm at the different sampling times t1 t2 t3 and locations e1 e3 e5 relative to the individual t0 samples measured in although experimental data appeared to be affected by a substantial variability most likely caused by the intrinsic heterogeneity of the sediment material and uneven distribution contaminants a time dependent decrease in the content of nearly all pahs and methylated pahs was apparent in sediment samples taken just over the anode i e sampling point e1 with removal efficiencies ranging from 80 to 100 at the last sampling time substantial though incomplete removal of pahs was also observed in e3 located approximately 15 cm apart from the edge of the anode by contrast negligible removal of pahs was observed in samples taken at e5 with concentrations measured at the last sampling time i e t3 in some cases even exceeding those detected at time zero i e t0 fig 4 as far as the control experiment is concerned negligible removal of pahs was observed over time at all sampling locations fig 5 with concentrations measured at the end of the study being typically equal or higher than those detected at t0 this latter finding provides a straightforward indication that the observed removal of pahs in the electrolytic mesocosm was driven by the application of electric current as far as the aliphatic hydrocarbons nc13 to nc30 are concerned in the electrolytic mesocosm a time dependent decrease in their concentrations relative to t0 was observed almost exclusively at e1 whereas negligible changes were detected at further distance from the electrode i e at e3 and e5 fig s1 unexpectedly the extent of removal of individual aliphatic hydrocarbons at e1 apparently increased with the length of the carbon chain eventually reaching 45 in the case of nc30 fig s1 in agreement with what observed in the case of pahs negligible removal of aliphatic hydrocarbons irrespective of the chain length was observed at all sampling locations in the control mesocosm fig s2 hence providing an additional line of evidence that the observed removal of hydrocarbons was triggered by the applied electric current 3 3 analysis of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with biosensors sediment samples from the electrolytic and the control mesocosms were also analyzed for target aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons by means of ad hoc developed biosensors besides permitting the quantification of low molecular weight compounds that could not be analyzed via gc ms i e nc6 to nc10 aliphatic hydrocarbons biosensors also allowed an integral assessment of the progress of the bioremediation process from the quantification of lumped parameters e g total pahs fig 6 a shows the normalized response of the biosensors for aliphatic compounds to samples taken from the electrolytic and the control mesocosms at different times t0 t1 t2 t3 the biosensor targeting nc6 nc10 indicated no apparent removal of hydrocarbons in the control mesocosm with concentrations measured at the last sampling time t3 being very similar or even higher than those measured at t0 a different situation was observed in the electrolytic mesocosm with a consistent disappearance of contaminants being detected over time in the e1 sample and though less clearly also in sample e3 by contrast negligible removal of nc6 nc10 was observed in e5 as far as the biosensor for pristane is concerned fig 6b no apparent removal was noticed both in the electrolytic and in the control mesocosm in agreement with gc ms data data not shown fig 7 reports the results of the biosensors for aromatic hydrocarbons also in this case in agreement with the results of oil chemistry obtained via gc ms analysis the biosensor detected a substantial time dependent removal of aromatic hydrocarbons i e btx and pah in the electrolytic mesocosm only and specifically in correspondence of e1 whereas lower to no removal was detected at e3 and e5 and in the control experiment 3 4 diagnostic ratios and pahs plots in order to gain a deeper understanding of the prevalent oil hydrocarbons removal mechanisms i e removal via electroosmosis vs biodegradation a number of key diagnostic ratios were calculated from gc ms oil chemistry analyses for each sample and were normalized to the same ratio as measured in the original oil conventionally it is assumed that due to the different intrinsic biodegradability of the different oil components the progress of biodegradation would result in a gradual decrease of these specific ratios as an example pristane pr and phytane ph are known to degrade at a slower rate compared to nc17 and nc18 therefore it is expected that upon biodegradation the specific ratios nc17 pr and nc18 ph would diminish over time same considerations apply for aromatic compounds by contrast removal mechanisms not linked to biodegradation such as electroosmosis driven mass transport would proceed at comparable rates for compounds having similar structures such as nc17 and pr and therefore would not result in a net decrease of the corresponding diagnostic ratio a detailed description of all diagnostic ratios herein calculated can be found elsewhere scheibye et al 2017 for e1 samples due to the extensive removal of most hydrocarbons some diagnostic ratio became undetectable at the last sampling time t3 fig s3 for some others such as nc17 pr and 2mn 1 mn a little decrease 10 was observed over the course of the experiment fig s3 in the case of e3 and e5 samples in which the extent of hydrocarbons removal was substantially lower than in e1 due to the greater distance from the anode all diagnostic ratios could be calculated and none displayed a substantial time dependent reduction same considerations also apply to the control experiment whereby all diagnostic ratios remained virtually unchanged over time taken as a whole these findings suggest that under the experimental conditions applied in this study in the electrolytic mesocosm removal of pah and nc13 nc30 was mainly due to electroosmosis rather than to biodegradation according to the helmholtz smoluchowsky equation alshawabkeh et al 1999 cameselle and reddy 2012 the electroosmotic flow from the anode to the overlying cathode was estimated to be around 250 ml d assuming a coefficient of electroosmotic conductivity of 5 10 9 m2 v s taking into account that the herein used sediment was freshly contaminated and therefore pah were only loosely bound to the sediment material it is plausible that in the presence of such a relatively high electroosmotic flow the electrokinetic transport proceeded at substantially higher rates compared to aerobic biodegradation possibly a different scenario could be expected in the case of historically contaminated sediments and or in the presence of a more active indigenous hydrocarbonoclastic microbial community by contrast with specific reference to lower mw alkanes biosensor analyses indicated a remarkable reduction in their concentration levels which was not mirrored by a corresponding reduction in the concentration level of pristane therefore under the assumption that the physico chemical behavior of nc6 to nc10 is somewhat similar to that of pristane it seems likely that biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism for such oil components although further lines of evidence are warranted the finding that electroosmosis was less effective in removing aliphatics with respect to pahs is a somewhat unexpected finding that however could be related to their lower affinity for water i e higher octanol water partition coefficient being less prone to be removed via electroosmosis these contaminants remained within the tanks for longer period of times under such conditions aerobic biodegradation apparently assumed a more relevant role especially in the case of low molecular weight alkanes i e nc6 to nc10 3 5 microbiological analyses next generation sequencing and card fish detection of alkb gene carrying cells sediment samples taken at different times t0 to t2 and positions e1 to e5 and c1 to c5 from the electrolytic and control mesocosms were also analyzed by next generation sequencing for identifying the dynamics of the main microbial community members as well as their spatial distribution figs 8 and 9 and s5 bray curtis similarities were calculated from 16s rrna gene sequencing profiles and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to assess changes in the microbial communities in electrolytic and control mesocosms fig 8 at time 0 microbial communities in the electrolytic mesocosm were distinct from those in the control mesocosm fig 8 triangles this finding is not surprising taking into account the substantial heterogeneity of the sediment samples as also confirmed by previously described oil hydrocarbon analyses however within the distinct clusters there was high similarity between sediment communities at all locations i e situated close to the anode e1 or further from the anode e5 and also between replicate samples 60 80 similarity fig 8 interestingly microbial community compositions converged at t1 i e day 77 in electrolytic e5 and control c1 fig 8 with a high relative abundance of known aerobic hydrocarbon degraders alcanivorax and marinobacter in both systems fig 9 a and b there were successional changes in the microbial communities over time with marked differences between t1 and t2 electrolytic and control mesocosms furthermore at t2 i e day 135 there appeared to be a zone of influence surrounding the anode as shown by distinct differences in the microbial communities with increasing distance from the anode in the electrified system fig 8 circles the five most abundant phyla in the electrolytic mesocosms were gammaproteobacteria 56 1 8 3 alphaproteobacteria 10 5 1 4 bacteroidetes 12 9 3 8 firmicutes 7 6 4 9 and deltaproteobacteria 3 3 1 1 fig s5 generally the same phyla were detected in the electrolytic and control mesocosms however there were differences in the relative abundance of the different phyla with a marked increase in deltaproteobacteria at c5 after 135 days fig s5 which coincided with a decrease in redox and the establishment of anoxic conditions in the control mesocosm fig 3 following a more detailed analysis of the microbial communities an increasing relative abundance of anaerobic thermophilic spore forming microbes within class clostridia were detected over time in the microbial communities surrounding the anode e g thermovenabulum desulfotomaculum sporotomaculum e1 fig 9c compared to communities observed in the control mesocosm and sites situated further from the anode c1 e3 e5 at t0 t1 t2 0 0005 0 0002 rel abundance sulfate reducing desulfotomaculum spp have previously been isolated from oil fields and are implicated in oil biodegradation guan et al 2013 lan et al 2011 leu et al 1998 liu et al 2008 rosnes et al 1991 as far as the card fish detection and quantification of the alkb gene is concerned experimental data revealed a remarkable time dependent increase in the concentration of alcanivorax borkumensis carrying the alkb gene in the electrolytic mesocosm at e1 and though to a lesser extent also at e5 hence confirming the beneficial role of electrolysis in the stimulation of aerobic hydrocarbonoclastic communities fig 10 in the control experiment a small increase was noticed only at c5 taken as a whole microbiological data provided an additional line of evidence to previously mentioned biosensors data of the stimulatory effect of electrolysis on biodegradation of low molecular weight alkanes 3 5 1 long term durability of electrode materials at the end of the 230 day experimental period the electrodes were removed from the electrolytic mesocosm and visually examined in order to assess their structural integrity apparently the integrity of the ti mesh anode was fully preserved fig 11 whereas the stainless steel cathode appeared to be highly deteriorated with evident pitting corrosion this finding has important economic implications particularly in consideration of the fact that the cost of used anode material approx 1000 m2 is orders of magnitude higher than that of the stainless steel cathode clearly further studies also involving detailed microscopic and electrochemical analyses would be warranted to more precisely assess the impact of aging of electrodes on their bio electrochemical performance 4 conclusions the main results of this mesocosm scale electrobioremediation study can be summarized as follows electrobioremediation proved to be a sustainable technology to remove hydrocarbons particularly pahs from contaminated sediments being characterized by a low energy footprint and a negligible need of maintenance electrobioremediation increased the orp of the sediment via oxygen generation even at distance of 60 cm from the edge of the anode despite the low applied current density of around 10 a m2 and resulting electric power consumption of 2 25 w consistent with electrolytic oxygen generation electrobioremediation resulted in a remarkable increase in the concentration of alcanivorax borkumensis cells i e a known aerobic hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium carrying the alkb gene and in the development of specialized microbial communities as determined by ngs analysis both electroosmosis and biodegradation though to this latter to a lesser extent contributed to the removal of contaminants from the sediment with their relative contribution being highly dependent on the nature of contaminants further work is warranted to identify optimal operational strategies of the electrobioremediation system which allow to synergistically exploit the contribution electrokinetic and biodegradation processes to the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated sites since these two mechanisms appear to be a complex function of a high number of variables including type and levels of contaminants activity of naturally occurring microbial

18868,marine sediments represent an important sink of harmful petroleum hydrocarbons after an accidental oil spill electrobioremediation techniques which combine electrokinetic transport and biodegradation processes represent an emerging technological platform for a sustainable remediation of contaminated sediments here we describe the results of a long term mesocosm scale electrobioremediation experiment for the treatment of marine sediments contaminated by crude oil a dimensionally stable anode and a stainless steel mesh cathode were employed to drive seawater electrolysis at a fixed current density of 11 a m2 this approach allowed establishing conditions conducive to contaminants biodegradation as confirmed by the enrichment of alcanivorax borkumensis cells harboring the alkb gene and other aerobic hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria oil chemistry analyses indicated that aromatic hydrocarbons were primarily removed from the sediment via electroosmosis and

sediments represent an important sink of harmful petroleum hydrocarbons ph after an accidental oil spill gong et al 2014 a number of different chemical physical and microbiological processes contribute to the sinking of ph from the water column down to the seafloor including weathering adsorption onto sinking particulate matter e g marine snow and the addition of chemical dispersants daly et al 2016 passow et al 2017 romero et al 2017 stout and german 2018 recent studies have pointed out that the fraction of spilled hydrocarbons which ultimately reaches the seafloor may be extremely relevant up to 14 on a mass basis as in the case of the deepwater horizon dwh spill chanton et al 2015 valentine et al 2014 upon sedimentation ph penetrate the upper layers of the sediment whereby they can persist for years or even decades acting as a long lasting contamination source to natural ecosystems the long term persistence of hydrocarbons buried within marine sediments is typically due to the lack of molecular oxygen indeed although extensively documented the anaerobic biodegradation of ph typically proceeds at remarkably lower rates compared to its aerobic counterpart boopathy 2017 da cruz et al 2011 mapelli et al 2017 salminen et al 2004 depending on site conditions certain oil components such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah also tend to strongly bind onto hydrophobic sedimentary materials particularly when they are fine grained and constituted by clay minerals with this process markedly reducing their bioavailability and in turn reduced their biodegradability kronenberg et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 furthermore in some cases ph biodegradation in marine sediments may also be hampered by the lack of macro and micronutrients and or the lack of naturally occurring hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms atlas et al 1972 singh et al 2014 over the years different strategies have been proposed with varying degrees of success to overcome environmental and microbiological factors rate limiting ph biodegradation in contaminated marine sediments as an example addition of fertilizers and or oxygen releasing compounds e g calcium peroxide based chemicals have been considered to address nutrient and oxygen limitation issues respectively boufadel et al 1999 mosmeri et al 2018 wu et al 2018 however difficulties in delivering the amendments into the sediments as well as their low yield of utilization by ph degrading microorganisms due to the rapid consumption scavenging by side biotic and abiotic reactions make these remediation approaches both highly expensive and scarcely effective furthermore the ever increasing attention towards environmental sustainability is now catalyzing the interest towards novel bio remediation technologies which involve minimal use of chemicals and external energy and have accordingly low environmental impact in this context electrobioremediation technologies have recently attracted considerable attention particularly following the discovery of an ever increasing number of microorganisms capable to degrade environmental contaminants including ph using electrodes as virtually inexhaustible terminal electron acceptors in their metabolism aulenta et al 2009 cruz viggi et al 2015 daghio et al 2018 2016 2016 domínguez garay et al 2018 li et al 2015 mao et al 2016 modin and aulenta 2017 rakoczy et al 2013 rodrigo quejigo et al 2016 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 furthermore bioelectrochemical system have also proved as an effective mean to manipulate the redox potential of a contaminated matrix and thereby establishing in situ conditions that are conducive to contaminants biodegradation barba et al 2018 yan et al 2015 yan and reible 2015 2012 as an example in a previous microcosm study dimensionally stable anodes dsa buried within a contaminated sediment where successfully employed to fine tune oxygen generation within the sediment via low voltage i e 2 v seawater electrolysis and by so doing accelerating up to 3 times relative to non electrified controls the biodegradation of crude oil hydrocarbons bellagamba et al 2017 further to their role as direct or indirect via oxygen generation electron acceptors electrodes can also be exploited to enhance ph bioavailability indeed application of low voltage direct electric currents triggers electrokinetic transport phenomena such as electroosmosis electromigration and electrophoresis acar et al 1995 acar and alshawabkeh 1993 in the case of non ionic contaminants such as ph electroosmosis is the principal transport mechanism kuppusamy et al 2017 lim and lau 2016 luo et al 2005 electroosmosis or electroosmotic flow is the movement of pore water within the soil sediment from the anode to the cathode under the influence of an electrical potential importantly the electroosmotic flow is directly proportional to the applied electrical gradient v cm but it is virtually independent of the soil sediment porosity and hydraulic conductivity thereby making this remediation approach ideally suited for the removal of non ionic contaminants from low permeability soils and sediments the principles of electrokinetics and electrokinetic remediation have been reviewed in several previous studies acar et al 1995 acar and alshawabkeh 1993 lim et al 2014 here we examined the viability of an integrated remediation approach exploiting the synergistic effect of electrokinetic transport and bioremediation for the treatment of marine sediments contaminated by crude oil for the first time the study was carried out in a highly representative environmental setting based on the use of large scale mesocosm facilities and involved the application of a highly comprehensive suite of chemical microbiological and electrochemical tools and analytical techniques to assess the overall viability and sustainability of the proposed approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operational conditions the hereafter described mesocosm experiments were setup and conducted at the messina site of iamc cnr located on the seaside of messina harbor italy the mesocosms consisted of 2 perspex tanks length 100 cm depth 30 cm height 40 cm one equipped with electrodes electrolytic mesocosm and one without electrodes control fig 1 each tank was filled with approximately 130 kg of marine sediments that were artificially contaminated in the laboratory with danish underground consortium duc light crude oil to a final concentration of approximately 10 g kg the main organic components of the oil were paraffins 12 7 wt wt napthenes 14 6 wt wt and aromatics 4 8 wt wt the two tanks were positioned within a larger tank 500 150 50 cm that was kept under a continuous flow of seawater taken directly from the messina harbor at a flow rate of approximately 510 l h prior to be introduced within the tank the seawater was filtered through a 200 μm nylon mesh to remove large metazoans and other suspended materials electrodes employed in the electrolytic mesocosm were a rectangular titanium mesh anode coated with ru ir oxides magneto special anodes the netherlands and a stainless steel 304 mesh cathode alpha aesar usa the projected area of the cathode and the anode was approximately 0 045 m2 the anode was positioned close to the bottom of the tank whereas the cathode was placed in the overlying water outside the sediment fig 1 the electrodes were connected to a power source manson nsp 2050 manson engineering industrial hong kong using ti wires the spacing between the anode and cathode was approximately 30 cm upon setup the electrolytic systems were maintained for approximately 2 weeks at open circuit i e the electrodes kept disconnected until the establishment of anoxic conditions within the sediment thereafter the electrodes were connected to the power source and after an initial start up period of 14 days aimed at verifying the electrochemical functionality of the system as a whole during which a fixed voltage difference of 2 5 v was applied between the electrodes a fixed current of 500 ma was continuously applied to the circuit assuming a 100 faradaic efficiency for seawater electrolysis with oxygen evolution at the anode and hydrogen evolution at the cathode being the only reactions taking place at the electrodes this applied current would theoretically correspond to an oxygen generation rate of approximately 4 g per day the electrolytic and the control mesocosms were monitored for a period of approximately 230 days during which a number of analytical electrochemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed notably since one of the main objectives of the experiment was to assess the radius of influence of the electrobioremediation system the 2 mesocosms were sampled in different positions at increasing distance from the electrodes with each position being identified with a code e1 e3 e5 and c1 c3 c5 for the electrolytic and the control mesocosm respectively fig 2 at each sampling time sediment samples each of approximately 50 g were removed from the mesocosms at the different sampling positions using a stainless steel corer and were analyzed for i oil hydrocarbons by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and by ad hoc developed biosensors a functional gene alkb involved in aerobic hydrocarbons biodegradation by

e electric current and voltage difference between electrodes were taken directly from the power source manson nsp 2050 manson engineering industrial hong kong in correspondence to each sampling time the redox potential of the sediment was measured by inserting electrodes directly within the sediment at a depth of approximately 15 cm from the surface a further detailed description of individual analytical and microbiological methods is included in the following paragraphs 2 2 analysis of aromatic and aliphatic oil hydrocarbons by gc ms and changes in diagnostic ratios 2 2 1 sample

2 gc ms analysis the extracts were analyzed using an agilent 5975c inert xl msd with electron ionization operating in selected ion monitoring sim mode as previously described gallotta and christensen 2012 in brief the gc was equipped with a hp 5 capillary column 60 m lenght 0 25 mm i d 0 25 μm film thickness capillary column with helium being used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 1 ml s aliquots of 1 μl were injected in splitless mode with injection temperature of 300 c the column temperature programme was as follows initial temperature 40 c held for 2 min 25 c min to 100 c then followed by

alcanivorax borkumensis sk2 pksb1 which responds to n alkanes having between 6 and 10 carbon atoms sevilla et al 2015 a borkumensis sk2 pksp450 3 3 which responds to pristane but not to n alkanes sevilla et al 2017 pseudomonas putida kt2440 pkst 1 which allows detecting benzene toluene and xylene hernández sánchez et al 2016 and novosphingobium sp hr1a pksr 1 a strain that responds to the polycyclic aromatic compounds biphenyl naphthalene phenanthrene and 2 methylnaphthalene segura et al 2017 in all cases the strains contained a plasmid in which the gene coding for the green fluorescent protein gfp is transcribed from a suitable promoter whose expression is induced in the presence of specific hydrocarbon compounds induction is achieved by means of a specific regulatory protein that senses the presence of a given hydrocarbon and responds by activating the corresponding promoter the amount of gfp produced can be easily monitored measuring the fluorescence emitted by the cells see below a borkumensis strains were cultured in onr7a artificial seawater medium containing 1 w v pyruvate as the carbon source dyksterhouse et al 1995 while p putida and novosphingobium were cultured in mineral salts m9 medium abril et al 1989 amended with 5 mm glucose as the carbon source antibiotics were added to assure the stable maintenance of the reporter plasmids 50 μg ml streptomycin for a borkumensis and p putida strains and 30 μg ml gentamycin for novosphingobium assays were performed adapting previously described protocols hernández sánchez et al 2016 sevilla et al 2015 briefly for the detection of n alkanes or pristane cultures of the a borkumensis reporter strains were cultivated to stationary phase in onr7a pyruvate at 30 c and cells were centrifuged and re suspended in fresh medium after adjusting the turbidity of the culture to 0 1 a600 nm with fresh medium 4 ml of the cell suspension were loaded into 4 5 ml crew cap glass vials containing 0 05 g of the sediment sample or no sample as control the vials were closed to avoid evaporation of the hydrocarbons and incubated at 30 c with agitation for 4 24 h as specified vials containing the sediment samples but lacking cells were used as blanks to measure the fluorescence amount of gfp of the samples 200 μl in triplicate were taken from the vials and dispensed onto a black clear bottomed microtiter plate the fluorescence excitation 480 nm emission 520 nm and absorbance 600 nm were recorded simultaneously in a tecan ch reader for microtiter plates equipped with a fluorescence detector the fluorescence signal was normalized by the number of cells present which was calculated from the turbidity of the culture a600 after detracting the turbidity of the sample with no cells the fluorescence induction ratio was obtained by dividing the normalized fluorescence of sediment containing samples by that of control samples containing no sediment three biological replicates were performed when using the p putida or novosphingobium reporter strains to detect aromatic compounds cells were grown overnight on m9 glucose medium and then diluted in 10 ml of the same fresh medium to

addition of sediment sample flasks were tightly closed and incubated at 30 c for 7 5 h with agitation two ml of the cultures were taken centrifuged 2000 rpm to eliminate sediments and the turbidity a600 nm of supernatants was measured and adjusted to 0 1 fluorescence excitation 485 nm emission 510 nm was then measured in a lps 220b fluorometer photon technology international fluorescence values are given as fluorescence induction ratio fluorescence emitted in presence of sediment divided by the fluorescence emitted by the control culture without sediment three independent replicates were performed 2 4 analysis of alkb gene by card fish sediment samples corresponding to 2 5 15 g of wet sediment collected from each mesocosm were immediately fixed with formaldehyde 2 for 3 h at 4 c cells

and gorley 2015 3 results 3 1 electrochemical measurements fig 3a shows the time profiles of electric current and cell voltage throughout the whole experimental period remarkably during steady state operation of the electrolytic mesocosm at a fixed current i of 500 ma corresponding to a current density of 11 a m2 the cell voltage v remained stably below 4 5 v hence pointing to a low electrical resistance of the system as a whole 10 ω which was most likely ensured by the high electric conductivity of the seawater accordingly under steady state conditions electric power consumption w i x v was lower than 2 25 w the application of a fixed current of 500 ma markedly affected the redox potential orp of the sediment consistently with the occurrence of electrolytic oxygen generation at the anode fig 3 b in the electrolytic mesocosm at the start of the experiment the orp was around 0 v vs ag agcl then it gradually increased at all sampling points during the initial 120 days of operation before stabilizing or slightly decreasing during the remainder of the test specifically at e1 the sediment redox potential reached a peak of 320 mv after 77 days of operation i e t1 whereas at e3 i e positioned 30 cm apart from e1 and at e5 positioned 60 cm apart from e1 the redox potential reached lower peak values of 310 v and 220 v respectively only after 135 days of operation from day 120 onward a slow decrease in the redox potential was observed at all sampling points at the end of the study however the redox potential remained between 250 mv at e1 and e3 and 150 mv at e5 a strikingly different trend was observed in the control mesocosm whereby after a period of around 120 days during which the redox potential remained nearly stable at around 0 v it gradually decreased down to 200 mv by the end of the study suggesting the establishment of anoxic conditions most likely driven by the metabolic activity of naturally occurring sulfate reducing microorganisms collectively these results provide a clear indication that application of low voltage direct current prompting seawater electrolysis allows increasing the redox potential of the sediment thereby creating conditions that are potentially conducive for the aerobic biodegradation of oil hydrocarbons most importantly the effect of electrolysis was apparent even at a distance of over 45 cm from the edge of the anode and also in the presence of a continuous flow of seawater over the surface of the sediment 3 2 gc ms analysis of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons as far as the concentration of main oil components is concerned fig 4 shows the hopane normalized concentration of c0 c4 alkylated pahs naphthalenes fluorenes dibenzothiophenes pyrenes and chrysenes in the electrolytic mesocosm at the different sampling times t1 t2 t3 and locations e1 e3 e5 relative to the individual t0 samples measured in although experimental data appeared to be affected by a substantial variability most likely caused by the intrinsic heterogeneity of the sediment material and uneven distribution contaminants a time dependent decrease in the content of nearly all pahs and methylated pahs was apparent in sediment samples taken just over the anode i e sampling point e1 with removal efficiencies ranging from 80 to 100 at the last sampling time substantial though incomplete removal of pahs was also observed in e3 located approximately 15 cm apart from the edge of the anode by contrast negligible removal of pahs was observed in samples taken at e5 with concentrations measured at the last sampling time i e t3 in some cases even exceeding those detected at time zero i e t0 fig 4 as far as the control experiment is concerned negligible removal of pahs was observed over time at all sampling locations fig 5 with concentrations measured at the end of the study being typically equal or higher than those detected at t0 this latter finding provides a straightforward indication that the observed removal of pahs in the electrolytic mesocosm was driven by the application of electric current as far as the aliphatic hydrocarbons nc13 to nc30 are concerned in the electrolytic mesocosm a time dependent decrease in their concentrations relative to t0 was observed almost exclusively at e1 whereas negligible changes were detected at further distance from the electrode i e at e3 and e5 fig s1 unexpectedly the extent of removal of individual aliphatic hydrocarbons at e1 apparently increased with the length of the carbon chain eventually reaching 45 in the case of nc30 fig s1 in agreement with what observed in the case of pahs negligible removal of aliphatic hydrocarbons irrespective of the chain length was observed at all sampling locations in the control mesocosm fig s2 hence providing an additional line of evidence that the observed removal of hydrocarbons was triggered by the applied electric current 3 3 analysis of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with biosensors sediment samples from the electrolytic and the control mesocosms were also analyzed for target aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons by means of ad hoc developed biosensors besides permitting the quantification of low molecular weight compounds that could not be analyzed via gc ms i e nc6 to nc10 aliphatic hydrocarbons biosensors also allowed an integral assessment of the progress of the bioremediation process from the quantification of lumped parameters e g total pahs fig 6 a shows the normalized response of the biosensors for aliphatic compounds to samples taken from the electrolytic and the control mesocosms at different times t0 t1 t2 t3 the biosensor targeting nc6 nc10 indicated no apparent removal of hydrocarbons in the control mesocosm with concentrations measured at the last sampling time t3 being very similar or even higher than those measured at t0 a different situation was observed in the electrolytic mesocosm with a consistent disappearance of contaminants being detected over time in the e1 sample and though less clearly also in sample e3 by contrast negligible removal of nc6 nc10 was observed in e5 as far as the biosensor for pristane is concerned fig 6b no apparent removal was noticed both in the electrolytic and in the control mesocosm in agreement with gc ms data data not shown fig 7 reports the results of the biosensors for aromatic hydrocarbons also in this case in agreement with the results of oil chemistry obtained via gc ms analysis the biosensor detected a substantial time dependent removal of aromatic hydrocarbons i e btx and pah in the electrolytic mesocosm only and specifically in correspondence of e1 whereas lower to no removal was detected at e3 and e5 and in the control experiment 3 4 diagnostic ratios and pahs plots in order to gain a deeper understanding of the prevalent oil hydrocarbons removal mechanisms i e removal via electroosmosis vs biodegradation a number of key diagnostic ratios were calculated from gc ms oil chemistry analyses for each sample and were normalized to the same ratio as measured in the original oil conventionally it is assumed that due to the different intrinsic biodegradability of the different oil components the progress of biodegradation would result in a gradual decrease of these specific ratios as an example pristane pr and phytane ph are known to degrade at a slower rate compared to nc17 and nc18 therefore it is expected that upon biodegradation the specific ratios nc17 pr and nc18 ph would diminish over time same considerations apply for aromatic compounds by contrast removal mechanisms not linked to biodegradation such as electroosmosis driven mass transport would proceed at comparable rates for compounds having similar structures such as nc17 and pr and therefore would not result in a net decrease of the corresponding diagnostic ratio a detailed description of all diagnostic ratios herein calculated can be found elsewhere scheibye et al 2017 for e1 samples due to the extensive removal of most hydrocarbons some diagnostic ratio became undetectable at the last sampling time t3 fig s3 for some others such as nc17 pr and 2mn 1 mn a little decrease 10 was observed over the course of the experiment fig s3 in the case of e3 and e5 samples in which the extent of hydrocarbons removal was substantially lower than in e1 due to the greater distance from the anode all diagnostic ratios could be calculated and none displayed a substantial time dependent reduction same considerations also apply to the control experiment whereby all diagnostic ratios remained virtually unchanged over time taken as a whole these findings suggest that under the experimental conditions applied in this study in the electrolytic mesocosm removal of pah and nc13 nc30 was mainly due to electroosmosis rather than to biodegradation according to the helmholtz smoluchowsky equation alshawabkeh et al 1999 cameselle and reddy 2012 the electroosmotic flow from the anode to the overlying cathode was estimated to be around 250 ml d assuming a coefficient of electroosmotic conductivity of 5 10 9 m2 v s taking into account that the herein used sediment was freshly contaminated and therefore pah were only loosely bound to the sediment material it is plausible that in the presence of such a relatively high electroosmotic flow the electrokinetic transport proceeded at substantially higher rates compared to aerobic biodegradation possibly a different scenario could be expected in the case of historically contaminated sediments and or in the presence of a more active indigenous hydrocarbonoclastic microbial community by contrast with specific reference to lower mw alkanes biosensor analyses indicated a remarkable reduction in their concentration levels which was not mirrored by a corresponding reduction in the concentration level of pristane therefore under the assumption that the physico chemical behavior of nc6 to nc10 is somewhat similar to that of pristane it seems likely that biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism for such oil components although further lines of evidence are warranted the finding that electroosmosis was less effective in removing aliphatics with respect to pahs is a somewhat unexpected finding that however could be related to their lower affinity for water i e higher octanol water partition coefficient being less prone to be removed via electroosmosis these contaminants remained within the tanks for longer period of times under such conditions aerobic biodegradation apparently assumed a more relevant role especially in the case of low molecular weight alkanes i e nc6 to nc10 3 5 microbiological analyses next generation sequencing and card fish detection of alkb gene carrying cells sediment samples taken at different times t0 to t2 and positions e1 to e5 and c1 to c5 from the electrolytic and control mesocosms were also analyzed by next generation sequencing for identifying the dynamics of the main microbial community members as well as their spatial distribution figs 8 and 9 and s5 bray curtis similarities were calculated from 16s rrna gene sequencing profiles and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to assess changes in the microbial communities in electrolytic and control mesocosms fig 8 at time 0 microbial communities in the electrolytic mesocosm were distinct from those in the control mesocosm fig 8 triangles this finding is not surprising taking into account the substantial heterogeneity of the sediment samples as also confirmed by previously described oil hydrocarbon analyses however within the distinct clusters there was high similarity between sediment communities at all locations i e situated close to the anode e1 or further from the anode e5 and also between replicate samples 60 80 similarity fig 8 interestingly microbial community compositions converged at t1 i e day 77 in electrolytic e5 and control c1 fig 8 with a high relative abundance of known aerobic hydrocarbon degraders alcanivorax and marinobacter in both systems fig 9 a and b there were successional changes in the microbial communities over time with marked differences between t1 and t2 electrolytic and control mesocosms furthermore at t2 i e day 135 there appeared to be a zone of influence surrounding the anode as shown by distinct differences in the microbial communities with increasing distance from the anode in the electrified system fig 8 circles the five most abundant phyla in the electrolytic mesocosms were gammaproteobacteria 56 1 8 3 alphaproteobacteria 10 5 1 4 bacteroidetes 12 9 3 8 firmicutes 7 6 4 9 and deltaproteobacteria 3 3 1 1 fig s5 generally the same phyla were detected in the electrolytic and control mesocosms however there were differences in the relative abundance of the different phyla with a marked increase in deltaproteobacteria at c5 after 135 days fig s5 which coincided with a decrease in redox and the establishment of anoxic conditions in the control mesocosm fig 3 following a more detailed analysis of the microbial communities an increasing relative abundance of anaerobic thermophilic spore forming microbes within class clostridia were detected over time in the microbial communities surrounding the anode e g thermovenabulum desulfotomaculum sporotomaculum e1 fig 9c compared to communities observed in the control mesocosm and sites situated further from the anode c1 e3 e5 at t0 t1 t2 0 0005 0 0002 rel abundance sulfate reducing desulfotomaculum spp have previously been isolated from oil fields and are implicated in oil biodegradation guan et al 2013 lan et al 2011 leu et al 1998 liu et al 2008 rosnes et al 1991 as far as the card fish detection and quantification of the alkb gene is concerned experimental data revealed a remarkable time dependent increase in the concentration of alcanivorax borkumensis carrying the alkb gene in the electrolytic mesocosm at e1 and though to a lesser extent also at e5 hence confirming the beneficial role of electrolysis in the stimulation of aerobic hydrocarbonoclastic communities fig 10 in the control experiment a small increase was noticed only at c5 taken as a whole microbiological data provided an additional line of evidence to previously mentioned biosensors data of the stimulatory effect of electrolysis on biodegradation of low molecular weight alkanes 3 5 1 long term durability of electrode materials at the end of the 230 day experimental period the electrodes were removed from the electrolytic mesocosm and visually examined in order to assess their structural integrity apparently the integrity of the ti mesh anode was fully preserved fig 11 whereas the stainless steel cathode appeared to be highly deteriorated with evident pitting corrosion this finding has important economic implications particularly in consideration of the fact that the cost of used anode material approx 1000 m2 is orders of magnitude higher than that of the stainless steel cathode clearly further studies also involving detailed microscopic and electrochemical analyses would be warranted to more precisely assess the impact of aging of electrodes on their bio electrochemical performance 4 conclusions the main results of this mesocosm scale electrobioremediation study can be summarized as follows electrobioremediation proved to be a sustainable technology to remove hydrocarbons particularly pahs from contaminated sediments being characterized by a low energy footprint and a negligible need of maintenance electrobioremediation increased the orp of the sediment via oxygen generation even at distance of 60 cm from the edge of the anode despite the low applied current density of around 10 a m2 and resulting electric power consumption of 2 25 w consistent with electrolytic oxygen generation electrobioremediation resulted in a remarkable increase in the concentration of alcanivorax borkumensis cells i e a known aerobic hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium carrying the alkb gene and in the development of specialized microbial communities as determined by ngs analysis both electroosmosis and biodegradation though to this latter to a lesser extent contributed to the removal of contaminants from the sediment with their relative contribution being highly dependent on the nature of contaminants further work is warranted to identify optimal operational strategies of the electrobioremediation system which allow to synergistically exploit the contribution electrokinetic and biodegradation processes to the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated sites since these two mechanisms appear to be a complex function of a high number of variables including type and levels of contaminants activity of naturally occurring microbial

18869,this study aimed to elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms of ps activation by carbon nanotubes cnts singlet oxygen generation 1o2 and direct cnts mediated electron transfer were hypothesized to be two major pathways of the oxidation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp by ps in the presence of both unmodified and modified cnts for the first time roles of cnt active sites responsible for ps activation were determined using cnt derivatization and structural characterization by selectively deactivating the carbonyl hydroxyl or carboxylic groups on cnts surface and linear sweep voltammetry lsv analysis co groups were determined to be the main active sites contributing to the direct electron transfer oxidation while singlet oxygen was generated at cnts defects subsequent uv irradiation was shown to cause the recovery of surface defects with id ig of cnts increasing by 21 this resulted in the regeneration of the performance for the coupled system and allowed for multi cycle activation of ps by cnts these results suggest that cnts ps system combined with regeneration based on uv irradiation can be used as an effective alternative process for continuous degradation of recalcitrant

metal based catalysts carbon feng et al 2015 sun et al 2016 boron bu et al 2017 and sulfur based catalysts guo et al 2017b for heterogeneous ps activation have attracted more attention due to their ecologically friendly properties carbon nanomaterials such as reduced graphene oxide rgo peng et al 2013 sun et al 2012 2013 carbon nanotubes cnts cheng et al 2016 2017 lee et al 2015 carbon nanofibers cnfs lin et al 2017 and nanodiamond duan et al 2016a lee et al 2016 have been shown to be effective in ps activation due to their high surface area large pore volume abundant oxygen containing functional groups and high electric conductivity however in contrast with the transition metals that have well defined valence states the nature of ps activation by carbon nanomaterials with their non stoichiometric properties and the intricate network structure remains to be ascertained in more detail previous studies have demonstrated that most types of the ps activation produce sulfate or and hydroxide radicals that degrade contaminants however recent research has also shown the existence of nonradical oxidation pathways effected via the activation of persulfate by carbon nanomaterials cheng et al 2016 guan et al 2017a 2017b lee et al 2015 tang et al demonstrated that n doped reduced graphene oxide could activate persulfate in the removal of phenolics and surface bound sulfate radicals were the dominant reactive oxygen species ros in this system wang et al 2015 still other studies showed that both free and surface attached sulfate radicals were generated in ps reactions activated by graphene carbon nanotubes or annealed nanodiamond duan et al 2015 2016b these results suggest that persulfate may be bound onto the cnt surface via outer sphere interaction with the conjugated π electron system leading to the formation metastable complexes that are engaged in the removal of organic pollutants guan et al 2017a 2017b lee et al 2015 an alternative hypothesis developed by cheng et al suggested the importance of the generation of nonradical singlet oxygen 1o2 that causes rapid and selective oxidation of electron rich substances cheng et al 2017 kim et al attributed the contaminant oxidation to the electron transport from the target pollutant to ps in presence of graphitized nanodiamonds in this case cnts played the role of a charge transfer mediator lee et al 2016 despite the development of the hypotheses outlined above the nature of mechanisms affecting the activation of ps by carbon nanomaterials remains unclear carbonyl groups located on cnts grain boundaries have been reported to constitute the main moiety of the active sites engaged in the generation of sulfate radicals sun et al 2014 and singlet oxygen cheng et al 2017 in the cnts ps systems similarly wang et al attributed the activation of peroxide to the presence of an electron rich edge and ketonic groups located at the grain boundaries of carbon nanomaterials indrawirawan et al 2015 liu et al 2014 peng et al 2013 these defects on carbon surfaces were concluded to react readily with peroxides peroxymonosulfate duan et al 2016c the activating configurations typical for cnts include sp2 hybridized carbon located in hexagonal networks constituting a graphene sheet together with functional groups such as co oh and cooh sun et al 2014 ps activation based on carbon nanotubes has been widely assumed to arise from sp2 covalent carbon structural defects and oxygen containing functional groups that enable the cycling of electrons from the target compounds to persulfate duan et al 2015 wang et al 2016 while these points have been largely agreed upon contributions of different types of active sites engaged in carbon based materials notably cnts with various properties remain to be ascertained this work is the first study which employed quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements to determine contributions of alternative oxidation pathways e g via singlet oxygen generation and direct cnts mediated electron transfer from the organic contaminant to persulfate in the degradation of the typical environmental recalcitrant

halophenolic dbps formed as a result of chlorine based disinfection gong et al 2017 guan et al 2017b lee et al 2016 zhu and zhang 2016 by employing selective modification processes a number of derivatized cnts were produced and the roles of the active sites responsible for ps non radical activation by these materials were elucidated based on the characterization of the engaged functional groups and structural defects contributions of the dissimilar surface groups to ps activation pathway characteristic for cnts were thoroughly investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

materials described above all tests were conducted at initial ph 6 5 in 25 c water bath under magnetic stirring in a typical experiment a 200 ml reaction suspension was prepared with the ps 2 4 dcp molar ratio at 1 1 0 05 mm for ps or 2 4 dcp the reaction was initiated by addition of cnts 0 1 g l at predetermined time intervals samples were withdrawn from the reactor immediately filtered through

oxygen and the uv light information are introduced in the si section subsection s2 triplicate experiments were conducted and the data with standard deviations were presented linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurements were conducted to measure electron transfer reactions in the examined systems more detailed information about these and other relevant experiments is presented in the si subsection s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 quenching performance for oxidation of 2 4 dcp in the absence of cnts ps was found to have a negligible effect on 2 4 dcp removal and the adsorption on cnts also led to a largely insignificant decrease of 2 4 dcp concentration fig 1 a this confirmed the results of our previous study in which a pronounced enhancement of the removal rate was observed in ps cnts system compared to the adsorption of cnts in the absence of ps cheng et al 2017 in that study the generation of singlet oxygen 1o2 was shown to proceed via nonradical activation pathways instead of a mechanism involving the generation of radicals however contradictory conclusions have been presented in the past years concerning the involvement of 1o2 generation and or direct mediated electron transfer for activation mechanism duan et al 2015 wang et al 2016 yun et al 2018 thus to elucidate the roles of the pathways likely to be responsible for the degradation of organic contaminants in the ps cnts system it is crucial to select proper quenchers whose effects help separate contributions of the involved mechanisms furfuryl alcohol ffa is usually chosen as a convenient 1o2 quencher and as such it has been used in ps oxidations duan et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 in a recent study yun et al used ffa to identify the generation of 1o2 in pms cnts and ps cnts systems yun et al 2018 in that study a higher ps concentration 1 mm was adopted for which a limited consumption of ffa in the presence of ps only was observed by comparing the performance of the pms cnts or ps cnts systems in the degradation of a number of pollutants electron transfer was concluded to be the most plausible mechanism for these two systems however our experiments showed that when ffa was employed in the presence of a lower ps concentration 0 05 mm the ps concentration declined rapidly fig s1 this confirmed the occurrence of a direct reaction between ps and ffa and indicated that ffa should not be used for probing reactions involving 1o2 in the presence of low ps concentrations in contrast with ffa practically no discernible consumption was observed for nan3 or tmp in the presence of ps while both these species exhibited an excellent reactivity towards 1o2 moan and wold 1979 song et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 consequently impacts of nan3 and tmp used as adequate quenchers on 2 4 dcp oxidation and ps decomposition were investigated further fig 1a shows that the presence of both of these species resulted in an inhibition of 2 4 dcp removal in the ps cnts system this inhibition was enhanced when higher concentrations of the scavengers were used figs s2a and b however different trends results were observed in the effects of nan3 and tmp on ps decomposition fig 1b this figure shows that ps consumption was enhanced by tmp while a weaker and somewhat complex effect was associated with nan3 the difference in the effects of these species on ps consumption could be attributed to the specific aspects of the reactivity of tmp and nan3 when tmp is introduced in the system its reactivity towards 1o2 led to an increased consumption of ps fig 1b left while the presence of 2 4 dcp results in further enhancement of ps decomposition fig 1b right in contrast with tmp which can only be oxidized by 1o2 nan3 can act as both a quencher of 1o2 formed as a result of ps decomposition and an electron acceptor that interferes with the electron transfer from 2 4 dcp to ps sanguanmith et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 this causes a pronounced inhibition of ps decomposition that results in slower decomposition for ps and 2 4 dcp in the presence of n3 ion fig 1a and b guan et al 2017b sanguanmith et al 2018 tang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 based on the differences of the effects induced by tmp and nan3 2 4 dcp removal by ps cnts system was concluded to be driven by both the generation of singlet oxygen and oxidation involving the electron transfer from 2 4 dcp to ps however the further mechanistic details concerning the intrinsic source of ros in this system remain to be ascertained as discussed in the sections that follow the stability of ph during the reaction was monitored as well fig s3 virtually no change of ph was observed in the single ps system while ph declined gradually in the coupled ps cnts system suggesting the hydroxide ions in solution were consumed it was also notable that the presence of an electron donor 2 4 dcp caused the ph to decrease much more rapidly however a smaller change of ph took place in presence of nan3 which was consistent with the results of ps decomposition fig 1b right our data for phosphate buffer also indicate that ph variations during the reaction do not seem to affect our conclusions concerning the activation mechanism of the process the influence of the initial ph on the oxidation of 2 4 dcp by ps cnts was examined as well fig s4 shows that the rate of the degradation of 2 4 dcp increased with the ph the apparent rate constants were 0 137 min 1 0 179 min 1 0 306 min 1 and 0 569 min 1 for ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively demonstrating the favorable role of hydroxide ions in ps cnts coupled process epr measurements with the spin trapping reagent tmp were carried out to directly examine the generation of singlet oxygen the influence of ma ffa and nan3 on the intensity of epr signal is shown in fig 1c it demonstrates that ma barely affects the intensity of the epr spectrum showing no radicals were generated in the solutions while the addition of nan3 resulted in a significant decrease of the signal intensity due to the competitive reaction for singlet oxygen which is consistent with the results obtained above no spin trapping adducts were observed after the addition of ffa which is a result of the rapid interaction between ps and ffa furthermore the concentration of 1o2 was half quantified based on the intensity of the signal associated with the formation of tmp 1o2 adduct tmpn and was observed to increase rapidly in the first 5 min and then remained at a slower rate which conformed to the degradation of 2 4 dcp fig 1d suggesting that the oxidation by singlet oxygen was one of the responsible processes for 2 4 dcp removal 3 2 examination of the roles of cnts active sites 3 2 1 oxygen containing functional groups to probe the role of oxygen containing functional groups on the 2 4 dcp ps reactions derivatized cnts cnts ph cnts ba and cnts brpe were employed examination of the sem images of cnts and the cnts derivatives fig s5 demonstrated that the modification of cnts with ph ba and brpe did not affect their sizes and morphologies the size distributions and specific surface areas of the modified cnts were only marginally affected by the derivatization figs s6 s7 and adsorption tests also confirmed the limited adsorption quantity on the cnts prior to and after their modification was essentially the same fig s7f the raman spectra of the cnts and its derivatives showed the two characteristic bands which are the d defect band at 1326 cm 1and the g graphitic band at 1575 cm 1 fig s8 cheng et al 2010 the ratio of the intensity of d band to g band which is an estimate of the structural disorder degree and defect content was determined to be 1 110 1 169 1 106 and 1 064 for pristine cnts cnts ph cnts ba and cnts brpe respectively indicating that the used modification procedures did not have any significant influence on defects and sp2 carbon network in these cnts maciel et al 2008 the surface chemistry of the cnts and cnts derivatives was subsequently analyzed by xps fig 2 shows the changes of intensities of the bands located at 532 25 ev and 533 83 ev and assigned to the carbonyl groups and hydroxyl groups respectively compared to the o 1s xps spectra for cnts the relative intensity of the co bond for cnts ph was reduced and the same phenomenon for coh signal of cnts ba was observed although the similar intensity was obtained for cnts and cnts brpe a further determination of zeta potentials demonstrated the removal of the carboxyl groups on cnts brpe fig s9 the kinetic data in fig 3 a and b shows that a significantly lower activity was observed for cnts ph which implies the crucial role for the carbonyl groups to explore this point in more detail ft ir and xps analysis for the used pristine cnts collected after reacting with ps for 2 h were conducted as shown in fig 3c and d respectively these results show that the intensity of the signal associated with the carbonyl group on cnts was noticeably decreased in the ft ir and xps spectra after ps activation given these results the influence of quenching agents on the degradation of 2 4 dcp and the decomposition of ps in presence of cnts ph was investigated in more detail fig s10 neither 2 4 dcp oxidation nor ps decomposition was affected by the addition of methanol however the addition of tmp inhibited the removal of 2 4 dcp while ps decomposition was simultaneously enhanced given the absence of carbonyl groups on the surface of cnts ph this indicates that the generation of singlet oxygen was likely to involve activate sites other than the carbonyl groups fig s10 the same intensity of the tmpn signal was observed in the epr spectra for various cnt derivative systems fig s11 which also demonstrated that singlet oxygen formation was independent with these functional groups considering the possible effect of the hydroxyl or carboxyl groups on the activation performance of cnts functionalized cnts with higher concentrations of hydroxyl or carboxyl surface groups referred to as cnts oh or cnts cooh were used to activate ps fig s12 shows that the efficiency of 2 4 dcp degradation was virtually unchanged in the presence of such modified cnts this implies that in accordance with the kinetic results shown in fig 3a and b the activation of ps is unlikely to depend on the hydroxyl or carboxyl groups on cnt surfaces 3 2 2 effects of cnts structural defects in addition to the oxygen containing surface functional groups structural defects e g vacancies interstitials bond rotations and non hexagonal rings with zigzag or armchair edges that do not necessarily have attached functional groups can be regarded as another moiety of cnt active sites collins 2009 dresselhaus et al 2010 liu et al 2006 to probe its influence experiments with cnts that had been treated to remove surface functional groups or defects were carried out fig s13a demonstrates that annealing of cnts in ar at 1300 c for 2 h produces defect rich cnts referred as cnts d that are largely devoid of the oxygen containing functional groups thermal treatment at a higher temperature 2800 c produced defect free graphitized cnts referred to as cnts df andrews et al 2001 bom et al 2002 additional adsorption experiments showed that the annealing only marginally affected the adsorption capacity of 2 4 dcp fig s13b fig 4 a shows that cnts d had a lower activity on the degradation of 2 4 dcp compared to pristine cnts yet a significant inhibition of their effects was still observed in the presence of tmp or nan3 however much more severe inhibition of effects of n3 ion was observed in the presence of cnts df fig 4b this was interpreted to indicate that singlet oxygen was generated via the involvement of cnt structural surface defects rather than via the involvement of the oxygen containing functional groups this conclusion was confirmed by the raman data for these types of raw and used cnts fig 4c shows that the id ig values of raw cnts df were much lower than those of cnts d this was in accordance with the expected results of the treatment of cnts done to decrease the presence of structural defects in them even lower id ig values were obtained for the used cnts d and cnts df this observation further confirms the consumption of cnts defects on ps activation the epr results presented in fig 4d showed that the use of cnts d resulted in an intensity of tmpn signal that was comparable with that for pristine cnts but the much lower intensity of the tmpn signal was detected when cnts df were used this confirms that the defects on cnts surface play the dominant role for singlet oxygen formation prior studies have demonstrated that the unsaturated active carbon atoms in cnts vacancy defects promote the dissociation the oo bond of oxidants for instance o3 through a one step process that generates singlet oxygen collins 2009 liu et al 2006 a number of studies also showed that defects on the carbonaceous nanomaterials act as active sites in the formation of singlet oxygen chen and jafvert 2011 chen and zepp 2015 wang et al 2018 these observations are in accord with those of our study s conclusions concerning the involvement of cnts surface defects in ps activation 3 3 confirmation of accelerated electron transfer the results presented above demonstrate that 2 4 dcp removal is controlled by both the generation of singlet oxygen and direct electron transfer associated with the involvement of the carbonyl groups and defects on cnt surfaces since the surface defects have been shown to play a critical role in the generation of singlet oxygen it can be argued that the carbonyl groups may be engaged in electron transfer from 2 4 dcp to ps in which case cnts with their high conductance act as a bridge between the 2 4 dcp donor and ps acceptor to prove this point linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurements using an inert glassy carbon gc electrode were conducted in these measurements electrochemical ec oxidation currents were recorded in the presence of several types of cnts pristine cnts cnts d and cnts df deposited on the surface of the gc electrode the maximum oxidation lsv currents observed in these experiments at the ec potential of 1 6 v are summarized in table s2 the lowest ec current 0 02 ma was observed for the bare gc electrode as shown in fig s14 a strong increase of the ec current 0 85 ma was observed for pristine cnts deposited on the gc electrode the ec current increased further when ps alone or ps with 2 4 dcp were present ec currents 1 22 and 2 10 ma respectively compared to the largely featureless lsv curve obtained for the gc electrode modified with cnts or cnts ps a distinct oxidation peak located at ca 0 95 v was observed for cnt modified ge electrode in the presence of both ps and 2 4 dcp this demonstrated the facilitation of electron transfer by the cnts and this may account for their role in the enhancement of reaction between ps and 2 4 dcp tang et al 2018 some increases of the ec currents were observed for cnts d and cnts df but they were much smaller compared with those observed for pristine cnts for instance the ec current for cnts df was the lowest 0 16 ma among the three types of the tested cnts given that the absence of the oxygen containing functional group in cnts d while cnts df lack both these functional groups and structural defects the difference in the ec currents observed for these materials can be interpreted as an indication of the involvement of the carbonyl groups in promoting electron transfer from the 2 4 dcp donor to ps acceptor through the cnt conductive substrate given that the experimental data presented above support the notion that the structural defects and carbonyl groups are responsible for singlet oxygen generation and direct electron transfer respectively a scheme of the interactions involved in the degradation of 2 4 dcp can be proposed scheme 1 this scheme shows that tmp acts a quencher for 1o2 generated in the reaction between the cnt structural defects and ps while nan3 acts as both a 1o2 quencher and a scavenger interfering in electron transfer accelerated by the surface carbonyl groups these reactions highlight the existence and roles of the two proposed pathways that cause the degradation of 2 4 dcp 3 4 regeneration of the activity of cnts while the performance of conventional ps systems is based on the generation of radicals the ps cnts system is more selective due to the involvement of the surface carbonyl groups and defects whose abundance is critical for ps activation it can therefore be expected that the loss of cnts active sites will reduce its activation efficiency fig 5 demonstrates that in agreement with this point the extent of 2 4 dcp removal decreased by ca 70 after 5 cycles of cnt use further experiments showed that the deterioration of the activity of used cnts can be reversed by uv irradiation for instance after the 2nd cycle of cnt use the collected cnts were dried at 60 c and subjected to uv irradiation for 8 h 1 044 10 7 e l 1 s 1 15 w this resulted in a partial recovery of their activity ft ir and raman examination of the irradiated cnts fig s15 showed only minor changes of the vibrations associated with the oxygen containing functional groups but the id ig ratio of the raman bands was increased by 21 after uv irradiation fig s15b the recovery of 2 4 dcp performance induced by uv irradiation can thus be attributed to the regeneration of defects on cnts surface this is consistent with the data of previous studies showing that uv irradiation of cnts created defects in the nanotube sidewalls czech et al 2015 ma et al 2009 since uv irradiation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to activate ps via radical mechanisms a combination of cnts ps oxidation and cnts regeneration by uv irradiation could be considered as an alternative process for sustainable removal of organic contaminants via non radical mechanism guo et al 2017a zhang et al 2018 3 5 toc measurements and inorganic anions effects the degree of mineralization of the organic carbon caused by the degradation of 2 4 dcp was evaluated via toc measurements carried out in the presence of modified cnts fig s16 shows that the toc removal percentages of cnts cnts ph cnts ba cnts brpe cnts d and cnts df system within 30 min were 76 3 44 4 67 9 72 8 61 9 and 53 2 respectively this is consistent with the degradation results of 2 4 dcp discussed above the efficiency of this process may decreased due to undesired reactions with background species typical for environmental systems notably by inorganic anions to examine this point the degradation of 2 4 dcp in the presence of varying level of inorganic ions was measured results of these experiments are shown in fig s17 the removal of 2 4 dcp changed only negligibly in the presence of cl or so4 2 which was largely expected since these anions are not robust scavengers in contrast the presence of hco3 or no3 resulted in a significant inhibition of the removal of 2 4 dcp this may be ascribed to the competition between 2 4 dcp and the nitrate or carbonate anions for singlet oxygen the extent of the inhibiting effects of hco3 or no3 will be addressed in further investigation 4 conclusions this study elucidated the activation mechanism of ps using cnts whose surface chemistry was altered by selective modification processes that changed cnt properties in a controlled manner by evaluating the activation of ps interacting with the derivatized cnts we demonstrate the presence of the coexisting mechanisms that mediate singlet oxygen generation and electron transfer acceleration structural defects and surface carbonyl groups were shown to be critical for these respective mechanisms results of this study also demonstrate that cnts ps exposures combined with the regeneration of the used cnts by uv irradiation allows for innovative multi cycle activation of ps which can be considered as a new approach for a better utilization of the activator acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the national natural science

18869,this study aimed to elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms of ps activation by carbon nanotubes cnts singlet oxygen generation 1o2 and direct cnts mediated electron transfer were hypothesized to be two major pathways of the oxidation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp by ps in the presence of both unmodified and modified cnts for the first time roles of cnt active sites responsible for ps activation were determined using cnt derivatization and structural characterization by selectively deactivating the carbonyl hydroxyl or carboxylic groups on cnts surface and linear sweep voltammetry lsv analysis co groups were determined to be the main active sites contributing to the direct electron transfer oxidation while singlet oxygen was generated at cnts defects subsequent uv irradiation was shown to cause the recovery of surface defects with id ig of cnts increasing by 21 this resulted in the regeneration of the performance for the coupled system and allowed for multi cycle activation of ps by cnts these results suggest that cnts ps system combined with regeneration based on uv irradiation can be used as an effective alternative process for continuous degradation of recalcitrant

rodriguez et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 natural organic matter nom ahmad et al 2013 fang et al 2013 lu et al 2016 as well as electrochemical reactions farhat et al 2015 yuan et al 2014 compared with metal based catalysts carbon feng et al 2015 sun et al 2016 boron bu et al 2017 and sulfur based catalysts guo et al 2017b for heterogeneous ps activation have attracted more attention due to their ecologically friendly properties carbon nanomaterials such as reduced graphene oxide rgo peng et al 2013 sun et al 2012 2013 carbon nanotubes cnts cheng et al 2016 2017 lee et al 2015 carbon nanofibers cnfs lin et al 2017 and nanodiamond duan et al 2016a lee et al 2016 have been shown to be effective in ps activation due to their high surface area large pore volume abundant oxygen containing functional groups and high electric conductivity however in contrast with the transition metals that have well defined valence states the nature of ps activation by carbon nanomaterials with their non stoichiometric properties and the intricate network structure remains to be ascertained in more detail previous studies have demonstrated that most types of the ps activation produce sulfate or and hydroxide radicals that degrade contaminants however recent research has also shown the existence of nonradical oxidation pathways effected via the activation of persulfate by carbon nanomaterials cheng et al 2016 guan et al 2017a 2017b lee et al 2015 tang et al demonstrated that n doped reduced graphene oxide could activate persulfate in the removal of phenolics and surface bound sulfate radicals were the dominant reactive oxygen species ros in this system wang et al 2015 still other studies showed that both free and surface attached sulfate radicals were generated in ps reactions activated by graphene carbon nanotubes or annealed nanodiamond duan et al 2015 2016b these results suggest that persulfate may be bound onto the cnt surface via outer sphere interaction with the conjugated π electron system leading to the formation metastable complexes that are engaged in the removal of organic pollutants guan et al 2017a 2017b lee et al 2015 an alternative hypothesis developed by cheng et al suggested the importance of the generation of nonradical singlet oxygen 1o2 that causes rapid and selective oxidation of electron rich substances cheng et al 2017 kim et al attributed the contaminant oxidation to the electron transport from the target pollutant to ps in presence of graphitized nanodiamonds in this case cnts played the role of a charge transfer mediator lee et al 2016 despite the development of the hypotheses outlined above the nature of mechanisms affecting the activation of ps by carbon nanomaterials remains unclear carbonyl groups located on cnts grain boundaries have been reported to constitute the main moiety of the active sites engaged in the generation of sulfate radicals sun et al 2014 and singlet oxygen cheng et al 2017 in the cnts ps systems similarly wang et al attributed the activation of peroxide to the presence of an electron rich edge and ketonic groups located at the grain boundaries of carbon nanomaterials indrawirawan et al 2015 liu et al 2014 peng et al 2013 these defects on carbon surfaces were concluded to react readily with peroxides peroxymonosulfate duan et al 2016c the activating configurations typical for cnts include sp2 hybridized carbon located in hexagonal networks constituting a graphene sheet together with functional groups such as co oh and cooh sun et al 2014 ps activation based on carbon nanotubes has been widely assumed to arise from sp2 covalent carbon structural defects and oxygen containing functional groups that enable the cycling of electrons from the target compounds to persulfate duan et al 2015 wang et al 2016 while these points have been largely agreed upon contributions of different types of active sites engaged in carbon based materials notably cnts with various properties remain to be ascertained this work is the first study which employed quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements to determine contributions of alternative oxidation pathways e g via singlet oxygen generation and direct cnts mediated electron transfer from the organic contaminant to persulfate in the degradation of the typical environmental recalcitrant contaminant 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp was selected as a typical surface water recalcitrant pollutant whose properties represent those of halophenols found in industrial and municipal wastewaters and halophenolic dbps formed as a result of chlorine based disinfection gong et al 2017 guan et al 2017b lee et al 2016 zhu and zhang 2016 by employing selective modification processes a number of derivatized cnts were produced and the roles of the active sites responsible for ps non radical activation by these materials were elucidated based on the characterization of the engaged functional groups and structural defects contributions of the dissimilar surface groups to ps activation pathway characteristic for cnts were thoroughly investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

and pore size distributions of the examined materials were acquired with a kubo x1000 builder instrument 2 4 experimental procedures 2 4 dcp was selected to evaluate the activation performance of the materials described above all tests were conducted at initial ph 6 5 in 25 c water bath under magnetic stirring in a typical experiment a 200 ml reaction suspension was prepared with the ps 2 4 dcp molar ratio at 1 1 0 05 mm for ps or 2 4 dcp the reaction was initiated by addition of cnts 0 1 g l at predetermined time intervals samples were withdrawn from the reactor immediately filtered through 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe syringe filters and terminated by sodium sulfite before analysis sulfite ps molar ratio 20 1 the analytical methods for 2 4 dcp persulfate related ros singlet oxygen and the uv light information are introduced in the si section subsection s2 triplicate experiments were conducted and the data with standard deviations were presented linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurements were conducted to measure electron transfer reactions in the examined systems more detailed information about these and other relevant experiments is presented in the si subsection s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 quenching performance for oxidation of 2 4 dcp in the absence of cnts ps was found to have a negligible effect on 2 4 dcp removal and the adsorption on cnts also led to a largely insignificant decrease of 2 4 dcp concentration fig 1 a this confirmed the results of our previous study in which a pronounced enhancement of the removal rate was observed in ps cnts system compared to the adsorption of cnts in the absence of ps cheng et al 2017 in that study the generation of singlet oxygen 1o2 was shown to proceed via nonradical activation pathways instead of a mechanism involving the generation of radicals however contradictory conclusions have been presented in the past years concerning the involvement of 1o2 generation and or direct mediated electron transfer for activation mechanism duan et al 2015 wang et al 2016 yun et al 2018 thus to elucidate the roles of the pathways likely to be responsible for the degradation of organic contaminants in the ps cnts system it is crucial to select proper quenchers whose effects help separate contributions of the involved mechanisms furfuryl alcohol ffa is usually chosen as a convenient 1o2 quencher and as such it has been used in ps oxidations duan et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 in a recent study yun et al used ffa to identify the generation of 1o2 in pms cnts and ps cnts systems yun et al 2018 in that study a higher ps concentration 1 mm was adopted for which a limited consumption of ffa in the presence of ps only was observed by comparing the performance of the pms cnts or ps cnts systems in the degradation of a number of pollutants electron transfer was concluded to be the most plausible mechanism for these two systems however our experiments showed that when ffa was employed in the presence of a lower ps concentration 0 05 mm the ps concentration declined rapidly fig s1 this confirmed the occurrence of a direct reaction between ps and ffa and indicated that ffa should not be used for probing reactions involving 1o2 in the presence of low ps concentrations in contrast with ffa practically no discernible consumption was observed for nan3 or tmp in the presence of ps while both these species exhibited an excellent reactivity towards 1o2 moan and wold 1979 song et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 consequently impacts of nan3 and tmp used as adequate quenchers on 2 4 dcp oxidation and ps decomposition were investigated further fig 1a shows that the presence of both of these species resulted in an inhibition of 2 4 dcp removal in the ps cnts system this inhibition was enhanced when higher concentrations of the scavengers were used figs s2a and b however different trends results were observed in the effects of nan3 and tmp on ps decomposition fig 1b this figure shows that ps consumption was enhanced by tmp while a weaker and somewhat complex effect was associated with nan3 the difference in the effects of these species on ps consumption could be attributed to the specific aspects of the reactivity of tmp and nan3 when tmp is introduced in the system its reactivity towards 1o2 led to an increased consumption of ps fig 1b left while the presence of 2 4 dcp results in further enhancement of ps decomposition fig 1b right in contrast with tmp which can only be oxidized by 1o2 nan3 can act as both a quencher of 1o2 formed as a result of ps decomposition and an electron acceptor that interferes with the electron transfer from 2 4 dcp to ps sanguanmith et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 this causes a pronounced inhibition of ps decomposition that results in slower decomposition for ps and 2 4 dcp in the presence of n3 ion fig 1a and b guan et al 2017b sanguanmith et al 2018 tang et al 2018 yun et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 based on the differences of the effects induced by tmp and nan3 2 4 dcp removal by ps cnts system was concluded to be driven by both the generation of singlet oxygen and oxidation involving the electron transfer from 2 4 dcp to ps however the further mechanistic details concerning the intrinsic source of ros in this system remain to be ascertained as discussed in the sections that follow the stability of ph during the reaction was monitored as well fig s3 virtually no change of ph was observed in the single ps system while ph declined gradually in the coupled ps cnts system suggesting the hydroxide ions in solution were consumed it was also notable that the presence of an electron donor 2 4 dcp caused the ph to decrease much more rapidly however a smaller change of ph took place in presence of nan3 which was consistent with the results of ps decomposition fig 1b right our data for phosphate buffer also indicate that ph variations during the reaction do not seem to affect our conclusions concerning the activation mechanism of the process the influence of the initial ph on the oxidation of 2 4 dcp by ps cnts was examined as well fig s4 shows that the rate of the degradation of 2 4 dcp increased with the ph the apparent rate constants were 0 137 min 1 0 179 min 1 0 306 min 1 and 0 569 min 1 for ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively demonstrating the favorable role of hydroxide ions in ps cnts coupled process epr measurements with the spin trapping reagent tmp were carried out to directly examine the generation of singlet oxygen the influence of ma ffa and nan3 on the intensity of epr signal is shown in fig 1c it demonstrates that ma barely affects the intensity of the epr spectrum showing no radicals were generated in the solutions while the addition of nan3 resulted in a significant decrease of the signal intensity due to the competitive reaction for singlet oxygen which is consistent with the results obtained above no spin trapping adducts were observed after the addition of ffa which is a result of the rapid interaction between ps and ffa furthermore the concentration of 1o2 was half quantified based on the intensity of the signal associated with the formation of tmp 1o2 adduct tmpn and was observed to increase rapidly in the first 5 min and then remained at a slower rate which conformed to the degradation of 2 4 dcp fig 1d suggesting that the oxidation by singlet oxygen was one of the responsible processes for 2 4 dcp removal 3 2 examination of the roles of cnts active sites 3 2 1 oxygen containing functional groups to probe the role of oxygen containing functional groups on the 2 4 dcp ps reactions derivatized cnts cnts ph cnts ba and cnts brpe were employed examination of the sem images of cnts and the cnts derivatives fig s5 demonstrated that the modification of cnts with ph ba and brpe did not affect their sizes and morphologies the size distributions and specific surface areas of the modified cnts were only marginally affected by the derivatization figs s6 s7 and adsorption tests also confirmed the limited adsorption quantity on the cnts prior to and after their modification was essentially the same fig s7f the raman spectra of the cnts and its derivatives showed the two characteristic bands which are the d defect band at 1326 cm 1and the g graphitic band at 1575 cm 1 fig s8 cheng et al 2010 the ratio of the intensity of d band to g band which is an estimate of the structural disorder degree and defect content was determined to be 1 110 1 169 1 106 and 1 064 for pristine cnts cnts ph cnts ba and cnts brpe respectively indicating that the used modification procedures did not have any significant influence on defects and sp2 carbon network in these cnts maciel et al 2008 the surface chemistry of the cnts and cnts derivatives was subsequently analyzed by xps fig 2 shows the changes of intensities of the bands located at 532 25 ev and 533 83 ev and assigned to the carbonyl groups and hydroxyl groups respectively compared to the o 1s xps spectra for cnts the relative intensity of the co bond for cnts ph was reduced and the same phenomenon for coh signal of cnts ba was observed although the similar intensity was obtained for cnts and cnts brpe a further determination of zeta potentials demonstrated the removal of the carboxyl groups on cnts brpe fig s9 the kinetic data in fig 3 a and b shows that a significantly lower activity was observed for cnts ph which implies the crucial role for the carbonyl groups to explore this point in more detail ft ir and xps analysis for the used pristine cnts collected after reacting with ps for 2 h were conducted as shown in fig 3c and d respectively these results show that the intensity of the signal associated with the carbonyl group on cnts was noticeably decreased in the ft ir and xps spectra after ps activation given these results the influence of quenching agents on the degradation of 2 4 dcp and the decomposition of ps in presence of cnts ph was investigated in more detail fig s10 neither 2 4 dcp oxidation nor ps decomposition was affected by the addition of methanol however the addition of tmp inhibited the removal of 2 4 dcp while ps decomposition was simultaneously enhanced given the absence of carbonyl groups on the surface of cnts ph this indicates that the generation of singlet oxygen was likely to involve activate sites other than the carbonyl groups fig s10 the same intensity of the tmpn signal was observed in the epr spectra for various cnt derivative systems fig s11 which also demonstrated that singlet oxygen formation was independent with these functional groups considering the possible effect of the hydroxyl or carboxyl groups on the activation performance of cnts functionalized cnts with higher concentrations of hydroxyl or carboxyl surface groups referred to as cnts oh or cnts cooh were used to activate ps fig s12 shows that the efficiency of 2 4 dcp degradation was virtually unchanged in the presence of such modified cnts this implies that in accordance with the kinetic results shown in fig 3a and b the activation of ps is unlikely to depend on the hydroxyl or carboxyl groups on cnt surfaces 3 2 2 effects of cnts structural defects in addition to the oxygen containing surface functional groups structural defects e g vacancies interstitials bond rotations and non hexagonal rings with zigzag or armchair edges that do not necessarily have attached functional groups can be regarded as another moiety of cnt active sites collins 2009 dresselhaus et al 2010 liu et al 2006 to probe its influence experiments with cnts that had been treated to remove surface functional groups or defects were carried out fig s13a demonstrates that annealing of cnts in ar at 1300 c for 2 h produces defect rich cnts referred as cnts d that are largely devoid of the oxygen containing functional groups thermal treatment at a higher temperature 2800 c produced defect free graphitized cnts referred to as cnts df andrews et al 2001 bom et al 2002 additional adsorption experiments showed that the annealing only marginally affected the adsorption capacity of 2 4 dcp fig s13b fig 4 a shows that cnts d had a lower activity on the degradation of 2 4 dcp compared to pristine cnts yet a significant inhibition of their effects was still observed in the presence of tmp or nan3 however much more severe inhibition of effects of n3 ion was observed in the presence of cnts df fig 4b this was interpreted to indicate that singlet oxygen was generated via the involvement of cnt structural surface defects rather than via the involvement of the oxygen containing functional groups this conclusion was confirmed by the raman data for these types of raw and used cnts fig 4c shows that the id ig values of raw cnts df were much lower than those of cnts d this was in accordance with the expected results of the treatment of cnts done to decrease the presence of structural defects in them even lower id ig values were obtained for the used cnts d and cnts df this observation further confirms the consumption of cnts defects on ps activation the epr results presented in fig 4d showed that the use of cnts d resulted in an intensity of tmpn signal that was comparable with that for pristine cnts but the much lower intensity of the tmpn signal was detected when cnts df were used this confirms that the defects on cnts surface play the dominant role for singlet oxygen formation prior studies have demonstrated that the unsaturated active carbon atoms in cnts vacancy defects promote the dissociation the oo bond of oxidants for instance o3 through a one step process that generates singlet oxygen collins 2009 liu et al 2006 a number of studies also showed that defects on the carbonaceous nanomaterials act as active sites in the formation of singlet oxygen chen and jafvert 2011 chen and zepp 2015 wang et al 2018 these observations are in accord with those of our study s conclusions concerning the involvement of cnts surface defects in ps activation 3 3 confirmation of accelerated electron transfer the results presented above demonstrate that 2 4 dcp removal is controlled by both the generation of singlet oxygen and direct electron transfer associated with the involvement of the carbonyl groups and defects on cnt surfaces since the surface defects have been shown to play a critical role in the generation of singlet oxygen it can be argued that the carbonyl groups may be engaged in electron transfer from 2 4 dcp to ps in which case cnts with their high conductance act as a bridge between the 2 4 dcp donor and ps acceptor to prove this point linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurements using an inert glassy carbon gc electrode were conducted in these measurements electrochemical ec oxidation currents were recorded in the presence of several types of cnts pristine cnts cnts d and cnts df deposited on the surface of the gc electrode the maximum oxidation lsv currents observed in these experiments at the ec potential of 1 6 v are summarized in table s2 the lowest ec current 0 02 ma was observed for the bare gc electrode as shown in fig s14 a strong increase of the ec current 0 85 ma was observed for pristine cnts deposited on the gc electrode the ec current increased further when ps alone or ps with 2 4 dcp were present ec currents 1 22 and 2 10 ma respectively compared to the largely featureless lsv curve obtained for the gc electrode modified with cnts or cnts ps a distinct oxidation peak located at ca 0 95 v was observed for cnt modified ge electrode in the presence of both ps and 2 4 dcp this demonstrated the facilitation of electron transfer by the cnts and this may account for their role in the enhancement of reaction between ps and 2 4 dcp tang et al 2018 some increases of the ec currents were observed for cnts d and cnts df but they were much smaller compared with those observed for pristine cnts for instance the ec current for cnts df was the lowest 0 16 ma among the three types of the tested cnts given that the absence of the oxygen containing functional group in cnts d while cnts df lack both these functional groups and structural defects the difference in the ec currents observed for these materials can be interpreted as an indication of the involvement of the carbonyl groups in promoting electron transfer from the 2 4 dcp donor to ps acceptor through the cnt conductive substrate given that the experimental data presented above support the notion that the structural defects and carbonyl groups are responsible for singlet oxygen generation and direct electron transfer respectively a scheme of the interactions involved in the degradation of 2 4 dcp can be proposed scheme 1 this scheme shows that tmp acts a quencher for 1o2 generated in the reaction between the cnt structural defects and ps while nan3 acts as both a 1o2 quencher and a scavenger interfering in electron transfer accelerated by the surface carbonyl groups these reactions highlight the existence and roles of the two proposed pathways that cause the degradation of 2 4 dcp 3 4 regeneration of the activity of cnts while the performance of conventional ps systems is based on the generation of radicals the ps cnts system is more selective due to the involvement of the surface carbonyl groups and defects whose abundance is critical for ps activation it can therefore be expected that the loss of cnts active sites will reduce its activation efficiency fig 5 demonstrates that in agreement with this point the extent of 2 4 dcp removal decreased by ca 70 after 5 cycles of cnt use further experiments showed that the deterioration of the activity of used cnts can be reversed by uv irradiation for instance after the 2nd cycle of cnt use the collected cnts were dried at 60 c and subjected to uv irradiation for 8 h 1 044 10 7 e l 1 s 1 15 w this resulted in a partial recovery of their activity ft ir and raman examination of the irradiated cnts fig s15 showed only minor changes of the vibrations associated with the oxygen containing functional groups but the id ig ratio of the raman bands was increased by 21 after uv irradiation fig s15b the recovery of 2 4 dcp performance induced by uv irradiation can thus be attributed to the regeneration of defects on cnts surface this is consistent with the data of previous studies showing that uv irradiation of cnts created defects in the nanotube sidewalls czech et al 2015 ma et al 2009 since uv irradiation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to activate ps via radical mechanisms a combination of cnts ps oxidation and cnts regeneration by uv irradiation could be considered as an alternative process for sustainable removal of organic contaminants via non radical mechanism guo et al 2017a zhang et al 2018 3 5 toc measurements and inorganic anions effects the degree of mineralization of the organic carbon caused by the degradation of 2 4 dcp was evaluated via toc measurements carried out in the presence of modified cnts fig s16 shows that the toc removal percentages of cnts cnts ph cnts ba cnts brpe cnts d and cnts df system within 30 min were 76 3 44 4 67 9 72 8 61 9 and 53 2 respectively this is consistent with the degradation results of 2 4 dcp discussed above the efficiency of this process may decreased due to undesired reactions with background species typical for environmental systems notably by inorganic anions to examine this point the degradation of 2 4 dcp in the presence of varying level of inorganic ions was measured results of these experiments are shown in fig s17 the removal of 2 4 dcp changed only negligibly in the presence of cl or so4 2 which was largely expected since these anions are not robust scavengers in contrast the presence of hco3 or no3 resulted in a significant inhibition of the removal of 2 4 dcp this may be ascribed to the competition between 2 4 dcp and the nitrate or carbonate anions for singlet oxygen the extent of the inhibiting effects of hco3 or no3 will be addressed in further investigation 4 conclusions this study elucidated the activation mechanism of ps using cnts whose surface chemistry was altered by selective modification processes that changed cnt properties in a controlled manner by evaluating the activation of ps interacting with the derivatized cnts we demonstrate the presence of the coexisting mechanisms that mediate singlet oxygen generation and electron transfer acceleration structural defects and surface carbonyl groups were shown to be critical for these respective mechanisms results of this study also demonstrate that cnts ps exposures combined with the regeneration of the used cnts by uv irradiation allows for innovative multi cycle activation of ps which can be considered as a new approach for a better utilization of the activator acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the national natural science
