450,the understanding of nonlinear flow in rough walled rock fractures is critical for underground engineering and geological sciences the macroscopic behavior and microfluidic field of flow in rough walled artificial fracture models was investigated through microscopic visualization of hydraulic experiment the results indicate that there are three states of flow regime in fracture namely linear weak inertial and strong inertial in linear flow regime the relationship between pressure drops and flow rate is linear and all the streamlines in the microfluidic field are parallel in weak inertial flow regime pressure drop and flow become nonlinear and the inertial pressure loss is less than the viscous pressure loss moreover backflow occurs near the tortuous wall in the microfluidic field in strong inertial flow regime the inertial pressure loss is greater than viscous pressure loss and the backflow begins to detach from the wall and eventually develop into a significantly large eddy far away from the wall however the flow in the mainstream remains laminar rather than turbulent in this experiment this result indicates that the main cause of the nonlinearity of flow in fracture is eddies due to the increase of the inertia term and the variation of aperture the shrinking of effective channel and losing of kinetic energy caused by eddies make fluid flow nonlinear moreover the area and number of eddies depend on the fracture roughness and the reynolds number keywords nonlinear flow rough walled fracture eddy micro particle image velocimetry flow regime 1 introduction the understanding of fluid flow through the rough walled fracture of rock is critical for underground engineering and geological sciences such as water resources management folch et al 2011 jiang et al 2014 enhanced geothermal systems huang et al 2019 high level radioactive waste repositories li et al 2014 nowamooz et al 2009 geological carbon storage pruess 2008 riazi et al 2011 contaminant pollution control lee et al 2010 qian et al 2011 petroleum and gas resource exploitation singh and cai 2018 and hydrothermal system luo et al 2017 2016 in general the fluid flow in the rough walled fracture of rock is governed by the three dimensional navier stokes n s equations zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 unfortunately due to the existence of nonlinear terms caused by inertial forces it is difficult to use the n s equation to solve in irregular geometries such as the rough walled fracture and there is no analytical solution so far therefore a simplified version of the n s equations such as stocks and reynolds equations is used to describe the linear flow of low reynolds number re in fractures brown 1987 giacomini et al 2008 nicholl et al 1999 furthermore considering the flow in fracture as the poiseuille flow between two smooth plates the cubic law cl is deduced and widely used which considers the discharge as proportional to the pressure gradient and the cubic of the aperture brush and thomson 2003 oron and berkowitz 1998 witherspoon et al 1980 the cubic law is only applicable to linear flow without inertial nonlinear terms however in rough walled fractures as the flux increases the effect of the inertial nonlinear term with regard to viscous terms cannot be neglected and the relationship between pressure drop and flow rate is no longer linear therefore in order to better describe the nonlinearity of the flow in the rough walled fracture the forchheimer and izbash laws were proposed forchheimer p 1901 izbash 1931 an impressive number of papers have been published in recent years addressing the subject of nonlinear flow in rough walled fracture using theoretical experimental or numerical methods most of the previous studies focused on the macroscopic properties of the fluid flow through rough walled fractures using experimental and numerical method for example the impact of macroscopic parameters such as the nonlinear effect factor the normalized transmissivity the viscous pressure loss and the inertial pressure loss on the transition from linear flow regime to nonlinear flow regime and the critical reynolds number have been studied chen et al 2015 javadi et al 2014 liu et al 2016a 2016b tzelepis et al 2015 zimmerman et al 2004 moreover many factors affecting macroscopic behavior of fluid flow in fractures have been widely discussed including the geometry of fracture normal stress or displacement shear stress or displacement and fluid properties etc chen et al 2019 chen et al 2015 ranjith and viete 2011 singh et al 2014 yu et al 2017 non newtonian fluid has become the focus of fracture flow research due to different fluid properties through experiments and theoretical analysis and the flow state of non newtonian fluid in fractures is studied chiapponi et al 2019 federico 1998 expect the fluid properties other factors influence on fluid flow in fractures are all related to their changes to the fracture s geometry for example the normal stress or displacement reduces the aperture and the shear stress or displacement changes the contact ratio dilation relative roughness matching degree and other geometric parameters of fractures javadi et al 2014 rodríguez de castro and radilla 2016 2017 rong et al 2016 yin et al 2017 zou et al 2017 therefore the intrinsic permeability of fractures mainly depends on the geometry of fracture furthermore recent numerical studies show that the macroscopic nonlinearity of fluid flow is closely related to eddies in local large aperture regions in the fractures and its generation and development will lead to the shrinking of the advection flow aperture chaudhary et al 2011 lee et al 2014 qian et al 2012 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2018 however research on the generation and development of eddies is mostly numerical analysis and there are few relevant experimental investigations despite extensive and outstanding previous work our understanding of nonlinear flow in rough walled rock fracture is still insufficient in particular the connection between macroscopic nonlinear features and microscopic flow field features remains an open issue in this work the macroscopic flow characteristics of the fluid in fracture model with different joint roughness coefficient jrc barton 1973 barton and choubey 1977 were obtained through hydraulic experiment and the microfluidic characteristics of fluid in fracture were observed with the micro particle image velocimetry piv lee et al 2014 2015 wereley and meinhart 2010 westerweel et al 2013 moreover the macroscopic fluid characteristics and the microfluidic field characteristics of the transition of flow regime from linear to nonlinear were discussed finally the generation and development of eddies in rough walled fractures were analyzed by flow imaging 2 theory and background 2 1 fluid flow in rough walled fractures of rock in steady state the fluid flow through rough walled fracture of rock is governed by the well known n s equations 1 ρ v v p μ 2 v f where ρ is the density of flowing fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity of flowing fluid v is the velocity vector of the flow field p is the pressure gradient and f is the body force vector the first term on the right side is pressure and the second term is viscous forces the left side is the inertia term which makes the equations nonlinear and unclosed for general incompressible fluids in order to close the equation it is necessary to combine the continuity equation when the flux is small and the inertia term is negligible relative to the viscous term the n s equation can be simplified as the stockes equation zimmerman and yeo 2000 2 p μ 2 v as the aperture of fracture varies gradually stockes equation can be reduced to a one dimensional form of reynolds equation zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 3 x p x ρ g w 3 x 12 μ 0 then through integration the cubic law widely used in engineering is obtained witherspoon et al 1980 4a q p k a h μ p w e h 3 μ 4b k e h 2 12 4c a h e h w where q is the volumetric flow rate or discharge k is the intrinsic permeability eh is the hydraulic aperture ah is the cross sectional area w is the fracture width as the flow rate increases and the inertial force becomes non negligible equation 4 is no longer applicable the most extensively used description of nonlinear flow in fractures is forchheimer s equation forchheimer 1901 5a p a q b q 2 where a and b are the coefficients of forchheimer equation describing energy losses due to viscous and inertial dissipation mechanisms respectively with coefficients a and b in fractures being commonly expressed as 5b a μ k a h 12 μ w e h 3 5c b β ρ a h 2 β ρ w 2 e h 2 where β is called nonlinear coefficient or inertial resistance another commonly used equation to describe nonlinear flow behaviors is the izbash equation izbash 1931 which can be expressed as 6 p λ q m where λ and m are the coefficients of izbash equation the value of m varies from 1 to 2 for m 1 eq 6 is reduced to the darcy law and the flow corresponds to laminar flow for m 2 izbash equation presents an excellent description of nonlinear flow in porous media the reynolds number re is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces for fluid flow in fractures re is given as 7 r e ρ v d μ where d is characteristic length of fracture model to quantitatively estimate the nonlinearity of fluids flowing through fractures a nonlinear effect factor e was introduced to determine the fluid flow regime 8 e b q 2 a q b q 2 for engineering purposes a critical e value of 10 was proposed to quantify the transition of flow regimes from linear to nonlinear the corresponding re was defined as the critical reynolds number in engineering ree which can be calculated by eq 7 the transmissivity t is another hydraulic property to characterize the flow resistances in fractures and the normalized transmissivity ta t0 is given as zimmerman et al 2004 9 t a t 0 1 1 β r e 1 e 9a t a μ q w p 9b t 0 μ a w where ta is the apparent transmissivity and t0 is a special apparent transmissivity in darcy s flow state which is typically called the intrinsic transmissivity a is the coefficients of forchheimer equation 2 2 roughness of fracture when n barton studied the shear strength of rock joints he put forward the concept of joint roughness coefficient jrc 0 20 by comparing the shapes of natural rock joints and defined 10 standard profile curves of joint roughness and it was estimated using an empirical equation barton and choubey 1977 10a z 2 1 m z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 10b j r c 32 2 32 47 log z 2 where xi and zi represent the coordinates of the fracture surface profile and m is the number of sampling points along the length i e x coordinate of a fracture our fracture models were designed to represent the original surface roughness i e the large scale waviness of the fracture morphology which play dominant roles in the nonlinear fluid flow properties of fractures 3 experimental methods 3 1 experimental setup and fracture model preparation fig 1 a shows the schematic of the visualized flow in fracture experimental system this system consists of three main units the transparent artificial rough walled fracture model the fluid injection and data measurement unit and the flow field observation unit as shown in fig 1 b these models were based on 10 contour curves of the standard jrc proposed by n barton barton and choubey 1977 in autocad the 3d model with length of 50 mm width of 0 5 mm and depth of 0 1 mm based on 10 contour curves of the standard jrc is established based on our models the transparent artificial rough fracture models were made using polydimethylsiloxane pdms the model is fixed by the glass plate to ensure that the models do not deform during the experiment the detailed geometric parameters of 10 fractures were shown in table 1 it is well known that the flow path and tortuosity are supposed to increase with the fracture roughness but it is found from table 1 that this parameters of 10 fracture models do not strictly follow this rule especially in jrc 8 10 and jrc 10 12 fractures greater than jrc 12 14 and jrc 14 16 this result will lead to the irregularity of experimental results the fluid injection was realized by a micro syringe pump which can adjust the flow rate according to experimental requirements pressure drop across the model was measured by an electronic manometer 0 50 kpa 0 25 fs the flow field observations in this test were performed using the micro piv system lee et al 2014 wereley and meinhart 2010 westerweel et al 2013 the micro piv system in this study mainly includes a laser two ccd cameras imager lx 8 m ccd resolution ratio 3312 2488 shooting frame rate 16 frame s and a stereo microscope plan apochromat 1 0x free working distance 60 mm 3 2 experimental procedure in our study the experimental fluid is deionized water mixed with tracer particles which is a rhodamine b fluoresecent particle with a radius of 0 45 μm at the beginning of the experiment deionized water with tracer particles was injected to clean the fracture model under high flow rate q 1 5 ml min and the possible residual air in the fracture was discharged the experimental flow rate was gradually increased from 0 1 ml min to 4 ml min and the pressure drop at different flow rates in the fracture with different jrc was measured with an electronic manometer in addition the velocity field is analyzed by davis 10 software which is matched with micro piv system the ccd camera takes continuous pictures and the davis software analyzes the correlation between the tracer particles in the two adjacent pictures through the calibration work in advance the track and moving speed of the tracer particles are calculated velocity vector graphs are gained and the eddy current area is calculated because of the great velocity difference between the eddy current field and the entire flow field different exposure time intervals were adopted for the two fields with the exposure interval for the former being 100 150 us picture and 5us picture for the latter 4 results and discussion 4 1 macroscopic nonlinear flow behavior in the fracture with different jrc first we analyzed the macroscopic characteristics of fluid flow in fractures with different jrc the relationships between p and q for water flow were shown in fig 2 the black squares denote experimental values the blue dotted line is the pressure value of darcy equation calculated by eq 1 and the red and green dotted lines represent fitting curves of forchheimer and izbash equation calculated by eq 2 and 3 respectively an error bar is added to each data point in fig 2 a to reflect the measurement accuracy of the experiment fig 2 a d represent jrc 0 2 jrc 8 10 jrc 10 12 and jrc 18 20 respectively other fractures are in the supplementary material figure s1 the pressure drop is linearly related to flow rate when the flow rate is low the relationship between pressure drop and flow rate can be described by darcy s law however as flow rate increases re increases accordingly and the relationship between pressure drop and flow rate becomes non linear moreover as re increases this behavior becomes more evident in other words the inertial term of flow in fracture is not negligible with respect to the viscous term at a large re therefore darcy s law is no longer applicable in this case but both forchheimer and izbash equations can be well fitted with the experimental values the residual squared r2 for all cases is larger than 0 99 and the fitting degree of forchheimer equations is even higher forchheimer and izbash equation coefficients are shown in table 2 in addition as shown in fig 2 and figure s1 the jrc value of the fracture has a great influence on the fracture flow in fracture with large jrc value that is in fracture with large roughness the fluid flow is more likely nonlinear the nonlinear effect factor e in eq 8 is used to describe the nonlinearity of the flow in fracture with different jrc for engineering purposes many scholars proposed that the point where e 10 is the transition point of fluid from being linear to nonlinear and the corresponding re is the critical reynolds number in engineering ree zimmerman and yeo 2000 when e 10 the flow rate corresponding to fractures with different jrc has been shown in fig 2 and figure s1 and the corresponding ree is listed in table 3 for most of fractures it can be seen that ree decreases as jrc value increases the ree is 105 for the fracture with jrc of 0 2 and only 33 1 for the fracture with jrc of 18 20 it is worth noting that the experimental results in the two fractures with jrc of 8 10 and 10 12 are slightly anomalous their roughness is less than the fracture with jrc of 14 16 but the ree is 27 which is less than 43 29 in the fracture with jrc of 14 16 meanwhile the coefficient b of the forchheimer fit increases with increasing jrc except the fractures with jrc 8 10 and 10 12 this is consistent with previous experimental results xia et al 2017 zhang and nemcik 2013 zoorabadi et al 2015 excluding the experimental error this may be attributed to the geometry of the fracture model as shown in table 1 the variation of the flow length and tortuosity of these two models is different from other models therefore we infer that the 10 contour curves of the standard jrc proposed by n barton cannot be well used in fracture hydraulic experiments especially in the comparative experiments of fracture hydraulic characteristics with different roughness because the jrc is commonly used in rock mechanics to relate rock strengths with fracture surface roughness conditions for the study of flow behaviors the empirical jrc values may be not accurate enough 4 2 onset of flow transition to nonlinear and local microfluidic field in rough walled fracture it is hard to quantify the transition of flow from being linear to nonlinear in this section we discuss the flow regime in fracture models with different jrc and the local microfluidic field the normalized transmissivity ta t0 is introduced to distinguish the flow regime of fluids in fractures see eq 9 fig 3 shows the variation of ta t0 with re the dotted line represents the results of this experiment and other lines curves and points with suffix mz are the results of the previous work zou et al 2017 at the beginning when re is small ta t0 is constant as re grows to a certain value ta t0 begins to decrease this means that the flow has transited from being linear to nonlinear although the nonlinearity is weak moreover in fracture with larger jrc ta t0 is more likely to decrease except the fractures with jrc 8 10 and 10 12 with the continuous increase of re ta t0 continues decreasing however there is an up and down trend for the reduction rate which is also indicated in the previous work the detailed variation of ta t0 with re in fracture with jrc 0 2 6 8 and 18 20 was shown in fig 4 a c it should be noted that only the data with re between 0 and 1018 59 was carried out in this experiment blue dot and other data were deduced from the experimental data and calculated parameters purple dots as shown in fig 4 the curve of ta t0 with re can be divided into three parts straight line segment sharp decreasing segment and slow descending segment correspondingly the flow regime in fracture can also be divided into three regimes linear regime weak inertia regime and strong inertia regime liu et al 2016b zimmerman et al 2004 the critical reynolds number between linear regime and weak inertia regime is denoted by relw and weak inertia regime and strong inertia regime is denoted by rews respectively and the values of relw and rews for different fractures are listed in table 3 in linear regime ta t0 is constant and all stream lines are parallel moreover as shown in fig 4 a1 c1 the velocity on the cross section is positive and there is no significant backflows or eddies on the ambient wall in weak inertia regime ta t0 begins to decrease significantly and the rate of decrease grows gradually in addition the eddy near the wall of the fracture with large curvature or aperture occurs the red line in fig 4 a1 c1 indicates the velocity distribution on the cross section of the backflow zone it can be seen that the area of eddy is small and the eddy speed is low it should be noted that ree defined by e 10 is located in inertia regime however when ta t0 drops to 0 5 the reduction rate begins to slow down according to the forchheimer law the proportion of viscous and inertia term are the same at this point on the left side of this point the viscous force is greater than the inertial force and the fluid is in the weak inertia regime while on the right side of this point and the viscous force is less than the inertial force therefore the point with ta t0 0 5 is regarded as the inflection point of fluid flow from weak to strong inertia regime in strong inertia regime the ta t0 continues to decrease and the rate of decline gradually slows down until reaching a stabilized state for the flow field in this regime the eddy has become significantly larger and faster and area of eddy continues to expand with the increase of re in fig 4 the red dashed line represents the critical re in a circular tube flow which is obviously not used to judge the flow regime in facture the re corresponding to the transition point of linear and transition regions in the circular tube flow is much larger than rews in the fracture flow if the re corresponding to the circular tube flow is used to judge the flow state in the fracture when the eddy current or nonlinear flow begins to appear in the fracture it is still in the linear region therefore the re corresponding to the circular tube flow cannot be used to judge the flow state in the fracture comparing the three fig 4 a b and c it is obvious that the lower the jrc the closer the re corresponding to the inflection point is to the rec of circular tube flow this is because the lower the jrc the smaller the flow tortuosity and the closer the fluid flow is to the circular tube flow furthermore we use ji j to express the ratio of inertial pressure loss to total pressure loss and use jv j to express the ratio of viscous pressure loss to total pressure loss qian et al 2015 11a j i j b q 2 a q b q 2 b q a b q 11b j v j a q a q b q 2 a a b q fig 5 shows the variation of the viscous pressure loss term and the inertial pressure loss term with re and the flow field at the intersection a d represent jrc 0 2 jrc 8 10 jrc 10 12 jrc 18 20 respectively other fractures are in the supplementary material figure s2 as shown in fig 5 the proportion of viscous and inertia term is a non linear trend as re increases jv j gradually decreases and the reduction slows down along with re increase while ji j gradually increases the rate of increment also gradually slows down in addition when re grows to a certain value ji j and jv j curves intersect this reynolds number is just the critical rews of the weak inertia regime to the strong inertia regime through the observation of local microfluidic field using piv when re rews the significant eddies appear in fracture with large aperture the right parts of fig 5 are the local microfluidic field of fracture corresponding to inflection points moreover the cross point of ji j and jv j curves which is regarded as the inflection point is getting smaller as the jrc increases it is further shown that with the increase of jrc the complex geometric boundary enhances the disturbance of the fluid and the fluid is more prone to nonlinear flow 4 3 generation and development of eddy in fracture in order to explore the generation and development of eddy in fractures the location and size of eddy generation in fracture with jrc 6 8 under different q are observed using micro piv system previous research has shown that eddies generally occur where the curvature is large or the aperture abruptly changes qian et al 2012 2015 zhou et al 2018 therefore the generation and development of eddy in the location of 2 65 4 mm was shown in movie 1 when the flow rate is low no backflows or eddies were observed until the flow rate increases to 1 5 ml min eddy was observed near the surface of lee side as the flow rate increases further the center of eddy gradually detaches from the wall and its area become enlarged moreover the area of eddy continues to increase and fills the entire angled area until the flow rate reaches 4 ml min movie 1 flow rate q 1 5 4 ml min eddy morphological change in fracture with jrc 6 8 location 2 65 4 mm furthermore the location and size of eddies in the whole fracture under different q was shown in fig 6 the red line represents the mechanical aperture the black line represents the eddy flow aperture which is observed by fracture flow visualization system and the blue line represents the advection flow aperture which is equal to the mechanical aperture minus eddy flow aperture fig 6 a represents the distribution of the mechanical aperture eddy aperture and effective flow aperture with different flow rate fig 6 b represents the local eddy velocity field at different flow rates when the flow rate is 2 ml min eddies occur at the position with larger aperture and tortuous angle in the fracture but only on the lee side of fracture and no eddy occurs on the windward side no eddy occurs at positions with little variation of aperture and tortuous angle because of the eddies the advection flow aperture becomes narrower in the local position of the fracture which leads to the increase of the local velocity compared with that in the absence of eddy with the increase of flow rate new eddies occur at the places where there was no eddy at low flow rate still all of them occur at the lee side it is worth noting that there is no turbulence in the mainstream of the fracture center in this experiment and eddies are only generated in regions where the aperture suddenly changes moreover the area and number of eddy increase with increasing re which leads to the shrinking of effective flow aperture this is the main cause of the nonlinearity of the fracture flow rather than the turbulence in the mainstream zone 5 conclusion this paper mainly discussed the nonlinear flow in rough walled fracture through experiments first the macroscopic flow characteristics and the microscopic flow field in fracture models with different jrc were analyzed through visual experimental investigation meanwhile the onset of flow nonlinearity was discussed by combining macroscopic and microscopic flow field characteristics lastly the generation and development of eddies in rough walled fracture were described in detail based on the current experimental results main conclusions were obtained as follows 1 regarding all fractures with different jrc values hydraulic experiments show that the relationship between pressure gradient and flow rate is non linear with the increase of flux and both forchheimer and izbash equations can fit the non linear relationship well the jrc value of the fracture has a great influence on fracture flow in the fracture with large jrc value the fluid flow is more likely to be nonlinear the jrc is commonly used in rock mechanics to relate rock strengths with fracture surface roughness conditions however for study of flow behaviors the empirical jrc values may not be accurate enough since the nonlinear flow behaviors are more controlled by local asperity conditions 2 combined with macroscopic flow characteristics and microscopic flow field characteristics the flow in fracture can be divided into three states according to its flow regimes linear flow regime weak inertial flow regime and strong inertial flow regime the inflection point from being linear to weak inertial flow regime is the point at which the ta t0 begins to decrease the inflection point from weak inertial to strong inertial flow regime is the point at which the ta t0 is equal to 0 5 the microfluidic field characteristics observed by micro piv also prove this in the linear flow regime the streamlines are parallel and no backflows or eddies are observed in fracture however in the weak inertial flow regime the backflow of ambient wall begins to appear in the fracture where the aperture suddenly increases furthermore in the strong inertial flow regime the significant eddies appear in fracture with large aperture in addition all critical reynolds numbers decrease as the jrc value increases 3 with the increase of re the tiny backflow first appears at the lee side of fracture with larger aperture as re increases these backflows gradually develop and detach from the wall and eventually form eddies in areas far away from the wall for the whole fracture the shrinking of the advective aperture caused by the increase of the number and area of eddies is the main cause of the flow nonlinearity in addition it should be noted that eddy will only occur on the lee side surface of the fracture there is no eddy

450,the understanding of nonlinear flow in rough walled rock fractures is critical for underground engineering and geological sciences the macroscopic behavior and microfluidic field of flow in rough walled artificial fracture models was investigated through microscopic visualization of hydraulic experiment the results indicate that there are three states of flow regime in fracture namely linear weak inertial and strong inertial in linear flow regime the relationship between pressure drops and flow rate is linear and all the streamlines in the microfluidic field are parallel in weak inertial

away from the wall however the flow in the mainstream remains laminar rather than turbulent in this experiment this result indicates that the main cause of the nonlinearity of flow in fracture is eddies due to the increase of the inertia term and the variation of aperture the shrinking of effective channel and losing of kinetic energy caused by eddies make fluid flow nonlinear moreover the

pressure gradient and f is the body force vector the first term on the right side is pressure and the second term is viscous forces the left side is the inertia term which makes the equations nonlinear and unclosed for general incompressible fluids in order to close the equation it is necessary to combine the continuity equation when the flux is small and the inertia term is negligible relative to the viscous term the n s equation can be simplified as the stockes equation zimmerman and yeo 2000 2 p μ 2 v as the aperture of fracture varies gradually stockes equation can be reduced to a one dimensional form of reynolds equation zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 3 x p x ρ g w 3 x 12 μ 0 then through integration the cubic law widely used in engineering is obtained witherspoon et al 1980 4a q p k a h μ p w e h 3 μ 4b k e h 2 12 4c a h e h w where q is the volumetric flow rate or discharge k is the intrinsic permeability eh is the hydraulic aperture ah is the cross sectional area w is the fracture width as the flow rate increases and the inertial force becomes non negligible equation 4 is no longer applicable the most extensively used description of nonlinear flow in fractures is forchheimer s equation forchheimer 1901 5a p a q b q 2 where a and b are the coefficients of forchheimer equation describing energy losses due to viscous and inertial dissipation mechanisms respectively with coefficients a and b in fractures being commonly expressed as 5b a μ k a h 12 μ w e h 3 5c b β ρ a h 2 β ρ w 2 e h 2 where β is called nonlinear coefficient or inertial resistance another commonly used equation to describe nonlinear flow behaviors is the izbash equation izbash 1931 which can be expressed as 6 p λ q m where λ and m are the coefficients of izbash equation the value of m varies from 1 to 2 for m 1 eq 6 is reduced to the darcy law and the flow corresponds to laminar flow for m 2 izbash equation presents an excellent description of nonlinear flow in porous media the reynolds number re is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces for fluid flow in fractures re is given as 7 r e ρ v d μ where d is characteristic length of fracture model to quantitatively estimate the nonlinearity of fluids flowing through fractures a nonlinear effect factor e was introduced to determine the fluid flow regime 8 e b q 2 a q b q 2 for engineering purposes a critical e value of 10 was proposed to quantify the transition of flow regimes from linear to nonlinear the corresponding re was defined as the critical reynolds number in engineering ree which can be calculated by eq 7 the transmissivity t is another hydraulic property to characterize the flow resistances in fractures and the normalized transmissivity ta t0 is given as zimmerman et al 2004 9 t a t 0 1 1 β r e 1 e 9a t a μ q w p 9b t 0 μ a w where ta is the apparent transmissivity and t0 is a special apparent transmissivity in darcy s flow state which is typically called the intrinsic transmissivity a is the coefficients of forchheimer equation 2 2 roughness of fracture when n barton studied the shear strength of rock joints he put forward the concept of joint roughness coefficient jrc 0 20 by comparing the shapes of natural rock joints and defined 10 standard profile curves of joint roughness and it was estimated using an empirical equation barton and choubey 1977 10a z 2 1 m z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 10b j r c 32 2 32 47 log z 2 where xi and zi represent the coordinates of the fracture surface profile and m is the number of sampling points along the length i e x coordinate of a fracture our fracture models were designed to represent the original surface roughness i e the large scale waviness of the fracture morphology which play dominant roles in the nonlinear fluid flow properties of fractures 3 experimental methods 3 1 experimental setup and fracture model preparation fig 1 a shows the schematic of the visualized flow in fracture experimental system this system consists of three main units the transparent artificial rough walled fracture model the fluid injection and data measurement unit and the flow field observation unit as shown in fig 1 b these models were based on 10 contour curves of the standard jrc proposed by n barton barton and choubey 1977 in autocad the 3d model with length of 50 mm width of 0 5 mm and depth of 0 1 mm based on 10 contour curves of the standard jrc is established based on our models the transparent artificial rough fracture models were made using polydimethylsiloxane pdms the model is fixed by the glass plate to ensure that the models do not deform during the experiment the detailed geometric parameters of 10 fractures were shown in table 1 it is well known that the flow path and tortuosity are supposed to increase with the fracture roughness but it is found from table 1 that this parameters of 10 fracture models do not strictly follow this rule especially in jrc 8 10 and jrc 10 12 fractures greater than jrc 12 14 and jrc 14 16 this result will lead to the irregularity of experimental results the fluid injection was realized by a micro syringe pump which can adjust the flow rate according to experimental requirements pressure drop across the model was measured by an electronic manometer 0 50 kpa 0 25 fs the flow field observations in this test were performed using the micro piv system lee et al 2014 wereley and meinhart 2010 westerweel et al 2013 the micro piv system in this study mainly includes a laser two ccd cameras imager lx 8 m ccd resolution ratio 3312 2488 shooting frame rate 16 frame s and a stereo microscope plan apochromat 1 0x free working distance 60 mm 3 2 experimental procedure in our study the experimental fluid is deionized water mixed with tracer particles which is a rhodamine b fluoresecent particle with a radius of 0 45 μm at the beginning of the experiment deionized water with tracer particles was injected to clean the fracture model under high flow rate q 1 5 ml min and the possible residual air in the fracture was discharged the experimental flow rate was gradually increased from 0 1 ml min to 4 ml min and the pressure drop at different flow rates in the fracture with different jrc was measured with an electronic manometer in addition the velocity field is analyzed by davis 10 software which is matched with micro piv system the ccd camera takes continuous pictures and the davis software analyzes the correlation between the tracer particles in the two adjacent pictures through the calibration work in advance the track and moving speed of the tracer particles are calculated velocity vector graphs are gained and the eddy current area is calculated because of the great velocity difference between the eddy current field and the entire flow field different exposure time intervals were adopted for the two fields with the exposure interval for the former being 100 150 us picture and 5us picture for the latter 4 results and discussion 4 1 macroscopic nonlinear flow behavior in the fracture with different jrc first we analyzed the macroscopic characteristics of fluid flow in fractures with different jrc the relationships between p and q for water flow were shown in fig 2 the black squares denote experimental values the blue dotted line is the pressure value of darcy equation calculated by eq 1 and the red and green dotted lines represent fitting curves of forchheimer and izbash equation calculated by eq 2 and 3 respectively an error bar is added to each data point in fig 2 a to reflect the measurement accuracy of the experiment fig 2 a d represent jrc 0 2 jrc 8 10 jrc 10 12 and jrc 18 20 respectively other fractures are in the supplementary material figure s1 the pressure drop is linearly related to flow rate when the flow rate is low the relationship between pressure drop and flow rate can be described by darcy s law however as flow rate increases re increases accordingly and the relationship between pressure drop and flow rate becomes non linear moreover as re increases this behavior becomes more evident in other words the inertial term of flow in fracture is not negligible with respect to the viscous term at a large re therefore darcy s law is no longer applicable in this case but both forchheimer and izbash equations can be well fitted with the experimental values the residual squared r2 for all cases is larger than 0 99 and the fitting degree of forchheimer equations is even higher forchheimer and izbash equation coefficients are shown in table 2 in addition as shown in fig 2 and figure s1 the jrc value of the fracture has a great influence on the fracture flow in fracture with large jrc value that is in fracture with large roughness the fluid flow is more likely nonlinear the nonlinear effect factor e in eq 8 is used to describe the nonlinearity of the flow in fracture with different jrc for engineering purposes many scholars proposed that the point where e 10 is the transition point of fluid from being linear to nonlinear and the corresponding re is the critical reynolds number in engineering ree zimmerman and yeo 2000 when e 10 the flow rate corresponding to fractures with different jrc has been shown in fig 2 and figure s1 and the corresponding ree is listed in table 3 for most of fractures it can be seen that ree decreases as jrc value increases the ree is 105 for the fracture with jrc of 0 2 and only 33 1 for the fracture with jrc of 18 20 it is worth noting that the experimental results in the two fractures with jrc of 8 10 and 10 12 are slightly anomalous their roughness is less than the fracture with jrc of 14 16 but the ree is 27 which is less than 43 29 in the fracture with jrc of 14 16 meanwhile the coefficient b of the forchheimer fit increases with increasing jrc except the fractures with jrc 8 10 and 10 12 this is consistent with previous experimental results xia et al 2017 zhang and nemcik 2013 zoorabadi et al 2015 excluding the experimental error this may be attributed to the geometry of the fracture model as shown in table 1 the variation of the flow length and tortuosity of these two models is different from other models therefore we infer that the 10 contour curves of the standard jrc proposed by n barton cannot be well used in fracture hydraulic experiments especially in the comparative experiments of fracture hydraulic characteristics with different roughness because the jrc is commonly used in rock mechanics to relate rock strengths with fracture surface roughness conditions for the study of flow behaviors the empirical jrc values may be not accurate enough 4 2 onset of flow transition to nonlinear and local microfluidic field in rough walled fracture it is hard to quantify the transition of flow from being linear to nonlinear in this section we discuss the flow regime in fracture models with different jrc and the local microfluidic field the normalized transmissivity ta t0 is introduced to distinguish the flow regime of fluids in fractures see eq 9 fig 3 shows the variation of ta t0 with re the dotted line represents the results of this experiment and other lines curves and points with suffix mz are the results of the previous work zou et al 2017 at the beginning when re is small ta t0 is constant as re grows to a certain value ta t0 begins to decrease this means that the flow has transited from being linear to nonlinear although the nonlinearity is weak moreover in fracture with larger jrc ta t0 is more likely to decrease except the fractures with jrc 8 10 and 10 12 with the continuous increase of re ta t0 continues decreasing however there is an up and down trend for the reduction rate which is also indicated in the previous work the detailed variation of ta t0 with re in fracture with jrc 0 2 6 8 and 18 20 was shown in fig 4 a c it should be noted that only the data with re between 0 and 1018 59 was carried out in this experiment blue dot and other data were deduced from the experimental data and calculated parameters purple dots as shown in fig 4 the curve of ta t0 with re can be divided into three parts straight line segment sharp decreasing segment and slow descending segment correspondingly the flow regime in fracture can also be divided into three regimes linear regime weak inertia regime and strong inertia regime liu et al 2016b zimmerman et al 2004 the critical reynolds number between linear regime and weak inertia regime is denoted by relw and weak inertia regime and strong inertia regime is denoted by rews respectively and the values of relw and rews for different fractures are listed in table 3 in linear regime ta t0 is constant and all stream lines are parallel moreover as shown in fig 4 a1 c1 the velocity on the cross section is positive and there is no significant backflows or eddies on the ambient wall in weak inertia regime ta t0 begins to decrease significantly and the rate of decrease grows gradually in addition the eddy near the wall of the fracture with large curvature or aperture occurs the red line in fig 4 a1 c1 indicates the velocity distribution on the cross section of the backflow zone it can be seen that the area of eddy is small and the eddy speed is low it should be noted that ree defined by e 10 is located in inertia regime however when ta t0 drops to 0 5 the reduction rate begins to slow down according to the forchheimer law the proportion of viscous and inertia term are the same at this point on the left side of this point the viscous force is greater than the inertial force and the fluid is in the weak inertia regime while on the right side of this point and the viscous force is less than the inertial force therefore the point with ta t0 0 5 is regarded as the inflection point of fluid flow from weak to strong inertia regime in strong inertia regime the ta t0 continues to decrease and the rate of decline gradually slows down until reaching a stabilized state for the flow field in this regime the eddy has become significantly larger and faster and area of eddy continues to expand with the increase of re in fig 4 the red dashed line represents the critical re in a circular tube flow which is obviously not used to judge the flow regime in facture the re corresponding to the transition point of linear and transition regions in the circular tube flow is much larger than rews in the fracture flow if the re corresponding to the circular tube flow is used to judge the flow state in the fracture when the eddy current or nonlinear flow begins to appear in the fracture it is still in the linear region therefore the re corresponding to the circular tube flow cannot be used to judge the flow state in the fracture comparing the three fig 4 a b and c it is obvious that the lower the jrc the closer the re corresponding to the inflection point is to the rec of circular tube flow this is because the lower the jrc the smaller the flow tortuosity and the closer the fluid flow is to the circular tube flow furthermore we use ji j to express the ratio of inertial pressure loss to total pressure loss and use jv j to express the ratio of viscous pressure loss to total pressure loss qian et al 2015 11a j i j b q 2 a q b q 2 b q a b q 11b j v j a q a q b q 2 a a b q fig 5 shows the variation of the viscous pressure loss term and the inertial pressure loss term with re and the flow field at the intersection a d represent jrc 0 2 jrc 8 10 jrc 10 12 jrc 18 20 respectively other fractures are in the supplementary material figure s2 as shown in fig 5 the proportion of viscous and inertia term is a non linear trend as re increases jv j gradually decreases and the reduction slows down along with re increase while ji j gradually increases the rate of increment also gradually slows down in addition when re grows to a certain value ji j and jv j curves intersect this reynolds number is just the critical rews of the weak inertia regime to the strong inertia regime through the observation of local microfluidic field using piv when re rews the significant eddies appear in fracture with large aperture the right parts of fig 5 are the local microfluidic field of fracture corresponding to inflection points moreover the cross point of ji j and jv j curves which is regarded as the inflection point is getting smaller as the jrc increases it is further shown that with the increase of jrc the complex geometric boundary enhances the disturbance of the fluid and the fluid is more prone to nonlinear flow 4 3 generation and development of eddy in fracture in order to explore the generation and development of eddy in fractures the location and size of eddy generation in fracture with jrc 6 8 under different q are observed using micro piv system previous research has shown that eddies generally occur where the curvature is large or the aperture abruptly changes qian et al 2012 2015 zhou et al 2018 therefore the generation and development of eddy in the location of 2 65 4 mm was shown in movie 1 when the flow rate is low no backflows or eddies were observed until the flow rate increases to 1 5 ml min eddy was observed near the surface of lee side as the flow rate increases further the center of eddy gradually detaches from the wall and its area become enlarged moreover the area of eddy continues to increase and fills the entire angled area until the flow rate reaches 4 ml min movie 1 flow rate q 1 5 4 ml min eddy morphological change in fracture with jrc 6 8 location 2 65 4 mm furthermore the location and size of eddies in the whole fracture under different q was shown in fig 6 the red line represents the mechanical aperture the black line represents the eddy flow aperture which is observed by fracture flow visualization system and the blue line represents the advection flow aperture which is equal to the mechanical aperture minus eddy flow aperture fig 6 a represents the distribution of the mechanical aperture eddy aperture and effective flow aperture with different flow rate fig 6 b represents the local eddy velocity field at different flow rates when the flow rate is 2 ml min eddies occur at the position with larger aperture and tortuous angle in the fracture but only on the lee side of fracture and no eddy occurs on the windward side no eddy occurs at positions with little variation of aperture and tortuous angle because of the eddies the advection flow aperture becomes narrower in the local position of the fracture which leads to the increase of the local velocity compared with that in the absence of eddy with the increase of flow rate new eddies occur at the places where there was no eddy at low flow rate still all of them occur at the lee side it is worth noting that there is no turbulence in the mainstream of the fracture center in this experiment and eddies are only generated in regions where the aperture suddenly changes moreover the area and number of eddy increase with increasing re which leads to the shrinking of effective flow aperture this is the main cause of the nonlinearity of the fracture flow rather than the turbulence in the mainstream zone 5 conclusion this paper mainly discussed the nonlinear flow in rough walled fracture through experiments first the macroscopic flow characteristics and the microscopic flow field in fracture models with different jrc were analyzed through visual experimental investigation meanwhile the onset of flow nonlinearity was discussed by combining macroscopic and microscopic flow field characteristics lastly the generation and development of eddies in rough walled fracture were described in detail based on the current experimental results main conclusions were obtained as follows 1 regarding all fractures with different jrc values hydraulic experiments show that the relationship between pressure gradient and flow rate is non linear with the increase of flux and both forchheimer and izbash equations can fit the non linear relationship well the jrc value of the fracture has a great influence on fracture flow in the fracture with large jrc value the fluid flow is more likely to be nonlinear the jrc is commonly used in rock mechanics to relate rock strengths with fracture surface roughness conditions however for study of flow behaviors the empirical jrc values may not be accurate enough since the nonlinear flow behaviors are more controlled by local asperity conditions 2 combined with macroscopic flow characteristics and microscopic flow field characteristics the flow in fracture can be divided into three states according to its flow regimes linear flow regime weak inertial flow regime and strong inertial flow regime the inflection point from being linear to weak inertial flow regime is the point at which the ta t0 begins to decrease the inflection point from weak inertial to strong inertial flow regime is the point at which the ta t0 is equal to 0 5 the microfluidic field characteristics observed by micro piv also prove this in the linear flow regime the streamlines are parallel and no backflows or eddies are observed in fracture however in the weak inertial flow regime the backflow of ambient wall begins to appear in the fracture where the aperture suddenly increases furthermore in the strong inertial flow regime the significant eddies appear in fracture with large aperture in addition all critical reynolds numbers decrease as the jrc value increases 3 with the increase of re the tiny backflow first appears at the lee side of fracture with larger aperture as re increases these backflows gradually develop and detach from the wall and eventually form eddies in areas far away from the wall for the whole fracture the shrinking of the advective aperture caused by the increase of the number and area of eddies is the main cause of the flow nonlinearity in addition it should be noted that eddy will only occur on the lee side surface of the fracture there is no eddy

451,this work investigates upscaling of capillary pressure curves for modeling gravity segregation under the influence of capillary heterogeneity we consider two flowing phases driven by gravity and capillary forces and seek the saturation spatial and temporal variation until equilibrium is reached existing upscaling methods found in the literature are applied to a number of cases resulting saturation solutions are compared to fine scale simulations and the different methods are evaluated showing in general that the popular capillary limit method produces the best results however a large number of cases are found to have significant errors this leads to the conclusion that all existing methods are often inadequate and developing new methods should be considered we therefore propose a new optimization based upscaling method using this approach it is shown that capillary pressure can be upscaled to brooks corey type functions and produce accurate upscaled simulations matching the fine scale solutions optimization upscaling is computationally demanding and requires the fine scale simulations for minimizing an objective function however it is shown that the upscaled curves can be applied to different permeability realizations to calculate ensemble average saturation solutions keywords upscaling gravity segregation capillary heterogeneity co2 storage capillary limit optimization 1 introduction numerical modeling of field scale multiphase flow processes is essential for many applications e g aquifer contaminant remediation oil recovery natural gas storage and co2 geological sequestration in some cases when there are no sources or sinks of flow in the model the process is dominated by gravity and capillary forces i e immiscible phases will migrate under the influence of buoyancy and capillary pressure this occurs for example in gravity drainage enhanced oil recovery and co2 storage in aquifers when gas or light fluids are injected into a reservoir saturated with oil or water after injection is stopped the phases will migrate mainly due to gravity and capillary effects accurate numerical modeling of these processes requires a fine mesh because of the large impact of heterogeneity on capillary trapping however these fine scale models are not feasible due to computational limitations and thus upscaling methods must be applied in this work we show that upscaling of capillary pressure functions with existing methods leads to significant simulation errors in gravity capillary driven flows and an upscaling method based on optimization is proposed upscaling of multiphase flow has been an important topic of research in the past four decades and developments have been summarized in the literature e g christie 2001 durlofsky 2003 das and hassanizadeh 2005 the general procedure begins with single phase flow upscaling to obtain upscaled permeability farmer 2002 durlofsky and chen 2012 and these methods are well established in many cases upscaling of multiphase flow properties i e relative permeability and capillary pressure is also necessary pseudo relative permeabilities for upscaling have been discussed in detail in the literature kyte et al 1975 barker et al 1997 and various methods for calculation have been proposed e g analytical saad et al 1995 rabinovich et al 2016 rabinovich 2018 steady state methods ekrann and aasen 2000 virnovsky et al 2004 and dynamic methods darman et al 2002 much less literature deals with upscaling of capillary pressure saturation curves denoted pc sw this is mostly due to the fact that for many applications capillary effects are minor and pc sw can be neglected or modeled simplistically without considering spatial variations however in low rate flow such as gravity capillary driven flow spatial variations of pc curves known as capillary heterogeneity are extremely important we note that the upscaling literature discussed above is limited to darcy scale flow and an additional body of literature exists dealing with upscaling of pore scale flow to obtain permeability mostaghimi et al 2013 starnoni et al 2017 relative permeability raeini et al 2014 2015 and capillary pressure ferrari and lunati 2013 starnoni and pokrajac 2020 capillary heterogeneity is usually modeled by a relationship between pc and permeability k e g the leverett j function scaling flow with capillary heterogeneity is complex and computationally demanding to model particularly considering capillary entry pressure trapping a well known mechanism in pore scale flow lenormand et al 1983 this phenomenon is expressed in reservoir simulations by the constraint that a fully wetting phase saturated grid block i will not be invaded by a nonwetting phase from an adjacent block i 1 unless the capillary pressure of block i 1 exceeds the entry pressure of block i li 2011 this trapping mechanism constitutes a major difficulty in pc sw upscaling existing methods of capillary pressure upscaling generally consist of two different approaches the first is based on the assumption that capillary pressure representing a region similar to phase pressure can be be calculated simply by arithmetic averaging this is done either using a dynamic method pickup and sorbie 1996 or a steady state method virnovsky et al 2004 the second approach is to assume capillary limit conditions in which phases are in equilibrium and capillary pressure is constant in each upscaling volume this is usually referred to as the capillary limit cl upscaling method and applied in the majority of existing literature e g desbarats 1995 pickup et al 2000 lohne et al 2006 mouche et al 2010 the dynamic method is computationally expensive and has not been implemented in many studies with capillary heterogeneity the cl method however is very simple and computationally efficient and has been shown to be accurate for cases with little or no entry pressure effects to extend its application to cases with entry pressure trapping the cl method was combined with percolation considerations by a number of authors braun et al 2005 behzadi and alvarado 2012 yang et al 2013 wolff et al 2013 and used to model gravity capillary driven flow another extension of the cl method was introduced in rabinovich et al 2015 where coarse scale simulations were conducted iteratively to improve pc upscaling accuracy altogether the studies on capillary pressure upscaling discussed above have a number of shortcomings first all studies but one consider two dimensional flow problems a significant simplification in comparison to realistic three dimensional problems which often exhibit major differences in upscaling jankovic et al 2017 second the upscaling methods are tested on a limited number of examples and not necessarily choosing the most challenging conditions e g simple heterogeneity structures finally and most importantly many of the studies show that their method does not achieve sufficiently good results in this work we first show that all previous upscaling methods fail to reproduce fine scale simulations for a number of cases of gravity capillary driven flow various examples are presented with different problem parameters and cases pertaining to applications of gravity drainage oil recovery and co2 storage in aquifers the three dimensional capillary heterogeneous pc curves are upscaled to vary only in the vertical direction i e p c s w x y z p c s w z where denotes an upscaled property the first conclusion is that upscaling in these types of gravity segregation flows with capillary heterogeneity is an issue that has not been fully resolved despite the impression that may be created by some of the previous studies we also evaluate the different methods and discuss their accuracy showing for example that adding percolation considerations to cl upscaling does not have a significant impact on the upscaled models then we apply an optimization approach in which we seek p c such that upscaled simulations reproduce the fine scale solution accurately we find that assuming p c curves of brooks corey type brooks and corey 1966 and optimizing 100 parameters leads to sufficient accuracy of the upscaled simulations while the optimization upscaling method is computationally demanding it is the only method we found that can adequately model all the considered cases upscaling methods are evaluated not only by their accuracy but also by their computational efficiency global methods such as dynamic upscaling are computationally intense requiring a full fine scale simulation to calculate upscaled properties despite having acquired the fine scale solution the upscaling may still be a practical tool if it applies to other cases e g different realizations of the permeability other non global approaches such as analytical or semi analytical upscaling methods e g cl method with without percolation are much less computationally demanding in this work we propose a new upscaling approach using optimization this method is computationally expensive since in addition to being a global method it also requires many coarse scale simulations to optimize the upscaled capillary pressure curves nevertheless the purpose of applying this approach here is mainly to investigate whether we can find p c curves that accurately reproduce the fine scale saturation distribution having shown that existing upscaling methods fail optimization upscaling could nonetheless be a practical tool if it is found to be robust and here we show one example in which the same p c curves are used for different realizations in monte carlo simulations we emphasize that this work is only a first step and it is not our goal yet to perfect a new method or prove its applicability in the future we expect that optimization upscaling can be fine tuned and developed to be a powerful tool incorporating state of the art optimization algorithms we note that other model complexity reduction approaches such as vertical equilibrium yortsos 1995 gasda et al 2013 or invasion percolation ioannidis et al 1996 nooruddin and blunt 2018 simulators are outside the scope of this work the paper is planned as follows in section 2 we present the flow problem and simulation setup and in section 3 the upscaling problem considered here section 4 is a brief description of existing upscaling methods and section 5 presents results of applying these methods to a number of flow scenarios section 6 presents the new optimization upscaling method and discusses results of applying the method to various cases comparison to existing methods is carried out section 7 presents results for the new upscaling approach for ensemble averages of multiple realization simulations section 8 summarizes this work and highlights the main conclusions 2 problem statement we consider injection of a nonwetting phase into an aquifer or oil reservoir i e a wetting phase saturated formation for simplicity we assume that the nonwetting phase is co2 and the wetting phase is water however these could in fact be any other phases such as a gas injected into an oil reservoir injection is stopped after some time and the co2 is distributed throughout the aquifer with some initial saturation s co 2 init x y z this is the starting point for our problem then co2 will migrate due to buoyancy and capillary effects until a steady state is reached when the phases are in equilibrium we seek the saturation distribution s co 2 x y z at every moment in time until equilibrium the equations for the problem described above are considered to be those describing immiscible flow of two incompressible phases in an incompressible rock and given by mass conservation 1 ϕ s j t u j 0 and darcy s law 2 u j k r j μ j k p j ρ j g z where ϕ is the porosity of the rock krj the relative permeability to phase j j w for water or j co2 for carbon dioxide μj the viscosity of phase j pj the pressure of phase j u j the darcy velocity of phase j k the absolute permeability tensor ρj the density of phase j g is gravitational acceleration and z is the vertical coordinate in our cartesian system x y z pressures of the nonwetting and wetting phases are related by 3 p co 2 p w p c s w where pc sw is the capillary pressure curve as commonly assumed for the darcy scale hassanizadeh and gray 1993 starnoni and pokrajac 2020 the assumption of incompressible fluid is a reasonable approximation for a number of applications discussed previously particularly for upscaling studies related to co2 storage in aquifers when the co2 is assumed to be in a supercritical state mouche et al 2010 gasda et al 2013 yang et al 2013 rabinovich et al 2015 capillary heterogeneity is expressed by a dependence of pc sw on permeability and porosity leading to spatially varying curves this is typically modeled using the leverett j function as follows 4 p c s w k ϕ α ϕ k j s w where α is a fitting parameter for simplicity isotropic permeability is assumed here so that k is a scalar function this is not a requirement for this study but assumed in order to avoid defining pc as a function of the directional components of k often taken as the average two of the most widely used j functions are the van genuchten van genuchten 1980 denoted vg and brooks corey brooks and corey 1966 denoted bc models given by 5 j v g s w s w 1 m 1 1 m and 6 j b c s w s w 1 λ respectively where s w s w s w i 1 s w i swi is the irreducible water saturation and λ m are fitting parameters we note that hysteresis is not taken into account in our models despite that it may play an important role in post injection migration of co2 during imbibition however our focus is on upscaling and hysteresis is outside the scope of this work an important difference between the two j function models expressed in eqs 5 and 6 is that the first does not incorporate entry pressure trapping i e p c s w 1 0 while the second does we focus on this trapping phenomenon and therefore the bc model will mostly be used while the case with vg pc is shown to be a much simpler upscaling problem the solution of eqs 1 3 is obtained using a commercial reservoir simulator by computer modeling group cmg ltd i e the imex package imex 2000 fully implicit two phase oil water module where oil represents the co2 phase and water the brine phase this is a well

obtained on grids of 25 25 50 3 upscaling model this work focuses on upscaling pc curves and therefore fine scale permeability and kr will be used in the upscaled simulations upscaling in general involves a transition to a coarser grid in which upscaled properties are assigned to each coarse grid block the coarse grid simulations are associated with two types of error the first is due to the inaccuracy of representing varying properties within a coarse block with a single uniform value the second is a result of numerical dispersion i e errors due to a coarser discretization of the domain in this work we do not wish to consider the numerical dispersion errors therefore we define our upscaled domain as having the same resolution as the fine scale domain each grid block in the upscaled simulation will contain the same k s co 2 init and kr functions as the corresponding fine scale block however the upscaled simulation will have a different pc sw structure each layer of the model will have the same uniform pc sw curve i e p c i j l s w p c l s w where i j l are grid block indices the procedure is depicted in fig 1 where the fine scale simulation is shown to have a grid of 25 25 50 with the curve p c i j l s w assigned to block i j l the upscaled simulation is shown to have the same resolution but with p c l s w i e capillary pressure curves change only with changing layer the approach adopted here aims at constructing the simplest possible upscaling problem this is done as described above by taking an upscaled model that is identical to the fine scale apart from the capillary pressure functions this reduces much of the error observed in conventional upscaling work such an approach is taken since the issue of upscaling pc in gravity capillary flows is involved in fact we will show that despite the measures taken to simplify the problem large errors are observed in many of the upscaled simulations while this approach reduces upscaling errors it has a significant disadvantage computationally in conventional upscaling investigations a major contribution for reducing simulation time is the grid coarsening here the grid resolution remains the same and fine scale k and kr are used hindering computational time reduction nevertheless this approach is adequate considering the goals of this work to show that current methods are insufficient and that upscaled pc functions can be generated using optimization as previously stated it is not our goal to perfect a new upscaling method based on optimization which would of course entail focusing on computational reduction future work dealing with this topic should include grid coarsening as well as the upscaled pc functions presented here despite that computational reduction is not one of the main goals of this work we find that the simplified approach discussed above leads to significant improvement in computer time these results will be presented in section 6 2 we choose our upscaling volume to be layers of the 3d model and therefore it is implicitly assumed that we are interested in matching only the average saturations of each layer between the fine scale and upscaled models in fact it will be shown that the upscaled simulations lead to less saturation variations within each layer due to the uniform pc functions and at equilibrium saturation distribution is one dimensional i e constant within each layer this characteristic of the upscaled model resulting from horizontally uniform pc curves leads to a large improvement in computational time despite that the model still has a fine mesh with varying permeability we conclude that the current upscaling approach which was simplified in order to reduce errors still leads to significant reduction in computational cost 4 description of existing methods for pc upscaling in this section we will give a brief description of upscaling methods that have appeared in previous literature for more details on each method we refer the readers to citations given in section 1 4 1 simple averaging the first and simplest method for upscaling capillary pressure is obtained by averaging the fine scale capillary pressure curves it can be formulated for our upscaling model as follows 8 p c l p c s w h 1 n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y p c i j l α j s w n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y ϕ i j l k i j l where nx ny are the number of grid blocks in the x y directions and h denotes horizontal averaging i e over layers the last equality in eq 8 is obtained by substituting eq 4 in p c i j l this method has not been discussed anywhere in the literature as far as we are aware while it may seem rather intuitive since capillary pressure in a given region is thought to be represented by the average similar to phase pressure it is in fact quite naive because of the implicit assumption that saturation is uniform in each layer of the fine scale model 4 2 dynamic upscaling dynamic upscaling involves averaging capillary pressures and saturations at each time step over several grid blocks of a fine scale simulation pickup and sorbie 1996 the procedure is as follows 1 conduct a fine scale simulation of the flow problem and record the time evolution of sw and pc in each grid block i e s w i j l t p c i j l t 2 for each time step average sw and pc over the fine blocks that constitute the upscaling domain in our problem this is expressed as s w i j l t h p c i j l t h 3 matching pairs of saturations and capillary pressures at a given time produces a point on the p c curve i e p c l s w s w i j l t h p c i j l t h an implementation problem associated with this method is the requirement that saturation change substantially with time during fine scale simulations to obtain information on a significant portion of the curve in gravity capillary driven flow there is often insufficient variations and therefore only a very small portion of p c l s w is obtained particularly when capillary effects are dominant since simulators require a full smooth pc curve as input this leads to a problem 4 3 capillary limit upscaling assuming cl conditions in the upscaling domains means that phases are in equilibrium and therefore capillary pressure is constant this allows to calculate the saturation of each grid block for a given overall capillary pressure and then upscaling is done by averaging the procedure is as follows desbarats 1995 pickup et al 2000 1 derive sw pc k ϕ by inverting eq 4 with j function from eq 5 or 6 2 choose a value of capillary pressure p c 0 3 calculate s w i j l at each fine scale grid block by substituting p c 0 k i j l and ϕ i j l in the sw pc k ϕ formula if the entry pressure of block i j l is larger than p c 0 then that block will be assigned s w i j l 1 4 average s w i j l over upscaling domains i e s w i j l h in our problem 5 obtain a point on the upscaled curve for each layer by pairing averaged saturation with equilibrium capillary pressure p c l s w i j l h p c 0 6 repeat steps 2 5 scanning values of p c 0 between 0 and to obtain full upscaled curves p c l s w for each layer 4 4 capillary limit upscaling with percolation this method involves applying the procedure described in section 4 3 with additional percolation considerations braun et al 2005 behzadi and alvarado 2012 yang et al 2013 wolff et al 2013 in step 3 of the procedure if block i j l does not have a connected pathway to some block with a nonzero co2 saturation then there is no available co2 to enter that block and it should remain fully water saturated a connected pathway is defined by a sequence of adjacent blocks with sw 1 therefore we first develop an algorithm to find all connected blocks in our domain each time that step 3 is repeated we find all connected structures and determine whether they have a connection to blocks with initial saturation i e cells with s co 2 init i j l 0 if they do not then all blocks in the structure will remain with s w i j l 1 otherwise they will be given the cl saturation values 5 results for existing methods the first step for initiating the gravity capillary flow model is to generate initial saturation distributions s co 2 init x y z this is done by simulating point injection of co2 at the upper or lower boundaries of the domain modeling situations related to gravity drainage oil recovery top injection or co2 geological storage bottom injection the two initial saturation distributions used in this work are presented in fig 2 results are for a vertical cross section through the center of the domain fig 2a b and for layer averaged saturation fig 2c for the top injection fig 2a there is a total of 1 6 pore volumes injected pvi leading to an average saturation of s co 2 init 0 53 while for the bottom injection fig 2b there is 0 16 pvi with s co 2 init 0 09 the smaller pvi in the bottom injection case is intended to model a co2 storage scenario which typically involves much smaller injected volumes in comparison to the total reservoir volume fig 2c presents the horizontally averaged initial co2 saturation s co 2 init h for each layer of the model where layer 1 is the top and layer 0 the bottom it is evident that s co 2 init in the case of top injection covers almost the entire domain however a trend is visible with saturation of 0 706 at the top layer and 0 37 at the bottom layer the bottom injection case however shows that hardly any co2 is at the top with average values of 0 003 at the top layer and 0 167 at the bottom layer we note that the same two initial saturation distributions will be used for all the results in the following sections to easily compare between different cases next gravity capillary flow is simulated beginning with s co 2 init x y z and ending when equilibrium is reached and phase velocities are zero everywhere the parameter inputs are given by eqs 4 7 phase densities are ρ w 1037 8 kg m3 and ρ c o 2 103 78 kg m3 viscosity ratio is μ w μ c o 2 12 porosity is constant with ϕ 0 2 and permeability realizations consist of k 100 md and l x l y l z 0 1 log permeability variance σ y 2 and capillary pressure parameters α m λ are varied and will be specified separately for each case these input parameters are also used to generate s co 2 init x y z and the same k realization with σ y 2 1 is used for both cases of bottom fig 2a and top fig 2b injection the saturation distribution is generated by injecting co2 via an injection well completed in a single grid cell at a constant rate of 0 001 m3 day for a duration of 0 1 day for the top injection and 0 01 day for the bottom injection the opposite boundary contains a production well with bhp of 700 kpa completed in a single cell fig 3 presents results for existing methods considering vg capillary pressure eq 5 for two cases of top injection the first case fig 3a c consists of parameters α 1 m 0 75 and a realization with σ y 2 1 while the second case fig 3d f is for α 1 m 0 4 and σ y 2 3 the different methods described in section 4 are applied to calculate the p c l s w curves and then upscaled simulations are conducted producing saturation for each grid block we note that the method of cl upscaling with percolation is not relevant to the vg case since there is no entry pressure trapping i e for any p c 0 all grid blocks have sw 1 and are therefore fully connected to evaluate the accuracy of upscaled simulations we compare the horizontally averaged saturation results with the corresponding fine scale ones i e s co 2 h with s co 2 fine h the comparison is held for 3 different simulation times labeled as transient 1 transient 2 and equilibrium and corresponding to simulation of 0 01 days 0 1 days and 10 days results in fig 3 show that all upscaling methods generally produce similar saturation profiles and these are in excellent agreement with the fine scale solution except for the case in fig 3b which presents a visible mismatch errors for the upscaled simulations are quantified by calculating the average saturation difference i e s co 2 h s co 2 fine h and these are presented in table 1 as a rule of thumb we find that errors below 0 05 are sufficiently low and correspond to a visual agreement between fine scale and upscaled results while errors of 0 05 0 1 are significant yet can often be tolerated errors above 0 1 are generally non reasonable and the upscaling is considered not applicable it can be seen that all error values are below 0 05 except the case in fig 3b equilibrium state solutions in the vg cases have an analytical solution nordbotten and dahle 2010 nordbotten and celia 2011 bedrikovetsky 2013 rabinovich and cheng 2020 and they are shown to be matched perfectly by the dynamic upscaling method errors of 0 0044 and 0 0003 the other two methods simple averaging and cl also match the fine scale very well at equilibrium conditions and appear to be even slightly better in the transient regime surprisingly the simple averaging method is perhaps the best overall despite its naive approach explained in section 4 1 the large error for transient 2 case in fig 3b is unexpected and indicates that even for the vg case at some points in time during vertical migration the upscaled simulations could have errors due to underestimation of capillary effects will be discussed further below however errors are limited in size 0 08 and in time only transient 2 so the general conclusion drawn from this analysis is that for capillary pressure functions without entry pressure such as vg upscaling is a rather simple problem and all the methods produce fairly accurate results all further test cases will consider only bc type capillary pressure fig 4 presents the saturation distribution in a vertical cross section considering the case of vg pc m 0 75 and σ y 2 1 presented in fig 3a c the plots illustrate the saturation migration with time under the influence of gravity and capillary forces the fine scale transient 1 case fig 4e is seen to resemble the initial distribution fig 2a since it is only 0 01 days after end of injection transient 2 fig 4c shows partial segregation in which a region of almost full water saturation exists at the bottom of the domain and equilibrium conditions fig 4a show that most of the fluids are segregated with some saturation variations apparent due to capillary effects the upscaled simulations fig 4b d f with p c curves obtained using simple averaging consist of much smoother saturation variations as a result of the uniform p c in each layer nevertheless in the transient cases fig 4d f some 3d variations are seen and observed to be somewhat similar to the fine scale variations fig 4c e the equilibrium upscaled saturation fig 4b on the other hand is completely layered this is because when phase velocities are zero everywhere the saturation solution is only governed by the hydrostatic capillary pressure variation and the pc sw function variation eq 4 which are both 1d and varying only in the z direction for more details see analytical solutions considering similar cases presented in rabinovich and cheng 2020 the agreement between fine scale and upscaled simulations can be roughly assessed observing fig 4 mainly by evaluating the extent of the full water saturation region at the bottom of the domain comparing the transient 1 simulations fig 4e and f it can be seen that the agreement is good with a thin layer of water at the bottom for the equilibrium simulations fig 4a and b agreement also appears to be good and these results are in line with those presented in fig 3 and table 1 however as discussed previously some mismatch between fine scale and upscaled results is seen in the transient 2 case fig 4c and d the distribution plots help to illustrate the source of the mismatch in general gravity works to segregate the phases while capillary effects have an opposite impact of pushing co2 to the lower parts for fine scale simulations each grid block has a different pc curve and therefore more capillary pressure gradients are created thus the co2 will generally remain in lower parts of the domain in comparison to the upscaled simulations which have less capillary pressure gradients as a result of the uniform p c curves in each layer this is seen comparing fig 4c and d and in agreement with the lower average co2 saturation for the upscaled simulations seen in the lower region in fig 3b we now apply the methods described in section 4 to bc capillary pressure considering first a case of α 1 λ 4 and σ y 2 3 fig 5 presents fine scale and upscaled pc curves for a single representative layer in the model the layer is chosen randomly from the lower part of the domain however other layers have similar curves both in shape and magnitude e g entry pressure for dynamic upscaling is between 0 25 0 58 only 25 of the 625 fine scale curves gray are plotted for illustration and those curves which are not plotted all fall in the same range of capillary pressures it is evident that these curve vary significantly due to a large variation in entry pressure as dictated by the large permeability variance the simple averaging method magenta is situated roughly in the middle in between the fine scale curves as can be expected the cl with percolation is the only method that depends on s co 2 init and therefore we present the curve for top and bottom injection separately crosses and circles it can be seen that in both injection schemes the percolation leads only to a small alteration of the curves from the cl curve red in 2d and 1d models there are much fewer possibilities for connected pathways and therefore percolation considerations will have a more significant impact behzadi and alvarado 2012 however considering the cl method in our 3d model most grid blocks with co2 have a connected pathway to the s co 2 init 0 blocks see section 4 4 and therefore percolation has only a minor impact on the curves fig 6 presents results for all four upscaling methods considering the case of injection at the top boundary fig 2a and bc capillary pressure eq 6 with varying parameters and for 2 different times i e equilibrium t 10 days and transient t 0 1 days corresponding upscaling errors are detailed in table 2 for α 1 λ 2 and σ y 2 1 fig 6a b results are reasonable for all methods with tolerable errors of up to 0 083 particularly good results are seen for cl errors 0 003 0 029 the dynamic and simple averaging are shown to have a significant error at the lower part of the domain underestimating the co2 saturation this is a typical characteristic of upscaled models saadatpoor et al 2011 which have less capillary heterogeneity and therefore less trapping opportunities leading to less trapped co2 in the lower parts and consequently more co2 at the upper parts the same is observed in fig 6c d when raising λ to 4 but with even more error 0 084 0 122 even for cl methods errors of 0 035 0 057 fig 6e f present results for a case of fairly low capillary pressure impact i e α 0 2 λ 2 and σ y 2 1 and the curves are seen to be varying more smoothly with elevation at equilibrium the upscaling results approximately match the fine scale however in the transient state an error is seen for all methods this result shows another difficulty in the gravity capillary upscaling problem i e that the transient state is sometimes difficult to capture even in cases where equilibrium is approximated well seen also in the vg case of fig 3b fig 6g h represent the most difficult case we consider when both capillary effects and entry pressure effects are maximized the dynamic and simple averaging methods are shown to have the largest errors in this case 0 095 0 168 the cl methods still approximately match the fine scale at equilibrium however the errors are present in the transient regime 0 07 the main reason for errors between fine scale and upscaled models is that the latter have much less pc function variations entry pressure trapping is based on the principle that co2 will not penetrate an adjacent grid block which is fully saturated with water until its capillary pressure exceeds the entry pressure of that grid block in the fine scale model each block has a different entry pressure and therefore there is a larger probability for small pc blocks surrounded by high entry pressure blocks leading to co2 trapping on the other hand the upscaled model has the same pc for each layer and therefore the same entry pressure if co2 penetrates any block in a given layer it can then migrate laterally eliminating fully water saturated blocks in that layer and removing the possibility of entry pressure trapping due to this process upscaled models tend to underestimate trapping allowing for more co2 to rise to the top layers as observed in fig 6 and in following figures as well it is very likely that this underestimation is related to capillary entry pressure values of the upscaled curves in general observing fig 6 we first find that cl with percolation upscaling produces almost identical results as cl without percolation consistent with our findings in fig 5 second we see that the cl is the most accurate method while the dynamic and simple averaging methods have very limited accuracy for this reason we do not continue to evaluate these two methods concluding that they are not adequate for cases with capillary entry pressure transient saturation profiles are seen to be generally more difficult to approximate in upscaled models and the cl also has significant errors in this regime for some cases finally we see that the errors consistently present themselves as underestimation of co2 in the lower parts of the domain and overestimation at the upper parts in line with the explanation provided in the previous paragraph fig 7 presents results comparing upscaled and fine scale simulations considering bottom injection fig 2b and bc capillary pressure eq 6 with varying parameters and for 2 different times i e equilibrium t 10 days and transient t 0 01 days only results for cl upscaling with and without percolation are presented because the other two methods are extremely inaccurate as already established in the previous analysis furthermore it is clear that in all cases the method of cl with percolation leads to saturation profiles which approximately coincide with the regular cl profiles indicating that percolation does not contribute this has already been discussed previously in fig 5 and regarding the top injection cases in fig 6 observing the equilibrium results in fig 7a c e g we see that the fine scale saturation consists of a region of trapped co2 spanning from layer 10 15 until the bottom of the domain and at the top is a region of abruptly increasing co2 this structure is dominated by the entry pressure trapping mechanism and is clearly different than the top injection case it is apparent that the upscaled models cannot replicate the bottom region which occurs due to this mechanism therefore extremely large errors develop at the upper parts e g the co2 at the top layer is overestimated by over 0 2 in fig 7g almost twice as much as the fine scale value the exception is fig 7e where the upscaled profiles match the fine scale ones because the capillary effects are small α 0 2 and there is no co2 trapped in the lower parts of the domain in general as the trapping is increased e g for larger σ y 2 fig 7g there will be more errors in the upscaled models saturation errors corresponding to fig 7 are presented in table 3 in these models an important result is the amount of co2 that reaches the top layer since co2 storage models are often employed to estimate these values as a means of assessing the possibility of leakage through the cap rock it is seen in fig 7a c and g that the co2 at the top layer is terribly overestimated with errors of 0 09 0 18 and 0 23 respectively this is despite that the overall errors are only 0 56 0 88 and 0 11 errors for the transient case are significantly smaller than for equilibrium this is because in bottom injection errors generally develop over time as co2 raises and the trapped amounts in the lower part are not predicted by the upscaled models nevertheless the errors are not negligible as seen in the agreement of the curves in fig 7b d f and h furthermore error values are somewhat misleading since they are not normalized i e errors of 0 01 still constitute more than 10 of the overall average saturation in bottom injection cases to summarize the bottom injection results we find that the cl method fails to estimate the saturation profiles particularly at equilibrium conditions 6 optimization upscaling approach the idea for using optimization algorithms in order to calculate upscaled single phase or multiphase flow parameters has appeared in previous literature e g wang et al 2009 mckee et al 2013 krogstad et al 2014 alpak 2015 however this idea is far from having been fully explored has gained very little attention and has not been seriously adopted in practice we have shown in the previous section that the problem of gravity capillary flow with capillary entry pressure effects cannot be handled by conventional methods of pc upscaling and therefore we resort to an optimization approach the method and results of the optimization upscaling is presented in the following 6 1 method we assume that upscaled capillary pressure functions are of the same form as the fine scale ones given by 9 p c l α l s w 1 λ l where αl and λl are the optimization parameters for each layer l of the model in this work we have 50 vertical layers i e 1 l 50 and therefore there are 100 parameters to be determined by optimization the objective function which we minimize is given by 10 o j s 1 m l 1 n s co 2 fine t s h l s co 2 t s h l 2 where n 50 and ts are the time steps which are considered in the optimization m 3 in the examples presented here the optimization algorithm used in this work is matlab s fminsearch based on the simplex search method of lagarias et al 1998 it is a non gradient based method and is not guaranteed to converge to a global minimum it was chosen since it can optimize many variables it is simple to operate and able to achieve adequate results with reasonable computational time the procedure is detailed as follows 1 obtain horizontally averaged fine scale saturation s co 2 fine t s h l for each layer l and for each chosen time step ts from simulation 2 choose initial guess of the parameters i e α l init λ l init 3 run fminsearch optimization to obtain αl λl using the objective function of eq 10 for only one ts pertaining to equilibrium conditions 4 input αl λl from previous step as initial parameters α l init λ l init 5 run fminsearch optimization using the objective function of eq 10 for all ts values i e 1 s m to obtain final values of αl λl and consequently the upscaled curves given by substitution of estimated parameters in eq 9 we find that in general the optimization procedure is sensitive to the initial guess of parameters α l init λ l init applying the optimization algorithm to only a single time ts step 3 and then using the output for a second optimization run step 5 is intended to improve results by lowering the sensitivity furthermore we find that this two step approach reduces the number of iterations required for convergence and therefore also the computational time 6 2 optimization upscaling results in this section we present and discuss the results for optimization upscaling fig 8 shows a comparison between fine scale and upscaled simulations using the method described in the previous section to obtain p c results are for top injection and the cases considered correspond to those discussed in section 5 an agreement between fine scale and upscaled saturation profiles can be clearly seen comparing fig 8 to fig 6 shows that the optimization method does not present significant underestimation of the co2 saturation at the lower region as was observed for the existing methods fig 6c d f and h on the other hand the optimization method of upscaling leads to some abrupt changes in the saturation profiles i e oscillations around the fine scale solution particularly in fig 8g h comparing the optimization and cl methods we find that the optimization results are more accurate for the transient regime where we have discussed in section 5 that the cl method has lower accuracy for equilibrium saturation both methods appear to be adequate however the optimization results present oscillations around the fine scale solution while the cl method saturation is a smoother fit to the fine scale table 4 presents the overall errors in saturation for optimization upscaling and the middle column pertains to the top injection cases the conclusions from the figures are supported by the table showing that the optimization errors are always significantly smaller than the cl errors see table 2 for comparison in the transient cases the equilibrium cases on the other hand have mixed results comparing cl and optimization upscaling nevertheless the errors for equilibrium conditions are sufficiently small for both methods so error differences have low significance while for the transient cases the cl has some large errors 0 07 and 0 071 in fig 6f and h in general all the errors for top injection observed in table 4 are considered sufficiently small less than 0 05 and the optimization method is shown to be applicable fig 9 presents results for bottom injection the most significant achievement of the optimization upscaling is seen in the equilibrium saturation profiles in fig 9a c e and g the upscaled simulations produce saturations that are able to capture the entry pressure trapping in the lower regions and consequently also match the co2 quantities that reach the top this overcomes the biggest difficulty we observed in the existing methods which lead to nearly zero co2 in the lower region and resulted in very large errors see fig 7a c and g as in the top injection cases some abrupt changes in the saturation profiles are seen however this is not significant amounting to only a few layers with zero saturation in the trapping region and not substantially impacting errors the fine scale solutions in the transient cases presented in fig 9b d f and h are also seen to be matched by the upscaled simulations some mismatch is seen similar in magnitude to that observed in the cl method results of fig 7b d f and h as in the equilibrium results some jumps in saturation are apparent however these are few in number confined to only a number of layers and the contribution to the overall error is small errors for bottom injection are detailed in the rightmost column of table 4 equilibrium cases are shown to have small errors all below 0 03 and significantly lower than the cl method errors see table 3 for cases with entry pressure trapping a c and g the case with small capillary effects e has similar accuracy for both methods considering the co2 saturation in the top layer the optimization upscaling has a dramatic improvement over the cl method with errors of 0 016 0 002 and 0 012 for cases a c and g respectively the transient case errors are shown to be sufficiently small cases b d f and g and similar in size compared to the cl method table 3 overall the optimization upscaling for bottom injection has errors well below 0 05 and even smaller than top injection errors for almost all cases fig 10 presents results for pc curves for the case of α 1 λ 4 and σ y 2 3 considering both top and bottom injection the entry pressure for the fine scale curves is seen to be in the range of 10 2 to 2 10 1 and this is similar to the fine scale curves in fig 5 same case but different curves chosen randomly the upscaled curves have much larger values with entry pressure of 100 for top injection and 101 for bottom injection these values are also much larger than the upscaled curves of the existing methods fig 5 which are seen to have values of up to 4 10 1 this is the main difference between the optimization curves and the curves of the existing methods and helps illustrate the reason for the improved accuracy of the former we have already established in section 5 that the upscaled models with existing methods significantly underestimate the co2 trapping in the lower regions particularly for the bottom injection case the optimization pc curves have a much larger entry pressure α which leads to significantly more co2 trapping in the lower region and thus the improved agreement with fine scale simulations this phenomenon is discussed in rabinovich and cheng 2020 it appears that only with the optimization approach we are able to reach entry pressure values which are large enough to obtain accurate upscaled simulations however we cannot determine that this is the only reason for the improved accuracy of the optimization upscaling and it is generally expected to be a combination of entry pressure shape and spatial variation of the pc curves optimization with less parameters was tested by considering the same p c z for every 2 5 or 10 layers this reduces the number of parameters in the optimization to 50 20 or 10 respectively instead of the 100 parameters optimized when considering a p c z for each layer as conducted in all previous cases results for overall error as a function of the number of parameters are plotted in fig 11 for t 0 01 transient case t 0 05 t 0 2 and equilibrium cases it is apparent that the error decreases continuously and rather slowly logarithmic decrease with number of parameters this provides some insight regarding the optimization procedure first the same error was not achieved using less parameters and the continuous slow logarithmic decrease gives an explanation for the large number of parameters required to obtain a sufficiently small error second the results for t 0 05 and 0 2 allow to address the issue of overfitting overfitting during the optimization could result in case specific parameters which apply only to the fitted cases we apply the same parameters optimized only for t 0 01 0 1 and equilibrium to two other test times t 0 05 and 0 2 results in fig 11 show that the errors for the test times are similar to the fitted times and also decrease monotonically with the number of parameters suggesting that there is no significant overfitting in relation to time we emphasize that in this work the optimization is intended to obtain the best possible match for a single simulation case with given parameters k kr s c o 2 init etc and the optimized parameters are not intended to be used for other cases this is similar to any upscaling procedure which is normally applied to each case separately to obtain unique case specific upscaled curves however global upscaling methods are sometimes tested for applicability to cases with different k realizations in stochastic flow solutions and we apply this test to our upscaled curves in the next section when we consider ensemble averages as discussed in section 3 the optimization approach is presented here to show its feasibility for upscaling capillary pressure considering gravity capillary driven flow computational reduction is not one of the main goals for this initial investigation nevertheless in table 5 we present the computational time for our simulations for both the fine scale and upscaled problems the 8 cases appearing in sections 5 and 6 2 pertaining to bc capillary pressure both top and bottom injection are considered upscaled simulation times are representative considering pc curves obtained using any upscaling method i e existing methods or optimization results pertain to simulations run on a single intel i7 8700 cpu with maximum clock speed of 3 2ghz a significant reduction in simulation time is seen for the upscaled model with speedups of up to 389 7 upscaling of ensemble averaged solutions global upscaling methods such as the optimization procedure presented above have a significant disadvantage of requiring a full fine scale simulation therefore these methods are often only used for theoretical studies or as a stepping stone towards developing local methods which do not require fine scale simulations if however the upscaled properties calculated for one problem can be used in other problems e g considering ensemble average solutions of different permeability realizations initial saturation distributions or capillary pressure curves then the upscaling method becomes a practical tool this robustness characteristic of the upscaled properties will be examined here considering ensemble average saturation profiles of different realizations reservoir parameters such as the permeability distribution are generally unknown and flow modeling must take this into account a common approach is to model the permeability as a random space function and to generate many possible realizations of k using geostatistical models which honor the data collected from the field then monte carlo simulation can be carried out to assess possible flow solutions resulting from the different permeability realizations we consider solutions of the gravity segregation problem for different realizations of lognormally distributed k in the previous section we calculated the saturation solution using upscaled pc curves obtained by optimization this was carried out for one k realization we now generate four more realizations and use the same upscaled pc to calculate saturation profiles with coarse simulations it is emphasized that due to the reuse of p c only one fine scale simulation was required to obtain all five saturation profiles corresponding to the five realizations this is a significant reduction of computational time since upscaled simulations have a speedup factor of up to 389 for top injection and 57 for bottom injection in comparison to the fine scale ones see table 5 fig 12 presents results for the ensemble average of the saturation profiles pertaining to all five realizations upscaled p c are calculated by optimization only to a single realization this is done in two different upscaling resolutions the first is by considering a different p c z for each layer leading to 100 parameters in the optimization blue lines in figure as discussed in section 6 1 the second resolution considers different p c z for each five layers leading to only 20 optimization parameters red lines in figure naturally reducing the number of p c functions will result in less accurate upscaling for a single realization as seen in fig 11 and less optimization computational time however it is apparent in the figure that in all cases the lower resolution of optimization 20 variables leads to more robust p c functions that apply to averages of different realizations i e the upscaled ensemble average for 20 variables is a better approximation to the fine scale than the 100 variable case this is somewhat intuitive considering that a higher resolution of optimization will lead to more case specific results while reducing the number of optimized parameters allows for more flexibility i e the accuracy of the single realization optimization is sacrificed to improve the accuracy of other realizations fig 12 a d present results for top injection ensemble averaged saturation profiles and the corresponding overall errors are presented in table 6 the upscaled simulations with 20 variables in the optimization method approximately match the fine scale simulation results with agreement comparable to that seen in the single realization case fig 8a b g h and table 4 particularly for the cases in subplots a and b bottom injection results are presented in fig 12e h and are seen to be much more challenging to upscale as observed before in the previous sections nevertheless the results for 20 variable optimization upscaling are reasonable and the match for equilibrium cases fig 12e g and table 6 are far better than the cl results for a single realization fig 7a g and table 3 it appears from the results of fig 12 that the reduced resolution optimization upscaling e g 20 variables can be calculated for one realization and then used in simulations with other realizations in order to calculate ensemble averages the analysis was also carried out using 10 realizations instead of only 5 and the results were similar in accuracy i e there appears to be no significant improvement in agreement between fine scale and upscaled saturation profiles for additional realizations in the ensemble average we emphasize that results for each realization separately were not presented in this section but rather only for their ensemble mean as mentioned previously we do not expect that the same parameters can be used separately for different realizations just as existing upscaling methods are normally not applied this way it is one of the limitation of numerical upscaling however ensemble averages are easier to replicate with the same upscaled pc curves and this is shown possible here by reducing the number of optimization parameters so that the curves become less case specific 8 summary and conclusions this work presents a thorough investigation of capillary pressure upscaling for the purpose of reducing computational cost of gravity capillary driven flow simulations an initial saturation distribution is allowed to migrate due to gravity and capillary forces without any flow sources or sinks all boundaries are considered impenetrable and two types of initial saturations are used in the examples injection of co2 at the top and bottom of the domain upscaling is carried out only for pc and all other parameters are the same for the upscaled and fine scale simulations pc functions are upscaled from 25 25 50 to 1 1 50 i e p c is only a function of z the first part of the investigation is a test of existing pc upscaling methods considering the case of vg capillary pressure curves without entry pressure we find that all methods generally work well particularly the simple averaging method which was not considered in previous literature nevertheless in one case we found errors in the transient stage of the simulation suggesting that this stage is more prone to error next bc capillary pressure is tested for top injection we show that the equilibrium saturation profile is approximated well using capillary limit upscaling while the other methods result in large errors for the transient stage of simulations more errors are apparent some of which we consider over the reasonable error threshold for bottom injection the equilibrium or late transient stages of the simulation are the most difficult to estimate with upscaled models only capillary limit upscaling is considered because other methods lead to extremely large errors as already mentioned regarding top injection even for the two cl methods with and without percolation very large errors are observed for equilibrium cases our conclusion is that for gravity capillary dominated flow scenarios with significant capillary heterogeneity large λ and σ y 2 or bottom injection of small amounts of co2 existing upscaling methods are inadequate furthermore we conclude that the popular cl method with percolation leads to similar results as the regular cl method in many three dimensional lognormal k distributions in the second part of this work we investigate whether any form of bc type p c curves can be defined to obtain accurate upscaled simulations to do so we introduce an optimization approach to upscaling the results show that indeed this is possible and for all cases we find p c curves leading to sufficiently accurate matches between upscaled and fine scale simulations the optimization upscaling is a global method requiring a computationally demanding fine scale simulation to arrive at the p c curves we show that it could nevertheless serve as a practical tool by reusing the p c curves in simulations of different realizations e g for obtaining average saturation profiles in monte carlo simulations despite efforts made to suggest implementation of optimization upscaling in practical real world problems it is not one of the main goals of this work and requires further study and improvement in the future a method could be developed based on the ideas presented here for practical purposes the following issues should be taken into consideration first grid coarsening should be incorporated in the upscaling method which will require permeability and relative permeability upscaling as well second typical upscaling volumes should be considered which are limited in both vertical and horizontal extent e g 5 5 10 as opposed to the full layer volumes used here 1 1 50 this is expected to be a more difficult problem and an approach to reduce the number of parameters in the optimization will be required e g quasiglobal upscaling alpak 2015 finally a variety of pc function structures and optimization algorithms should be evaluated to study which are most accurate and computationally efficient we believe the conclusions of this work will help bring attention to errors associated with upscaling gravity capillary dominated flows e g in applications of modelling co2 storage existing methods such as cl should not be used without taking extreme care as trapped co2 quantities may be significantly underestimated furthermore the optimization upscaling results show that there is a way to define p c using conventional bc type functions and obtain sufficient accuracy one attribute of these upscaled curves is their large entry pressure which is shown to be significantly larger than in curves calculated using existing methods these findings open the possibility for future investigations with either of two approaches physics based upscaling methods or optimization methods while the optimization upscaling is generally computationally demanding it can be useful if further developed to be highly efficient and robust credit

451,this work investigates upscaling of capillary pressure curves for modeling gravity segregation under the influence of capillary heterogeneity we consider two flowing phases driven by gravity and capillary forces and seek the saturation spatial and temporal variation until equilibrium is reached existing upscaling methods found in the literature are applied to a number of cases resulting saturation solutions are compared to fine scale simulations and the different methods are evaluated showing in general that the popular capillary limit method produces the best results however a large number of cases are found to have significant errors this leads to the conclusion that all existing methods are often inadequate and developing new methods should be considered we therefore propose a new optimization based upscaling method using this approach it is shown that capillary pressure can be upscaled to brooks corey type functions and produce accurate upscaled simulations matching the fine scale solutions optimization upscaling is computationally demanding and requires the fine scale simulations for minimizing an objective function however it is shown that the upscaled curves can be applied to different permeability realizations to calculate ensemble average saturation solutions keywords upscaling gravity segregation capillary heterogeneity co2 storage capillary limit optimization 1 introduction numerical modeling of field scale multiphase flow processes is essential for many applications e g aquifer contaminant remediation oil recovery natural gas storage and co2 geological sequestration in some cases when there are no sources or sinks of flow in the model the process is dominated by gravity and capillary forces i e immiscible phases will migrate under the influence of buoyancy and capillary pressure this occurs for example in gravity drainage enhanced oil recovery and co2 storage in aquifers when gas or light fluids are injected into a reservoir saturated with oil or water after injection is stopped the phases will migrate mainly due to gravity and capillary effects accurate numerical modeling of these processes requires a fine mesh because of the large impact of heterogeneity on capillary trapping however these fine scale models are not feasible due to computational limitations and thus upscaling methods must be applied in this work we show that upscaling of capillary pressure functions with existing methods leads to significant simulation errors in gravity capillary driven flows and an upscaling method based on optimization is proposed upscaling of multiphase flow has been an important topic of research in the past four decades and developments have been summarized in the literature e g christie 2001 durlofsky 2003 das and hassanizadeh 2005 the general procedure begins with single phase flow upscaling to obtain upscaled permeability farmer 2002 durlofsky and chen 2012 and these methods are well established in many cases upscaling of multiphase flow properties i e relative permeability and capillary pressure is also necessary pseudo relative permeabilities for upscaling have been discussed in detail in the literature kyte et al 1975 barker et al 1997 and various methods for calculation have been proposed e g analytical saad et al 1995 rabinovich et al 2016 rabinovich 2018 steady state methods ekrann and aasen 2000 virnovsky et al 2004 and dynamic methods darman et al 2002 much less literature deals with upscaling of capillary pressure saturation curves denoted pc sw this is mostly due to the fact that for many applications capillary effects are minor and pc sw can be neglected or modeled simplistically without considering spatial variations however in low rate flow such as gravity capillary driven flow spatial variations of pc curves known as capillary heterogeneity are extremely important we note that the upscaling literature discussed above is limited to darcy scale flow and an additional body of literature exists dealing with upscaling of pore scale flow to obtain permeability mostaghimi et al 2013 starnoni et al 2017 relative permeability raeini et al 2014 2015 and capillary pressure ferrari and lunati 2013 starnoni and pokrajac 2020 capillary heterogeneity is usually modeled by a relationship between pc and permeability k e g the leverett j function scaling flow with capillary heterogeneity is complex and computationally demanding to model particularly considering capillary entry pressure trapping a well known mechanism in pore scale flow lenormand et al 1983 this phenomenon is expressed in reservoir simulations by the constraint that a fully wetting phase saturated grid block i will not be invaded by a nonwetting phase from an adjacent block i 1 unless the capillary pressure of block i 1 exceeds the entry pressure of block i li 2011 this trapping mechanism constitutes a major difficulty in pc sw upscaling existing methods of capillary pressure upscaling generally consist of two different approaches the first is based on the assumption that capillary pressure representing a region similar to phase pressure can be be calculated simply by arithmetic averaging this is done either using a dynamic method pickup and sorbie 1996 or a steady state method virnovsky et al 2004 the second approach is to assume capillary limit conditions in which phases are in equilibrium and capillary pressure is constant in each upscaling volume this is usually referred to as the capillary limit cl upscaling method and applied in the majority of existing literature e g desbarats 1995 pickup et al 2000 lohne et al 2006 mouche et al 2010 the dynamic method is computationally expensive and has not been implemented in many studies with capillary heterogeneity the cl method however is very simple and computationally efficient and has been shown to be accurate for cases with little or no entry pressure effects to extend its application to cases with entry pressure trapping the cl method was combined with percolation considerations by a number of authors braun et al 2005 behzadi and alvarado 2012 yang et al 2013 wolff et al 2013 and used to model gravity capillary driven flow another extension of the cl method was introduced in rabinovich et al 2015 where coarse scale simulations were conducted iteratively to improve pc upscaling accuracy altogether the studies on capillary pressure upscaling discussed above have a number of shortcomings first all studies but one consider two dimensional flow problems a significant simplification in comparison to realistic three dimensional problems which often exhibit major differences in upscaling jankovic et al 2017 second the upscaling methods are tested on a limited number of examples and not necessarily choosing the most challenging conditions e g simple heterogeneity structures finally and most importantly many of the studies show that their method does not achieve sufficiently good results in this work we first show that all previous upscaling methods fail to reproduce fine scale simulations for a number of cases of gravity capillary driven flow various examples are presented with different problem parameters and cases pertaining to applications of gravity drainage oil recovery and co2 storage in aquifers the three dimensional capillary heterogeneous pc curves are upscaled to vary only in the vertical direction i e p c s w x y z p c s w z where denotes an upscaled property the first conclusion is that upscaling in these types of gravity segregation flows with capillary heterogeneity is an issue that has not been fully resolved despite the impression that may be created by some of the previous studies we also evaluate the different methods and discuss their accuracy showing for example that adding percolation considerations to cl upscaling does not have a significant impact on the upscaled models then we apply an optimization approach in which we seek p c such that upscaled simulations reproduce the fine scale solution accurately we find that assuming p c curves of brooks corey type brooks and corey 1966 and optimizing 100 parameters leads to sufficient accuracy of the upscaled simulations while the optimization upscaling method is computationally demanding it is the only method we found that can adequately model all the considered cases upscaling methods are evaluated not only by their accuracy but also by their computational efficiency global methods such as dynamic upscaling are computationally intense requiring a full fine scale simulation to calculate upscaled properties despite having acquired the fine scale solution the upscaling may still be a practical tool if it applies to other cases e g different realizations of the permeability other non global approaches such as analytical or semi analytical upscaling methods e g cl method with without percolation are much less computationally demanding in this work we propose a new upscaling approach using optimization this method is computationally expensive since in addition to being a global method it also requires many coarse scale simulations to optimize the upscaled capillary pressure curves nevertheless the purpose of applying this approach here is mainly to investigate whether we can find p c curves that accurately reproduce the fine scale saturation distribution having shown that existing upscaling methods fail optimization upscaling could nonetheless be a practical tool if it is found to be robust and here we show one example in which the same p c curves are used for different realizations in monte carlo simulations we emphasize that this work is only a first step and it is not our goal yet to perfect a new method or prove its applicability in the future we expect that optimization upscaling can be fine tuned and developed to be a powerful tool incorporating state of the art optimization algorithms we note that other model complexity reduction approaches such as vertical equilibrium yortsos 1995 gasda et al 2013 or invasion percolation ioannidis et al 1996 nooruddin and blunt 2018 simulators are outside the scope of this work the paper is planned as follows in section 2 we present the flow problem and simulation setup and in section 3 the upscaling problem considered here section 4 is a brief description of existing upscaling methods and section 5 presents results of applying these methods to a number of flow scenarios section 6 presents the new optimization upscaling method and discusses results of applying the method to various cases comparison to existing methods is carried out section 7 presents results for the new upscaling approach for ensemble averages of multiple realization simulations section 8 summarizes this work and highlights the main conclusions 2 problem statement we consider injection of a nonwetting phase into an aquifer or oil reservoir i e a wetting phase saturated formation for simplicity we assume that the nonwetting phase is co2 and the wetting phase is water however these could in fact be any other phases such as a gas injected into an oil reservoir injection is stopped after some time and the co2 is distributed throughout the aquifer with some initial saturation s co 2 init x y z this is the starting point for our problem then co2 will migrate due to buoyancy and capillary effects until a steady state is reached when the phases are in equilibrium we seek the saturation distribution s co 2 x y z at every moment in time until equilibrium the equations for the problem described above are considered to be those describing immiscible flow of two incompressible phases in an incompressible rock and given by mass conservation 1 ϕ s j t u j 0 and darcy s law 2 u j k r j μ j k p j ρ j g z where ϕ is the porosity of the rock krj the relative permeability to phase j j w for water or j co2 for carbon dioxide μj the viscosity of phase j pj the pressure of phase j u j the darcy velocity of phase j k the absolute permeability tensor ρj the density of phase j g is gravitational acceleration and z is the vertical coordinate in our cartesian system x y z pressures of the nonwetting and wetting phases are related by 3 p co 2 p w p c s w where pc sw is the capillary pressure curve as commonly assumed for the darcy scale hassanizadeh and gray 1993 starnoni and pokrajac 2020 the assumption of incompressible fluid is a reasonable approximation for a number of applications discussed previously particularly for upscaling studies related to co2 storage in aquifers when the co2 is assumed to be in a supercritical state mouche et al 2010 gasda et al 2013 yang et al 2013 rabinovich et al 2015 capillary heterogeneity is expressed by a dependence of pc sw on permeability and porosity leading to spatially varying curves this is typically modeled using the leverett j function as follows 4 p c s w k ϕ α ϕ k j s w where α is a fitting parameter for simplicity isotropic permeability is assumed here so that k is a scalar function this is not a requirement for this study but assumed in order to avoid defining pc as a function of the directional components of k often taken as the average two of the most widely used j functions are the van genuchten van genuchten 1980 denoted vg and brooks corey brooks and corey 1966 denoted bc models given by 5 j v g s w s w 1 m 1 1 m and 6 j b c s w s w 1 λ respectively where s w s w s w i 1 s w i swi is the irreducible water saturation and λ m are fitting parameters we note that hysteresis is not taken into account in our models despite that it may play an important role in post injection migration of co2 during imbibition however our focus is on upscaling and hysteresis is outside the scope of this work an important difference between the two j function models expressed in eqs 5 and 6 is that the first does not incorporate entry pressure trapping i e p c s w 1 0 while the second does we focus on this trapping phenomenon and therefore the bc model will mostly be used while the case with vg pc is shown to be a much simpler upscaling problem the solution of eqs 1 3 is obtained using a commercial reservoir simulator by computer modeling group cmg ltd i e the imex package imex 2000 fully implicit two phase oil water module where oil represents the co2 phase and water the brine phase this is a well established finite difference simulator has been used in numerous publications e g for modeling enhanced recovery e g zheng et al 2013 co2 storage e g nicot et al 2011 and coreflooding e g jackson et al 2018 the oil water module is chosen because it can be easily initialized to solve our governing equations relative permeability is considered to be of the form presented in brooks and corey 1966 commonly used in previous literature e g al menhali et al 2015 krause et al 2011 pickup and sorbie 1996 and given by 7a k r w c w s w n w 7b k r c o 2 c c o 2 1 s w n c o 2 where cw c c o 2 nw n c o 2 are fitting parameters taken to be c w c c o 2 1 and n w n c o 2 2 in this work as in previous studies e g virnovsky et al 2004 rabinovich et al 2019 random lognormally distributed permeability realizations are used generated using the sequential gaussian simulation deutsch and journel 1992 module of the stanford geostatistical modeling software sgems remy et al 2009 each realization is characterized by the permeability mean k variance of log permeability σ y 2 y ln k and dimensionless correlation lengths lx ly lz in the x y and z directions non dimensionalized by the domain length in the corresponding direction inputting pc from eq 4 with j function from 5 or 6 kr from eqs 7 a b and k realizations from sequential gaussian simulation into the simulator the fine scale solution is obtained on grids of 25 25 50 3 upscaling model this work focuses on upscaling pc curves and therefore fine scale permeability and kr will be used in the upscaled simulations upscaling in general involves a transition to a coarser grid in which upscaled properties are assigned to each coarse grid block the coarse grid simulations are associated with two types of error the first is due to the inaccuracy of representing varying properties within a coarse block with a single uniform value the second is a result of numerical dispersion i e errors due to a coarser discretization of the domain in this work we do not wish to consider the numerical dispersion errors therefore we define our upscaled domain as having the same resolution as the fine scale domain each grid block in the upscaled simulation will contain the same k s co 2 init and kr functions as the corresponding fine scale block however the upscaled simulation will have a different pc sw structure each layer of the model will have the same uniform pc sw curve i e p c i j l s w p c l s w where i j l are grid block indices the procedure is depicted in fig 1 where the fine scale simulation is shown to have a grid of 25 25 50 with the curve p c i j l s w assigned to block i j l the upscaled simulation is shown to have the same resolution but with p c l s w i e capillary pressure curves change only with changing layer the approach adopted here aims at constructing the simplest possible upscaling problem this is done as described above by taking an upscaled model that is identical to the fine scale apart from the capillary pressure functions this reduces much of the error observed in conventional upscaling work such an approach is taken since the issue of upscaling pc in gravity capillary flows is involved in fact we will show that despite the measures taken to simplify the problem large errors are observed in many of the upscaled simulations while this approach reduces upscaling errors it has a significant disadvantage computationally in conventional upscaling investigations a major contribution for reducing simulation time is the grid coarsening here the grid resolution remains the same and fine scale k and kr are used hindering computational time reduction nevertheless this approach is adequate considering the goals of this work to show that current methods are insufficient and that upscaled pc functions can be generated using optimization as previously stated it is not our goal to perfect a new upscaling method based on optimization which would of course entail focusing on computational reduction future work dealing with this topic should include grid coarsening as well as the upscaled pc functions presented here despite that computational reduction is not one of the main goals of this work we find that the simplified approach discussed above leads to significant improvement in computer time these results will be presented in section 6 2 we choose our upscaling volume to be layers of the 3d model and therefore it is implicitly assumed that we are interested in matching only the average saturations of each layer between the fine scale and upscaled models in fact it will be shown that the upscaled simulations lead to less saturation variations within each layer due to the uniform pc functions and at equilibrium saturation distribution is one dimensional i e constant within each layer this characteristic of the upscaled model resulting from horizontally uniform pc curves leads to a large improvement in computational time despite that the model still has a fine mesh with varying permeability we conclude that the current upscaling approach which was simplified in order to reduce errors still leads to significant reduction in computational cost 4 description of existing methods for pc upscaling in this section we will give a brief description of upscaling methods that have appeared in previous literature for more details on each method we refer the readers to citations given in section 1 4 1 simple averaging the first and simplest method for upscaling capillary pressure is obtained by averaging the fine scale capillary pressure curves it can be formulated for our upscaling model as follows 8 p c l p c s w h 1 n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y p c i j l α j s w n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y ϕ i j l k i j l where nx ny are the number of grid blocks in the x y directions and h denotes horizontal averaging i e over layers the last equality in eq 8 is obtained by substituting eq 4 in p c i j l this method has not been discussed anywhere in the literature as far as we are aware while it may seem rather intuitive since capillary pressure in a given region is thought to be represented by the average similar to phase pressure it is in fact quite naive because of the implicit assumption that saturation is uniform in each layer of the fine scale model 4 2 dynamic upscaling dynamic upscaling involves averaging capillary pressures and saturations at each time step over several grid blocks of a fine scale simulation pickup and sorbie 1996 the procedure is as follows 1 conduct a fine scale simulation of the flow problem and record the time evolution of sw and pc in each grid block i e s w i j l t p c i j l t 2 for each time step average sw and pc over the fine blocks that constitute the upscaling domain in our problem this is expressed as s w i j l t h p c i j l t h 3 matching pairs of saturations and capillary pressures at a given time produces a point on the p c curve i e p c l s w s w i j l t h p c i j l t h an implementation problem associated with this method is the requirement that saturation change substantially with time during fine scale simulations to obtain information on a significant portion of the curve in gravity capillary driven flow there is often insufficient variations and therefore only a very small portion of p c l s w is obtained particularly when capillary effects are dominant since simulators require a full smooth pc curve as input this leads to a problem 4 3 capillary limit upscaling assuming cl conditions in the upscaling domains means that phases are in equilibrium and therefore capillary pressure is constant this allows to calculate the saturation of each grid block for a given overall capillary pressure and then upscaling is done by averaging the procedure is as follows desbarats 1995 pickup et al 2000 1 derive sw pc k ϕ by inverting eq 4 with j function from eq 5 or 6 2 choose a value of capillary pressure p c 0 3 calculate s w i j l at each fine scale grid block by substituting p c 0 k i j l and ϕ i j l in the sw pc k ϕ formula if the entry pressure of block i j l is larger than p c 0 then that block will be assigned s w i j l 1 4 average s w i j l over upscaling domains i e s w i j l h in our problem 5 obtain a point on the upscaled curve for each layer by pairing averaged saturation with equilibrium capillary pressure p c l s w i j l h p c 0 6 repeat steps 2 5 scanning values of p c 0 between 0 and to obtain full upscaled curves p c l s w for each layer 4 4 capillary limit upscaling with percolation this method involves applying the procedure described in section 4 3 with additional percolation considerations braun et al 2005 behzadi and alvarado 2012 yang et al 2013 wolff et al 2013 in step 3 of the procedure if block i j l does not have a connected pathway to some block with a nonzero co2 saturation then there is no available co2 to enter that block and it should remain fully water saturated a connected pathway is defined by a sequence of adjacent blocks with sw 1 therefore we first develop an algorithm to find all connected blocks in our domain each time that step 3 is repeated we find all connected structures and determine whether they have a connection to blocks with initial saturation i e cells with s co 2 init i j l 0 if they do not then all blocks in the structure will remain with s w i j l 1 otherwise they will be given the cl saturation values 5 results for existing methods the first step for initiating the gravity capillary flow model is to generate initial saturation distributions s co 2 init x y z this is done by simulating point injection of co2 at the upper or lower boundaries of the domain modeling situations related to gravity drainage oil recovery top injection or co2 geological storage bottom injection the two initial saturation distributions used in this work are presented in fig 2 results are for a vertical cross section through the center of the domain fig 2a b and for layer averaged saturation fig 2c for the top injection fig 2a there is a total of 1 6 pore volumes injected pvi leading to an average saturation of s co 2 init 0 53 while for the bottom injection fig 2b there is 0 16 pvi with s co 2 init 0 09 the smaller pvi in the bottom injection case is intended to model a co2 storage scenario which typically involves much smaller injected volumes in comparison to the total reservoir volume fig 2c presents the horizontally averaged initial co2 saturation s co 2 init h for each layer of the model where layer 1 is the top and layer 0 the bottom it is evident that s co 2 init in the case of top injection covers almost the entire domain however a trend is visible with saturation of 0 706 at the top layer and 0 37 at the bottom layer the bottom injection case however shows that hardly any co2 is at the top with average values of 0 003 at the top layer and 0 167 at the bottom layer we note that the same two initial saturation distributions will be used for all the results in the following sections to easily compare between different cases next gravity capillary flow is simulated beginning with s co 2 init x y z and ending when equilibrium is reached and phase velocities are zero everywhere the parameter inputs are given by eqs 4 7 phase densities are ρ w 1037 8 kg m3 and ρ c o 2 103 78 kg m3 viscosity ratio is μ w μ c o 2 12 porosity is constant with ϕ 0 2 and permeability realizations consist of k 100 md and l x l y l z 0 1 log permeability variance σ y 2 and capillary pressure parameters α m λ are varied and will be specified separately for each case these input parameters are also used to generate s co 2 init x y z and the same k realization with σ y 2 1 is used for both cases of bottom fig 2a and top fig 2b injection the saturation distribution is generated by injecting co2 via an injection well completed in a single grid cell at a constant rate of 0 001 m3 day for a duration of 0 1 day for the top injection and 0 01 day for the bottom injection the opposite boundary contains a production well with bhp of 700 kpa completed in a single cell fig 3 presents results for existing methods considering vg capillary pressure eq 5 for two cases of top injection the first case fig 3a c consists of parameters α 1 m 0 75 and a realization with σ y 2 1 while the second case fig 3d f is for α 1 m 0 4 and σ y 2 3 the different methods described in section 4 are applied to calculate the p c l s w curves and then upscaled simulations are conducted producing saturation for each grid block we note that the method of cl upscaling with percolation is not relevant to the vg case since there is no entry pressure trapping i e for any p c 0 all grid blocks have sw 1 and are therefore fully connected to evaluate the accuracy of upscaled simulations we compare the horizontally averaged saturation results with the corresponding fine scale ones i e s co 2 h with s co 2 fine h the comparison is held for 3 different simulation times labeled as transient 1 transient 2 and equilibrium and corresponding to simulation of 0 01 days 0 1 days and 10 days results in fig 3 show that all upscaling methods generally produce similar saturation profiles and these are in excellent agreement with the fine scale solution except for the case in fig 3b which presents a visible mismatch errors for the upscaled simulations are quantified by calculating the average saturation difference i e s co 2 h s co 2 fine h and these are presented in table 1 as a rule of thumb we find that errors below 0 05 are sufficiently low and correspond to a visual agreement between fine scale and upscaled results while errors of 0 05 0 1 are significant yet can often be tolerated errors above 0 1 are generally non reasonable and the upscaling is considered not applicable it can be seen that all error values are below 0 05 except the case in fig 3b equilibrium state solutions in the vg cases have an analytical solution nordbotten and dahle 2010 nordbotten and celia 2011 bedrikovetsky 2013 rabinovich and cheng 2020 and they are shown to be matched perfectly by the dynamic upscaling method errors of 0 0044 and 0 0003 the other two methods simple averaging and cl also match the fine scale very well at equilibrium conditions and appear to be even slightly better in the transient regime surprisingly the simple averaging method is perhaps the best overall despite its naive approach explained in section 4 1 the large error for transient 2 case in fig 3b is unexpected and indicates that even for the vg case at some points in time during vertical migration the upscaled simulations could have errors due to underestimation of capillary effects will be discussed further below however errors are limited in size 0 08 and in time only transient 2 so the general conclusion drawn from this analysis is that for capillary pressure functions without entry pressure such as vg upscaling is a rather simple problem and all the methods produce fairly accurate results all further test cases will consider only bc type capillary pressure fig 4 presents the saturation distribution in a vertical cross section considering the case of vg pc m 0 75 and σ y 2 1 presented in fig 3a c the plots illustrate the saturation migration with time under the influence of gravity and capillary forces the fine scale transient 1 case fig 4e is seen to resemble the initial distribution fig 2a since it is only 0 01 days after end of injection transient 2 fig 4c shows partial segregation in which a region of almost full water saturation exists at the bottom of the domain and equilibrium conditions fig 4a show that most of the fluids are segregated with some saturation variations apparent due to capillary effects the upscaled simulations fig 4b d f with p c curves obtained using simple averaging consist of much smoother saturation variations as a result of the uniform p c in each layer nevertheless in the transient cases fig 4d f some 3d variations are seen and observed to be somewhat similar to the fine scale variations fig 4c e the equilibrium upscaled saturation fig 4b on the other hand is completely layered this is because when phase velocities are zero everywhere the saturation solution is only governed by the hydrostatic capillary pressure variation and the pc sw function variation eq 4 which are both 1d and varying only in the z direction for more details see analytical solutions considering similar cases presented in rabinovich and cheng 2020 the agreement between fine scale and upscaled simulations can be roughly assessed observing fig 4 mainly by evaluating the extent of the full water saturation region at the bottom of the domain comparing the transient 1 simulations fig 4e and f it can be seen that the agreement is good with a thin layer of water at the bottom for the equilibrium simulations fig 4a and b agreement also appears to be good and these results are in line with those presented in fig 3 and table 1 however as discussed previously some mismatch between fine scale and upscaled results is seen in the transient 2 case fig 4c and d the distribution plots help to illustrate the source of the mismatch in general gravity works to segregate the phases while capillary effects have an opposite impact of pushing co2 to the lower parts for fine scale simulations each grid block has a different pc curve and therefore more capillary pressure gradients are created thus the co2 will generally remain in lower parts of the domain in comparison to the upscaled simulations which have less capillary pressure gradients as a result of the uniform p c curves in each layer this is seen comparing fig 4c and d and in agreement with the lower average co2 saturation for the upscaled simulations seen in the lower region in fig 3b we now apply the methods described in section 4 to bc capillary pressure considering first a case of α 1 λ 4 and σ y 2 3 fig 5 presents fine scale and upscaled pc curves for a single representative layer in the model the layer is chosen randomly from the lower part of the domain however other layers have similar curves both in shape and magnitude e g entry pressure for dynamic upscaling is between 0 25 0 58 only 25 of the 625 fine scale curves gray are plotted for illustration and those curves which are not plotted all fall in the same range of capillary pressures it is evident that these curve vary significantly due to a large variation in entry pressure as dictated by the large permeability variance the simple averaging method magenta is situated roughly in the middle in between the fine scale curves as can be expected the cl with percolation is the only method that depends on s co 2 init and therefore we present the curve for top and bottom injection separately crosses and circles it can be seen that in both injection schemes the percolation leads only to a small alteration of the curves from the cl curve red in 2d and 1d models there are much fewer possibilities for connected pathways and therefore percolation considerations will have a more significant impact behzadi and alvarado 2012 however considering the cl method in our 3d model most grid blocks with co2 have a connected pathway to the s co 2 init 0 blocks see section 4 4 and therefore percolation has only a minor impact on the curves fig 6 presents results for all four upscaling methods considering the case of injection at the top boundary fig 2a and bc capillary pressure eq 6 with varying parameters and for 2 different times i e equilibrium t 10 days and transient t 0 1 days corresponding upscaling errors are detailed in table 2 for α 1 λ 2 and σ y 2 1 fig 6a b results are reasonable for all methods with tolerable errors of up to 0 083 particularly good results are seen for cl errors 0 003 0 029 the dynamic and simple averaging are shown to have a significant error at the lower part of the domain underestimating the co2 saturation this is a typical characteristic of upscaled models saadatpoor et al 2011 which have less capillary heterogeneity and therefore less trapping opportunities leading to less trapped co2 in the lower parts and consequently more co2 at the upper parts the same is observed in fig 6c d when raising λ to 4 but with even more error 0 084 0 122 even for cl methods errors of 0 035 0 057 fig 6e f present results for a case of fairly low capillary pressure impact i e α 0 2 λ 2 and σ y 2 1 and the curves are seen to be varying more smoothly with elevation at equilibrium the upscaling results approximately match the fine scale however in the transient state an error is seen for all methods this result shows another difficulty in the gravity capillary upscaling problem i e that the transient state is sometimes difficult to capture even in cases where equilibrium is approximated well seen also in the vg case of fig 3b fig 6g h represent the most difficult case we consider when both capillary effects and entry pressure effects are maximized the dynamic and simple averaging methods are shown to have the largest errors in this case 0 095 0 168 the cl methods still approximately match the fine scale at equilibrium however the errors are present in the transient regime 0 07 the main reason for errors between fine scale and upscaled models is that the latter have much less pc function variations entry pressure trapping is based on the principle that co2 will not penetrate an adjacent grid block which is fully saturated with water until its capillary pressure exceeds the entry pressure of that grid block in the fine scale model each block has a different entry pressure and therefore there is a larger probability for small pc blocks surrounded by high entry pressure blocks leading to co2 trapping on the other hand the upscaled model has the same pc for each layer and therefore the same entry pressure if co2 penetrates any block in a given layer it can then migrate laterally eliminating fully water saturated blocks in that layer and removing the possibility of entry pressure trapping due to this process upscaled models tend to underestimate trapping allowing for more co2 to rise to the top layers as observed in fig 6 and in following figures as well it is very likely that this underestimation is related to capillary entry pressure values of the upscaled curves in general observing fig 6 we first find that cl with percolation upscaling produces almost identical results as cl without percolation consistent with our findings in fig 5 second we see that the cl is the most accurate method while the dynamic and simple averaging methods have very limited accuracy for this reason we do not continue to evaluate these two methods concluding that they are not adequate for cases with capillary entry pressure transient saturation profiles are seen to be generally more difficult to approximate in upscaled models and the cl also has significant errors in this regime for some cases finally we see that the errors consistently present themselves as underestimation of co2 in the lower parts of the domain and overestimation at the upper parts in line with the explanation provided in the previous paragraph fig 7 presents results comparing upscaled and fine scale simulations considering bottom injection fig 2b and bc capillary pressure eq 6 with varying parameters and for 2 different times i e equilibrium t 10 days and transient t 0 01 days only results for cl upscaling with and without percolation are presented because the other two methods are extremely inaccurate as already established in the previous analysis furthermore it is clear that in all cases the method of cl with percolation leads to saturation profiles which approximately coincide with the regular cl profiles indicating that percolation does not contribute this has already been discussed previously in fig 5 and regarding the top injection cases in fig 6 observing the equilibrium results in fig 7a c e g we see that the fine scale saturation consists of a region of trapped co2 spanning from layer 10 15 until the bottom of the domain and at the top is a region of abruptly increasing co2 this structure is dominated by the entry pressure trapping mechanism and is clearly different than the top injection case it is apparent that the upscaled models cannot replicate the bottom region which occurs due to this mechanism therefore extremely large errors develop at the upper parts e g the co2 at the top layer is overestimated by over 0 2 in fig 7g almost twice as much as the fine scale value the exception is fig 7e where the upscaled profiles match the fine scale ones because the capillary effects are small α 0 2 and there is no co2 trapped in the lower parts of the domain in general as the trapping is increased e g for larger σ y 2 fig 7g there will be more errors in the upscaled models saturation errors corresponding to fig 7 are presented in table 3 in these models an important result is the amount of co2 that reaches the top layer since co2 storage models are often employed to estimate these values as a means of assessing the possibility of leakage through the cap rock it is seen in fig 7a c and g that the co2 at the top layer is terribly overestimated with errors of 0 09 0 18 and 0 23 respectively this is despite that the overall errors are only 0 56 0 88 and 0 11 errors for the transient case are significantly smaller than for equilibrium this is because in bottom injection errors generally develop over time as co2 raises and the trapped amounts in the lower part are not predicted by the upscaled models nevertheless the errors are not negligible as seen in the agreement of the curves in fig 7b d f and h furthermore error values are somewhat misleading since they are not normalized i e errors of 0 01 still constitute more than 10 of the overall average saturation in bottom injection cases to summarize the bottom injection results we find that the cl method fails to estimate the saturation profiles particularly at equilibrium conditions 6 optimization upscaling approach the idea for using optimization algorithms in order to calculate upscaled single phase or multiphase flow parameters has appeared in previous literature e g wang et al 2009 mckee et al 2013 krogstad et al 2014 alpak 2015 however this idea is far from having been fully explored has gained very little attention and has not been seriously adopted in practice we have shown in the previous section that the problem of gravity capillary flow with capillary entry pressure effects cannot be handled by conventional methods of pc upscaling and therefore we resort to an optimization approach the method and results of the optimization upscaling is presented in the following 6 1 method we assume that upscaled capillary pressure functions are of the same form as the fine scale ones given by 9 p c l α l s w 1 λ l where αl and λl are the optimization parameters for each layer l of the model in this work we have 50 vertical layers i e 1 l 50 and therefore there are 100 parameters to be determined by optimization the objective function which we minimize is given by 10 o j s 1 m l 1 n s co 2 fine t s h l s co 2 t s h l 2 where n 50 and ts are the time steps which are considered in the optimization m 3 in the examples presented here the optimization algorithm used in this work is matlab s fminsearch based on the simplex search method of lagarias et al 1998 it is a non gradient based method and is not guaranteed to converge to a global minimum it was chosen since it can optimize many variables it is simple to operate and able to achieve adequate results with reasonable computational time the procedure is detailed as follows 1 obtain horizontally averaged fine scale saturation s co 2 fine t s h l for each layer l and for each chosen time step ts from simulation 2 choose initial guess of the parameters i e α l init λ l init 3 run fminsearch optimization to obtain αl λl using the objective function of eq 10 for only one ts pertaining to equilibrium conditions 4 input αl λl from previous step as initial parameters α l init λ l init 5 run fminsearch optimization using the objective function of eq 10 for all ts values i e 1 s m to obtain final values of αl λl and consequently the upscaled curves given by substitution of estimated parameters in eq 9 we find that in general the optimization procedure is sensitive to the initial guess of parameters α l init λ l init applying the optimization algorithm to only a single time ts step 3 and then using the output for a second optimization run step 5 is intended to improve results by lowering the sensitivity furthermore we find that this two step approach reduces the number of iterations required for convergence and therefore also the computational time 6 2 optimization upscaling results in this section we present and discuss the results for optimization upscaling fig 8 shows a comparison between fine scale and upscaled simulations using the method described in the previous section to obtain p c results are for top injection and the cases considered correspond to those discussed in section 5 an agreement between fine scale and upscaled saturation profiles can be clearly seen comparing fig 8 to fig 6 shows that the optimization method does not present significant underestimation of the co2 saturation at the lower region as was observed for the existing methods fig 6c d f and h on the other hand the optimization method of upscaling leads to some abrupt changes in the saturation profiles i e oscillations around the fine scale solution particularly in fig 8g h comparing the optimization and cl methods we find that the optimization results are more accurate for the transient regime where we have discussed in section 5 that the cl method has lower accuracy for equilibrium saturation both methods appear to be adequate however the optimization results present oscillations around the fine scale solution while the cl method saturation is a smoother fit to the fine scale table 4 presents the overall errors in saturation for optimization upscaling and the middle column pertains to the top injection cases the conclusions from the figures are supported by the table showing that the optimization errors are always significantly smaller than the cl errors see table 2 for comparison in the transient cases the equilibrium cases on the other hand have mixed results comparing cl and optimization upscaling nevertheless the errors for equilibrium conditions are sufficiently small for both methods so error differences have low significance while for the transient cases the cl has some large errors 0 07 and 0 071 in fig 6f and h in general all the errors for top injection observed in table 4 are considered sufficiently small less than 0 05 and the optimization method is shown to be applicable fig 9 presents results for bottom injection the most significant achievement of the optimization upscaling is seen in the equilibrium saturation profiles in fig 9a c e and g the upscaled simulations produce saturations that are able to capture the entry pressure trapping in the lower regions and consequently also match the co2 quantities that reach the top this overcomes the biggest difficulty we observed in the existing methods which lead to nearly zero co2 in the lower region and resulted in very large errors see fig 7a c and g as in the top injection cases some abrupt changes in the saturation profiles are seen however this is not significant amounting to only a few layers with zero saturation in the trapping region and not substantially impacting errors the fine scale solutions in the transient cases presented in fig 9b d f and h are also seen to be matched by the upscaled simulations some mismatch is seen similar in magnitude to that observed in the cl method results of fig 7b d f and h as in the equilibrium results some jumps in saturation are apparent however these are few in number confined to only a number of layers and the contribution to the overall error is small errors for bottom injection are detailed in the rightmost column of table 4 equilibrium cases are shown to have small errors all below 0 03 and significantly lower than the cl method errors see table 3 for cases with entry pressure trapping a c and g the case with small capillary effects e has similar accuracy for both methods considering the co2 saturation in the top layer the optimization upscaling has a dramatic improvement over the cl method with errors of 0 016 0 002 and 0 012 for cases a c and g respectively the transient case errors are shown to be sufficiently small cases b d f and g and similar in size compared to the cl method table 3 overall the optimization upscaling for bottom injection has errors well below 0 05 and even smaller than top injection errors for almost all cases fig 10 presents results for pc curves for the case of α 1 λ 4 and σ y 2 3 considering both top and bottom injection the entry pressure for the fine scale curves is seen to be in the range of 10 2 to 2 10 1 and this is similar to the fine scale curves in fig 5 same case but different curves chosen randomly the upscaled curves have much larger values with entry pressure of 100 for top injection and 101 for bottom injection these values are also much larger than the upscaled curves of the existing methods fig 5 which are seen to have values of up to 4 10 1 this is the main difference between the optimization curves and the curves of the existing methods and helps illustrate the reason for the improved accuracy of the former we have already established in section 5 that the upscaled models with existing methods significantly underestimate the co2 trapping in the lower regions particularly for the bottom injection case the optimization pc curves have a much larger entry pressure α which leads to significantly more co2 trapping in the lower region and thus the improved agreement with fine scale simulations this phenomenon is discussed in rabinovich and cheng 2020 it appears that only with the optimization approach we are able to reach entry pressure values which are large enough to obtain accurate upscaled simulations however we cannot determine that this is the only reason for the improved accuracy of the optimization upscaling and it is generally expected to be a combination of entry pressure shape and spatial variation of the pc curves optimization with less parameters was tested by considering the same p c z for every 2 5 or 10 layers this reduces the number of parameters in the optimization to 50 20 or 10 respectively instead of the 100 parameters optimized when considering a p c z for each layer as conducted in all previous cases results for overall error as a function of the number of parameters are plotted in fig 11 for t 0 01 transient case t 0 05 t 0 2 and equilibrium cases it is apparent that the error decreases continuously and rather slowly logarithmic decrease with number of parameters this provides some insight regarding the optimization procedure first the same error was not achieved using less parameters and the continuous slow logarithmic decrease gives an explanation for the large number of parameters required to obtain a sufficiently small error second the results for t 0 05 and 0 2 allow to address the issue of overfitting overfitting during the optimization could result in case specific parameters which apply only to the fitted cases we apply the same parameters optimized only for t 0 01 0 1 and equilibrium to two other test times t 0 05 and 0 2 results in fig 11 show that the errors for the test times are similar to the fitted times and also decrease monotonically with the number of parameters suggesting that there is no significant overfitting in relation to time we emphasize that in this work the optimization is intended to obtain the best possible match for a single simulation case with given parameters k kr s c o 2 init etc and the optimized parameters are not intended to be used for other cases this is similar to any upscaling procedure which is normally applied to each case separately to obtain unique case specific upscaled curves however global upscaling methods are sometimes tested for applicability to cases with different k realizations in stochastic flow solutions and we apply this test to our upscaled curves in the next section when we consider ensemble averages as discussed in section 3 the optimization approach is presented here to show its feasibility for upscaling capillary pressure considering gravity capillary driven flow computational reduction is not one of the main goals for this initial investigation nevertheless in table 5 we present the computational time for our simulations for both the fine scale and upscaled problems the 8 cases appearing in sections 5 and 6 2 pertaining to bc capillary pressure both top and bottom injection are considered upscaled simulation times are representative considering pc curves obtained using any upscaling method i e existing methods or optimization results pertain to simulations run on a single intel i7 8700 cpu with maximum clock speed of 3 2ghz a significant reduction in simulation time is seen for the upscaled model with speedups of up to 389 7 upscaling of ensemble averaged solutions global upscaling methods such as the optimization procedure presented above have a significant disadvantage of requiring a full fine scale simulation therefore these methods are often only used for theoretical studies or as a stepping stone towards developing local methods which do not require fine scale simulations if however the upscaled properties calculated for one problem can be used in other problems e g considering ensemble average solutions of different permeability realizations initial saturation distributions or capillary pressure curves then the upscaling method becomes a practical tool this robustness characteristic of the upscaled properties will be examined here considering ensemble average saturation profiles of different realizations reservoir parameters such as the permeability distribution are generally unknown and flow modeling must take this into account a common approach is to model the permeability as a random space function and to generate many possible realizations of k using geostatistical models which honor the data collected from the field then monte carlo simulation can be carried out to assess possible flow solutions resulting from the different permeability realizations we consider solutions of the gravity segregation problem for different realizations of lognormally distributed k in the previous section we calculated the saturation solution using upscaled pc curves obtained by optimization this was carried out for one k realization we now generate four more realizations and use the same upscaled pc to calculate saturation profiles with coarse simulations it is emphasized that due to the reuse of p c only one fine scale simulation was required to obtain all five saturation profiles corresponding to the five realizations this is a significant reduction of computational time since upscaled simulations have a speedup factor of up to 389 for top injection and 57 for bottom injection in comparison to the fine scale ones see table 5 fig 12 presents results for the ensemble average of the saturation profiles pertaining to all five realizations upscaled p c are calculated by optimization only to a single realization this is done in two different upscaling resolutions the first is by considering a different p c z for each layer leading to 100 parameters in the optimization blue lines in figure as discussed in section 6 1 the second resolution considers different p c z for each five layers leading to only 20 optimization parameters red lines in figure naturally reducing the number of p c functions will result in less accurate upscaling for a single realization as seen in fig 11 and less optimization computational time however it is apparent in the figure that in all cases the lower resolution of optimization 20 variables leads to more robust p c functions that apply to averages of different realizations i e the upscaled ensemble average for 20 variables is a better approximation to the fine scale than the 100 variable case this is somewhat intuitive considering that a higher resolution of optimization will lead to more case specific results while reducing the number of optimized parameters allows for more flexibility i e the accuracy of the single realization optimization is sacrificed to improve the accuracy of other realizations fig 12 a d present results for top injection ensemble averaged saturation profiles and the corresponding overall errors are presented in table 6 the upscaled simulations with 20 variables in the optimization method approximately match the fine scale simulation results with agreement comparable to that seen in the single realization case fig 8a b g h and table 4 particularly for the cases in subplots a and b bottom injection results are presented in fig 12e h and are seen to be much more challenging to upscale as observed before in the previous sections nevertheless the results for 20 variable optimization upscaling are reasonable and the match for equilibrium cases fig 12e g and table 6 are far better than the cl results for a single realization fig 7a g and table 3 it appears from the results of fig 12 that the reduced resolution optimization upscaling e g 20 variables can be calculated for one realization and then used in simulations with other realizations in order to calculate ensemble averages the analysis was also carried out using 10 realizations instead of only 5 and the results were similar in accuracy i e there appears to be no significant improvement in agreement between fine scale and upscaled saturation profiles for additional realizations in the ensemble average we emphasize that results for each realization separately were not presented in this section but rather only for their ensemble mean as mentioned previously we do not expect that the same parameters can be used separately for different realizations just as existing upscaling methods are normally not applied this way it is one of the limitation of numerical upscaling however ensemble averages are easier to replicate with the same upscaled pc curves and this is shown possible here by reducing the number of optimization parameters so that the curves become less case specific 8 summary and conclusions this work presents a thorough investigation of capillary pressure upscaling for the purpose of reducing computational cost of gravity capillary driven flow simulations an initial saturation distribution is allowed to migrate due to gravity and capillary forces without any flow sources or sinks all boundaries are considered impenetrable and two types of initial saturations are used in the examples injection of co2 at the top and bottom of the domain upscaling is carried out only for pc and all other parameters are the same for the upscaled and fine scale simulations pc functions are upscaled from 25 25 50 to 1 1 50 i e p c is only a function of z the first part of the investigation is a test of existing pc upscaling methods considering the case of vg capillary pressure curves without entry pressure we find that all methods generally work well particularly the simple averaging method which was not considered in previous literature nevertheless in one case we found errors in the transient stage of the simulation suggesting that this stage is more prone to error next bc capillary pressure is tested for top injection we show that the equilibrium saturation profile is approximated well using capillary limit upscaling while the other methods result in large errors for the transient stage of simulations more errors are apparent some of which we consider over the reasonable error threshold for bottom injection the equilibrium or late transient stages of the simulation are the most difficult to estimate with upscaled models only capillary limit upscaling is considered because other methods lead to extremely large errors as already mentioned regarding top injection even for the two cl methods with and without percolation very large errors are observed for equilibrium cases our conclusion is that for gravity capillary dominated flow scenarios with significant capillary heterogeneity large λ and σ y 2 or bottom injection of small amounts of co2 existing upscaling methods are inadequate furthermore we conclude that the popular cl method with percolation leads to similar results as the regular cl method in many three dimensional lognormal k distributions in the second part of this work we investigate whether any form of bc type p c curves can be defined to obtain accurate upscaled simulations to do so we introduce an optimization approach to upscaling the results show that indeed this is possible and for all cases we find p c curves leading to sufficiently accurate matches between upscaled and fine scale simulations the optimization upscaling is a global method requiring a computationally demanding fine scale simulation to arrive at the p c curves we show that it could nevertheless serve as a practical tool by reusing the p c curves in simulations of different realizations e g for obtaining average saturation profiles in monte carlo simulations despite efforts made to suggest implementation of optimization upscaling in practical real world problems it is not one of the main goals of this work and requires further study and improvement in the future a method could be developed based on the ideas presented here for practical purposes the following issues should be taken into consideration first grid coarsening should be incorporated in the upscaling method which will require permeability and relative permeability upscaling as well second typical upscaling volumes should be considered which are limited in both vertical and horizontal extent e g 5 5 10 as opposed to the full layer volumes used here 1 1 50 this is expected to be a more difficult problem and an approach to reduce the number of parameters in the optimization will be required e g quasiglobal upscaling alpak 2015 finally a variety of pc function structures and optimization algorithms should be evaluated to study which are most accurate and computationally efficient we believe the conclusions of this work will help bring attention to errors associated with upscaling gravity capillary dominated flows e g in applications of modelling co2 storage existing methods such as cl should not be used without taking extreme care as trapped co2 quantities may be significantly underestimated furthermore the optimization upscaling results show that there is a way to define p c using conventional bc type functions and obtain sufficient accuracy one attribute of these upscaled curves is their large entry pressure which is shown to be significantly larger than in curves calculated using existing methods these findings open the possibility for future investigations with either of two approaches physics based upscaling methods or optimization methods while the optimization upscaling is generally computationally demanding it can be useful if further developed to be highly efficient and robust credit

452,in the present work a suite of numerical experiments with linear stability analysis are conducted to study density driven flow with chemical dissolution of two reactive fluids in synthetic porous media linear stability analysis at the darcy scale is first performed to predict the interfacial phenomena and instability at the initial time pore scale simulations using the lattice boltzmann method lbm are further conducted to capture more mechanistic information and advance the understanding of the transport processes under different scenarios it is demonstrated that the transport processes exhibit distinct behaviors which are largely dominated by the interplay among density contrast chemical reaction rate and evolution of the porosity permeability all the results indicate that the interfacial instability can be triggered by the density contrast between two miscible fluids leading to the rayleigh taylor r t instability the r t instability can be suppressed by the heterogeneous surface reaction between the fluid and solid phases which prevents the transport of the denser fluid over the long term it is found that the interfacial instability is influenced by the evolution of the porosity permeability due to dissolution which potentially restarts the transport of the denser fluid keywords reactive transport density driven flow chemical dissolution linear stability analysis pore scale modeling lattice boltzmann method 1 introduction density driven flow with mineral dissolution precipitation can be found in many geological applications szulczewski et al 2012 tan et al 2016 bui et al 2018 ipcc 2005 for instance during the transport processes of co2 in geological storage the injected co2 first dissolves into the subsurface brine and forms a diffusive boundary layer and then the acidic and denser mixture falls down under gravity and reacts with the aquifer matrix szulczewski et al 2013 unwin et al 2015 such processes are complex due to the strong coupling and interactions among the flow chemical reaction as well as the evolution of the porous matrix lemieux 2011 macminn et al 2010 which fundamentally are driven by the interplay among density driven flow chemical reaction and fluid solid interactions specifically the properties of the miscible fluid vary with the concentration of the solvent such as the density which leads to the formation of the rayleigh taylor r t or gravity instability at the miscible interface de wit 2004 2001 fu and juanes 2013 szulczewski et al 2013 gopalakrishnan et al 2017 in addition dissolution of the aquifer matrix which causes the dynamic changes of the porosity and permeability may also affect the instability of the convection dominant processes osselin et al 2016 szymczak and ladd 2013 2012 2014 macminn and juanes 2013 there have been extensive studies focusing on the density driven miscible flows the heterogeneous reactions between acidic solution and bedrocks and the interfacial instability in geological settings huppert and neufeld 2014 zhang et al simulated the transport processes of co2 mixture at the pore scale the research focus of which lies in the sensitivity of the parameters e g the rayleigh number on the solute transport chen and zhang 2010 riaz et al performed the linear stability analysis to investigate the instability growth on the mixing interface between co2 and saline water riaz et al 2006 backhaus et al 2011 considering the heterogeneous reactions fu et al studied the interfacial instability and the pore morphology change due to dissolution in density driven flows using three dimensional simulations at the darcy scale fu and juanes 2013 fu et al 2015 ward et al theoretically analyzed the density driven convection with heterogeneous reactions in synthetic porous media their results showed that the interfacial instability can be triggered by density driven convection ward et al 2014 it is also noted that the heterogeneous reaction consumes solvent in the incoming stream and the instability decays as the reaction rate increases when the reaction rate is large enough the interfacial instability due to the density difference will not be triggered in addition andres and cardoso systematically investigated density driven flow with reactions in infinite porous media using a combination of laboratory experiments theoretical analysis and numerical simulations cardoso and andres 2014 andres and cardoso 2012 however the evolution of porosity and permeability due to chemical reactions was not considered in refs ward et al 2014 cardoso and andres 2014 andres and cardoso 2012 which is reported to have strong effects on the interfacial behaviors szymczak and ladd 2012 oltean et al 2013 ameli et al 2014 szymczak and ladd 2014 therefore the interplay among the density driven flow heterogeneous reaction as well as the evolution of the porous matrix especially at fundamental scales remains unexplored to the best of our knowledge in summary previous studies on density driven flow with heterogeneous reactions are mostly based on numerical simulations or linear stability analysis at the darcy scale however the effective parameters at the darcy scale such as the effective permeability and effective diffusion coefficient are difficult to quantify when reactions occur specifically with the dissolution of porous matrix leading to inaccurate predictions of the darcy scale transport processes the particular focus of the present study is to investigate the reactive transport processes of density driven flow with dissolution the interfacial instability and the associated influencing factors using a multiscale analysis approach i e the darcy scale theoretical analysis i e linear stability analysis and pore scale numerical simulations we first perform linear stability analysis which is a useful tool to predict the interfacial instability of reactive transport processes at the initial time the effect of the potential impact factors e g density contrast on the interfacial instability can be diagnosed through linear stability analysis meanwhile numerical simulations at the pore scale can provide detailed growth of the instability in longer terms furthermore at the pore scale the solid and fluid fraction and solid liquid interface are distinguished so that the heterogeneous reaction on the interface along with the dynamic change of the pore structure can be accurately described in recent decades a group of pore scale models for simulating flow and reactive transport have been developed benchmarked and utilized molins et al 2014 molins 2015 kang et al 2014 yang et al 2016 among them the lattice boltzmann method lbm has become one of the most popular numerical approaches due to its easy treatment of complex boundaries and accelerated computational efficiency chai and zhao 2013 succi 2001 guo et al 2002 yoon et al 2015 kang et al 2010 the lbm has been widely utilized to simulate flow and reactive transport in porous media especially those with pore structure change for example kang et al simulated incompressible flow transport and interface reaction processes using the lbm at the pore scale and furthermore assessed the changes of permeability and porosity induced by dissolution kang et al 2014 in the current research we study the reactive transport of density driven flow with chemical dissolution in two dimensional homogeneous porous media using a multiscale approach that combines darcy scale theoretical analysis and pore scale simulations linear stability analysis is first conducted to estimate the influence of chemical reaction on the interfacial instability pore scale lbm simulations of the reactive transport processes in micro models are further carried out to capture more mechanistic information and advance the understanding of the fundamental phenomena the interplay among the density contrast the chemical reaction rate and the evolution of the porosity permeability is presented and discussed in different simulation scenarios the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the governing equations and numerical methods at the darcy and pore scales section 3 presents the results from darcy scale linear stability analysis and pore scale lbm simulations followed by the conclusions in section 4 2 methodology the analysis of the density driven convection with chemical dissolution of the porous matrix depends on the accurate descriptions of flow and reactive transport particularly the dissolution and the associated evolution of the aquifer matrix in the current study such complex processes in natural subsurface environments are confined in a two dimensional 2d synthetic porous medium for simplicity we assume that the flow is incompressible and boussinesq hypothesis is satisfied furthermore chemical reactions occur as the incoming fluids with solute contact with the porous matrix finally the fluid density is assumed to be linear in the solute concentration 2 1 governing equations 2 1 1 darcy scale equations as shown in fig 1 a a 2d homogeneous porous medium is adopted as the modeling domain for linear stability analysis at the darcy scale in which two reactive solutes are injected from the left boundary with the same volume in particular the solute concentrations in the upper denoted by yellow and lower denoted by green regions are c i n and c 0 0 respectively the fluid in the upper region is denser than that in the lower region and fluids with concentration c 0 can react with the porous matrix in addition the porous matrix will be dissolved due to the chemical reaction between the solutes and the porous medium the reactive transport processes can be described by the convection diffusion reaction cdr equation and the equations for flow in porous media at the darcy scale are the continuity equation and darcy s law furthermore changes of the porous structure are represented by altering the porosity of the 2d porous media system the governing equations for flow and reactive transport are expressed as ritchie and david 2011 1a t ϕ u 0 1b u k ϕ μ p ρ 0 g β δ c 1c ϕ t c u c d ϕ c k r c 1d ρ s o l t ϕ k r c where ϕ represents the porosity u u w is the darcy scale velocity μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid p is the pressure in the pore space d represents the effective diffusion coefficient at the darcy scale g g z is the gravitational acceleration g is a constant and z is the unit vector in the z direction δ c c c 0 denotes the difference in the concentration ρsol is the density of solid phase and k r is the effective chemical reaction rate the fluid density is assumed to be linear with the concentration as ρ ρ 0 1 β c c 0 where β is defined as the expansion coefficient and ρ 0 is the density for fluid with concentration c 0 in addition k represents the permeability which is described by the carman kozeny correlation as ritchie and david 2011 2 k ϕ k ϕ 0 ϕ 3 ϕ 0 3 finally the imposed initial and boundary conditions are as follows 3a ϕ x z 0 ϕ 0 3b c x h t c i n z c x h t 0 3c x c 0 z t x c l z t 0 3d ω x h t ω x h t 0 3e u 0 z t u l z t 0 2 1 2 pore scale equations the pore scale simulation domain considered here is illustrated in fig 1b the initial porosity of the 2d micro model 0 x l h z h fig 1b is 0 3 an extended layer is added outside the porous area for dissolution liu et al 2013 an initial concentration cin in the upper boundary of the domain is applied to initiate the density driven process we assume that only a portion of the solid matrix blue area in fig 1b can react with the aquifer which will then be dissolved navier stokes ns equations are solved for the pore scale flows while fluid solid interactions are governed by the boundary conditions besides solute transport and heterogeneous reactions are respectively described by the convective diffusion equation cde and the associated boundary conditions the governing equations for the mentioned process that couples the reactive flows and the porosity permeability evolution in the porous media can be expressed as follows meng and guo 2015 kang et al 2014 4a u 0 4b

phase kr m s is the reaction rate s m 2 is the surface area and νsol denotes the stoichiometry note that the volume of the solid phase will change due to the chemical reactions leading to the variations of the porosity as well as the permeability in addition we also employ a linear relationship between density and concentration i e ρ c ρ 0 1 β c c 0 which is similar as in the darcy scale analysis a first order reactive boundary condition is set to describe the heterogeneous reaction as yoon et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 kang et al 2014 meng and guo 2016 5 d c n k r c c 0 where n is the unit normal vector on the boundary c 0 0 denotes the equilibrium concentration of the fluid as for the non reactive solid the following boundary condition is employed i e n c 0 in addition the no slip boundary condition is employed at the fluid solid interface i e u w 0 0 the initial as well as other boundary conditions are as follows 6a x 0 l u w 0 x c 0 6b z h u w 0 c c i n 6c z h u w 0 z c 0 note that the fluid density generally increases with the dissolution of solid matrix because certain solutes will be released into the fluid during the dissolution process in many real world applications however in the present study we refer to the overall effect of two coexisting reactions ward et al 2014 cardoso and andres 2014 which is to reduce the fluid density as well as dissolve the solid matrix therefore we assume that the fluid density will decrease as the solute is consumed by the chemical reaction at both the darcy and pore scales this assumption only represents the change of the density using an expansion coefficient β in the darcy scale linear stability analysis or β in the pore scale simulations for simplicity and does not involve detailed geochemistry model of any particular system which however can be used for studying interfacial instabilities as reported in refs ward et al 2014 cardoso and andres 2014 2 2 numerical methods 2 2 1 linear stability analysis at the darcy scale since the porosity changes slowly with time during the reaction the porosity derivative term in eq 1a can be omitted at the initial time ritchie and david 2011 for the convenience of comparison and description the above parameters are converted to dimensionless forms by the similar method in ref ward et al 2014 7 x x h z z h c c c i n ϕ ϕ ϕ 0 u u k ϕ 0 ρ 0 g β c i n

1 z cosh 2 r a d a which serve as the reference solutions for the theoretical analysis obviously the solution of concentration is independent of time and takes the form of one dimension we then add small perturbations on all the variables e g porosity velocity etc accounting for the changes of the system due to reactions as ritchie and david 2011 11 ψ ψ b ψ ψ ϕ u w p c and k here ψ denotes the

12d t c ω z c b r a 1 ϕ c b c d a c 12e t ϕ γ d a c in addition if we write the perturbations as ritchie and david 2011 13a ϕ g ϕ exp i k x σ t 13b ω g ω exp i k x σ t 13c c g c exp i k x σ t eq 12 can be further derived as 14a x 2 k 2 g w 3 k 2 c b g ϕ k 2 g c 14b σ g c g w z c b r a 1 z 2 g c k 2 g c z g ϕ z c b g ϕ z 2 c 0 d a g c 14c σ g ϕ γ d a g c where k is the wavenumber of the

1 0 15b ω 1 ω 1 0 based on the given reference solutions as well as the boundary conditions we can then obtain σ k numerically using the spectral method boyd 2001 which is indeed the eigenvalues of eq

in refs meng and guo 2015 meng et al 2018 is employed which aims to model flow and reactive transport at the pore scale and has been proven to have superior numerical stability the evolution equation of the mrt model for the incompressible navier stokes equations is written as guo and zheng 2008 meng and guo 2015 19 f i x c i δ t t δ t f i x t m 1 λ m i j f j x t f j e q x t δ t m 1 i 0 5 λ m i j

velocity λ λ 0 λ 1 λ 8 t is the diagonal relaxation matrix in moment space where λi represent the relaxation factor m is the transformation matrix the equilibrium distribution function in the present model reads as 20 f i e q ω i ρ p ρ p 0 c i u c s 2 c i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 a δ t s c i c i c s 2 i 2 c s 2 where ρp is the pressure related density ρ p0 is the average density of the fluid c i is the discrete velocity model two dimensional nine velocity in the present study c s 3 3 is the lattice sound speed defined and a is a viscosity related parameter more details as well as the discrete

boundary scheme for the reaction at the fluid solid interface eq 5 developed in ref meng and guo 2016 which is suitable for both flat and curved walls i e the boundaries in porous media is employed here furthermore to describe the pore morphology change due to dissolution the update of the solid phase defined in eq 4d is implemented using a time forward difference method proposed in ref chen et al 2014 a solid node becomes a fluid node as its volume decreases to zero distribution functions of this new fluid node are obtained by averaging the corresponding distribution functions at its neighbor fluid nodes finally the boundary schemes employed to treat the flow and concentration boundary conditions are specified case by case in what follows finally we would like to point out that the nondimensionalization of the governing equations at the darcy and pore scales are different since the spatio temporal scales the governing equations and the associated parameters e g diffusion coefficient are not identical between scales different characteristic quantities e g velocity pressure etc are then scaled and employed in the nondimensionalization forms of the corresponding at scale governing equations similar ways of nondimensionalization and the governing equations in ward et al 2014 darcy scale and chen and zhang 2010 pore scale are adopted in the current study respectively therefore the ra considered in the present study are of the same order as in ward et al 2014 chen and zhang 2010 3 results and discussion in this section linear stability analysis of density driven flows with chemical dissolution at the darcy scale is first conducted which provides evidence for the potential impact factors e g density contrast chemical reaction rate and the evolution of porous matrix on the interfacial instability at the initial time pore scale simulations using the lbm are then performed to predict the interfacial instability in longer terms 3 1 theoretical analysis considering that density driven flows with the first order reaction without chemical dissolution has been studied in ref ward et al 2014 we first test this case as a validation all the initial and boundary conditions are kept the same as those in ref ward et al 2014 we test three cases with different ra numbers here i e 1 ra 25 2 ra 41 6 and 3 ra 100 while keeping da 0 1 our simulated results are displayed in fig 2 which are in agreement with those in ref ward et al 2014 furthermore it can be observed that all the profiles follow the same trend the growth rate first increases with the wave number until it reaches the maximum value σ max then decreases with the increase of the wave number in addition the growth rate increases with ra for the same perturbation suggesting that the increase of the density ratio accelerates the interfacial instability moreover there exists a critical value of ra ra c 41 6 for this case as ra ra c all the growth rates are negative suggesting that all the initial instabilities will disappear due to the decrease of amplitudes of the perturbations for the case ra ra c all the results also well match those in ref ward et al 2014 which confirms the accuracy of our method finally we would like to point out that the magnitude of ra is determined by the expansion coefficient the diffusion coefficient and the fluid viscosity etc for instance the ra increases with the increase of the expansion coefficient as we fix other parameters e g the diffusion coefficient etc note that the gravitational infiltration is determined by the magnitude of ra rather than a particular parameter such as the expansion coefficient or the diffusion coefficient all parameters related to the ra have the same importance mathematically however the viscosity and the diffusion coefficient are quite small in reality which dominates the magnitude of the ra therefore the fluid viscosity and the diffusion coefficient are more important than the expansion coefficient in the determination of ra now we study the effect of the chemical dissolution on the interfacial instability as mentioned in ref ritchie and david 2011 γ 1 in the process of the dissolution we first test four different cases within the range i e γ 0 0 01 0 05 0 1 the results are shown in fig 3 as we can see profiles of γ 0 are similar furthermore the profiles for γ 0 are quite different with the case γ 0 i e the growth rates are all positive for perturbations with γ 0 while there exists σ 0 as γ 0 pore structure change will occur when γ 0 resulting the reaction infiltration instability in the system leading to σ 0 for all perturbations however only gravitational instability exists in the system which can be suppressed by the chemical reaction leading to negative values of the growth rates in this case cardoso and andres 2014 furthermore the growth rate increases with γ to observe the effect of chemical dissolution on the overall instability obviously we keep γ 0 1 in the following cases as mentioned in ref ward et al 2014 since ra also plays a critical role in the interfacial instability five different cases i e ra 50 100 150 200 250 and da 0 01 are tested the results are shown in fig 4 as we can see the profiles for different rayleigh numbers are in same patterns the growth rate first increases with the wave number and then decreases moreover growth rates for all perturbations are positive suggesting all the instabilities will grow in these cases furthermore the growth rate increases with ra for the same perturbation as mentioned above the increase of ra will accelerate the gravitational instability thus the overall instability will also increase with ra for the same chemical reaction rate in addition the most unstable wave number also increases with the increase of ra suggesting that short wavelength perturbation is more likely to trigger the instability to further study the effect of ra on the interfacial instability we also test the following two cases i e 1 da 0 1 and 2 da 1 while keeping ra 50 100 150 200 250 the results are displayed in fig 5 it can be observed clearly that the tendency between σ and k is the same as the case of da 0 01 the relation between σ max k max and ra is also plotted in fig 6 in which both σ max and k max increase with ra then we discuss the effect of da on the interfacial instability as shown in figs 5 and 6 it can be clearly seen that σ max da 0 01 σ max da 0 1 and σ max da 0 1 σ max da 1 suggesting the effect of da on the growth rate is nonmonotonous then we plot the relation between σ max and da in fig 7 a as displayed σ max first increases with da then decreases and increases with da again for each ra on one hand as reported in ref cardoso and andres 2014 the heterogeneous chemical reactions will consume the solute in the incoming fluids leading to the density decrease of the incoming fluid thus the gravitational instability is suppressed by the chemical reaction the larger the reaction rate da the less gravitational instability on the other hand pore structure changes due to the chemical reaction resulting in the reaction infiltration instability the larger the da the more reaction infiltration instability therefore the overall instability depends on the competition between these two types of instabilities as da is small the increase of reaction infiltration instability caused by the reaction is larger than the decrease of the gravitational instability leading to the increase of σ max reaction infiltration dominant as da increases the decrease of gravitational instability caused by the chemical reaction is larger than the increase of the reaction infiltration instability resulting the decrease of σ max gravitational dominant as da increases further the overall instability again changes to the reaction infiltration dominant case therefore σ max increases with the increase of da finally we also plot the relation between k max and da in fig 7b which shows that k max increases with the increase of da for each ra 3 2 pore scale simulation of density driven flows with dissolution we proceed to investigate the interfacial instability for the reactive transport processes with chemical dissolution at the pore scale which are expected to provide accurate predictions of the instability growth at longer time we recall the structure of the pore system as shown fig 1b which has a size of 2 h l 21 5 mm 15 56 mm detailed descriptions for the parameters used in the simulations are displayed in table 1 initially the upper region z δl of the porous media is filled with solutes with a concentration of c c i n red in fig 8 1 which can react with the solids the bottom region z δl contains solutes with concentration c c 0 0 therefore the fluid in the upper region is denser which will fall down under the gravity furthermore the fluid with concentration c 0 can react with the solids the solids will then be dissolved due to the chemical reaction in general high grid resolutions of the grain size are needed to accurately describe flow through a beadpack for resolving the flow in the void space near the contact points of two beads however the present structure is different from that of a beadpack since each circle has no contact with its neighbors the pore scale simulations here are conducted on l 2 h 1000 1582 uniform lattices more specifically 18 lattices are located within the pore width between two circles the resolution of which is already finer than previous studies on pore scale simulations of density driven flows e g 7 lattices in ref chen and zhang 2010 we first simulate density driven flows without chemical reactions i e investigations on gravity instability in pore scale porous medium then the density driven flows with chemical reactions but without the evolution of the pore structure are simulated to study the effect of chemical reactions on the gravity instability finally we model the density driven flows with chemical reactions as well as the evolution of the pore structure to investigate the interplay of density contrast chemical reactions and the evolution of the porous media we begin with simulating density driven flows without chemical reaction at the fluid solid interface i e da 0 therefore the reaction boundary is now n c 0 in our simulations the upper bottom left right boundary schemes for flows are treated by the non equilibrium extrapolation while no slip boundary condition at the fluid solid interface is implemented by the bounce back scheme as for the solute transport the upper bottom left right boundary conditions are treated by the non equilibrium extrapolation and no flux boundary condition at the fluid solid interface is also implemented by the bounce back scheme as reported in ref cardoso and andres 2014 here we take sc 100 simulations of three cases i e ra 10 3 10 4 and 5 104 are first conducted the concentration fields are shown in fig 8 we can see clearly that the miscible interface becomes unstable for the last two cases as ra is large enough in addition the instability grows with time this type of instability is related to rayleigh taylor r t instability or gravitational instability as mentioned in previous literature chen and zhang 2010 large ra suggests large density ratio or small diffusion which will accelerate the interfacial instability to study the effect of chemical reaction on the interfacial instability density driven flows with heterogeneous chemical reaction are further simulated it is worth mentioning that the pore structure change due to chemical reactions is temporarily ignored in this scenario the reaction boundary condition at the fluid solid interface is now n c da c which is implemented by the boundary scheme developed in ref zhang et al 2012 all the other boundary conditions and their corresponding implementations are kept the same as the above cases we first test these three cases i e ra 10 3 1 da 0 01 2 da 0 1 and 3 da 1 the concentration fields are shown in fig 9 as displayed no interfacial instabilities are observed in addition the reaction zone becomes smaller as da increases we further consider the case i e ra 10 4 as shown in fig 10 it is observed that the interfacial instabilities occur as da 0 01 however the miscible interfaces are stable for da 0 1 and 1 as mentioned above the gravitational instability exists as ra 10 4 meanwhile solutes in the incoming fluids will be consumed by the chemical reaction leading to the decrease of the incoming fluid density thus the gravitational instability is suppressed by the chemical reactions which is consistent with theoretical results in ref ward et al 2014 finally we increase the ra to 5 104 and keep da 1 the results in fig 11 are almost the same with previous cases all the results indicate that the chemical reaction suppress the gravitational instability by consuming solutes in the incoming fluids finally we consider the pore morphology changes i e evolution of the solid matrix caused by the chemical reaction on the interfacial instability we first simulate the case with ra 10 3 da 1 the concentration field is illustrated in fig 12 1 it is observed that the reaction front becomes unstable and the reaction zone increases with time however as shown before the reaction front is stable if the solid matrix keeps unchanged during the process of reaction therefore we can conclude that the interfacial instability is triggered by the chemical dissolution once the porous structure changes with the chemical reaction the permeability in the upper region is larger than that of the bottom region the reaction infiltration instability is thus triggered meanwhile the incoming fluids will still fall down as the dissolved regions are consumed by chemical reactions under the gravity we further test another two cases i e ra 10 4 and 5 104 with da 1 as we can see in fig 12 2 and 3 the interfacial instability is much more obvious and the reaction zone increase with time which is quite different with the case ignoring the pore structure change considering that the gravitational instability is suppressed by the chemical reaction the interfacial instability is firstly triggered by the reaction infiltration instability which then makes the incoming fluid fall down under the gravity which is the same as the last case it is worth mentioning that all these results are consistent with results from linear stability analysis we finally test three more cases i e ra 5 10 4 da 0 1 1 5 to further validate this phenomenon as shown in fig 13 the results are similar to the case of ra 10 4 the above results imply that the chemical dissolution will always destabilize the interface which will then trigger the gravitational instability in the system meanwhile the heterogeneous reactions can stabilize the interface the numerical results conforms the results of the theoretical analysis the overall instability in the system depends on the interplay competition among the density ratio heterogeneous reactions and the solid matrix dissolution 4 conclusions density driven flow with chemical dissolution as fundamental processes often occur in co2 sequestration are studied in the present work the particular interest is to study the effect of chemical dissolution on porous media flows which is investigated by using a multiscale analysis approach that combines darcy scale linear stability analysis and pore scale numerical simulations all the results indicate that the flow pattern depends on the competition among density ratio chemical reaction rate and the dissolution specifically the density ratio triggers the gravitational instability while the chemical reaction at the fluid solid interface suppresses this type of instability by decreasing the density of the incoming fluids meanwhile the chemical dissolution will always destabilizes the interface through the reaction infiltration instability furthermore once the reaction infiltration instability is triggered it will in turn cause the gravitational instability the flow pattern is finally determined by interactions between the gravitational instability and the reaction infiltration instability other interesting topics such as the effect of dimensionality of the system on the interfacial instability will be studied in our future work credit authorship

452,in the present work a suite of numerical experiments with linear stability analysis are conducted to study density driven flow with chemical dissolution of two reactive fluids in synthetic porous media linear stability analysis at the darcy scale is first performed to predict the interfacial phenomena and instability at the initial time pore scale simulations using the lattice boltzmann method lbm are further conducted to capture more mechanistic information and advance the understanding of the transport processes under different scenarios it is demonstrated that the transport processes exhibit distinct behaviors which are largely dominated by the interplay among density contrast chemical reaction rate and evolution of the porosity permeability all the results indicate that the interfacial instability can be triggered by the density contrast between two miscible fluids leading to the rayleigh taylor r t instability the r t instability can be suppressed by the heterogeneous surface reaction between the fluid and solid phases which prevents the transport of the denser fluid over the long term it is found that the interfacial instability is influenced by the evolution of the porosity permeability due to dissolution which potentially restarts the transport of the denser fluid keywords reactive transport density driven flow chemical dissolution linear stability analysis pore scale modeling lattice boltzmann method 1 introduction density driven flow with mineral dissolution precipitation can be found in many geological applications szulczewski et al 2012 tan et al 2016 bui et al 2018 ipcc 2005 for instance during the transport processes of co2 in geological storage the injected co2 first dissolves into the subsurface brine and forms a diffusive boundary layer and then the acidic and denser mixture falls down under gravity and reacts with the aquifer matrix szulczewski et al 2013 unwin et al 2015 such processes are complex due to the strong coupling and interactions among the flow chemical reaction as well as the evolution of the porous matrix lemieux 2011 macminn et al 2010 which fundamentally are driven by the interplay among density driven flow chemical reaction and fluid solid interactions specifically the properties of the miscible fluid vary with the concentration of the solvent such as the density which leads to the formation of the rayleigh taylor r t or gravity instability at the miscible interface de wit 2004 2001 fu and juanes 2013 szulczewski et al 2013 gopalakrishnan et al 2017 in addition dissolution of the aquifer matrix which causes the dynamic changes of the porosity and permeability may also affect the instability of the convection dominant processes osselin et al 2016 szymczak and ladd 2013 2012 2014 macminn and juanes 2013 there have been extensive studies focusing on the density driven miscible flows the heterogeneous reactions between acidic solution and bedrocks and the interfacial instability in geological settings huppert and neufeld 2014 zhang et al simulated the transport processes of co2 mixture at the pore scale the research focus of which lies in the sensitivity of the parameters e g the rayleigh number on the solute transport chen and zhang 2010 riaz et al performed the linear stability analysis to investigate the instability growth on the mixing interface between co2 and saline water riaz et al 2006 backhaus et al 2011 considering the heterogeneous reactions fu et al studied the interfacial instability and the pore morphology change due to dissolution in density driven flows using three dimensional simulations at the darcy scale fu and juanes 2013 fu et al 2015 ward et al theoretically analyzed the density driven convection with heterogeneous reactions in synthetic porous media their results showed that the interfacial instability can be triggered by density driven convection ward et al 2014 it is also noted that the heterogeneous reaction consumes solvent in the incoming stream and the instability decays as the reaction rate increases when the reaction rate is large enough the interfacial instability due to the density difference will not be triggered in addition andres and cardoso systematically investigated density driven flow with reactions in infinite porous media using a combination of laboratory experiments theoretical analysis and numerical simulations cardoso and andres 2014 andres and cardoso 2012 however the evolution of porosity and permeability due to chemical reactions was not considered in refs ward et al 2014 cardoso and andres 2014 andres and cardoso 2012 which is reported to have strong effects on the interfacial behaviors szymczak and ladd 2012 oltean et al 2013 ameli et al 2014 szymczak and ladd 2014 therefore the interplay among the density driven flow heterogeneous reaction as well as the evolution of the porous matrix especially at fundamental scales remains unexplored to the best of our knowledge in summary previous studies on density driven flow with heterogeneous reactions are mostly based on numerical simulations or linear stability analysis at the darcy scale however the effective parameters at the darcy scale such as the effective permeability and effective diffusion coefficient are difficult to quantify when reactions occur specifically with the dissolution of porous matrix leading to inaccurate predictions of the darcy scale transport processes the particular focus of the present study is to investigate the reactive transport processes of density driven flow with dissolution the interfacial instability and the associated influencing factors using a multiscale analysis approach i e the darcy scale theoretical analysis i e linear stability analysis and pore scale numerical simulations we first perform linear stability analysis which is a useful tool to predict the interfacial instability of reactive transport processes at the initial time the effect of the potential impact factors e g density contrast on the interfacial instability can be diagnosed through linear stability analysis meanwhile numerical simulations at the pore scale can provide detailed growth of the instability in longer terms furthermore at the pore scale the solid and fluid fraction and solid liquid interface are distinguished so that the heterogeneous reaction on the interface along with the dynamic change of the pore structure can be accurately described in recent decades a group of pore scale models for simulating flow and reactive transport have been developed benchmarked and utilized molins et al 2014 molins 2015 kang et al 2014 yang et al 2016 among them the lattice boltzmann method lbm has become one of the most popular numerical approaches due to its easy treatment of complex boundaries and accelerated computational efficiency chai and zhao 2013 succi 2001 guo et al 2002 yoon et al 2015 kang et al 2010 the lbm has been widely utilized to simulate flow and reactive transport in porous media especially those with pore structure change for example kang et al simulated incompressible flow transport and interface reaction processes using the lbm at the pore scale and furthermore assessed the changes of permeability and porosity induced by dissolution kang et al 2014 in the current research we study the reactive transport of density driven flow with chemical dissolution in two dimensional homogeneous porous media using a multiscale approach that combines darcy scale theoretical analysis and pore scale simulations linear stability analysis is first conducted to estimate the influence of chemical reaction on the interfacial instability pore scale lbm simulations of the reactive transport processes in micro models are further carried out to capture more mechanistic information and advance the understanding of the fundamental phenomena the interplay among the density contrast the chemical reaction rate and the evolution of the porosity permeability is presented and discussed in different simulation scenarios the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the governing equations and numerical methods at the darcy and pore scales section 3 presents the results from darcy scale linear stability analysis and pore scale lbm simulations followed by the conclusions in section 4 2 methodology the analysis of the density driven convection with chemical dissolution of the porous matrix depends on the accurate descriptions of flow and reactive transport particularly the dissolution and the associated evolution of the aquifer matrix in the current study such complex processes in natural subsurface environments are confined in a two dimensional 2d synthetic porous medium for simplicity we assume that the flow is incompressible and boussinesq hypothesis is satisfied furthermore chemical reactions occur as the incoming fluids with solute contact with the porous matrix finally the fluid density is assumed to be linear in the solute concentration 2 1 governing equations 2 1 1 darcy scale equations as shown in fig 1 a a 2d homogeneous porous medium is adopted as the modeling domain for linear stability analysis at the darcy scale in which two reactive solutes are injected from the left boundary with the same volume in particular the solute concentrations in the upper denoted by yellow and lower denoted by green regions are c i n and c 0 0 respectively the fluid in the upper region is denser than that in the lower region and fluids with concentration c 0 can react with the porous matrix in addition the porous matrix will be dissolved due to the chemical reaction between the solutes and the porous medium the reactive transport processes can be described by the convection diffusion reaction cdr equation and the equations for flow in porous media at the darcy scale are the continuity equation and darcy s law furthermore changes of the porous structure are represented by altering the porosity of the 2d porous media system the governing equations for flow and reactive transport are expressed as ritchie and david 2011 1a t ϕ u 0 1b u k ϕ μ p ρ 0 g β δ c 1c ϕ t c u c d ϕ c k r c 1d ρ s o l t ϕ k r c where ϕ represents the porosity u u w is the darcy scale velocity μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid p is the pressure in the pore space d represents the effective diffusion coefficient at the darcy scale g g z is the gravitational acceleration g is a constant and z is the unit vector in the z direction δ c c c 0 denotes the difference in the concentration ρsol is the density of solid phase and k r is the effective chemical reaction rate the fluid density is assumed to be linear with the concentration as ρ ρ 0 1 β c c 0 where β is defined as the expansion coefficient and ρ 0 is the density for fluid with concentration c 0 in addition k represents the permeability which is described by the carman kozeny correlation as ritchie and david 2011 2 k ϕ k ϕ 0 ϕ 3 ϕ 0 3 finally the imposed initial and boundary conditions are as follows 3a ϕ x z 0 ϕ 0 3b c x h t c i n z c x h t 0 3c x c 0 z t x c l z t 0 3d ω x h t ω x h t 0 3e u 0 z t u l z t 0 2 1 2 pore scale equations the pore scale simulation domain considered here is illustrated in fig 1b the initial porosity of the 2d micro model 0 x l h z h fig 1b is 0 3 an extended layer is added outside the porous area for dissolution liu et al 2013 an initial concentration cin in the upper boundary of the domain is applied to initiate the density driven process we assume that only a portion of the solid matrix blue area in fig 1b can react with the aquifer which will then be dissolved navier stokes ns equations are solved for the pore scale flows while fluid solid interactions are governed by the boundary conditions besides solute transport and heterogeneous reactions are respectively described by the convective diffusion equation cde and the associated boundary conditions the governing equations for the mentioned process that couples the reactive flows and the porosity permeability evolution in the porous media can be expressed as follows meng and guo 2015 kang et al 2014 4a u 0 4b

phase kr m s is the reaction rate s m 2 is the surface area and νsol denotes the stoichiometry note that the volume of the solid phase will change due to the chemical reactions leading to the variations of the porosity as well as the permeability in addition we also employ a linear relationship between density and concentration i e ρ c ρ 0 1 β c c 0 which is similar as in the darcy scale analysis a first order reactive boundary condition is set to describe the heterogeneous reaction as yoon et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 kang et al 2014 meng and guo 2016 5 d c n k r c c 0 where n is the unit normal vector on the boundary c 0 0 denotes the equilibrium concentration of the fluid as for the non reactive solid the following boundary condition is employed i e n c 0 in addition the no slip boundary condition is employed at the fluid solid interface i e u w 0 0 the initial as well as other boundary conditions are as follows 6a x 0 l u w 0 x c 0 6b z h u w 0 c c i n 6c z h u w 0 z c 0 note that the fluid density generally increases with the dissolution of solid matrix because certain solutes will be released into the fluid during the dissolution process in many real world applications however in the present study we refer to the overall effect of two coexisting reactions ward et al 2014 cardoso and andres 2014 which is to reduce the fluid density as well as dissolve the solid matrix therefore we assume that the fluid density will decrease as the solute is consumed by the chemical reaction at both the darcy and pore scales this assumption only represents the change of the density using an expansion coefficient β in the darcy scale linear stability analysis or β in the pore scale simulations for simplicity and does not involve detailed geochemistry model of any particular system which however can be used for studying interfacial instabilities as reported in refs ward et al 2014 cardoso and andres 2014 2 2 numerical methods 2 2 1 linear stability analysis at the darcy scale since the porosity changes slowly with time during the reaction the porosity derivative term in eq 1a can be omitted at the initial time ritchie and david 2011 for the convenience of comparison and description the above parameters are converted to dimensionless forms by the similar method in ref ward et al 2014 7 x x h z z h c c c i n ϕ ϕ ϕ 0 u u k ϕ 0 ρ 0 g β c i n

1 z cosh 2 r a d a which serve as the reference solutions for the theoretical analysis obviously the solution of concentration is independent of time and takes the form of one dimension we then add small perturbations on all the variables e g porosity velocity etc accounting for the changes of the system due to reactions as ritchie and david 2011 11 ψ ψ b ψ ψ ϕ u w p c and k here ψ denotes the

1 0 15b ω 1 ω 1 0 based on the given reference solutions as well as the boundary conditions we can then obtain σ k numerically using the spectral method boyd 2001 which is indeed the eigenvalues of eq

in refs meng and guo 2015 meng et al 2018 is employed which aims to model flow and reactive transport at the pore scale and has been proven to have superior numerical stability the evolution equation of the mrt model for the incompressible navier stokes equations is written as guo and zheng 2008 meng and guo 2015 19 f i x c i δ t t δ t f i x t m 1 λ m i j f j x t f j e q x t δ t m 1 i 0 5 λ m i j

model reads as 20 f i e q ω i ρ p ρ p 0 c i u c s 2 c i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 a δ t s c i c i c s 2 i 2 c s 2 where ρp is the pressure related density ρ p0 is the average density of the fluid c i is the discrete velocity model two dimensional nine velocity in the present study c s 3 3 is the lattice sound speed defined and a is a viscosity related parameter more details as well as the discrete

boundary scheme for the reaction at the fluid solid interface eq 5 developed in ref meng and guo 2016 which is suitable for both flat and curved walls i e the boundaries in porous media is employed here furthermore to describe the pore morphology change due to dissolution the update of the solid phase defined in eq 4d is implemented using a time forward difference method proposed in ref chen et al 2014 a solid node becomes a fluid node as its volume decreases to zero distribution functions of this new fluid node are obtained by averaging the corresponding distribution functions at its neighbor fluid nodes finally the boundary schemes employed to treat the flow and concentration boundary conditions are specified case by case in what follows finally we would like to point out that the nondimensionalization of the governing equations at the darcy and pore scales are different since the spatio temporal scales the governing equations and the associated parameters e g diffusion coefficient are not identical between scales different characteristic quantities e g velocity pressure etc are then scaled and employed in the nondimensionalization forms of the corresponding at scale governing equations similar ways of nondimensionalization and the governing equations in ward et al 2014 darcy scale and chen and zhang 2010 pore scale are adopted in the current study respectively therefore the ra considered in the present study are of the same order as in ward et al 2014 chen and zhang 2010 3 results and discussion in this section linear stability analysis of density driven flows with chemical dissolution at the darcy scale is first conducted which provides evidence for the potential impact factors e g density contrast chemical reaction rate and the evolution of porous matrix on the interfacial instability at the initial time pore scale simulations using the lbm are then performed to predict the interfacial instability in longer terms 3 1 theoretical analysis considering that density driven flows with the first order reaction without chemical dissolution has been studied in ref ward et al 2014 we first test this case as a validation all the initial and boundary conditions are kept the same as those in ref ward et al 2014 we test three cases with different ra numbers here i e 1 ra 25 2 ra 41 6 and 3 ra 100 while keeping da 0 1 our simulated results are displayed in fig 2 which are in agreement with those in ref ward et al 2014 furthermore it can be observed that all the profiles follow the same trend the growth rate first increases with the wave number until it reaches the maximum value σ max then decreases with the increase of the wave number in addition the growth rate increases with ra for the same perturbation suggesting that the increase of the density ratio accelerates the interfacial instability moreover there exists a critical value of ra ra c 41 6 for this case as ra ra c all the growth rates are negative suggesting that all the initial instabilities will disappear due to the decrease of amplitudes of the perturbations for the case ra ra c all the results also well match those in ref ward et al 2014 which confirms the accuracy of our method finally we would like to point out that the magnitude of ra is determined by the expansion coefficient the diffusion coefficient and the fluid viscosity etc for instance the ra increases with the increase of the expansion coefficient as we fix other parameters e g the diffusion coefficient etc note that the gravitational infiltration is determined by the magnitude of ra rather than a particular parameter such as the expansion coefficient or the diffusion coefficient all parameters related to the ra have the same importance mathematically however the viscosity and the diffusion coefficient are quite small in reality which dominates the magnitude of the ra therefore the fluid viscosity and the diffusion coefficient are more important than the expansion coefficient in the determination of ra now we study the effect of the chemical dissolution on the interfacial instability as mentioned in ref ritchie and david 2011 γ 1 in the process of the dissolution we first test four different cases within the range i e γ 0 0 01 0 05 0 1 the results are shown in fig 3 as we can see profiles of γ 0 are similar furthermore the profiles for γ 0 are quite different with the case γ 0 i e the growth rates are all positive for perturbations with γ 0 while there exists σ 0 as γ 0 pore structure change will occur when γ 0 resulting the reaction infiltration instability in the system leading to σ 0 for all perturbations however only gravitational instability exists in the system which can be suppressed by the chemical reaction leading to negative values of the growth rates in this case cardoso and andres 2014 furthermore the growth rate increases with γ to observe the effect of chemical dissolution on the overall instability obviously we keep γ 0 1 in the following cases as mentioned in ref ward et al 2014 since ra also plays a critical role in the interfacial instability five different cases i e ra 50 100 150 200 250 and da 0 01 are tested the results are shown in fig 4 as we can see the profiles for different rayleigh numbers are in same patterns the growth rate first increases with the wave number and then decreases moreover growth rates for all perturbations are positive suggesting all the instabilities will grow in these cases furthermore the growth rate increases with ra for the same perturbation as mentioned above the increase of ra will accelerate the gravitational instability thus the overall instability will also increase with ra for the same chemical reaction rate in addition the most unstable wave number also increases with the increase of ra suggesting that short wavelength perturbation is more likely to trigger the instability to further study the effect of ra on the interfacial instability we also test the following two cases i e 1 da 0 1 and 2 da 1 while keeping ra 50 100 150 200 250 the results are displayed in fig 5 it can be observed clearly that the tendency between σ and k is the same as the case of da 0 01 the relation between σ max k max and ra is also plotted in fig 6 in which both σ max and k max increase with ra then we discuss the effect of da on the interfacial instability as shown in figs 5 and 6 it can be clearly seen that σ max da 0 01 σ max da 0 1 and σ max da 0 1 σ max da 1 suggesting the effect of da on the growth rate is nonmonotonous then we plot the relation between σ max and da in fig 7 a as displayed σ max first increases with da then decreases and increases with da again for each ra on one hand as reported in ref cardoso and andres 2014 the heterogeneous chemical reactions will consume the solute in the incoming fluids leading to the density decrease of the incoming fluid thus the gravitational instability is suppressed by the chemical reaction the larger the reaction rate da the less gravitational instability on the other hand pore structure changes due to the chemical reaction resulting in the reaction infiltration instability the larger the da the more reaction infiltration instability therefore the overall instability depends on the competition between these two types of instabilities as da is small the increase of reaction infiltration instability caused by the reaction is larger than the decrease of the gravitational instability leading to the increase of σ max reaction infiltration dominant as da increases the decrease of gravitational instability caused by the chemical reaction is larger than the increase of the reaction infiltration instability resulting the decrease of σ max gravitational dominant as da increases further the overall instability again changes to the reaction infiltration dominant case therefore σ max increases with the increase of da finally we also plot the relation between k max and da in fig 7b which shows that k max increases with the increase of da for each ra 3 2 pore scale simulation of density driven flows with dissolution we proceed to investigate the interfacial instability for the reactive transport processes with chemical dissolution at the pore scale which are expected to provide accurate predictions of the instability growth at longer time we recall the structure of the pore system as shown fig 1b which has a size of 2 h l 21 5 mm 15 56 mm detailed descriptions for the parameters used in the simulations are displayed in table 1 initially the upper region z δl of the porous media is filled with solutes with a concentration of c c i n red in fig 8 1 which can react with the solids the bottom region z δl contains solutes with concentration c c 0 0 therefore the fluid in the upper region is denser which will fall down under the gravity furthermore the fluid with concentration c 0 can react with the solids the solids will then be dissolved due to the chemical reaction in general high grid resolutions of the grain size are needed to accurately describe flow through a beadpack for resolving the flow in the void space near the contact points of two beads however the present structure is different from that of a beadpack since each circle has no contact with its neighbors the pore scale simulations here are conducted on l 2 h 1000 1582 uniform lattices more specifically 18 lattices are located within the pore width between two circles the resolution of which is already finer than previous studies on pore scale simulations of density driven flows e g 7 lattices in ref chen and zhang 2010 we first simulate density driven flows without chemical reactions i e investigations on gravity instability in pore scale porous medium then the density driven flows with chemical reactions but without the evolution of the pore structure are simulated to study the effect of chemical reactions on the gravity instability finally we model the density driven flows with chemical reactions as well as the evolution of the pore structure to investigate the interplay of density contrast chemical reactions and the evolution of the porous media we begin with simulating density driven flows without chemical reaction at the fluid solid interface i e da 0 therefore the reaction boundary is now n c 0 in our simulations the upper bottom left right boundary schemes for flows are treated by the non equilibrium extrapolation while no slip boundary condition at the fluid solid interface is implemented by the bounce back scheme as for the solute transport the upper bottom left right boundary conditions are treated by the non equilibrium extrapolation and no flux boundary condition at the fluid solid interface is also implemented by the bounce back scheme as reported in ref cardoso and andres 2014 here we take sc 100 simulations of three cases i e ra 10 3 10 4 and 5 104 are first conducted the concentration fields are shown in fig 8 we can see clearly that the miscible interface becomes unstable for the last two cases as ra is large enough in addition the instability grows with time this type of instability is related to rayleigh taylor r t instability or gravitational instability as mentioned in previous literature chen and zhang 2010 large ra suggests large density ratio or small diffusion which will accelerate the interfacial instability to study the effect of chemical reaction on the interfacial instability density driven flows with heterogeneous chemical reaction are further simulated it is worth mentioning that the pore structure change due to chemical reactions is temporarily ignored in this scenario the reaction boundary condition at the fluid solid interface is now n c da c which is implemented by the boundary scheme developed in ref zhang et al 2012 all the other boundary conditions and their corresponding implementations are kept the same as the above cases we first test these three cases i e ra 10 3 1 da 0 01 2 da 0 1 and 3 da 1 the concentration fields are shown in fig 9 as displayed no interfacial instabilities are observed in addition the reaction zone becomes smaller as da increases we further consider the case i e ra 10 4 as shown in fig 10 it is observed that the interfacial instabilities occur as da 0 01 however the miscible interfaces are stable for da 0 1 and 1 as mentioned above the gravitational instability exists as ra 10 4 meanwhile solutes in the incoming fluids will be consumed by the chemical reaction leading to the decrease of the incoming fluid density thus the gravitational instability is suppressed by the chemical reactions which is consistent with theoretical results in ref ward et al 2014 finally we increase the ra to 5 104 and keep da 1 the results in fig 11 are almost the same with previous cases all the results indicate that the chemical reaction suppress the gravitational instability by consuming solutes in the incoming fluids finally we consider the pore morphology changes i e evolution of the solid matrix caused by the chemical reaction on the interfacial instability we first simulate the case with ra 10 3 da 1 the concentration field is illustrated in fig 12 1 it is observed that the reaction front becomes unstable and the reaction zone increases with time however as shown before the reaction front is stable if the solid matrix keeps unchanged during the process of reaction therefore we can conclude that the interfacial instability is triggered by the chemical dissolution once the porous structure changes with the chemical reaction the permeability in the upper region is larger than that of the bottom region the reaction infiltration instability is thus triggered meanwhile the incoming fluids will still fall down as the dissolved regions are consumed by chemical reactions under the gravity we further test another two cases i e ra 10 4 and 5 104 with da 1 as we can see in fig 12 2 and 3 the interfacial instability is much more obvious and the reaction zone increase with time which is quite different with the case ignoring the pore structure change considering that the gravitational instability is suppressed by the chemical reaction the interfacial instability is firstly triggered by the reaction infiltration instability which then makes the incoming fluid fall down under the gravity which is the same as the last case it is worth mentioning that all these results are consistent with results from linear stability analysis we finally test three more cases i e ra 5 10 4 da 0 1 1 5 to further validate this phenomenon as shown in fig 13 the results are similar to the case of ra 10 4 the above results imply that the chemical dissolution will always destabilize the interface which will then trigger the gravitational instability in the system meanwhile the heterogeneous reactions can stabilize the interface the numerical results conforms the results of the theoretical analysis the overall instability in the system depends on the interplay competition among the density ratio heterogeneous reactions and the solid matrix dissolution 4 conclusions density driven flow with chemical dissolution as fundamental processes often occur in co2 sequestration are studied in the present work the particular interest is to study the effect of chemical dissolution on porous media flows which is investigated by using a multiscale analysis approach that combines darcy scale linear stability analysis and pore scale numerical simulations all the results indicate that the flow pattern depends on the competition among density ratio chemical reaction rate and the dissolution specifically the density ratio triggers the gravitational instability while the chemical reaction at the fluid solid interface suppresses this type of instability by decreasing the density of the incoming fluids meanwhile the chemical dissolution will always destabilizes the interface through the reaction infiltration instability furthermore once the reaction infiltration instability is triggered it will in turn cause the gravitational instability the flow pattern is finally determined by interactions between the gravitational instability and the reaction infiltration instability other interesting topics such as the effect of dimensionality of the system on the interfacial instability will be studied in our future work credit authorship

453,the dispersion coefficient is the most crucial parameter that governs the model prediction of pollutant mixing in rivers however the spatial variability of dispersion coefficient associated with velocity structures has not yet been thoroughly investigated in this study two types of spatially varying dispersion tensors were considered using both the vertical velocity profiles df and the depth averaged flow fields da and the pollutant transports using df and da were compared with tracer test results in a meandering channel the results showed that the peak concentration and arrival time were more accurately predicted by using df than da because the flow properties associated with the shear induced dispersion were explicitly incorporated in the df the spatial distributions of the df showed variations in both stream wise and span wise directions due to the creation and destruction of secondary flow in the meandering channel in contrast the da only changed in the stream wise direction therefore the df is advantageous to reproduce shear dispersion processes keywords 2d contaminant transport model dispersion tensor shear flow dispersion meandering channel velocity distribution 1 introduction a water quality forecasting system for predicting the concentration of pollutants following unexpected accidents in natural rivers is a useful tool to secure water resources the system needs to provide accurate arrival and retention time of polluted water based on analysis of mixing behaviors in rivers pollutants mixing in rivers is strongly influenced by the shear flow generated by channel geometries and roughness the shear flow mixing is usually determined by contaminant transport models based on the advection dispersion equation among the various contaminant transport models rma4 king et al 2005 and aquasea vatnaskil 1998 use the 2d advection dispersion equation in combination with the constant dispersion coefficient because the dispersion coefficient considerably affects pollutant concentration it is the crucial parameter that governs the mixing of pollutant in rivers since taylor 1954 proposed the concept of longitudinal dispersions in pipe flow there have been significant improvements in dispersion studies elder 1959 suggested the longitudinal dispersion coefficient formula which was derived from the logarithmic velocity profile in the assumption of infinitely wide straight channel fischer et al 1979 maintained that the longitudinal dispersion is affected by span wise velocity distributions in the flow direction rather than in the vertical direction from these theoretical studies chikwendu 1986 developed the n zone model and reported the importance of dispersion induced by velocity deviations in the vertical direction deng et al 2002 derived an integral expression for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and an analytical method for prediction of the dispersion coefficient in natural streams experimental studies have also been carried out to understand the relationship between the dispersion coefficient and the secondary current marion et al 2006 studied longitudinal dispersion which is affected by secondary currents in curved parts of meandering channels albers and steffler 2007 studied the effect of secondary currents on span wise pollutant mixing boxall and guymer 2007 investigated longitudinal mixing at various flow rates within each of the channels by monitoring the development of tracer plumes during transit through the channels they were able to capture the variation in the longitudinal mixing coefficient with longitudinal meander location channel form and discharge seo et al 2008 found that the dispersion coefficients considering velocity profiles showed better results in predicting pollutant mixing lanzoni et al 2018 set up a rational framework of analytical estimate for longitudinal dispersion associated with spatial non uniformities of the flow field in practical aspects the in situ 2d tracer tests were conducted to estimate reach averaged longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients because of its simplicity and applicability baek et al 2006 calculated longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients using moment and routing methods from 2d tracer test results in meandering channel seo et al 2016 conducted tracer tests in natural rivers of various sizes and proposed an empirical formula to estimate dispersion coefficients based on hydraulic and geometric variables however the 2d contaminant transport model using the reach averaged dispersion coefficient still suffers from inaccurate results because complex mixing phenomena cannot be reproduced by an invariant dispersion coefficient thus the spatially varying dispersion coefficients are required to increase the accuracy of the model prediction several numerical studies on 2d contaminant transport models that adopt spatially varying dispersion tensors have been reported piasecki and katopodes 1999 developed a 2d contaminant transport model that includes the dispersion tensor by coordinate transformations lee and seo 2007 applied the dispersion tensors of alavian 1986 to a 2d contaminant transport model and confirmed priorities of applying the spatially varying dispersion coefficient according to lee and kim 2012 the dispersion tensor is effective in analyzing tracer mixing in curved open channels where the vertically skewed shear flow occurs the vast majority of the existing researches on the estimation of the dispersion coefficient has been conducted to develop an empirical formula for dispersion coefficients that parameterizes dimensionless hydraulic variables or channel geometry parameters based on field measurements or available relationship seo and cheong 1998 deng et al 2002 kashefipour and falconer 2002 wang and huai 2016 baek and seo 2017 a notable study that has a similar approach to the present article is seo et al 2008 inspired by the spatially heterogeneous dispersion that had evolved in a curved channel seo et al 2008 investigated two types of dispersion coefficient tensor 1 estimated by measured vertical velocity profile and 2 predicted based on the depth averaged velocity field however they only used elder s and fisher s formulas shown below to estimate the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients 1 d l 5 93 h u 2 d t 0 15 h u where dl is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient dt is the transverse dispersion coefficient h is the depth and u is the shear velocity they computed u using the relationship between the hydraulic radius and the friction slope given as follows 3 u g r h s f where g is the gravitational acceleration rh is the hydraulic radius and sf is the friction slope to calculate sf they employed the manning s equation s f 1 2 n u r h 2 3 in which u u 2 v 2 is the velocity magnitude and n is the manning s roughness coefficient because h rh n and ucan be determined by experimental conditions and measured data sf and u can also be obtained to produce the dl and dt as described above they applied empirical equations and analytical relations consecutively however the equation and relations require several assumptions and hypothesis consequently the dispersion coefficients predicted by seo et al 2008 were subject to considerable errors additionally they only employed the measured vertical velocity and thus did not analyze how the dispersion would behave under generally adopted velocity distribution formulas such as kikkawa et al 1976 or odgaard 1986 lastly their study was mainly focused on cross sectionally averaged physical quantities and statistical properties hence they did not elucidate the spatial variation of dispersion coefficients in streamwise and spanwise direction in this study spatially varying dispersion tensors were calculated in a laboratory channel in three ways 1 vertical velocity data by measurement df1 2 vertical velocity profiles imported using theoretical or empirical formulas df2 and 3 depth averaged flow field da from the calculation results the spatial change in dispersion coefficient was analyzed in a meandering channel with two bends in addition the two types of dispersion tensors were applied to a 2d contaminant transport model and compared with tracer test results the aforementioned research procedures are schematized in fig 1 2 theoretical derivations 2 1 2d advection dispersion model with dispersion tensor the 2d advection dispersion equation 2d ade has been widely used for the analysis of pollutant mixing in the intermediate area where the vertical mixing is completed fischer et al 1979 the 2d ade is derived from the reynolds averaged three dimensional advection diffusion equation the reynolds averaged three dimensional advection diffusion equation defined in the cartesian coordinate reads 4 c t x i u i c x j e i j c x j i j 1 2 3 where c is the time averaged concentration ui is the time averaged velocity in xi x y z directions respectively and eij is the turbulent diffusion coefficient on each direction each component in eq 4 neglects the turbulent fluctuations which occur in period shorter than the averaging time scale the point values of ui and c are decomposed into the depth averaged value and deviation from it as follows 5a u i u i u i 5b c c c where u i is the depth averaged velocity u i is the velocity deviation c is the depth averaged concentration and c is the concentration deviation the 2d ade can be obtained by substituting eqs 5 15 16 into eq 4 and depth averaging it with the leibnitz s rule and the reynolds rule of average then the integration term representing the product of velocity and concentration fluctuation can be regarded as the mass transport property in the fickian type dispersion taylor 1954 fischer et al 1979 6 m i 1 h 0 h u i c d z d i j c x j i j 1 2 where m i is the rate of mass transport in x y directions and dij is the dispersion tensor using eq 6 the 2d ade can be rewritten as 7 h c t u i h c x i x i h d i j c x j i j 1 2 the 2d ade with the tensor type dispersion coefficient was applied in the numerical modeling of pollutant mixing by piasecki and katopodes 1999 two dimensional pollutant transport models such as mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and ram4 seo et al 2008 also employ eq 7 as the mathematical model 2 2 dispersion tensors incorporating vertical velocity profile fischer et al 1979 provided dispersion tensors derived by physical analysis in skewed shear flow 8 c c t u i u i c c x i x j e i j c c x j i j 1 2 3 if the vertical mixing is completed we can neglect the advection diffusion equation in the z direction to transform eq 8 into the lagrangian coordinates substitutions of ξ i x i u i t and τ t yield 9 c c τ u i c c ξ i ξ j e i j c c ξ j z e z c z i j 1 2 in eq 9 the first term in right hand side including eij can be neglected because dispersion with velocity deviations is more dominant than mixing by turbulent diffusion in the turbulent diffusion term in the z direction ez is interpreted as the eddy viscosity ε z by the reynolds analogy following taylor 1954 c c and the time derivative term can be eliminated according to the above statements the 2d diffusion equation in the cartesian coordinates is expressed as 10 u i c x i z ε z c z i 1 2 after integrating eq 10 in the z direction concentration deviation in shear flow can be expressed as 11 c z 0 z 1 ε z 0 z u i c x i d z d z i 1 2 by inserting eq 11 into eq 6 dispersion tensors incorporating velocity deviations in the vertical direction are derived as 12 d i j 1 h 0 h u i z 0 z 1 ε z 0 z u j z d z d z d z i j 1 2 ε z in eq 12 has a parabolic distribution over depth as follows 13 ε z κ ζ 1 ζ h u where ζ z h and κ is the von kármán constant in the above procedure the reynolds analogy was introduced which assumes uniform flow and wide rectangular section hereafter eq 12 is referred to as df by introducing the velocity deviations in the vertical direction u i in eq 12 df can accommodate the secondary current effects that usually occur in meandering streams for this reason df is useful to characterize shear induced dispersion in the modeling of 2d pollutant mixing however the main obstacle in calculating df for the 2d ade model is the lack of velocity data in the vertical direction thus the theoretical equations for the vertical velocity profile were imported in df and these dispersion tensors then incorporated into the 2d ade model 2 3 dispersion tensor incorporating mean velocities for most natural streams the flow direction varies continuously according to the spatial alignment of the channel therefore the transport and dispersion behaviors can be more properly described in the natural coordinate system which is defined by the axes along the streamlines s and its normal direction n cheng et al 1984 sun and sun 1996 lee and seo 2013 14 c t u s c s s d l c s n d t c n where u s is the depth averaged velocity in the stream wise direction s the description in the natural coordinate system has advantages in that the dispersion tensor becomes a diagonal matrix and the solution of the equation can be simplified cirpka et al 1999 eq 14 has an intrinsic assumption that the dispersion phenomena is predominant in the form of elliptic shape stretched along the streamwise and spanwise direction if we want to describe the irregularly directing pollutant mixing in the cartesian coordinate system the metric coefficient or the jacobian matrix should be introduced because these coefficients act as a corrector for distance difference between curved length and straight line yotsukura 1977 smith 1983 yoshida and nagaoka 2014 by applying the chain rule and the relations of x s u u and y s v u rhs of eq 14 can be transformed into fixed cartesian coordinate as follows 15a s d l c s d l u 2 u 2 2 c x 2 d l u v u 2 2 c x y d l u v u 2 2 c y x d l v 2 u 2 2 c y 2 15b n d t c n d t

open channel flows hekmat et al 2015 kim et al 2018a kim et al 2018b in this study the dispersion tensors calculated by eq 16 are indicated as da although da can be calculated using the depth averaged velocity and dispersion coefficients there are difficulties associated with it in that the dispersion coefficients dl and dt need to be estimated for the given study areas several methods have been employed to estimate the dispersion coefficients among them the trace test is a viable way to determine the dispersion coefficients concentration time curves are acquired by measuring the concentration at specific positions downstream of an injection point and the dispersion coefficients can be estimated by applying the moment methods or routing procedure however this method has challenges such as 1 sensitivity to the flow or weather conditions in the reach 2 increasing costs and labor requirements when carried out in huge rivers and 3 the consideration of trapping or storage zone effect thus in practice empirical formulas such as elder 1959 and fisher et al 1979 are frequently used due to their simplicity these formulas parameterize hydraulic variables such as the channel geometry average depth channel width bed shape factor or sinuosity mean velocity or shear velocity however the dispersion coefficients predicted by empirical formula have large error bound ranging from 37 to 320 wang and huai 2016 and they should be applied with caution therefore in this study the measured dispersion coefficients shown in table 1 were adopted for calculation of da 3 calculation of dispersion tensors the spatially varying dispersion tensors were calculated in three ways following the research procedure shown in fig 1 df defined in eq 12 was computed in two ways df1 was obtained by introducing the vertical velocities by measurement in a laboratory channel and df2 was acquired by incorporating the theoretical or empirical velocity formulas in the vertical direction into eq 12 in constrast da was calculated by using both the depth averaged velocity fields from 2d hydrodynamic modeling and the dl and dt presented in table 1 targeting a meandering channel with two bends the evolution and development of dispersion tensors according to each approach were thoroughly examined 3 1 dispersion tensors based on measured velocity data the dispersion tensors of df1 and da were calculated using measured hydraulic data from park 2008 the experiment was conducted on a laboratory meandering channel as shown in fig 2 the width of the channel is 1 m and total length is 12 m this channel has two curved parts with a 150 arc angle with a rectangular cross section in this channel velocity field was measured along 12 cross sections from s1 to s12 at each section velocity was measured at 19 points in the transverse direction and 6 8 points in the vertical direction according to the water depth in addition park 2008 conducted 2d tracer tests in this channel using salt solution to obtain the concentration time data velocity field was recorded using micro adv acoustic doppler velocimetry and solute concentration was detected using the electrode conductivity meter kenek model nst 30 the density of the salt solution was diluted to that of the flowing water by mixing with methanol at the centerline of the channel marked with a red circle in fig 2 the tracer substance was instantaneously injected into the flowing water as a full depth vertical line source covered by an acrylic cylinder from the collected concentration data park 2008 estimated the dispersion coefficients dl and dt using the 2d routing method baek et al 2006 the experimental conditions and results are listed in table 1 the case numbers were titled as three digits denoting the boundary conditions first two digits represent the water depth in centimeter and the last digit indicates the second decimal place of the flow discharge fig 3 shows calculation results of two types of dispersion tensor df1 and da for case 303 in this figure both the tensors showed periodic patterns in stream wise variations along the meandering channel as the tracer cloud was transported from the first bend to cross over and then to the second bend all the components of df1 varied in both stream wise and span wise directions and the maximum values existed at the inner bank of the bend however the components of da significantly varied only in stream wise direction as can see in eq 16 the da consists of the velocity ratio and the reach averaged dispersion coefficients and the dispersion coefficients are invariant in both stream wise and span wise directions the velocity ratio is a factor to make variations of the da across the channel width but the velocity ratio is rarely changed in span wise direction because the velocity magnitude increased according to the velocity components in the x and y directions thus the da values show relative dominance between dl and dt according to the velocity ratio and the da merely changes along the stream wise direction unless there are reversal or recirculation flows park and song 2018 in contrast df1 implies the physical mechanisms of pollutant mixing induced by the shear flow which has spatially inhomogeneous distributions the spatial variations of velocity structures caused variations of df1 in both stream wise and span wise directions this means that da might not be appropriate to describe variable pollutant concentrations in span wise directions to investigate the periodic variation of the dispersion tensors more clearly dimensionless width averaged values of the dispersion tensor components d i j h u of df1 and da were plotted against the stream wise distance in fig 4 where the x axis indicates the dimensionless distance from s1 s 0 to the tail gate s l this figure shows that both df1 and da have a similar pattern showing periodical changes along the stream wise direction d x x h u had its maximum value at the apex of the bends s4 s l 0 22 s9 s l 0 68 where the flow direction coincides with x axis d x x h u increased along with the velocity magnitude in the x direction because d x x h u represents the shear flow dispersion in the x direction d x x h u had the minimum value at the cross over sections s6 s l 0 44 s7 s l 0 52 where xdirection velocity approaches zero in contrast to d x x h u d y y h u increased between s6 and s7 where y direction velocity increases in d x y h u positive values were observed at s4 s5 and s8 s9 where the flow changed to a positive y direction in contrast d x y h u and d x y h u showed negative values when the flow direction changes to a negative y direction thus pollutant cloud was distorted asymmetrically by d x y h u component when it passed through s5 s l 0 38 and s8 s l 0 60 comparing between da and df1 the spatially averaged values of da were larger than the values of df1 the da values are based on the reach averaged values of dl and dt shown in table 1 and the dispersion coefficients estimated from the tracer tests tend to be overestimated compared with the velocity based method jung 2012 these results could lead to the differences in simulation results that the mixing behaviors using the da would be more activated than the results using the df as shown in fig 3 da and df1 showed considerable differences in determining the physical spreading in lateral direction to quantify this dimensionless dxx and dyy were plotted against to the transverse distance from the left bank of the channel for curved sections s3 s9 and the straight sections s6 s7 in fig 5 in fig 5a the values of dxx hu by df1 changed significantly along the transverse direction showing maximum values at the inner bank and minimum values at the outer bank of the bend this is because the maximum stream wise velocity occurs at the inner bank of the channel bend and the velocity deviation in the vertical direction also maximizes at the inner bank this deviation became more evident at the second apex and caused larger shear dispersion on s9 in contrast to df1 dxx hu by da had almost constant values of 5 3 5 8 at both bend sections and its transversal variations were just 0 19 0 31 which were much smaller than df1 fig 5b shows the variation of dyy hu dyy hu by df1 was higher at the right side while the value by da was almost unchanged across the sections table 2 indicates the standard deviations σ d of the lateral variations of dxx hu and dyy hu across the channel width the value of σ d for da were less than 0 30 at every section which means that the dispersion values are almost evenly distributed over the section around its mean in contrast σ d of dxx hu ranged from 0 73 to 1 57 on s3 and increased to 1 72 2 39 on s9 similarly σ d of dyy hu by df1 had values between 1 28 and 3 69 which were about 8 5 99 0 times larger than the deviation of da the main difference between the two types of dispersion tensor is whether they can consider the change of shear dispersion across the channel width the span wise variations in df1 are caused by the flow structures in the meandering channel in the bends of meandering channel the first kind secondary currents occurred due to the channel curvature blanckaert and graf 2004 the effects of the secondary currents can be quantified using the secondary currents intensity sci defined as follows seo et al 2006 17 s c i 1 m p i 1 m p 0 h u n 2 d z h i 0 w u s d z w where mp is the number of measuring points the sci shows the relative strength between the primary velocity and the shear velocity by a helical motion in a cross section the relationships between the sci and the span wise variations of df1 and da were analyzed in fig 6 by plotting with σ d in the two bends s3 s5 and s8 s10 the results show that σ d of df1 tended to increase as the value of sci became larger whereas σ d of da maintained an almost constant value which is the same as the trend seen in fig 5 the magnitude of sci increased when w h and u were raised thus the relatively large sci was found in case 206 and a small sci appeared in case 406 from these relationships it can be concluded that the lateral variations of df1 would be increased in a large width to depth ratio furthermore the results of 2d mixing simulations would have relatively large errors because da does not include the effects of secondary flows based on these analyses it was found that df1 is more effective than da in describing the shear dispersion in meandering channels 3 2 dispersion tensors using velocity profile formulas it was shown that df is better suited to represent the spatial variations of dispersion in meandering channels to calculate df the vertical profiles of both the stream wise and span wise velocities should be provided however detailed information on velocity data is not easily obtainable thus an alternative is to use the theoretical formulas of velocity profiles in the proposed approach the depth averaged velocities in the stream wise u s and span wise u n directions were provided from the simulation results of a hydrodynamic model and the vertical velocity profiles are represented using the theoretical and the empirical formulas suggested by previous research from the generated velocity profiles df can be calculated even though there are no measurements this approach is referred to as df2 in this study among the various 2d hydrodynamic models hdm 2d was used to calculate the depth averaged velocity fields this model has been tested against various flow problems in laboratory channels and natural rivers song et al 2012 seo et al 2014 in this study the logarithmic profile was applied for the stream wise velocity because this equation has been proven by a number of experimental data jackson 1981 the logarithmic profile proposed by rozovskii 1957 for the stream wise velocity is given below 18 u s ζ u s 1 g κ c 1 ln ζ where c h r h 1 6 n m is the chezy coefficient and n is the manning s coefficient in case of the span wise velocity distribution several researchers including rozovskii 1957 kikkawa et al 1976 odgaard 1986 and jung 2012 have proposed velocity distribution formulas to represent the secondary currents in curved channels fig 7 represents the comparison of the vertical velocity distributions between previous research and the experimental results of park 2008 who measured the vertical velocity structures at apexes of the channel bends s4 and s9 in fig 2 from this figure velocity distribution in vertical direction showed clockwise secondary flow at s4 and counter clockwise at s9 most of the equations for the span wise velocity profile could not successfully replicate the experimental velocity distributions even though the equation by kikkawa et al 1976 modeled the velocity distribution closely at the water surface and the equation by jung 2012 successfully represented the no slip condition at the channel bottom the formula by odgaard 1986 performed better than the formulas by rozovskii 1957 kikkawa et al 1976 and jung 2012 at the channel bends the calculation results of the mean absolute error for each formulas are listed in table 3 in which the formula of odgaard 1986 showed the minimum error compared with other formulas thus following linear profile proposed by odgaard 1986 was selected to reproduce the span wise velocity distribution in the vertical direction 19a u n z u n 2 u n s z h 1 2 19b u n s u s 2 m 1 2 k 2 m h r c where m κ c h g rc is the radius of curvature and un s is the span wise velocity at the water surface in a fully developed flow fig 8 shows the contours of dispersion tensor df using odgaard 1986 s formulas df2 and experimental data df1 df1 and df2 showed spatially varied distributions and each component changed periodically in the stream wise direction further df2 showed the span wise variation of dispersion tensor more distinctly because df2 used an almost continuous data set based on the simulation results the comparisons between df1 and df2 on curved s3 and s9 and cross over s5 and s8 parts are shown in fig 9 df2 behaved similarly to df1 at the first bend s3 however df2 underestimated or overestimated the dispersion properties within inner bank of the cross over s5 and the second bend s9 4 2d pollutant transport modeling incorporating dispersion tensors the df and da were incorporated into the 2d contaminant transport model ram4 seo et al 2008 to simulate the mixing of instantaneously injected mass pollutant in a meandering channel the simulations performed focused on case 206 and 306 in table 1 in the tracer test conservative tracer dye of 100 000 ppm c 0 was injected at the center point ahead of s1 as shown in fig 2 the tracer was introduced as a vertical line source assuming the completion of vertical mixing fig 10 shows the entire mixing process of case 206 in the experiments after the pollutant cloud approached the right bank at 10 s it bifurcated into a double peak due to the non uniform distribution of the primary flow and the complex structure of the secondary currents this tracer bifurcation persisted all the way through the second bend of the meandering channel this is because the tracer was not fully mixed in the vertical during the transport by shear flow thus the tracer near the water surface was transported faster than that at the lower depth and the tracer cloud had concentration fields with two peaks however in simulations pollutant clouds in both cases showed one peak concentration at each time because the conventional advection dispersion model assumed complete mixing in the vertical direction the completion time for vertical mixing tvm has been suggested as follows fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 20 t v m 0 1 h 2 ε z from eq 20 tvm of case 206 and 306 was approximately 17 7 s and 41 6 s respectively the distance for vertical mixing completion can be assumed as downstream of s5 in case 206 and s7 in case 306 according to the computed results of tvm for the reasons described above both simulation results showed difficulties in reproducing the experimental results in the first bend due to the intrinsic restriction of the 2d model however the numerical result by df2 showed more reasonable distributions at the second bend apex and the head of pollutant cloud laterally expanded due to the span wise variations of the dispersion tensor in the second bend whereas the results using da showed a symmetric pattern with respect to its peak therefore model prediction by df2 can produce more accurate results and can partially overcome the limitation of 2d model the time variations in concentration are presented in fig 11 the concentration distribution by simulations rose faster than the measurements in the early stage and the results using the da showed larger discrepancies than df2 the results using df2 can reproduce the peak concentration more closely despite the inconsistencies in the shape of the concentration curves the long tail of the concentration curves which occurred due to the incompletion of vertical mixing could not be successfully replicated in numerical simulation due to the radical assumption of the 2d model the statistical properties of the dimensionless peak concentration c p cp c 0 centroid μ t and variance σ t 2 of the concentration time curves are listed in table 4 the value of μ t and σ t 2 were calculated as follows 21 μ t m 1 m 0 m 0 0 c x i t d t m 1 0 c x i t t d t 22 σ t 2 m 2 m 0 μ t 2 m 2 0 c x i t t 2 d t from the comparisons in table 4 the errors using the df2 tended to decrease as the pollutant moved downstream while the results using the da showed huge errors besides the results at s4 the μ t and σ t 2 of concentration time curves using the df2 achieved less than 10 errors these results can be obtained due to the spatial heterogeneities of the df2 as shown in fig 8 each component of the dispersion tensor changed spatially due to the artificially generated shear flow and the effects of velocity deviations along the entire flow depth were incorporated in df2 thus the simulation results using the df1 perform better than the results using the da the span wise dispersion between the measurements and the simulation results was compared using the concentration dimensionless cumulative discharge η curves 23 η 1 q 0 n u s 2 u n 2 h d n the value of η is 0 at the left bank and 1 at the right bank fig 12 shows the comparisons of the concentration curves the measurements at s4 showed large differences compared with simulation results due to the three dimensional mixing behaviors caused by the clock wise helical motion at s4 the large errors were gradually decreased at s6 and s9 in the results using the df2 because the vertical mixing would be almost completed from s6 based on the calculation results of tvm however the results using the da still have large discrepancies at s6 and the concentration was highly underestimated through the entire simulation area the distributions of the da showed laterally averaged values of the df1 as shown in fig 5 and thus the dispersion could be overestimated where the velocity deviations decreased over the water depth consequently the 2d model using the df1 can be successfully applied even when the tracer cloud passes through a locally three dimensional mixing region in this study the mixing phenomena by two different approaches were analyzed from a local point of view thus larger extent impacts or the influences of da and df on river scale dispersion need to be mentioned when the vertical velocities in longitudinal and transverse directions are deviated far away from the means and widely dispersed over the depth which frequently occurs in flood or rainy season the shear advection is strongly activated in tidal river the large scale currents are generated by the interaction between the tidal wave and the bathymetry and the shear flow dispersion exerts significant effects in pollutant mixing also when a flow passes around a bend the centripetal forces induce a flow towards the outside bank at the surface and a compensating reverse flow near the bottom and the vertical variation of velocity gradient became much bigger in these situations df might have larger values compared to da in terms of application aspect df needs the vertical velocity distributions in streamwise and spanwise directions to compute the integration while da requires longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients 5 summary and conclusions in this study spatially varying dispersion tensors were calculated in a meandering channel using the vertical profiles of velocity df and the results were compared with the dispersion tensors using the depth averaged flow fields da in the meandering channel the each component of both the dispersion tensors shows periodic patterns along the stream wise direction while only the df shows variations in the span wise direction these results were obtained because the df includes effects of the complex flow distributions induced by the occurrence of secondary flows in the meandering channel in practical aspects the df is limited to use in 2d mixing simulations due to the inconvenience of obtaining vertical velocity profiles thus in this study theoretical formulas to reproduce vertical velocity profiles from the depth averaged flow fields were used as an alternative for calculation of the df the calculation results of df using velocity formulas properly reproduced the spatial variations of shear dispersion when compared with the results using the measured flow data the results of the 2d contaminant transport simulations using the df and the da were compared with the results of the tracer test conducted in the meandering channel the comparison results showed that both simulation results have large discrepancies in the first bend because the vertical mixing of the tracer cloud was not completed in the initial mixing phase however after passing the first bend arrival time and the peak concentration errors decreased in the df results because the df includes the span wise variations of shear dispersion these results were more clearly observed when the concentration time and concentration cumulative discharge curves were compared from these results it is concluded that the 2d advection dispersion model using the df2 can be successfully applied even when the tracer cloud passes through a locally three dimensional mixing region and hence overcome the intrinsic restriction of the 2d approach credit authorship contribution statement inhwan park investigation writing original draft il won seo project administration conceptualization jaehyun shin visualization

453,the dispersion coefficient is the most crucial parameter that governs the model prediction of pollutant mixing in rivers however the spatial variability of dispersion coefficient associated with velocity structures has not yet been thoroughly investigated in this study two types of spatially varying dispersion tensors were considered using both the vertical velocity profiles df and the depth averaged flow fields da and the pollutant transports using df and da were compared with tracer test results in a meandering channel the results showed that the peak concentration and arrival time were more accurately predicted by using df than da because the flow properties associated with the shear induced dispersion were explicitly incorporated in the df the spatial distributions of the df showed variations in both stream wise and span wise directions due to the creation and destruction of secondary flow in the meandering channel in contrast the da only changed in the stream wise direction therefore the df is advantageous to reproduce shear dispersion processes keywords 2d contaminant transport model dispersion tensor shear flow dispersion meandering channel velocity distribution 1 introduction a water quality forecasting system for predicting the concentration of pollutants following unexpected accidents in natural rivers is a useful tool to secure water resources the system needs to provide accurate arrival and retention time of polluted water based on analysis of mixing behaviors in rivers pollutants mixing in rivers is strongly influenced by the shear flow generated by channel geometries and roughness the shear flow mixing is usually determined by contaminant transport models based on the advection dispersion equation among the various contaminant transport models rma4 king et al 2005 and aquasea vatnaskil 1998 use the 2d advection dispersion equation in combination with the constant dispersion coefficient because the dispersion coefficient considerably affects pollutant concentration it is the crucial parameter that governs the mixing of pollutant in rivers since taylor 1954 proposed the concept of longitudinal dispersions in pipe flow there have been significant improvements in dispersion studies elder 1959 suggested the longitudinal dispersion coefficient formula which was derived from the logarithmic velocity profile in the assumption of infinitely wide straight channel fischer et al 1979 maintained that the longitudinal dispersion is affected by span wise velocity distributions in the flow direction rather than in the vertical direction from these theoretical studies chikwendu 1986 developed the n zone model and reported the importance of dispersion induced by velocity deviations in the vertical direction deng et al 2002 derived an integral expression for the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and an analytical method for prediction of the dispersion coefficient in natural streams experimental studies have also been carried out to understand the relationship between the dispersion coefficient and the secondary current marion et al 2006 studied longitudinal dispersion which is affected by secondary currents in curved parts of meandering channels albers and steffler 2007 studied the effect of secondary currents on span wise pollutant mixing boxall and guymer 2007 investigated longitudinal mixing at various flow rates within each of the channels by monitoring the development of tracer plumes during transit through the channels they were able to capture the variation in the longitudinal mixing coefficient with longitudinal meander location channel form and discharge seo et al 2008 found that the dispersion coefficients considering velocity profiles showed better results in predicting pollutant mixing lanzoni et al 2018 set up a rational framework of analytical estimate for longitudinal dispersion associated with spatial non uniformities of the flow field in practical aspects the in situ 2d tracer tests were conducted to estimate reach averaged longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients because of its simplicity and applicability baek et al 2006 calculated longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients using moment and routing methods from 2d tracer test results in meandering channel seo et al 2016 conducted tracer tests in natural rivers of various sizes and proposed an empirical formula to estimate dispersion coefficients based on hydraulic and geometric variables however the 2d contaminant transport model using the reach averaged dispersion coefficient still suffers from inaccurate results because complex mixing phenomena cannot be reproduced by an invariant dispersion coefficient thus the spatially varying dispersion coefficients are required to increase the accuracy of the model prediction several numerical studies on 2d contaminant transport models that adopt spatially varying dispersion tensors have been reported piasecki and katopodes 1999 developed a 2d contaminant transport model that includes the dispersion tensor by coordinate transformations lee and seo 2007 applied the dispersion tensors of alavian 1986 to a 2d contaminant transport model and confirmed priorities of applying the spatially varying dispersion coefficient according to lee and kim 2012 the dispersion tensor is effective in analyzing tracer mixing in curved open channels where the vertically skewed shear flow occurs the vast majority of the existing researches on the estimation of the dispersion coefficient has been conducted to develop an empirical formula for dispersion coefficients that parameterizes dimensionless hydraulic variables or channel geometry parameters based on field measurements or available relationship seo and cheong 1998 deng et al 2002 kashefipour and falconer 2002 wang and huai 2016 baek and seo 2017 a notable study that has a similar approach to the present article is seo et al 2008 inspired by the spatially heterogeneous dispersion that had evolved in a curved channel seo et al 2008 investigated two types of dispersion coefficient tensor 1 estimated by measured vertical velocity profile and 2 predicted based on the depth averaged velocity field however they only used elder s and fisher s formulas shown below to estimate the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients 1 d l 5 93 h u 2 d t 0 15 h u where dl is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient dt is the transverse dispersion coefficient h is the depth and u is the shear velocity they computed u using the relationship between the hydraulic radius and the friction slope given as follows 3 u g r h s f where g is the gravitational acceleration rh is the hydraulic radius and sf is the friction slope to calculate sf they employed the manning s equation s f 1 2 n u r h 2 3 in which u u 2 v 2 is the velocity magnitude and n is the manning s roughness coefficient because h rh n and ucan be determined by experimental conditions and measured data sf and u can also be obtained to produce the dl and dt as described above they applied empirical equations and analytical relations consecutively however the equation and relations require several assumptions and hypothesis consequently the dispersion coefficients predicted by seo et al 2008 were subject to considerable errors additionally they only employed the measured vertical velocity and thus did not analyze how the dispersion would behave under generally adopted velocity distribution formulas such as kikkawa et al 1976 or odgaard 1986 lastly their study was mainly focused on cross sectionally averaged physical quantities and statistical properties hence they did not elucidate the spatial variation of dispersion coefficients in streamwise and spanwise direction in this study spatially varying dispersion tensors were calculated in a laboratory channel in three ways 1 vertical velocity data by measurement df1 2 vertical velocity profiles imported using theoretical or empirical formulas df2 and 3 depth averaged flow field da from the calculation results the spatial change in dispersion coefficient was analyzed in a meandering channel with two bends in addition the two types of dispersion tensors were applied to a 2d contaminant transport model and compared with tracer test results the aforementioned research procedures are schematized in fig 1 2 theoretical derivations 2 1 2d advection dispersion model with dispersion tensor the 2d advection dispersion equation 2d ade has been widely used for the analysis of pollutant mixing in the intermediate area where the vertical mixing is completed fischer et al 1979 the 2d ade is derived from the reynolds averaged three dimensional advection diffusion equation the reynolds averaged three dimensional advection diffusion equation defined in the cartesian coordinate reads 4 c t x i u i c x j e i j c x j i j 1 2 3 where c is the time averaged concentration ui is the time averaged velocity in xi x y z directions respectively and eij is the turbulent diffusion coefficient on each direction each component in eq 4 neglects the turbulent fluctuations which occur in period shorter than the averaging time scale the point values of ui and c are decomposed into the depth averaged value and deviation from it as follows 5a u i u i u i 5b c c c where u i is the depth averaged velocity u i is the velocity deviation c is the depth averaged concentration and c is the concentration deviation the 2d ade can be obtained by substituting eqs 5 15 16 into eq 4 and depth averaging it with the leibnitz s rule and the reynolds rule of average then the integration term representing the product of velocity and concentration fluctuation can be regarded as the mass transport property in the fickian type dispersion taylor 1954 fischer et al 1979 6 m i 1 h 0 h u i c d z d i j c x j i j 1 2 where m i is the rate of mass transport in x y directions and dij is the dispersion tensor using eq 6 the 2d ade can be rewritten as 7 h c t u i h c x i x i h d i j c x j i j 1 2 the 2d ade with the tensor type dispersion coefficient was applied in the numerical modeling of pollutant mixing by piasecki and katopodes 1999 two dimensional pollutant transport models such as mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and ram4 seo et al 2008 also employ eq 7 as the mathematical model 2 2 dispersion tensors incorporating vertical velocity profile fischer et al 1979 provided dispersion tensors derived by physical analysis in skewed shear flow 8 c c t u i u i c c x i x j e i j c c x j i j 1 2 3 if the vertical mixing is completed we can neglect the advection diffusion equation in the z direction to transform eq 8 into the lagrangian coordinates substitutions of ξ i x i u i t and τ t yield 9 c c τ u i c c ξ i ξ j e i j c c ξ j z e z c z i j 1 2 in eq 9 the first term in right hand side including eij can be neglected because dispersion with velocity deviations is more dominant than mixing by turbulent diffusion in the turbulent diffusion term in the z direction ez is interpreted as the eddy viscosity ε z by the reynolds analogy following taylor 1954 c c and the time derivative term can be eliminated according to the above statements the 2d diffusion equation in the cartesian coordinates is expressed as 10 u i c x i z ε z c z i 1 2 after integrating eq 10 in the z direction concentration deviation in shear flow can be expressed as 11 c z 0 z 1 ε z 0 z u i c x i d z d z i 1 2 by inserting eq 11 into eq 6 dispersion tensors incorporating velocity deviations in the vertical direction are derived as 12 d i j 1 h 0 h u i z 0 z 1 ε z 0 z u j z d z d z d z i j 1 2 ε z in eq 12 has a parabolic distribution over depth as follows 13 ε z κ ζ 1 ζ h u where ζ z h and κ is the von kármán constant in the above procedure the reynolds analogy was introduced which assumes uniform flow and wide rectangular section hereafter eq 12 is referred to as df by introducing the velocity deviations in the vertical direction u i in eq 12 df can accommodate the secondary current effects that usually occur in meandering streams for this reason df is useful to characterize shear induced dispersion in the modeling of 2d pollutant mixing however the main obstacle in calculating df for the 2d ade model is the lack of velocity data in the vertical direction thus the theoretical equations for the vertical velocity profile were imported in df and these dispersion tensors then incorporated into the 2d ade model 2 3 dispersion tensor incorporating mean velocities for most natural streams the flow direction varies continuously according to the spatial alignment of the channel therefore the transport and dispersion behaviors can be more properly described in the natural coordinate system which is defined by the axes along the streamlines s and its normal direction n cheng et al 1984 sun and sun 1996 lee and seo 2013 14 c t u s c s s d l c s n d t c n where u s is the depth averaged velocity in the stream wise direction s the description in the natural coordinate system has advantages in that the dispersion tensor becomes a diagonal matrix and the solution of the equation can be simplified cirpka et al 1999 eq 14 has an intrinsic assumption that the dispersion phenomena is predominant in the form of elliptic shape stretched along the streamwise and spanwise direction if we want to describe the irregularly directing pollutant mixing in the cartesian coordinate system the metric coefficient or the jacobian matrix should be introduced because these coefficients act as a corrector for distance difference between curved length and straight line yotsukura 1977 smith 1983 yoshida and nagaoka 2014 by applying the chain rule and the relations of x s u u and y s v u rhs of eq 14 can be transformed into fixed cartesian coordinate as follows 15a s d l c s d l u 2 u 2 2 c x 2 d l u v u 2 2 c x y d l u v u 2 2 c y x d l v 2 u 2 2 c y 2 15b n d t c n d t

follows alavian 1986 16a d x x d l u 2 u 2 d t v 2 u 2 16b d x y d y x d l d t u v u 2 16c d y y d t u 2 u 2 d l v 2 u 2 eq 16 has been employed for two dimensional solute transport simulations in open channel flows hekmat et al 2015 kim et al 2018a kim et al 2018b in this study the dispersion tensors calculated by eq 16 are indicated as da although da can be calculated using the depth averaged velocity and dispersion coefficients there are difficulties associated with it in that the dispersion coefficients dl and dt need to be estimated for the given study areas several methods have been employed to estimate the dispersion coefficients among them the trace test is a viable way to determine the dispersion coefficients concentration time curves are acquired by measuring the concentration at specific positions downstream of an injection point and the dispersion coefficients can be estimated by applying the moment methods or routing procedure however this method has challenges such as 1 sensitivity to the flow or weather conditions in the reach 2 increasing costs and labor requirements when carried out in huge rivers and 3 the consideration of trapping or storage zone effect thus in practice empirical formulas such as elder 1959 and fisher et al 1979 are frequently used due to their simplicity these formulas parameterize hydraulic variables such as the channel geometry average depth channel width bed shape factor or sinuosity mean velocity or shear velocity however the dispersion coefficients predicted by empirical formula have large error bound ranging from 37 to 320 wang and huai 2016 and they should be applied with caution therefore in this study the measured dispersion coefficients shown in table 1 were adopted for calculation of da 3 calculation of dispersion tensors the spatially varying dispersion tensors were calculated in three ways following the research procedure shown in fig 1 df defined in eq 12 was computed in two ways df1 was obtained by introducing the vertical velocities by measurement in a laboratory channel and df2 was acquired by incorporating the theoretical or empirical velocity formulas in the vertical direction into eq 12 in constrast da was calculated by using both the depth averaged velocity fields from 2d hydrodynamic modeling and the dl and dt presented in table 1 targeting a meandering channel with two bends the evolution and development of dispersion tensors according to each approach were thoroughly examined 3 1 dispersion tensors based on measured velocity data the dispersion tensors of df1 and da were calculated using measured hydraulic data from park 2008 the experiment was conducted on a laboratory meandering channel as shown in fig 2 the width of the channel is 1 m and total length is 12 m this channel has two curved parts with a 150 arc angle with a rectangular cross section in this channel velocity field was measured along 12 cross sections from s1 to s12 at each section velocity was measured at 19 points in the transverse direction and 6 8 points in the vertical direction according to the water depth in addition park 2008 conducted 2d tracer tests in this channel using salt solution to obtain the concentration time data velocity field was recorded using micro adv acoustic doppler velocimetry and solute concentration was detected using the electrode conductivity meter kenek model nst 30 the density of the salt solution was diluted to that of the flowing water by mixing with methanol at the centerline of the channel marked with a red circle in fig 2 the tracer substance was instantaneously injected into the flowing water as a full depth vertical line source covered by an acrylic cylinder from the collected concentration data park 2008 estimated the dispersion coefficients dl and dt using the 2d routing method baek et al 2006 the experimental conditions and results are listed in table 1 the case numbers were titled as three digits denoting the boundary conditions first two digits represent the water depth in centimeter and the last digit indicates the second decimal place of the flow discharge fig 3 shows calculation results of two types of dispersion tensor df1 and da for case 303 in this figure both the tensors showed periodic patterns in stream wise variations along the meandering channel as the tracer cloud was transported from the first bend to cross over and then to the second bend all the components of df1 varied in both stream wise and span wise directions and the maximum values existed at the inner bank of the bend however the components of da significantly varied only in stream wise direction as can see in eq 16 the da consists of the velocity ratio and the reach averaged dispersion coefficients and the dispersion coefficients are invariant in both stream wise and span wise directions the velocity ratio is a factor to make variations of the da across the channel width but the velocity ratio is rarely changed in span wise direction because the velocity magnitude increased according to the velocity components in the x and y directions thus the da values show relative dominance between dl and dt according to the velocity ratio and the da merely changes along the stream wise direction unless there are reversal or recirculation flows park and song 2018 in contrast df1 implies the physical mechanisms of pollutant mixing induced by the shear flow which has spatially inhomogeneous distributions the spatial variations of velocity structures caused variations of df1 in both stream wise and span wise directions this means that da might not be appropriate to describe variable pollutant concentrations in span wise directions to investigate the periodic variation of the dispersion tensors more clearly dimensionless width averaged values of the dispersion tensor components d i j h u of df1 and da were plotted against the stream wise distance in fig 4 where the x axis indicates the dimensionless distance from s1 s 0 to the tail gate s l this figure shows that both df1 and da have a similar pattern showing periodical changes along the stream wise direction d x x h u had its maximum value at the apex of the bends s4 s l 0 22 s9 s l 0 68 where the flow direction coincides with x axis d x x h u increased along with the velocity magnitude in the x direction because d x x h u represents the shear flow dispersion in the x direction d x x h u had the minimum value at the cross over sections s6 s l 0 44 s7 s l 0 52 where xdirection velocity approaches zero in contrast to d x x h u d y y h u increased between s6 and s7 where y direction velocity increases in d x y h u positive values were observed at s4 s5 and s8 s9 where the flow changed to a positive y direction in contrast d x y h u and d x y h u showed negative values when the flow direction changes to a negative y direction thus pollutant cloud was distorted asymmetrically by d x y h u component when it passed through s5 s l 0 38 and s8 s l 0 60 comparing between da and df1 the spatially averaged values of da were larger than the values of df1 the da values are based on the reach averaged values of dl and dt shown in table 1 and the dispersion coefficients estimated from the tracer tests tend to be overestimated compared with the velocity based method jung 2012 these results could lead to the differences in simulation results that the mixing behaviors using the da would be more activated than the results using the df as shown in fig 3 da and df1 showed considerable differences in determining the physical spreading in lateral direction to quantify this dimensionless dxx and dyy were plotted against to the transverse distance from the left bank of the channel for curved sections s3 s9 and the straight sections s6 s7 in fig 5 in fig 5a the values of dxx hu by df1 changed significantly along the transverse direction showing maximum values at the inner bank and minimum values at the outer bank of the bend this is because the maximum stream wise velocity occurs at the inner bank of the channel bend and the velocity deviation in the vertical direction also maximizes at the inner bank this deviation became more evident at the second apex and caused larger shear dispersion on s9 in contrast to df1 dxx hu by da had almost constant values of 5 3 5 8 at both bend sections and its transversal variations were just 0 19 0 31 which were much smaller than df1 fig 5b shows the variation of dyy hu dyy hu by df1 was higher at the right side while the value by da was almost unchanged across the sections table 2 indicates the standard deviations σ d of the lateral variations of dxx hu and dyy hu across the channel width the value of σ d for da were less than 0 30 at every section which means that the dispersion values are almost evenly distributed over the section around its mean in contrast σ d of dxx hu ranged from 0 73 to 1 57 on s3 and increased to 1 72 2 39 on s9 similarly σ d of dyy hu by df1 had values between 1 28 and 3 69 which were about 8 5 99 0 times larger than the deviation of da the main difference between the two types of dispersion tensor is whether they can consider the change of shear dispersion across the channel width the span wise variations in df1 are caused by the flow structures in the meandering channel in the bends of meandering channel the first kind secondary currents occurred due to the channel curvature blanckaert and graf 2004 the effects of the secondary currents can be quantified using the secondary currents intensity sci defined as follows seo et al 2006 17 s c i 1 m p i 1 m p 0 h u n 2 d z h i 0 w u s d z w where mp is the number of measuring points the sci shows the relative strength between the primary velocity and the shear velocity by a helical motion in a cross section the relationships between the sci and the span wise variations of df1 and da were analyzed in fig 6 by plotting with σ d in the two bends s3 s5 and s8 s10 the results show that σ d of df1 tended to increase as the value of sci became larger whereas σ d of da maintained an almost constant value which is the same as the trend seen in fig 5 the magnitude of sci increased when w h and u were raised thus the relatively large sci was found in case 206 and a small sci appeared in case 406 from these relationships it can be concluded that the lateral variations of df1 would be increased in a large width to depth ratio furthermore the results of 2d mixing simulations would have relatively large errors because da does not include the effects of secondary flows based on these analyses it was found that df1 is more effective than da in describing the shear dispersion in meandering channels 3 2 dispersion tensors using velocity profile formulas it was shown that df is better suited to represent the spatial variations of dispersion in meandering channels to calculate df the vertical profiles of both the stream wise and span wise velocities should be provided however detailed information on velocity data is not easily obtainable thus an alternative is to use the theoretical formulas of velocity profiles in the proposed approach the depth averaged velocities in the stream wise u s and span wise u n directions were provided from the simulation results of a hydrodynamic model and the vertical velocity profiles are represented using the theoretical and the empirical formulas suggested by previous research from the generated velocity profiles df can be calculated even though there are no measurements this approach is referred to as df2 in this study among the various 2d hydrodynamic models hdm 2d was used to calculate the depth averaged velocity fields this model has been tested against various flow problems in laboratory channels and natural rivers song et al 2012 seo et al 2014 in this study the logarithmic profile was applied for the stream wise velocity because this equation has been proven by a number of experimental data jackson 1981 the logarithmic profile proposed by rozovskii 1957 for the stream wise velocity is given below 18 u s ζ u s 1 g κ c 1 ln ζ where c h r h 1 6 n m is the chezy coefficient and n is the manning s coefficient in case of the span wise velocity distribution several researchers including rozovskii 1957 kikkawa et al 1976 odgaard 1986 and jung 2012 have proposed velocity distribution formulas to represent the secondary currents in curved channels fig 7 represents the comparison of the vertical velocity distributions between previous research and the experimental results of park 2008 who measured the vertical velocity structures at apexes of the channel bends s4 and s9 in fig 2 from this figure velocity distribution in vertical direction showed clockwise secondary flow at s4 and counter clockwise at s9 most of the equations for the span wise velocity profile could not successfully replicate the experimental velocity distributions even though the equation by kikkawa et al 1976 modeled the velocity distribution closely at the water surface and the equation by jung 2012 successfully represented the no slip condition at the channel bottom the formula by odgaard 1986 performed better than the formulas by rozovskii 1957 kikkawa et al 1976 and jung 2012 at the channel bends the calculation results of the mean absolute error for each formulas are listed in table 3 in which the formula of odgaard 1986 showed the minimum error compared with other formulas thus following linear profile proposed by odgaard 1986 was selected to reproduce the span wise velocity distribution in the vertical direction 19a u n z u n 2 u n s z h 1 2 19b u n s u s 2 m 1 2 k 2 m h r c where m κ c h g rc is the radius of curvature and un s is the span wise velocity at the water surface in a fully developed flow fig 8 shows the contours of dispersion tensor df using odgaard 1986 s formulas df2 and experimental data df1 df1 and df2 showed spatially varied distributions and each component changed periodically in the stream wise direction further df2 showed the span wise variation of dispersion tensor more distinctly because df2 used an almost continuous data set based on the simulation results the comparisons between df1 and df2 on curved s3 and s9 and cross over s5 and s8 parts are shown in fig 9 df2 behaved similarly to df1 at the first bend s3 however df2 underestimated or overestimated the dispersion properties within inner bank of the cross over s5 and the second bend s9 4 2d pollutant transport modeling incorporating dispersion tensors the df and da were incorporated into the 2d contaminant transport model ram4 seo et al 2008 to simulate the mixing of instantaneously injected mass pollutant in a meandering channel the simulations performed focused on case 206 and 306 in table 1 in the tracer test conservative tracer dye of 100 000 ppm c 0 was injected at the center point ahead of s1 as shown in fig 2 the tracer was introduced as a vertical line source assuming the completion of vertical mixing fig 10 shows the entire mixing process of case 206 in the experiments after the pollutant cloud approached the right bank at 10 s it bifurcated into a double peak due to the non uniform distribution of the primary flow and the complex structure of the secondary currents this tracer bifurcation persisted all the way through the second bend of the meandering channel this is because the tracer was not fully mixed in the vertical during the transport by shear flow thus the tracer near the water surface was transported faster than that at the lower depth and the tracer cloud had concentration fields with two peaks however in simulations pollutant clouds in both cases showed one peak concentration at each time because the conventional advection dispersion model assumed complete mixing in the vertical direction the completion time for vertical mixing tvm has been suggested as follows fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 20 t v m 0 1 h 2 ε z from eq 20 tvm of case 206 and 306 was approximately 17 7 s and 41 6 s respectively the distance for vertical mixing completion can be assumed as downstream of s5 in case 206 and s7 in case 306 according to the computed results of tvm for the reasons described above both simulation results showed difficulties in reproducing the experimental results in the first bend due to the intrinsic restriction of the 2d model however the numerical result by df2 showed more reasonable distributions at the second bend apex and the head of pollutant cloud laterally expanded due to the span wise variations of the dispersion tensor in the second bend whereas the results using da showed a symmetric pattern with respect to its peak therefore model prediction by df2 can produce more accurate results and can partially overcome the limitation of 2d model the time variations in concentration are presented in fig 11 the concentration distribution by simulations rose faster than the measurements in the early stage and the results using the da showed larger discrepancies than df2 the results using df2 can reproduce the peak concentration more closely despite the inconsistencies in the shape of the concentration curves the long tail of the concentration curves which occurred due to the incompletion of vertical mixing could not be successfully replicated in numerical simulation due to the radical assumption of the 2d model the statistical properties of the dimensionless peak concentration c p cp c 0 centroid μ t and variance σ t 2 of the concentration time curves are listed in table 4 the value of μ t and σ t 2 were calculated as follows 21 μ t m 1 m 0 m 0 0 c x i t d t m 1 0 c x i t t d t 22 σ t 2 m 2 m 0 μ t 2 m 2 0 c x i t t 2 d t from the comparisons in table 4 the errors using the df2 tended to decrease as the pollutant moved downstream while the results using the da showed huge errors besides the results at s4 the μ t and σ t 2 of concentration time curves using the df2 achieved less than 10 errors these results can be obtained due to the spatial heterogeneities of the df2 as shown in fig 8 each component of the dispersion tensor changed spatially due to the artificially generated shear flow and the effects of velocity deviations along the entire flow depth were incorporated in df2 thus the simulation results using the df1 perform better than the results using the da the span wise dispersion between the measurements and the simulation results was compared using the concentration dimensionless cumulative discharge η curves 23 η 1 q 0 n u s 2 u n 2 h d n the value of η is 0 at the left bank and 1 at the right bank fig 12 shows the comparisons of the concentration curves the measurements at s4 showed large differences compared with simulation results due to the three dimensional mixing behaviors caused by the clock wise helical motion at s4 the large errors were gradually decreased at s6 and s9 in the results using the df2 because the vertical mixing would be almost completed from s6 based on the calculation results of tvm however the results using the da still have large discrepancies at s6 and the concentration was highly underestimated through the entire simulation area the distributions of the da showed laterally averaged values of the df1 as shown in fig 5 and thus the dispersion could be overestimated where the velocity deviations decreased over the water depth consequently the 2d model using the df1 can be successfully applied even when the tracer cloud passes through a locally three dimensional mixing region in this study the mixing phenomena by two different approaches were analyzed from a local point of view thus larger extent impacts or the influences of da and df on river scale dispersion need to be mentioned when the vertical velocities in longitudinal and transverse directions are deviated far away from the means and widely dispersed over the depth which frequently occurs in flood or rainy season the shear advection is strongly activated in tidal river the large scale currents are generated by the interaction between the tidal wave and the bathymetry and the shear flow dispersion exerts significant effects in pollutant mixing also when a flow passes around a bend the centripetal forces induce a flow towards the outside bank at the surface and a compensating reverse flow near the bottom and the vertical variation of velocity gradient became much bigger in these situations df might have larger values compared to da in terms of application aspect df needs the vertical velocity distributions in streamwise and spanwise directions to compute the integration while da requires longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients 5 summary and conclusions in this study spatially varying dispersion tensors were calculated in a meandering channel using the vertical profiles of velocity df and the results were compared with the dispersion tensors using the depth averaged flow fields da in the meandering channel the each component of both the dispersion tensors shows periodic patterns along the stream wise direction while only the df shows variations in the span wise direction these results were obtained because the df includes effects of the complex flow distributions induced by the occurrence of secondary flows in the meandering channel in practical aspects the df is limited to use in 2d mixing simulations due to the inconvenience of obtaining vertical velocity profiles thus in this study theoretical formulas to reproduce vertical velocity profiles from the depth averaged flow fields were used as an alternative for calculation of the df the calculation results of df using velocity formulas properly reproduced the spatial variations of shear dispersion when compared with the results using the measured flow data the results of the 2d contaminant transport simulations using the df and the da were compared with the results of the tracer test conducted in the meandering channel the comparison results showed that both simulation results have large discrepancies in the first bend because the vertical mixing of the tracer cloud was not completed in the initial mixing phase however after passing the first bend arrival time and the peak concentration errors decreased in the df results because the df includes the span wise variations of shear dispersion these results were more clearly observed when the concentration time and concentration cumulative discharge curves were compared from these results it is concluded that the 2d advection dispersion model using the df2 can be successfully applied even when the tracer cloud passes through a locally three dimensional mixing region and hence overcome the intrinsic restriction of the 2d approach credit authorship contribution statement inhwan park investigation writing original draft il won seo project administration conceptualization jaehyun shin visualization

454,precipitation p plant water use and evaporation from the soil surface control the travel time of streamflow q and evapotranspiration et in a complex way however the impact of soil moisture and energy availability on the travel time distribution ttd of evaporated and transpired waters are yet less understood in this study we investigate how the seasonal variability of p and et in terms of phase shift and rate influences the temporal dynamics of ttds to this end we choose four contrasting climate types described as in phase p and et out of phase p and et year round constant p with seasonal et and year round constant et with seasonal p we use a physically based hydrological model to simulate dominant processes in the water and energy cycles as well as subsurface flow velocity which are subsequently used in a lagrangian particle tracking model to characterize the age distribution of water particles in space and time the results prove that the soil moisture availability than the et rate imposes a stronger control on the ttd of transpired water in all climate scenarios plants indicate an overall tendency towards younger water particles unless in periods with a pronounced dry condition when old waters are more available in the deeper soil layers in particular the climate scenario with out of phase p and et yields the highest percentage of old particles taken up by plants furthermore et age sampling mechanism shows hysteresis against the et rate with an opposite direction in climates with in phase and out of phase p and et our results also suggest that the ratio between the median travel time of q and the median age of water storage has a dual relationship with the q rate indicating the existence of a threshold behavior that distinguishes the direct and

we focus on another important control on et and q travel times that is the seasonality of and the phase shift between precipitation p and et fluxes depending on the type of climate in a region the interplay between energy and water availability translates into complexity on how water particles of different travel times are preferentially discharged by different outflows such as q and et for instance brinkmann et al 2018 showed that the composition of water taken up by trees in a region with temperate climate includes a similar portion of water particles with a wide range of travel times that initiated from p events falling in the growing or previous seasons on the other hand by compiling the available worldwide isotopic data in p q soil and tree water barbeta and peñuelas 2017 concluded that in regions with a pronounced dry season on average 49 and 28 of plant water use is composed of groundwater particles in the dry and wet seasons respectively nevertheless it remains to investigate how the contribution of young and old water to transpired water travel times change in regions with different climates to this end we use the recently developed lagrangian particle tracking model ecoslim maxwell et al 2019 to quantify the flow pathways and transient travel time of particles leaving a hillslope through et and q ecoslim is coupled interactively with the subsurface and land surface models parflow clm danesh yazdi et al 2018 to simulate subsurface flow velocities and energy balance components at the land surface we employ this approach in a hypothetic catchment to study the interaction between et and q travel time dynamics under four different climatic forcings with contrasting seasonality in p and et in particular we aim to explore the following questions 1 how does the seasonal variation of p and et individually and with respect to each other impact the ttd of q and et fluxes under different climate conditions 2 how do the soil moisture availability and et rate control the ttd of evaporated and transpired waters 3 what is the relationship between water storage and the age sampling mechanism of q and et the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the hydrological model section 2 1 the particle tracking model section 2 2 measures of ttd analysis section 2 3 the model setup and properties section 2 4 and the data we used section 2 5 for the objectives of this study in section 3 the impact of seasonality in p and et on the shape and temporal dynamics of the q and et ttds are discussed different schemes for the age sampling preference of et and the emergence of hysteresis are also discussed the threshold behavior in the direct and inverse storage effects is further investigated in section 3 finally section 4 presents the concluding remarks of this study 2 methods 2 1 hydrologic model we use the physically based numerical model parflow clm to simulate the hydrologic cycle processes in the subsurface surface and plant canopy using the three dimensional form of the richards equation parflow solves subsurface flow velocity field in the saturated groundwater and unsaturated vadose zones kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell 2013 that is subsequently used to compute particle transport velocity in the particle tracking model section 2 2 parflow is coupled to the land surface model common land model clm to simulate the processes involving in the surface energy budget such as et and snow dai et al 2003 maxwell and miller 2005 parflow and clm exchange information in a manner that the soil moisture computed by parflow in the root zone is used in clm to compute the momentum sensible heat latent heat and ground heat fluxes among other variables since the conceptual framework and the governing equations of parflow clm have been previously discussed in detail here we only outline how the coupled model computes evaporation and transpiration fluxes which are critical for the objectives of this study see oleson et al 2013 for further details on clm water balance in a hillslope can be written as 1 d s t d t p t q t e t t where s is the water storage volume per unit area l p is the precipitation rate lt 1 q is the rate of flow exiting the hillslope as streamflow lt 1 and et is the evapotranspiration rate lt 1 et in clm is composed of three components i e i evaporation from ground surface ii evaporation from wet canopy leaves and stems and iii plant transpiration ground evaporation eg lt 1 is the sum of evaporation from soil esoil lt 1 snow esnow lt 1 and water covered surfaces e h 2 o lt 1 that is computed using the following equations 2 e g i t e s o i l i t e s n o w i t e h 2 o i t i 1 3 e s o i l i t ρ a ρ w q s o i l i t q s t r a w t r l i t t e r i t i 1 4 e

surface ρ a ml 3 is the intrinsic density of air ρ w ml 3 is the intrinsic density of water qs mm 1 qsoil mm 1 qsnow mm 1 and q h 2 o mm 1 are the specific humidity of canopy soil snow and surface water respectively r aw tl 1 is the aerodynamic resistance to water vapor transfer between the ground and canopy and rlitter tl 1 is a resistance for the plant litter layer all fluxes in eqs 2 to 5 are computed at the top soil layer evaporation from the wet fraction of vegetation eveg lt 1 and the total transpiration e tr tot lt 1 of the dry portion of vegetation are computed by 6 e v e g t l s

saturation specific humidity at the vegetation temperature transpiration in a given soil layer i is computed as a fraction of e tr tot based on the layer s effective root fraction r e i t which is the product of the root fraction ri and plant wilting factor wi t expressed as 9 e t r i t r e i t e t r t o t t 1 i n 10 r e i t r i w i t i 1 n r i w i t 1 i n 11 w i t ψ c ψ i t ψ c ψ o θ t 1 i n 12 r

soil water potential l when stomata is fully closed and open respectively ψ i is the soil water matric potential of layer i l θ is the ratio of effective porosity to total porosity zi is the depth from the soil surface to the interface of layers i and i 1 l and ra and rb are root distribution parameters zeng 2001 i 1 n r i w i t ranges from near 0 when soil is dry to 1 when soil is wet ri depends on the plant functional type and is a decreasing exponential function of soil depth the accuracy and robustness of the et estimation from this approach has been already demonstrated by former studies on land surface modeling e g oleson et al 2013 and liu et al 2016 as well as validated against field observations e g shi et al 2013 the rate of water height change in a given soil layer i e δw i t lt 1 depends on the infiltration rate inf lt 1 evaporation and transpiration fluxes corresponding to that layer as well as interactions with the adjacent layers for the top soil layer we have 14 δ w i t i n f i t e g i t e t r i t q i i t q o i t i 1 where qi and qo represent inflow from and outflow to adjacent layers respectively and inf is computed by subtracting the overland flow and canopy integration from p for the deeper soil layers i e 1 i n eg and inf do not exist and thus δw reduces to 15 δ w i t e t r i t q i i t q o i t 1 i n in section 2 2 we describe in detail how δw i t is used to add particles into or remove them from the subsurface we also note that the et computed in this study does not include eveg because eveg belongs to the volume of water that is intercepted by and evaporated from the canopy surface hence this portion of water does not reach the ground surface and obviously cannot be traced by the particle tracking module communications between parflow and clm are reflected into many instances in the coupled modeling for instance the specific humidity soil resistance factor infiltration rate and heat flux rate calculated by clm at the soil layers are dependent on the soil degree of saturation that is alternatively calculated by parflow jefferson and maxwell 2015 on the other hand the rate of et flux is used by parflow to update the pressure head and the velocity field which is later used in the particle tracking model to advance the particles along their pathways therefore a more accurate representation of the soil moisture leads to a more realistic transport properties of water particles like their ttds demonstration on the improved accuracy of soil moisture computation in the root zone as the result of coupling between parflow and clm has been already shown by maxwell and miller 2005 2 2 particle tracking model using the lagrangian particle tracking framework employed in the slim model to trace water particles discharging as q bearup et al 2016 danesh yazdi et al 2018 de rooij et al 2013 the recently developed ecoslim model further enables us to trace water particles through their pathways to be evaporated at the soil surface or transpired by plants maxwell et al 2019 in this model i a domain is first set up with an initial condition representing pre stored water particles tagged as groundwater in each domain cell the total mass of particles is determined by the cell water volume computed from parflow the mass is then divided equally to a number of particles that is assigned by the model user ii at every time step a particle leaves the domain as q if its location and velocity direction comply with the constraints imposed by the domain boundary conditions in a three dimensional domain with zero flux boundary conditions at five faces where particles can leave the domain only through the upper top face if a particle resides in the top half portion of the relating top cell near the domain surface as well as its vertical velocity is positive it leaves the domain as q iii at the time steps with positive δw i t computed by parfow clm particles with a total mass equal to the mass equivalent of δw i t 1 i n are added to the top cells along the domain surface the added particles at a given time step are tagged as rainfall or snow depending on the type of p in that time step determined by clm the pre stored particles from step i and the entering new particles from this step possess different masses depending on the saturation degree and the rate of δw i t respectively the three dimensional location of entering particles within each cell is set randomly iv for each cell at the time steps with negative δw i t 1 i n the probability by which a particle may be captured by et is determined by the ratio of δw i t to the available water i t in the particle s residing cell if δ w i t i t r where r is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 the particle is removed from the domain as et we note that given the above mechanism the probability by which the particles are captured by transpiration decreases as the soil depth increases due to the decline in transpiration rate as a result of smaller root fraction v the active particles that did not leave the domain in steps ii and iv are located into their new positions according to the advection and molecular diffusion mechanisms expressed by 16 x p t τ v p x p t t τ z 2 d e τ x p t where xp t l is the location of the particle p at time t τ is the timestep length in which the particle is advected and diffused z is a uniformly distributed random vector with zero mean and unit variance de l2t 1 is the effective molecular diffusivity and vp xp t t lt 1 is the velocity of the particle p at location xp at time t since parflow computes flow velocity at the domain cell faces at each time step a particle s velocity within a cell space is computed by linearly interpolating the velocities at the particle s residing cell faces at that time step see fig 1 in danesh yazdi et al 2018 for further details when the particle moves to another cell velocities at the new cell faces are used to compute the particle s velocity and so on 2 3 ttd computation and analysis ttd can either be computed from the travel time of the particles entering the domain at the same time called forward ttd fttd conditioned on the entrance time or from the travel time of the particles exiting the domain at a given time called backward ttd bttd conditioned on the exit time here we focus on the bttd as it carries information about the history of the transport dynamics influenced by the events took place prior to the time at which the bttd is computed bttds are also directly related to the storage selection sas function and allow for the computation of solute concentration given the time series of solute input benettin et al 2015b at each time step of the particle tracking model run the travel time of those particles satisfying the exit conditions either as q or et are recorded therefore bttds can be computed directly for q or et at any given time step accordingly we can compute the cumulative bttds as 17 p q t t q τ t t q t 18 p et t t et τ t t et t where pq t t and pet t t are the non exceedance probability distribution of travel times t at time t for q and et respectively and q τ t t and et τ t t are the q and et flux with travel times τ equal or smaller than t at time t respectively having a set of bttds over the simulation period we also compute the representative bttd for the last year of the particle tracking simulation as the median distribution of the non exceedance bttds determined by eq 17 and 18 we use the representative bttd to distinguish the impact of climatic condition on the shape of the bttds in the four studied scenarios section 2 5 over the annual scale we also compute and analyze the median travel time mtt as a robust statistical descriptor of the bttd central tendency young water fraction f yw defined as the fraction of particles in q that are younger than a certain travel time kirchner 2016 is also analyzed in particular we compute f yw for water younger than three months to study transport dynamics in a time scale that is comparable to the et travel times and the seasons duration the latter in those scenarios in which the seasonality in p and et are pronounced former studies demonstrated that not only young water contributes to a large portion of steamflow but also represents the rapid transfer of contaminants to the streamflow which highlights its importance in water quality modeling benettin et al 2017 jasechko et al 2016 wilusz et al 2017 another important behavior to study is the dynamic of travel times in outfluxes in relation to the age of stored water in the hillslope to this end we compute the exit age ratio ear defined as 19 e a r q t m t t q t m r t s t 20 e a r e t t m t t e t t m r t s t where mttq t and mttet t are the mtt of water particles exiting the domain via q and et at time t respectively and mrts t is the median residence time mrt of the water particles stored in the domain at the same time t soulsby et al 2016 smaller values of ear indicate a preference for exiting younger water particles and vice versa 2 4 model setup and properties simulations were performed on a synthetic three dimensional rectangular hillslope with a homogeneous land cover and soil physical properties given in table 1 the reasons for the chosen geometrical shape and dimensions were twofold first the hillslope was large enough so that the range of travel times obtained for the particles were close to those that are typically observed in real world catchments second the hillslope was intentionally considered similar to those used in the former studies danesh yazdi et al 2018 maxwell et al 2019 so that the results from different scenarios pursued by each study can be compared independent of the impact of hillslope geometric and geophysical characteristics however the top soil layers in this study were discretized more finely to capture a better representation of the et related quantities such as its flux and travel time vegetation parameters including the leaf and stem area indices aerodynamic roughness length displacement height and leaf dimension were adopted from the igbp classification vegetation parameters see table 1 the domain was constrained by a no flux boundary condition at the bottom and sides hence the particles could leave the domain only across the upper face through q or et at each time step the three dimensional location of all particles after being advected and diffused is checked if the new location of a particle is supposed to fall beyond any no flux boundary the boundary acts as a mirror and reflects the particle back to the domain we intentionally excluded heterogeneity in the vegetation cover and soil properties to ensure that the observed spatiotemporal changes in q and et travel times merely reflect the influence of the phase shift between the four climate scenarios described in section 2 5 for each scenario simulation parflow clm was driven by the relating meteorological forcing until reaching the equilibrium state i e the difference between water storage at two consecutive years becomes less than 1 of total annual p then the parflow clm outputs at the end of the equilibrium state were used as an initial state for the ecoslim simulation similarly ecoslim was run successively until the model spins up by stabilizing the mean age of the particles for each of our scenarios this took five years of simulation finally the model was run for extra 10 years and the results for the last year are reported and discussed here 2 5 climatic scenarios and meteorological data table 2 summarizes the geographical and climatic information of the four types of meteorological forcing we used for scenario simulation these climate types include a hot summer mediterranean climate with wet winters and very dry and hot summers köppen climate zone csa scenario 1 a humid subtropical climate with very little seasonal variation in rainfall and hot summers köppen climate zone cfa scenario 2 a humid subtropical climate with dry winters and wet and hot summers köppen climate zone cwa scenario 3 and a tropical savanna climate with wet and dry seasons and very little seasonal variation in the average temperature köppen climate zone aw scenario 4 the meteorological data used in this study correspond to redding usa 40 5865 n 122 3917 w for the csa

2 further gives the average annual temperature average annual solar radiation and total annual p values at the four study sites fig 1 illustrates the geographical location of the study sites together with the time series of total monthly p and average daily solar radiation for each month in a representative water year of each climate while scenario 1 is identified as out of phase p and et scenario 2 shows a relatively constant p throughout a year with seasonal changes in et scenario 3 indicates in phase p and et and scenario 4 represents wet and dry seasons with relatively constant et throughout a year the study sites were chosen carefully to ensure that they i show distinctive seasonal patterns of p and et and ii do not indicate considerable differences in long term averages of et and total annual p clm input variables i e p temperature pressure wind speed and direction data were obtained from the integrated surface database isd noaa smith et al 2011 data for scenario 1 were recorded at the redding municipal airport station from 2012 to 2013 data for scenario 2 came from the waco regional airport station between 2011 and 2012 data for scenario 3 belong to the ambrosio l v taravella international airport station from 2003 to 2004 and data for scenario 4 were obtained from the bondoukou soko airport station from 2003 to 2004 the shortwave radiation and specific humidity were obtained from the merra 2 dataset gelaro et al 2017 and the downward longwave radiation was estimated using temperature time series according to brutsaert 1975 formulation hourly meteorological data were available in scenarios 1 and 2 however single gaps in data were filled by interpolating values from the previous and following hours since six hourly data were available in scenarios 3 and 4 we used the merra 2 product to generate hourly data by interpolation the exception was the p data which were equally divided between hours the vegetation cover in clm for all scenarios was set to grass which is common between the wide gradient of climates considered in this study dixon et al 2014 3 results and discussion section 3 1 discusses how the phase shift between p and et in contrasting climate scenarios controls the shape of bttds in sections 3 2 and 3 3 we then study the effect of p and et seasonality on the changes in f yw and mtt of q and et the mechanism of age sampling by et under different conditions of soil moisture availability is further discussed in section 3 4 finally the threshold behavior in the direct and inverse storage effects as well as the emergence of hysteresis in the exit age ratio of et are presented in sections 3 5 and 3 6 respectively 3 1 the effect of phase shift between p and et on the shape of ttds fig 2 a and b illustrate the representative bttds in the four scenarios for q and et respectively fig 2a shows that in scenario 1 where p and et are completely out of phase particles discharging as q are younger than those in all the other scenarios this is because the entering new particles by precipitation events in the fall and winter are not taken up by plants due to the low rate of et on the contrary the oldest particles as q correspond to scenario 3 where p and et are in phase indeed a high fraction of entering particles during spring and summer are captured by plants in these seasons due to the high rate of et over the same period the older particles as well as the major portion of the remaining young particles keep on traveling within the domain and thus become older in the following seasons when the low rate of et cannot considerably remove particles from the domain therefore older particles exit via q in all seasons in this case in scenario 4 the year round constant et removes a high fraction of entering particles during fall spring and summer however since the length of the dry period in this scenario is shorter than that in scenario 3 the particles as q are younger and therefore their cumulative bttd shows a higher fraction of particles younger than a given travel time finally the year round constant p in scenario 2 causes a cyclic depletion and replenishment of entering young particles in the seasons with high and low et rates respectively which results in the streamflow bttd that falls between scenarios 1 and 3 the above observations therefore suggest that q comprises of the largest fraction of young and old particles when p and et are out of phase and in phase respectively the effect of frequency and intensity of p on the bttd of et particles is clarified in fig 2b in scenario 1 where p and et are out of phase the occurrence of low p if ever exists in the seasons with high et rates makes only old particles from previous seasons available to plants resulting to the oldest bttd for et in comparison to the other scenarios on the other hand the bttd of et consists of the largest fraction of young particles in scenarios 3 and 4 because young water from p is always available to plants during the highest rates of et in these two scenarios the above observations have important implications for the biogeochemical processing of nutrients as well as for the transport of minerals and organic matters in regions with out of phase p and et q is expected to discharge a large fraction of constituents in soil in a shorter period of time which can potentially lead to a faster degradation of water quality in streams this is because the shorter transport times may not be long enough for the bacterial species in the soil ecosystem to perform biogeochemical reactions to the extent that can remarkably reduce the concentration of chemical constituents impairing soil and water in contrast in the regions with synchronized p and et signals the quality of discharged water from soil is expected to be least impaired if all the other factors influencing the nutrient concentration is the same in all scenarios nevertheless it should be noted that bioremediation might also adversely influence the quality of water discharging from soil under certain environmental conditions the product of biogeochemical reactions can be more toxic than the initial chemical compounds e g iron and sulfate reducing bacteria contribute significantly to arsenic mobilization which brings about major health issues jiang et al 2019 vidali 2001 the significance of the contribution of water travel times to improving the mechanistic predications of nutrient cycling in rivers has also been demonstrated by former studies zarnetske et al 2011 showed that different units of a hyporheic zone can act as reduction or production hot spots of nitrogen depending on their respective flow pathway travel time to the draining stream that is nitrification and denitrification taking place at short and longer travel times respectively they also showed that the transition between the two contrasting behaviors i e from production to removal can be determined by a travel time threshold which is a complex function of physical factors such as those controlling the hydraulic transport of nitrogen scholberg et al 2002 also demonstrated a strong correlation between the water residence time in soil and nitrogen update efficiency by citrus 3 2 controls of p and et seasonality on young water fraction fig 3 shows the time series of q and et for each scenario for the last year of parflow clm ecoslim simulation these time series are color coded by the f yw s computed from the respective fluxes while the seasonal variation in q strongly correlates to that of p as expected the effect of et on the magnitude of q is also noticeable in scenarios 1 2 and 3 in which et shows a seasonal variation for instance the q rate in scenario 1 is higher than that in scenario 3 during the wet season due to the out of phase seasonality between et and p where low et rate in the wet period facilitated the exit of a larger mass of particles via q the average q rate during the wet seasons is 3 4 1 7 2 6 and 2 2 mm day for scenarios 1 to 4 respectively in addition although scenario 2 shows the lowest variability in q due to the year round constant p high et rates in the spring and summer seasons has decreased the q rate to some extent f yw is basically pronounced during the wet seasons when not only new particles enter the domain from p but also higher soil moisture further assists the exit of young ages the ratio of the median f yw in q during the dry periods to the wet periods in scenarios 1 and 3 are 0 05 and 0 125 respectively fig 4 shows the boxplot of daily f yw s for each scenario separately the median annual f yw in q is 9 7 5 9 4 1 and 5 1 for scenarios 1 to 4 respectively scenario 1 indicates the highest median f yw in q mainly because higher degree of soil moisture has led to the flashiest discharge that exited a larger number of very young water particles in contrast to scenario 1 the in phase seasonality of p and et in scenario 3 resulted in the lowest median f yw in q since the low degree of soil moisture together with the uptake of younger particles by et left the storage to be consisted of particles older than three months or so the impact of phase shift between p and et is also projected into the variation of f yw in q the 25th and 75th percentile of f yw in q are 0 04 0 17 0 01 0 19 0 005 0 05 and 0 008 0 08 in scenarios 1 to 4 respectively scenario 4 also shows a relatively small median f yw in q due to the low p rates in the fall and winter as well as the existence of a constant et rate during the whole year in scenario 2 nearly constant p throughout the year allowed for a continuous injection of new water particles with age zero leading to a steady contribution of young ages to the storage age distribution as compared to scenarios 3 and 4 also the removal of a remarkable fraction of young waters due to high et rate in the spring and summer has been compensated by the availability of very young particles at all seasons causing the highest range of f yw variability in q however this scenario did not yield the highest median f yw in q as compared to scenario 1 indeed in spite of the persistency of p to keep the soil moisture high throughout the year in scenario 2 the soil moisture in the wet season is less than that in scenario 1 in which p and et are out of phase as a result a smaller fraction of young particles i e younger than three months in our cases exited the domain the above results demonstrate that under the same total precipitation depth the sequence of seasonality between p and et than the rainfall intermittency has a stronger control on the young fraction of q in the annual scale here a few points are worth mentioning first the median f yw in et in scenario 3 is smaller than that in scenario 1 since the higher rate of et has resulted in removing a larger fraction of older particles decreasing the median f yw second f yw in q gives the largest and smallest coefficient of variation for scenarios 3 and 1 respectively i e 0 17 and 0 13 this is because the major portion of f yw s in scenario 1 exited the domain as q without being interrupted by et while high et rates in scenario 3 during the wet period has induced a larger degree of variability in the f yw distribution the variability of f yw has implications for the analysis of ecosystem vulnerability to soluble contaminant loads along with the solute infiltration history f yw variability has been shown to capture the solute concentration dynamics in streamflow e g benettin et al 2017 hence the lower and upper bounds of f yw give insight about the range of soluble contaminant load expected as well as the risk threating the ecosystem see also stockinger et al 2019 3 3 temporal evolution of q and et median travel time fig 5 indicates the temporal variation of the streamflow mtt mttq which is color coded by the q and et rates separately mttq for each day was computed as the median of the travel time of all the particles that left the domain as q on the same day mttq fluctuates significantly throughout the year in all scenarios i e the standard deviation is 0 52 0 54 0 53 and 0 49 year for scenarios 1 to 4 respectively not surprisingly mttq shows sharp decreases when rainfall events occur which augments the infiltration rate and accordingly the particles velocity in the subsurface furthermore mttq increases during the dry periods between rainfall episodes which allow for the exit of older particles from the domain this is particularly apparent in scenarios 1 and 3 during may to september as well as in scenario 4 during november to january when no rainfall event takes place the observations are in agreement with the results of former studies on the connection between mttq and the wetness of a catchment botter et al 2010 wilusz et al 2017 on the other hand mttq does not show a significant trend throughout the wet seasons due to the constantly occurring rainfall events it is noteworthy that either the seasonal variability or intermittency of p imposes a stronger control on the variability of mttq than et seasonality or rate indeed the comparison between scenario 1 and scenario 3 indicates that given a similar p rate and seasonality contrasting et seasonality has slightly influenced the mttq fluctuations in scenario 1 but increased its trend slope during the dry period as compared to scenario 3 the same observation holds for scenario 2 too therefore the results suggest that during wet seasons where young water is available for et et impose a slight influence on the mttq while it increases in dry seasons where plants take up older waters for transpiration fig 6 indicates the temporal evolution of the evapotranspiration mtt mttet for each scenario color coded by the q and et flux rates separately mttet shows much less variability in a year as compared to that of q fig 5 as well as is typically less than one year old the standard deviation of mttet is 0 23 0 09 0 15 and 0 10 year for scenarios 1 to 4 respectively it is also noted that the high rate of et in scenario 1 in the spring and summer as compared to that in scenario 3 has resulted to larger mttet highlighting the availability of old particles to plants in the absence of young ages from the previous seasons we note that this does not only hold for the dry seasons but also in the wet seasons during the periods in which p is less intermittent for instance in scenario 2 the root zone storage time series right axis in fig 6 shows that due to the decrease of soil moisture content between p events plants have taken up older waters in response to high et rates in the summer 3 4 mechanism of age sampling by et fig 7 illustrates the fraction of water particles removed from the domain via et left axis which is color coded to show the distribution of travel times at each day also p time series are shown on the right axis first the ttd of et is much younger than that of q see also figs 5 and 6 e g the annual mtt of et and q in scenario 1 equals to 89 days and 1 94 years respectively second although et rates are high in the dry season of scenario 1 et is also composed of the water particles entering the domain in the same year the same observation is also found in scenarios 2 and 3 in which et rates are high during the wet season in scenario 4 et rates are high throughout the year removing available young water particles in the wet season and capturing older ones in the dry season as such the results point out that plants do have a preference for younger ages as long as they are available regardless of the season to be wet or dry e g scenario 1 however ttd of et particles is not necessarily composed of the most recent injected water particles e g particles less than three months old but includes older ages from previous seasons as in the dry seasons of scenarios 1 and 4 it is thus observed that evaporation from the top soil layer and transpiration from plants tend to remove younger ages as long as they are available to them otherwise they capture older particles from deeper waters the observation that is consistent with the findings of previous studies barbeta and peñuelas 2017 brinkmann et al 2018 smith et al 2018 it is however noted that the water travel time of transpiration is also governed by other factors than soil moisture availability such as soil pore size and plant root distribution sprenger et al 2019 the above observation has also practical implication for the conceptual studies using the sas function approach to model transient ttds indeed since the preference of the et sampling varies in time depending on the age distribution of stored water seasonal or time variant parameterization of the sas function should be employed so that the dynamic nature of soil water mixing is taken into account appropriately 3 5 threshold behavior in the direct and inverse storage effects fig 8 shows earq versus the q rate for each scenario separately all climatic scenarios indicate a similar behavior i e two contrasting relationships exist between earq and q for a given scenario the two trend lines in fig 8 represent these relationships using a moving average window the turning point between the two relationships was found at the value at which a sharp change occurred in the sign of earq i e positive slope turning to negative the coefficient of determination r2 and the p values of the regression lines are also indicated in this figure all the correlations are statistically significant at 5 percent significant level as evidenced by p value 0 05 earq increases with q until a threshold value after which the relationship becomes reverse the increase of earq until the threshold value is indicative of the direct storage effect benettin et al 2015a harman 2015 i e q rates less than a threshold value prefer to discharge older particles from the storage however when q rates exceed the threshold value earq decreases with the q rate this observation witnesses the inverse storage effect i e a larger fraction of younger water particles is discharged via q when storage increases the younger travel time of discharged water under the wet soil moisture condition is indeed an indication of the activation of fast subsurface flow pathways that facilitate quicker transport of young waters through their journey from the soil matrix to the discharge point conversely lower soil moisture condition provides extra capacity in the soil where the particles can move through slowly and thus become older until they ultimately exit the domain the change of q preference in discharging travel times directly influences the temporal variability in the concentration of solutes by measuring stream n no3 concentration in the catchment schafertal in central germany yang et al 2018 showed a significant correlation between the n no3 concentration and mttq during the wet periods nitrate from the fertilizer application in agricultural fields was transported through the faster shallow subsurface pathways which did not give sufficient time to denitrification to diminish the nitrate concentration on the other hand nitrate could penetrate much deeper into the soil layers during the dry period which allowed the denaturation process to considerably attenuate nitrate concentration before discharging into the stream while mttq i e the numerator of earq has a negative correlation with the q rate results not shown here the change of mrt in the storage i e the denominator of earq is indeed the controlling factor of the mechanism by which water particles are preferentially discharged via q finally the threshold value for the q rate in the four scenarios ranges between 2 3 mm day and 3 7 mm day although our scenarios represent a wide range of climate conditions we cannot make a conclusion about the validity of the above threshold values in determining the point where the direct and inverse storage effects segregate further research is thus needed in other geographic locations with different climatic characteristics to explore this issue 3 6 hysteresis in the relationship between et exit age ratio and rate fig 9 shows earet as a function of et rate for each scenario earet s in this plot have been categorized into the wet and dry periods for a given day if the total amount of p within a 30 days period followed by that day is greater than 40 mm the day belongs to the wet period otherwise the day is tagged as the dry period peel et al 2007 in all scenarios earet is generally lower than 0 1 for the events occurring in the wet period highlighting the strong influence of the accessible young water particles on earet in particular the persistent availability of young ages for the sake of the year round occurring p in scenario 2 have resulted in earet s that are almost less than 0 1 over the whole year larger earet s in this scenario in the spring and summer initiates from the extraction of some old particles in this period due to the high rate of et there is no correlation between earet and the et rate during the wet periods in all scenarios nevertheless earet shows a more pronounced variability in the dry periods in scenarios 1 3 and 4 in scenario 1 earet begins with low values at the beginning of the dry period and then increases to a maximum value of 0 51 while reaching the end of the period however a hysteretic relationship holds between earet and the et rate i e two contrasting earet values can exist for the same amount of et the mechanistic explanation of this behavior is that earet increases with et by the advance of the dry period until et reaches its maxima thereafter although et begins to decrease earet keeps on increasing as young water ages are no longer available and thus older particles mainly contribute to transpiration which results in higher earet values similar observation is seen for scenario 3 but the direction of hysteresis is reverse because of the in phase seasonality between p and et in contrast to scenario 1 in which p and et are out of phase finally since et shows no seasonality in scenario 4 earet s are divided into two distinct groups that shift by each other due to the seasonality of p which dictates when particles of young and old ages are available to plants the hysteretic behavior in the relationship between mttq and storage has been already shown in former studies e g hrachowitz et al 2013 rodriguez et al 2018 however this is the first study that shows hysteresis between the sampling behavior of et travel times and the et rate conditioned on the state of soil wetness fig 10 further shows earet versus the q rate for each scenario separately similar to fig 9 earet is typically lower than 0 1 in the wet periods while it may increases up to 0 51 in the dry periods nevertheless unlike fig 9 earet for the dry periods indicates a clear decreasing relationship with the q rate in all scenarios except scenario 2 in which no dry period exists regardless of the seasonality of p and et with respect to each other indeed as the flow rate decreases over the dry period earet continuously increases since the plants capture older waters due to the less available young waters this observation is in agreement with the findings of previous studies smith et al 2018 sprenger et al 2018 in which the inverse storage effect was reported for the evaporated and transpired waters 4 conclusion and final remarks in this study we explored the dynamics of travel time distribution ttd in streamflow q and evapotranspiration et under different climate conditions with contrasting seasonality and rate in precipitation p and et to this end we employed the integrated hydrologic model parflow clm to simulate water and energy cycle processes in a hypothetical hillslope governed by four climate types with in phase p and et out of phase p and et year round constant p with seasonal et and year round constant et with seasonal p we then used the lagrangian particle tracking model ecoslim to simulate the travel time distribution of q and et under the conditions above the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the seasonality of et imposed the largest and smallest variability in the streamflow fyw when p and et were in phase and out of phase respectively 2 the rate and persistency of p showed a stronger control on the q median travel time mttq than the et rate unless under dry soil conditions in which the removal of older water particles by et led to the increase in the mttq 3 et showed a clear tendency towards removing young ages as long as they were available due to the high degree of soil moisture however older particles from deeper soil layers were taken up by plants during the dry periods and in between the p events with a relatively long inter arrival time 4 the age sampling mechanism of q indicated a dual relationship with the q rate i e the storage state introduced a threshold behavior distinguishing the direct and inverse storage effects however the same mechanism for et always showed a decreasing relationship with the q rate in dry periods 5 the earet versus the rate of et showed hysteresis with inverse directions when a phase shift existed between p and et this work highlights the importance of the seasonality in p and et as well as the phase shift between them on the water travel time dynamics in hillslopes we note that the scope of this study is limited in terms of considering the interactions between climate vegetation and geomorphology indeed studying the role of interactions between these elements on hydrologic partitioning and transport dynamics requires utilization of a process based hydrologic model over a large dataset that cover a wide gradient of climate and landscape physical properties e g troch et al 2013 however the model set up in this study was intentionally designed to understand the sole role of the phase shift between p and et on ttds as such we masked the possible impact imposed by other contributors such as heterogeneity in soil and vegetation by assuming these properties the same in all scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the results to the assumption of heterogeneity in the soil hydraulic properties we modeled another hillslope with the mean hydraulic conductivity of 0 05 m hr and variance of 0 01 imposed by the climate forcing of scenario 2 this model set up was simulated 50 times each representing a different spatial distribution of heterogeneity the percent bias between different statistics of ensemble averaged bttds i e the median 25th percentile and 75th percentile for q and et were less than 10 which is not remarkable and does not violate the generality of the conclusions the applied particle tracking approach proved promising in understanding the mechanisms that govern the interactions between the ttd of et and q the spatial and temporal characterization of residence times by this model also allows for a direct quantification of sas function without the need for defining the shape of this function as a priori furthermore systematic simulations of a hillslope or catchment forced by different climatic vegetation and geomorphological properties help understand the underlying shape of the sas function under a condition of interest this will subsequently aid conceptual hydrologic modelers in limiting the pool of choices for the assumption of the sas function shape for the system under study however further research is needed to improve the tracking scheme of the particles such that the particle removal by evaporation and transpiration can be characterized separately also we acknowledge that our particle tracking model is not currently able to distinguish between different water pools and thus cannot be used to examine the two water worlds hypothesis mcdonnell 2014 indeed we simulated particle removal via et as a stochastic process based on an estimation of the exit probability which is applied to all the active particles in the domain future development in this area will be worthwhile to extend the application of the model to exploring these novel issues finally the computational cost of the particle tracking model can be challenging depending on the size of the domain mesh discretization and the choice of the number of particles that enter the domain per each input pulse we note that the latter parameter which is defined by the user has slight impact on the computed ttds our extra simulations with different number of particles i e 2 4 and 8 particles assigned to the mass of the input pulse under the same other conditions in the studied scenarios revealed that the average bias for different statistics of the representative bttds i e the median 25th percentile and 75th percentile were between 0 10 and 0 44 for q and between 2 1 and 3 3 for et indicating that the results are not significantly sensitive to the number of particles assigned to the mass of input flux nevertheless large domains with very fine mesh discretization even forced by a small value for this parameter can result in long model runs declaration of competing interest none

454,precipitation p plant water use and evaporation from the soil surface control the travel time of streamflow q and evapotranspiration et in a complex way however the impact of soil moisture and energy availability on the travel time distribution ttd of evaporated and transpired waters are yet less understood in this study we investigate how the seasonal variability of p and et in terms of phase shift and rate influences the temporal dynamics of ttds to this end we choose four contrasting climate types described as in phase p and et out of phase p and et year round constant p with seasonal et and year round constant et with seasonal p we use a physically based hydrological model to simulate dominant processes in the water and energy cycles as well as subsurface flow velocity which are subsequently used in a lagrangian particle tracking model to characterize the age distribution of water particles in space and time the results prove that the soil moisture availability than the et rate imposes a stronger control on the ttd of transpired water in all climate scenarios plants indicate an overall tendency towards younger water particles unless in periods with a pronounced dry condition when old waters are more available in the deeper soil layers in particular the climate scenario with out of phase p and et yields the highest percentage of old particles taken up by plants furthermore et age sampling mechanism shows hysteresis against the et rate with an opposite direction in climates with in phase and out of phase p and et our results also suggest that the ratio between the median travel time of q and the median age of water storage has a dual relationship with the q rate indicating the existence of a threshold behavior that distinguishes the direct and inverse storage effects based on the storage volume keywords evapotranspiration seasonality travel time particle tracking exit age ratio hysteresis 1 introduction the exit age or travel time of water leaving a catchment as streamflow q is interrelated with evapotranspiration et travel time and flux ali et al 2014 birkel et al 2012 botter 2012 hrachowitz et al 2013 rinaldo et al 2015 sprenger et al

2015 of the climatic variables and plant characteristics et travel time is directly influenced by the rate and intermittency of evaporation and transpiration fluxes which in turn are mainly dependent on net radiation rainfall interception leaf and stem area indices aerodynamic and stomatal resistances atmospheric stability wind speed specific humidity and temperature the influence of the aforementioned factors on the et flux has been widely explored by former studies mckenney and rosenberg 1993 however the distinct or combined impacts of these components on the travel time of evaporation and transpiration are still less investigated initiated with the analytical expressions introduced by botter et al 2010 2011 and extended by rigon et al 2016 other studies have attempted to explore evaporation or transpiration travel time via isotopic measurements of soil and xylem water e g brinkmann et al 2018 despite advances in developing novel approaches for et partitioning see kool et al 2014 and references therein and its travel time estimation e g smith et al 2018 there are still some major challenges to deal with i e a prerequisite for assuming a mechanism to sample et travel times from precipitation klaus et al 2015 or storage danesh yazdi et al 2016 harman 2015 queloz et al 2015 poorly available high resolution isotopic data for evaporation and root water uptake fluxes birkel and soulsby 2015 stockinger et al 2016 and a need for a comprehensive framework expressing the linkage between xylem and soil water isotopic composition berry et al 2018 rothfuss and javaux 2017 alternatively a few recent studies have employed flux or particle tracking methods to quantify evaporated water travel time from soil soulsby et al 2016 transpired water travel time by plants brinkmann et al 2018 sprenger et al 2016 or both douinot et al 2019 maxwell et al 2019 smith et al 2019 sprenger et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge the literature has been devoted to exploring how vegetation cover soil type spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture and topographical characteristics control the travel time dynamics of evaporation transpiration or et in this study we focus on another important control on et and q travel times that is the seasonality of and the phase shift between precipitation p and et fluxes depending on the type of climate in a region the interplay between energy and water availability translates into complexity on how water particles of different travel times are preferentially discharged by different outflows such as q and et for instance brinkmann et al 2018 showed that the composition of water taken up by trees in a region with temperate climate includes a similar portion of water particles with a wide range of travel times that initiated from p events falling in the growing or previous seasons on the other hand by compiling the available worldwide isotopic data in p q soil and tree water barbeta and peñuelas 2017 concluded that in regions with a pronounced dry season on average 49 and 28 of plant water use is composed of groundwater particles in the dry and wet seasons respectively nevertheless it remains to investigate how the contribution of young and old water to transpired water travel times change in regions with different climates to this end we use the recently developed lagrangian particle tracking model ecoslim maxwell et al 2019 to quantify the flow pathways and transient travel time of particles leaving a hillslope through et and q ecoslim is coupled interactively with the subsurface and land surface models parflow clm danesh yazdi et al 2018 to simulate subsurface flow velocities and energy balance components at the land surface we employ this approach in a hypothetic catchment to study the interaction between et and q travel time dynamics under four different climatic forcings with contrasting seasonality in p and et in particular we aim to explore the following questions 1 how does the seasonal variation of p and et individually and with respect to each other impact the ttd of q and et fluxes under different climate conditions 2 how do the soil moisture availability and et rate control the ttd of evaporated and transpired waters 3 what is the relationship between water storage and the age sampling mechanism of q and et the rest of this paper is organized as follows

section 2 5 for the objectives of this study in section 3 the impact of seasonality in p and et on the shape and temporal dynamics of the q and et ttds are discussed different schemes for the age

presents the concluding remarks of this study 2 methods 2 1 hydrologic model we use the physically based numerical model parflow clm to simulate the hydrologic cycle processes in the subsurface surface and plant canopy using the three dimensional form of the richards equation parflow solves subsurface flow velocity field in the saturated groundwater and unsaturated vadose zones kollet and maxwell 2006 maxwell 2013 that is subsequently used to compute particle transport velocity in the particle tracking model section 2 2 parflow is coupled to the land surface model common land model clm to simulate the processes involving in the surface energy budget such as et and snow dai et al 2003 maxwell and miller 2005 parflow and clm exchange information in a manner that the soil moisture computed by parflow in the root zone is used in clm to compute the momentum sensible heat latent heat and ground heat fluxes among other variables since the conceptual framework and the governing equations of parflow clm have been previously discussed in detail here we only outline how the coupled model computes evaporation and transpiration fluxes which are critical for the objectives of this study see oleson et al 2013 for further details on clm water balance in a hillslope can be written as 1 d s t d t p t q t e t t where s is the water storage volume per unit area l p is the precipitation rate lt 1 q is the rate of flow exiting the hillslope as streamflow lt 1 and et is the evapotranspiration rate lt 1 et in clm is composed of three components i e i evaporation from ground surface ii evaporation from wet canopy leaves and stems and iii plant transpiration ground evaporation eg lt 1 is the sum of evaporation from soil esoil lt 1 snow esnow lt 1 and water covered surfaces e h 2 o lt 1 that is computed using the following equations 2 e g i t e s o i l i t e s n o w i t e h 2 o i t i 1 3 e s o i l i t ρ a ρ w q s o i l i t q s t r a w t r l i t t e r i t i 1 4 e

surface ρ a ml 3 is the intrinsic density of air ρ w ml 3 is the intrinsic density of water qs mm 1 qsoil mm 1 qsnow mm 1 and q h 2 o mm 1 are the specific humidity of canopy soil snow and surface water respectively r aw tl 1 is the aerodynamic resistance to water vapor transfer between the ground and canopy and rlitter tl 1 is a resistance for the plant litter layer all fluxes in eqs 2 to 5 are computed at the top soil layer evaporation from the wet fraction of vegetation eveg lt 1 and the total transpiration e tr tot lt 1 of the dry portion of vegetation are computed by 6 e v e g t l s

saturation specific humidity at the vegetation temperature transpiration in a given soil layer i is computed as a fraction of e tr tot based on the layer s effective root fraction r e i t which is the

soil water potential l when stomata is fully closed and open respectively ψ i is the soil water matric potential of layer i l θ is the ratio of effective porosity to total porosity zi is the depth from the soil surface to the interface of layers i and i 1 l and ra and rb are root distribution parameters zeng 2001 i 1 n r i w i t ranges from near 0 when soil is dry to 1 when soil is wet ri depends on the plant functional type and is a decreasing exponential function of soil depth the accuracy and robustness of the et estimation from this approach has been already demonstrated by former studies on land surface modeling e g oleson et al 2013 and liu et al 2016 as well as validated against field observations e g shi et al 2013 the rate of water height change in a given soil layer i e δw i t lt 1 depends on the infiltration rate inf lt 1 evaporation and transpiration fluxes corresponding to that layer as well as interactions with the adjacent layers for the top soil layer we have 14 δ w i t i n f i t e g i t e t r i t q i i t q o i t i 1 where qi and qo represent inflow from and outflow to adjacent layers respectively and inf is computed by subtracting the overland flow and canopy integration from p for the deeper soil layers i e 1 i n eg and inf do not exist and thus δw reduces to 15 δ w i t e t r i t q i i t q o i t 1 i n in section 2 2 we describe in detail how δw i t is used to add particles into or remove them from the subsurface we also note that the et computed in this study does not include eveg because eveg belongs to the volume of water that is intercepted by and evaporated from the canopy surface hence this portion of water does not reach the ground surface and obviously cannot be traced by the particle tracking module communications between parflow and clm are reflected into many instances in the coupled modeling for instance the specific humidity soil resistance factor infiltration rate and heat flux rate calculated by clm at the soil layers are dependent on the soil degree of saturation that is alternatively calculated by parflow jefferson and maxwell 2015 on the other hand the rate of et flux is used by parflow to update the pressure head and the velocity field which is later used in the particle tracking model to advance the particles along their pathways therefore a more accurate representation of the soil moisture leads to a more realistic transport properties of water particles like their ttds demonstration on the improved accuracy of soil moisture computation in the root zone as the result of coupling between parflow and clm has been already shown by maxwell and miller 2005 2 2 particle tracking model using the lagrangian particle tracking framework employed in the slim model to trace water particles discharging as q bearup et al 2016 danesh yazdi et al 2018 de rooij et al 2013 the recently developed ecoslim model further enables us to trace water particles through their pathways to be evaporated at the soil surface or transpired by plants maxwell et al 2019 in this model i a domain is first set up with an initial condition representing pre stored water particles tagged as groundwater in each domain cell the total mass of particles is determined by the cell water volume computed from parflow the mass is then divided equally to a number of particles that is assigned by the model user ii at every time step a particle leaves the domain as q if its location and velocity direction comply with the constraints imposed by the domain boundary conditions in a three dimensional domain with zero flux boundary conditions at five faces where particles can leave the domain only through the upper top face if a particle resides in the top half portion of the relating top cell near the domain surface as well as its vertical velocity is positive it leaves the domain as q iii at the time steps with positive δw i t computed by parfow clm particles with a total mass equal to the mass equivalent of δw i t 1 i n are added to the top cells along the domain surface the added particles at a given time step are tagged as rainfall or snow depending on the type of p in that time step determined by clm the pre stored particles from step i and the entering new particles from this step possess different masses depending on the saturation degree and the rate of δw i t respectively the three dimensional location of entering particles within each cell is set randomly iv for each cell at the time steps with negative δw i t 1 i n the probability by which a particle may be captured by et is determined by the ratio of δw i t to the available water i t in the particle s residing cell if δ w i t i t r where r is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 the particle is removed from the domain as et we note that given the above mechanism the probability by which the particles are captured by transpiration decreases as the soil depth increases due to the decline in transpiration rate as a result of smaller root fraction v the active particles that did not leave the domain in steps ii and iv are located into their new positions according to the advection and molecular diffusion mechanisms expressed by 16 x p t τ v p x p t t τ z 2 d e τ x p t where xp t l is the location of the particle p at time t τ is the timestep length in which the particle is advected and diffused z is a uniformly distributed random vector with zero mean and unit variance de l2t 1 is the effective molecular diffusivity and vp xp t t lt 1 is the velocity of the particle p at location xp at time t since parflow computes flow velocity at the domain cell faces at each time step a particle s velocity within a cell space is computed by linearly interpolating the velocities at the particle s residing cell faces at that time step see fig 1 in danesh yazdi et al 2018 for further details when the particle moves to another cell velocities at the new cell faces are used to compute the particle s velocity and so on 2 3 ttd computation and analysis ttd can either be computed from the travel time of the particles entering the domain at the same time called forward ttd fttd conditioned on the entrance time or from the travel time of the particles exiting the domain at a given time called backward ttd bttd conditioned on the exit time here we focus on the bttd as it carries information about the history of the transport dynamics influenced by the events took place prior to the time at which the bttd is computed bttds are also directly related to the storage selection sas function and allow for the computation of solute concentration given the time series of solute input benettin et al 2015b at each time step of the particle tracking model run the travel time of those particles satisfying the exit conditions either as q or et are recorded therefore bttds can be computed directly for q or et at any given time step accordingly we can compute the cumulative bttds as 17 p q t t q τ t t q t 18 p et t t et τ t t et t where pq t t and pet t t are the non exceedance probability distribution of travel times t at time t for q and et respectively and q τ t t and et τ t t are the q and et flux with travel times τ equal or smaller than t at time t respectively having a set of bttds over the simulation period we also compute the representative bttd for the last year of the particle tracking simulation as the median distribution of the non exceedance bttds determined by eq 17 and 18 we use the representative bttd to distinguish the impact of climatic condition on the shape of the bttds in the four studied scenarios section 2 5 over the annual scale we also compute and analyze the median travel time mtt as a robust statistical descriptor of the bttd central tendency young water fraction f yw defined as the fraction of particles in q that are younger than a certain travel time kirchner 2016 is also analyzed in particular we compute f yw for water younger than three months to study transport dynamics in a time scale that is comparable to the et travel times and the seasons duration the latter in those scenarios in which the seasonality in p and et are pronounced former studies demonstrated that not only young water contributes to a large portion of steamflow but also represents the rapid transfer of contaminants to the streamflow which highlights its importance in water quality modeling benettin et al 2017 jasechko et al 2016 wilusz et al 2017 another important behavior to study is the dynamic of travel times in outfluxes in relation to the age of stored water in the hillslope to this end we compute the exit age ratio ear defined as 19 e a r q t m t t q t m r t s t 20 e a r e t t m t t e t t m r t s t where mttq t and mttet t are the mtt of water particles exiting the domain via q and et at time t respectively and mrts t is the median residence time mrt of the water particles stored in the domain at the same time t soulsby et al 2016 smaller values of ear indicate a preference for exiting younger water particles and vice versa 2 4 model setup and properties simulations were performed on a synthetic three dimensional rectangular hillslope with a homogeneous land cover and soil physical properties given in table 1 the reasons for the chosen geometrical shape and dimensions were twofold first the hillslope was large enough so that the range of travel times obtained for the particles were close to those that are typically observed in real world catchments second the hillslope was intentionally considered similar to those used in the former studies danesh yazdi et al 2018 maxwell et al 2019 so that the results from different scenarios pursued by each study can be compared independent of the impact of hillslope geometric and geophysical characteristics however the top soil layers in this study were discretized more finely to capture a better representation of the et related quantities such as its flux and travel time vegetation parameters including the leaf and stem area indices aerodynamic roughness length displacement height and leaf dimension were adopted from the igbp classification vegetation parameters see table 1 the domain was constrained by a no flux boundary condition at the bottom and sides hence the particles could leave the domain only across the upper face through q or et at each time step the three dimensional location of all particles after being advected and diffused is checked if the new location of a particle is supposed to fall beyond any no flux boundary the boundary acts as a mirror and reflects the particle back to the domain we intentionally excluded heterogeneity in the vegetation cover and soil properties to ensure that the observed spatiotemporal changes in q and et travel times merely reflect the influence of the phase shift between the four climate scenarios described in section 2 5 for each scenario simulation parflow clm was driven by the relating meteorological forcing until reaching the equilibrium state i e the difference between water storage at two consecutive years becomes less than 1 of total annual p then the parflow clm outputs at the end of the equilibrium state were used as an initial state for the ecoslim simulation similarly ecoslim was run successively until the model spins up by stabilizing the mean age of the particles for each of our scenarios this took five years of simulation finally the model was run for extra 10 years and the results for the last year are reported and discussed here 2 5 climatic scenarios and meteorological data table 2 summarizes the geographical and climatic information of the four types of meteorological forcing we used for scenario simulation these climate types include a hot summer

recorded at the redding municipal airport station from 2012 to 2013 data for scenario 2 came from the waco regional airport station between 2011 and 2012 data for scenario 3 belong to the ambrosio l v taravella international airport station from 2003 to 2004 and data for scenario 4 were obtained from the bondoukou soko airport station from 2003 to 2004 the shortwave radiation and specific humidity were obtained from the merra 2 dataset gelaro et al 2017 and the downward longwave radiation was estimated using temperature time series according to brutsaert 1975 formulation hourly meteorological data were available in scenarios 1 and 2 however single gaps in data were filled by interpolating values from the previous and following hours since six hourly data were available in scenarios 3 and 4 we used the merra 2 product to generate hourly data by interpolation the exception was the p data which were equally divided between hours the vegetation cover in clm for all scenarios was set to grass which is common between the wide gradient of climates considered in this study dixon et al 2014 3 results and discussion section 3 1 discusses how the phase shift between p and et in contrasting climate scenarios controls the shape of bttds in sections 3 2 and 3 3 we then study the effect of p and et seasonality on the changes in f yw and mtt of q and et the mechanism of age sampling by et under different conditions of soil moisture availability is further discussed in section 3 4 finally the threshold behavior in the direct and inverse storage effects as well as the emergence of hysteresis in the exit age ratio of et are presented in sections 3 5 and 3 6 respectively 3 1 the effect of phase shift between p and et on the shape of ttds fig 2 a and b illustrate the representative bttds in the four scenarios for q and et respectively fig 2a shows that in scenario 1 where p and et are completely out of phase particles discharging as q are younger than those in all the other scenarios this is because the entering new particles by precipitation events in the fall and winter are not taken up by plants due to the low rate of et on the contrary the oldest particles as q correspond to scenario 3 where p and et are in phase indeed a high fraction of entering particles during spring and summer are captured by plants in these seasons due to the high rate of et over the same period the older particles as well as the major portion of the remaining young particles keep on traveling within the domain and thus become older in the following seasons when the low rate of et cannot considerably remove particles from the domain therefore older particles exit via q in all seasons in this case in scenario 4 the year round constant et removes a high fraction of entering particles during fall spring and summer however since the length of the dry period in this scenario is shorter than that in scenario 3 the particles as q are younger and therefore their cumulative bttd shows a higher fraction of particles younger than a given travel time finally the year round constant p in scenario 2 causes a cyclic depletion and replenishment of entering young particles in the seasons with high and low et rates respectively which results in the streamflow bttd that falls between scenarios 1 and 3 the above observations therefore suggest that q comprises of the largest fraction of young and old particles when p and et are out of phase and in phase respectively the effect of frequency and intensity of p on the bttd of et particles is clarified in fig 2b in scenario 1 where p and et are out of phase the occurrence of low p if ever exists in the seasons with high et rates makes only old particles from previous seasons available to plants resulting to the oldest bttd for et in comparison to the other scenarios on the other hand the bttd of et consists of the largest fraction of young particles in scenarios 3 and 4 because young water from p is always available to plants during the highest rates of et in these two scenarios the above observations have important implications for the biogeochemical processing of nutrients as well as for the transport of minerals and organic matters in regions with out of phase p and et q is expected to discharge a large fraction of constituents in soil in a shorter period of time which can potentially lead to a faster degradation of water quality in streams this is because the shorter transport times may not be long enough for the bacterial species in the soil ecosystem to perform biogeochemical reactions to the extent that can remarkably reduce the concentration of chemical constituents impairing soil and water in contrast in the regions with synchronized p and et signals the quality of discharged water from soil is expected to be least impaired if all the other factors influencing the nutrient concentration is the same in all scenarios nevertheless it should be noted that bioremediation might also adversely influence the quality of water discharging from soil under certain environmental conditions the product of biogeochemical reactions can be more toxic than the initial chemical compounds e g iron and sulfate reducing bacteria contribute significantly to arsenic mobilization which brings about major health issues jiang et al 2019 vidali 2001 the significance of the contribution of water travel times to improving the mechanistic predications of nutrient cycling in rivers has also been demonstrated by former studies zarnetske et al 2011 showed that different units of a hyporheic zone can act as reduction or production hot spots of nitrogen depending on their respective flow pathway travel time to the draining stream that is nitrification and denitrification taking place at short and longer travel times respectively they also showed that the transition between the two contrasting behaviors i e from production to removal can be determined by a travel time threshold which is a complex function of physical factors such as those controlling the hydraulic transport of nitrogen scholberg et al 2002 also demonstrated a strong correlation between the water residence time in soil and nitrogen update efficiency by citrus 3 2 controls of p and et seasonality on young water fraction fig 3 shows the time series of q and et for each scenario for the last year of parflow clm ecoslim simulation these time series are color coded by the f yw s computed from the respective fluxes while the seasonal variation in q strongly correlates to that of p as expected the effect of et on the magnitude of q is also noticeable in scenarios 1 2 and 3 in which et shows a seasonal variation for instance the q rate in scenario 1 is higher than that in scenario 3 during the wet season due to the out of phase seasonality between et and p where low et rate in the wet period facilitated the exit of a larger mass of particles via q the average q rate during the wet seasons is 3 4 1 7 2 6 and 2 2 mm day for scenarios 1 to 4 respectively in addition although scenario 2 shows the lowest variability in q due to the year round constant p high et rates in the spring and summer seasons has decreased the q rate to some extent f yw is basically pronounced during the wet seasons when not only new particles enter the domain from p but also higher soil moisture further assists the exit of young ages the ratio of the median f yw in q during the dry periods to the wet periods in scenarios 1 and 3 are 0 05 and 0 125 respectively fig 4 shows the boxplot of daily f yw s for each scenario separately the median annual f yw in q is 9 7 5 9 4 1 and 5 1 for scenarios 1 to 4 respectively scenario 1 indicates the highest median f yw in q mainly because higher degree of soil moisture has led to the flashiest discharge that exited a larger number of very young water particles in contrast to scenario 1 the in phase seasonality of p and et in scenario 3 resulted in the lowest median f yw in q since the low degree of soil moisture together with the uptake of younger particles by et left the storage to be consisted of particles older than three months or so the impact of phase shift between p and et is also projected into the variation of f yw in q the 25th and 75th percentile of f yw in q are 0 04 0 17 0 01 0 19 0 005 0 05 and 0 008 0 08 in scenarios 1 to 4 respectively scenario 4 also shows a relatively small median f yw in q due to the low p rates in the fall and winter as well as the existence of a constant et rate during the whole year in scenario 2 nearly constant p throughout the year allowed for a continuous injection of new water particles with age zero leading to a steady contribution of young ages to the storage age distribution as compared to scenarios 3 and 4 also the removal of a remarkable fraction of young waters due to high et rate in the spring and summer has been compensated by the availability of very young particles at all seasons causing the highest range of f yw variability in q however this scenario did not yield the highest median f yw in q as compared to scenario 1 indeed in spite of the persistency of p to keep the soil moisture high throughout the year in scenario 2 the soil moisture in the wet season is less than that in scenario 1 in which p and et are out of phase as a result a smaller fraction of young particles i e younger than three months in our cases exited the domain the above results demonstrate that under the same total precipitation depth the sequence of seasonality between p and et than the rainfall intermittency has a stronger control on the young fraction of q in the annual scale here a few points are worth mentioning first the median f yw in et in scenario 3 is smaller than that in scenario 1 since the higher rate of et has resulted in removing a larger fraction of older particles decreasing the median f yw second f yw in q gives the largest and smallest coefficient of variation for scenarios 3 and 1 respectively i e 0 17 and 0 13 this is because the major portion of f yw s in scenario 1 exited the domain as q without being interrupted by et while high et rates in scenario 3 during the wet period has induced a larger degree of variability in the f yw distribution the variability of f yw has implications for the analysis of ecosystem vulnerability to soluble contaminant loads along with the solute infiltration history f yw variability has been shown to capture the solute concentration dynamics in streamflow e g benettin et al 2017 hence the lower and upper bounds of f yw give insight about the range of soluble contaminant load expected as well as the risk threating the ecosystem see also stockinger et al 2019 3 3 temporal evolution of q and et median travel time fig 5 indicates the temporal variation of the streamflow mtt mttq which is color coded by the q and et rates separately mttq for each day was computed as the median of the travel time of all the particles that left the domain as q on the same day mttq fluctuates significantly throughout the year in all scenarios i e the standard deviation is 0 52 0 54 0 53 and 0 49 year for scenarios 1 to 4 respectively not surprisingly mttq shows sharp decreases when rainfall events occur which augments the infiltration rate and accordingly the particles velocity in the subsurface furthermore mttq increases during the dry periods between rainfall episodes which allow for the exit of older particles from the domain this is particularly apparent in scenarios 1 and 3 during may to september as well as in scenario 4 during november to january when no rainfall event takes place the observations are in agreement with the results of former studies on the connection between mttq and the wetness of a catchment botter et al 2010 wilusz et al 2017 on the other hand mttq does not show a significant trend throughout the wet seasons due to the constantly occurring rainfall events it is noteworthy that either the seasonal variability or intermittency of p imposes a stronger control on the variability of mttq than et seasonality or rate indeed the comparison between scenario 1 and scenario 3 indicates that given a similar p rate and seasonality contrasting et seasonality has slightly influenced the mttq fluctuations in scenario 1 but increased its trend slope during the dry period as compared to scenario 3 the same observation holds for scenario 2 too therefore the results suggest that during wet seasons where young water is available for et et impose a slight influence on the mttq while it increases in dry seasons where plants take up older waters for transpiration fig 6 indicates the temporal evolution of the evapotranspiration mtt mttet for each scenario color coded by the q and et flux rates separately mttet shows much less variability in a year as compared to that of q fig 5 as well as is typically less than one year old the standard deviation of mttet is 0 23 0 09 0 15 and 0 10 year for scenarios 1 to 4 respectively it is also noted that the high rate of et in scenario 1 in the spring and summer as compared to that in scenario 3 has resulted to larger mttet highlighting the availability of old particles to plants in the absence of young ages from the previous seasons we note that this does not only hold for the dry seasons but also in the wet seasons during the periods in which p is less intermittent for instance in scenario 2 the root zone storage time series right axis in fig 6 shows that due to the decrease of soil moisture content between p events plants have taken up older waters in response to high et rates in the summer 3 4 mechanism of age sampling by et fig 7 illustrates the fraction of water particles removed from the domain via et left axis which is color coded to show the distribution of travel times at each day also p time series are shown on the right axis first the ttd of et is much younger than that of q see also figs 5 and 6 e g the annual mtt of et and q in scenario 1 equals to 89 days and 1 94 years respectively second although et rates are high in the dry season of scenario 1 et is also composed of the water particles entering the domain in the same year the same observation is also found in scenarios 2 and 3 in which et rates are high during the wet season in scenario 4 et rates are high throughout the year removing available young water particles in the wet season and capturing older ones in the dry season as such the results point out that plants do have a preference for younger ages as long as they are available regardless of the season to be wet or dry e g scenario 1 however ttd of et particles is not necessarily composed of the most recent injected water particles e g particles less than three months old but includes older ages from previous seasons as in the dry seasons of scenarios 1 and 4 it is thus observed that evaporation from the top soil layer and transpiration from plants tend to remove younger ages as long as they are available to them otherwise they capture older particles from deeper waters the observation that is consistent with the findings of previous studies barbeta and peñuelas 2017 brinkmann et al 2018 smith et al 2018 it is however noted that the water travel time of transpiration is also governed by other factors than soil moisture availability such as soil pore size and plant root distribution sprenger et al 2019 the above observation has also practical implication for the conceptual studies using the sas function approach to model transient ttds indeed since the preference of the et sampling varies in time depending on the age distribution of stored water seasonal or time variant parameterization of the sas function should be employed so that the dynamic nature of soil water mixing is taken into account appropriately 3 5 threshold behavior in the direct and inverse storage effects fig 8 shows earq versus the q rate for each scenario separately all climatic scenarios indicate a similar behavior i e two contrasting relationships exist between earq and q for a given scenario the two trend lines in fig 8 represent these relationships using a moving average window the turning point between the two relationships was found at the value at which a sharp change occurred in the sign of earq i e positive slope turning to negative the coefficient of determination r2 and the p values of the regression lines are also indicated in this figure all the correlations are statistically significant at 5 percent significant level as evidenced by p value 0 05 earq increases with q until a threshold value after which the relationship becomes reverse the increase of earq until the threshold value is indicative of the direct storage effect benettin et al 2015a harman 2015 i e q rates less than a threshold value prefer to discharge older particles from the storage however when q rates exceed the threshold value earq decreases with the q rate this observation witnesses the inverse storage effect i e a larger fraction of younger water particles is discharged via q when storage increases the younger travel time of discharged water under the wet soil moisture condition is indeed an indication of the activation of fast subsurface flow pathways that facilitate quicker transport of young waters through their journey from the soil matrix to the discharge point conversely lower soil moisture condition provides extra capacity in the soil where the particles can move through slowly and thus become older until they ultimately exit the domain the change of q preference in discharging travel times directly influences the temporal variability in the concentration of solutes by measuring stream n no3 concentration in the catchment schafertal in central germany yang et al 2018 showed a significant correlation between the n no3 concentration and mttq during the wet periods nitrate from the fertilizer application in agricultural fields was transported through the faster shallow subsurface pathways which did not give sufficient time to denitrification to diminish the nitrate concentration on the other hand nitrate could penetrate much deeper into the soil layers during the dry period which allowed the denaturation process to considerably attenuate nitrate concentration before discharging into the stream while mttq i e the numerator of earq has a negative correlation with the q rate results not shown here the change of mrt in the storage i e the denominator of earq is indeed the controlling factor of the mechanism by which water particles are preferentially discharged via q finally the threshold value for the q rate in the four scenarios ranges between 2 3 mm day and 3 7 mm day although our scenarios represent a wide range of climate conditions we cannot make a conclusion about the validity of the above threshold values in determining the point where the direct and inverse storage effects segregate further research is thus needed in other geographic locations with different climatic characteristics to explore this issue 3 6 hysteresis in the relationship between et exit age ratio and rate fig 9 shows earet as a function of et rate for each scenario earet s in this plot have been categorized into the wet and dry periods for a given day if the total amount of p within a 30 days period followed by that day is greater than 40 mm the day belongs to the wet period otherwise the day is tagged as the dry period peel et al 2007 in all scenarios earet is generally lower than 0 1 for the events occurring in the wet period highlighting the strong influence of the accessible young water particles on earet in particular the persistent availability of young ages for the sake of the year round occurring p in scenario 2 have resulted in earet s that are almost less than 0 1 over the whole year larger earet s in this scenario in the spring and summer initiates from the extraction of some old particles in this period due to the high rate of et there is no correlation between earet and the et rate during the wet periods in all scenarios nevertheless earet shows a more pronounced variability in the dry periods in scenarios 1 3 and 4 in scenario 1 earet begins with low values at the beginning of the dry period and then increases to a maximum value of 0 51 while reaching the end of the period however a hysteretic relationship holds between earet and the et rate i e two contrasting earet values can exist for the same amount of et the mechanistic explanation of this behavior is that earet increases with et by the advance of the dry period until et reaches its maxima thereafter although et begins to decrease earet keeps on increasing as young water ages are no longer available and thus older particles mainly contribute to transpiration which results in higher earet values similar observation is seen for scenario 3 but the direction of hysteresis is reverse because of the in phase seasonality between p and et in contrast to scenario 1 in which p and et are out of phase finally since et shows no seasonality in scenario 4 earet s are divided into two distinct groups that shift by each other due to the seasonality of p which dictates when particles of young and old ages are available to plants the hysteretic behavior in the relationship between mttq and storage has been already shown in former studies e g hrachowitz et al 2013 rodriguez et al 2018 however this is the first study that shows hysteresis between the sampling behavior of et travel times and the et rate conditioned on the state of soil wetness fig 10 further shows earet versus the q rate for each scenario separately similar to fig 9 earet is typically lower than 0 1 in the wet periods while it may increases up to 0 51 in the dry periods nevertheless unlike fig 9 earet for the dry periods indicates a clear decreasing relationship with the q rate in all scenarios except scenario 2 in which no dry period exists regardless of the seasonality of p and et with respect to each other indeed as the flow rate decreases over the dry period earet continuously increases since the plants capture older waters due to the less available young waters this observation is in agreement with the findings of previous studies smith et al 2018 sprenger et al 2018 in which the inverse storage effect was reported for the evaporated and transpired waters 4 conclusion and final remarks in this study we explored the dynamics of travel time distribution ttd in streamflow q and evapotranspiration et under different climate conditions with contrasting seasonality and rate in precipitation p and et to this end we employed the integrated hydrologic model parflow clm to simulate water and energy cycle processes in a hypothetical hillslope governed by four climate types with in phase p and et out of phase p and et year round constant p with seasonal et and year round constant et with seasonal p we then used the lagrangian particle tracking model ecoslim to simulate the travel time distribution of q and et under the conditions above the main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the seasonality of et imposed the largest and smallest variability in the streamflow fyw when p and et were in phase and out of phase respectively 2 the rate and persistency of p showed a stronger control on the q median travel time mttq than the et rate unless under dry soil conditions in which the removal of older water particles by et led to the increase in the mttq 3 et showed a clear tendency towards removing young ages as long as they were available due to the high degree of soil moisture however older particles from deeper soil layers were taken up by plants during the dry periods and in between the p events with a relatively long inter arrival time 4 the age sampling mechanism of q indicated a dual relationship with the q rate i e the storage state introduced a threshold behavior distinguishing the direct and inverse storage effects however the same mechanism for et always showed a decreasing relationship with the q rate in dry periods 5 the earet versus the rate of et showed hysteresis with inverse directions when a phase shift existed between p and et this work highlights the importance of the seasonality in p and et as well as the phase shift between them on the water travel time dynamics in hillslopes we note that the scope of this study is limited in terms of considering the interactions between climate vegetation and geomorphology indeed studying the role of interactions between these elements on hydrologic partitioning and transport dynamics requires utilization of a process based hydrologic model over a large dataset that cover a wide gradient of climate and landscape physical properties e g troch et al 2013 however the model set up in this study was intentionally designed to understand the sole role of the phase shift between p and et on ttds as such we masked the possible impact imposed by other contributors such as heterogeneity in soil and vegetation by assuming these properties the same in all scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the results to the assumption of heterogeneity in the soil hydraulic properties we modeled another hillslope with the mean hydraulic conductivity of 0 05 m hr and variance of 0 01 imposed by the climate forcing of scenario 2 this model set up was simulated 50 times each representing a different spatial distribution of heterogeneity the percent bias between different statistics of ensemble averaged bttds i e the median 25th percentile and 75th percentile for q and et were less than 10 which is not remarkable and does not violate the generality of the conclusions the applied particle tracking approach proved promising in understanding the mechanisms that govern the interactions between the ttd of et and q the spatial and temporal characterization of residence times by this model also allows for a direct quantification of sas function without the need for defining the shape of this function as a priori furthermore systematic simulations of a hillslope or catchment forced by different climatic vegetation and geomorphological properties help understand the underlying shape of the sas function under a condition of interest this will subsequently aid conceptual hydrologic modelers in limiting the pool of choices for the assumption of the sas function shape for the system under study however further research is needed to improve the tracking scheme of the particles such that the particle removal by evaporation and transpiration can be characterized separately also we acknowledge that our particle tracking model is not currently able to distinguish between different water pools and thus cannot be used to examine the two water worlds hypothesis mcdonnell 2014 indeed we simulated particle removal via et as a stochastic process based on an estimation of the exit probability which is applied to all the active particles in the domain future development in this area will be worthwhile to extend the application of the model to exploring these novel issues finally the computational cost of the particle tracking model can be challenging depending on the size of the domain mesh discretization and the choice of the number of particles that enter the domain per each input pulse we note that the latter parameter which is defined by the user has slight impact on the computed ttds our extra simulations with different number of particles i e 2 4 and 8 particles assigned to the mass of the input pulse under the same other conditions in the studied scenarios revealed that the average bias for different statistics of the representative bttds i e the median 25th percentile and 75th percentile were between 0 10 and 0 44 for q and between 2 1 and 3 3 for et indicating that the results are not significantly sensitive to the number of particles assigned to the mass of input flux nevertheless large domains with very fine mesh discretization even forced by a small value for this parameter can result in long model runs declaration of competing interest none
