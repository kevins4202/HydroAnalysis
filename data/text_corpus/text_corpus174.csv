870,dynamic capillary pressure dcp effects which is vital for predicting multiphase flow behavior in porous media refers to the injection rate dependence capillary pressure observed during non equilibrium displacement experiments however a clear picture of the effects of microscale fractures on dcp remains elusive this study quantified the effects of microscale fractures on dcp and simulated pore scale force and saturation change in fractured porous media using the multiphase lattice boltzmann method lbm eighteen simulation cases were carried out to calculate dcp as a function of wetting phase saturation the effects of viscosity ratio and fracture orientation aperture and length on dcp and dcp coefficient τ were investigated where τ refers to the ratio of the difference of dcp and static capillary pressure scp over the rate of wetting phase saturation change versus time significant differences in τ values were observed between unfractured and fractured porous media the τ values of fractured porous media were 1 1 104 pa ms to 5 68 105 pa ms which were one or two orders of magnitude lower than those of unfractured porous media with a value of 4 106 pa ms a horizontal fracture had greater effects on dcp and τ than a vertical fracture given the same fracture aperture and length this study suggested that a microscale fracture might result in large magnitude changes in dcp for two phase flow keywords fracture porous media dynamic capillary pressure multiphase flow lattice boltzmann method 1 introduction understanding and predicting multiphase flow behavior in fractured porous media is a challenging subject in a number of disciplines and applications such as co2 storage in brine aquifers berg and ott 2012 hall et al 2016 juanes et al 2006 kim and santamarina 2016 pruess and garcia 2002 qi et al 2009 oil recovery in fractured reservoirs tang et al 2017 and water flow back in shale gas development cao et al 2017 recently several field and laboratory experiments and numerical analysis have been conducted to investigate the nonlinear transient and spatial characteristics of multiphase flow in fractured porous media tang et al 2017 faybishenko 2017 fractures not only dramatically change the permeability of the porous media but also change the effective average static capillary pressure in addition fractures usually show unique multiscale characteristics whose main dimensions could span several orders of magnitude in space with numerous microscale fractures and large faults zhang et al 2017c since it is impractical to represent every microscale fracture in a numerical model due to the enormous computational cost associated with a complete discretization of these fractures jerbi et al 2017 matrix and microscale fractures are usually divided into small homogenized continuum blocks in field scale simulations tang et al 2017 such as equivalent continuum models wu 1999 tang et al 2017 dual domain or dual porosity continuum models jerbi et al 2017 lichtner 2000 and their various extensions pruess and garcia 2002 in these models the mass balance and darcy s law are assumed to be valid for each block tang et al 2017 landry et al 2011 for two phase flow which is the primary concern of this study the governing equation can be written as dahle et al 2005 yu et al 2015 tang et al 2017 sussman et al 1998 1 ϕ t s α k s k r a μ α p α where μα is the viscosity of phase α which can be a wetting phase w or a non wetting phase n φ is the porosity k s is the absolute permeability kra is the relative permeability for phase α s α is the saturation of phase α bounded by a constraint of sn sw 1 p α is the pressure of phase α t is time and is the differential operator in space the constitutive equation among pn pw and sw is the capillary pressure equation 2 p n p w p c d y n s w where p c d y n s w is usually called the dynamic capillary pressure dcp hou et al 2012 or non equilibrium fluid pressure difference bottero et al 2011 which is dependent on actual flow dynamics the subscript c means capillary pressure hereinafter and the superscript dyn means dynamic hereinafter different from dcp another widely used capillary pressure called the static capillary pressure scp or equilibrium fluid pressure difference p c s t a which is often measured under a static or quasi static state in laboratory experiments bottero et al 2011 abidoye and das 2014 das et al 2005 is frequently used as a substitute of p c d y n s w in field scale simulations tang et al 2017 yu et al 2015 it is notable that the terms of non equilibrium and dynamic have been used exchangeable in many previous studies and the terms of equilibrium and static have also been used exchangeable by various investigators hassanizadeh et al 2005 and bottero et al 2011 gave a detailed discussion about the terms of non equilibrium and dynamic and the terms of equilibrium and static in respect to the capillary pressure in this study the non equilibrium state refers to a flow field that is still dynamically change with time whereas the equilibrium state refers to a flow field that is not change with time anymore however many studies abidoye and das 2014 das and mirzaei 2012 niasar et al 2010 goel et al 2016 have observed unique features of dcp that has not been seen in scp during non equilibrium two phase flow in porous media suggesting that the conventional scp concept may not accurately describe two phase flow behavior under non equilibrium flow conditions several quantitative equations have been proposed to describe dcp considering the change in saturation rate based on experimental results bottero et al 2011 abidoye and das 2014 goel et al 2016 a common practice of those studies was to relate dcp and scp with a constant coefficient and a widely used equation was proposed by hassanizadeh et al 2005 3 p c d p c d y n p c s t a τ s w t where p c d denotes the difference of dcp and scp τ is called the dcp coefficient hereinafter and sw is the wetting phase saturation in a two phase flow problem the value of τ is crucial for studying two phase flow in porous media bottero et al 2011 dahle et al 2005 hassanizadeh et al 2005 however up to date only a number of values of τ have been published from experimental and modeling studies using unfractured porous media hou et al 2012 bottero et al 2011 hassanizadeh et al 2005 abidoye and das 2014 das and mirzaei 2012 goel et al 2016 a comprehensive investigation of dcp in fractured porous media remain elusive the objective of this study is to fill this knowledge gap specifically we will investigate the effects of fracture characteristics such as fracture orientation aperture and length on dcp and τ and will report innovative methods to determine the τ value in addition we will investigate the effects of viscosity ratio on dcp and τ a realistic porous media model is developed based on x ray micro tomography ct image data of a sandstone sample which is obtained from a borehole drilled to the depth of 1900 m from well long 26 in fuyu formation songliao basin northeast of china the effects of injection rates and fluid mobility ratio which is defined as the ratio of the viscosities of wetting phase and non wetting phase are studied a simplified artificial microscale fracture is added into the porous model to analyze the influence of fracture on two phase flow in particularly to investigate dcp and its associated τ values the lattice boltzmann method lbm is used to simulate two phase flow in the porous model in this study 2 methods many numerical methods have been proposed to simulate multiphase flow in porous media cahn and hilliard 1958 badalassi et al 2003 hirt and nichols 1981 pilliod and puckett 2004 osher and sethian 1988 sussman et al 1998 sukop and thorne 2006 bao and schaefer 2013 tang et al 2015 chen and doolen 1998 among these methods lbm has been proven to be an efficient and effective simulation method for a variety of problems liu et al 2012 gunstensen et al 1991 shan and chen 1993 swift et al 1995 he et al 2000 nourgaliev et al 2003 bao and schaefer 2013 sukop and thorne 2006 succi et al 2014 cahn and hilliard 1958 eshraghi et al 2012 reported that the lbm model could be used on simulation of dendritic solidification with 36 billion grid points and the parallel efficient is almost 100 by using central processing unit cpu cores of 1000 4068 li et al 2016 reported that the three dimensional multi phase lbm simulation cases with a model size of 512 256 256 could achieve a parallel efficiency of about 60 with 400k cpu cores using a hybrid and heterogeneous multiple data programming model up to present there are at least three main three dimensional lbms suga et al 2015 namely the d3q15 model the d3q19 model and the d3q27 model after a careful check of these three lbms we select the d3q27 model fig 1 to simulate two phase flow in the ct image based digital rock model in this study with a specific focus on analyzing the effects of a horizontal or vertical fracture on dcp and τ such a choice is based on two considerations firstly kang and hassan 2013 found that the d3q19 model violated galilean invariance while the d3q27 model did not secondly kuwata and suga 2015 and suga et al 2015 reported that both the d3q19 model and the d3q15 model produced false forces reynolds stresses in particular directions while such an issue was negligible in the d3q27 model therefore the d3q27 model is a proper choice for the type of problem investigated here fig 1 shows the lattice cell of the d3q27 model in which the number notes are the discrete speed vectors there are 27 discrete speed vectors in total the 0th discrete speed vector is placed at the center of the cell with a discrete velocity value of zero and the other discrete speed vectors are pointed from the center of the cell to the center points of faces 1 6 with a discrete velocity value of one the middle points of edges 7 18 with a discrete velocity value of 2 and the corners 19 26 with a discrete velocity value of 3 all in dimensionless forms liu et al 2016 suga et al 2015 in the d3q27 model the distribution function satisfies the following lattice boltzmann equation sukop and thorne 2006 bao and schaefer 2013 tang et al 2015 4 f k α x e k δ t t δ t f k α x t δ t f k α x t f k α e q x t λ

is the time step eq in the superscript of f k α x t represents the equilibrium state hereinafter α in the superscript or subscript means the phase α hereinafter λ is the relaxation time which expresses the fact that molecular collisions tend to relax the distribution function toward the equilibrium state bhatnagar et al 1954 and its determination will be provided later in this section eq 4 is derived from the bgk equation chen et al 1991 sukop and thorne 2006 bao and schaefer 2013 chen and doolen 1998 5 f k α t e k f k α f k α e q x t f k α x t λ α the fluid viscosity μα is recovered as 6 μ α c s 2 λ α δ t 2 where c s 1 3 is the sound speed in lattice units the microscopic equilibrium distribution function f k α e q x t at direction of e k can be written as sukop and thorne 2006 succi et al 2014 7 f k α e q x t w k ρ α 1 e k u α x t c s 2 e k u α x t 2 c s 2 u α x t 2 2 c s 2 where wk are weight factors is the sign of magnitude value of a vector ρα is the fluid density which could be obtained from 8 ρ α k f k α and the macroscopic fluid velocity u α x t is given by sukop and thorne 2006 succi et al 2014 9 u α 1 ρ α k f k α e k it is notable that the microscopic equilibrium distribution function in eq 7 is determined using the macroscopic fluid properties of eqs 8 and 9 sukop and thorne 2006 succi et al 2014 using macroscopic properties to determine the microscopic equilibrium distribution function has commonly done in many previous lbm studies mohamad 2011 succi et al 2014 suga et al 2015 liu et al 2016 table 1 lists the weight factors wk the discrete speed vectors e k and sound speed used in the d3q27 model based on the d3q27 model we employ the shan chen pseudo potential concept in the present work due to its simplicity and flexibility shan and chen 1993 huang et al 2007 the basic idea of this concept is to use a pseudo potential that depends on the local density and interaction strength to represent the pairwise microscopic molecular interactions at the macroscopic scale huang et al 2007 once the interaction strength is properly chosen the phases will spontaneously segregate chen and doolen 1998 huang et al 2007 this concept represents the microscopic physics closely and is flexible in dealing with the surface tension force tang et al 2015 tang et al 2017 because of its remarkable simplicity flexibility and clear representation of the underlying microscopic physics of phase segregation the pseudo potential concept has been successfully used in a broad range of studies about multiphase flow shan and chen 1993 landry et al 2014 huang et al 2007 especially for multiphase flow in porous media landry et al 2014 landry et al 2011 tang et al 2015 according to this model the total force acting on the particles of fluid phase α denoted as f f f α can be written as succi et al 2014 10 f f f α ψ α x t α 1 s k 0 b g α α w k ψ α x e k δ t t e k where ψα x t is the pseudo potential g α α is the interaction strength between phases α and α s is the number of phases and b is 26 for the two phase flow of this study based on the interaction force there are several implementations of lbm for multiphase flow our implementation is achieved through a common velocity of u x t defined as u x t α 1 s k 1 b f k α e k λ α α 1 s k 1 b f k α λ α huang et al 2007 succi et al 2014 the transient velocity of each phase u α x t modified by the interaction force f f f α can be written as huang et al 2007 11 u α x t u x t λ α f f f α ρ α x t since we are only considering two phase flow in this study g α α is a constant g in all simulation cases additional fluid phases can be implemented by changing g α α into an interaction strength matrix contact angle is also controlled by interaction forces between the solid and fluid phases which can be easily implemented by replacing ψ α x e k δ t t in eq 10 with a solid potential π x e k δ t t and replacing g α α in eq 10 with the interaction strength between solid and fluid g a α π bao and schaefer 2013 tang et al 2015 where α and π in the superscript represent the fluid phase and solid phase respectively and a in the subscript is an abbreviation of adhesive force between the fluid and solid phases the solid surface force between fluid phase α and solid wall π could be calculated as 12 f f w α ρ α x t k 1 b g a α π w k π x e k δ t t e k where g a α π is the interaction strength between solid wall π and fluid phase α π x e k δ t t is equal to 1 for solid wall and 0 for fluid the total interaction force acting on the fluid node is f α f f f α f f w α the dimension analog is applied in all sixteen simulation cases of this study to convert the simulation data from lattice units into physical units for velocity kinematic viscosity relaxation time and surface tension coefficient the following equations are satisfied frish et al 1987 gunstensen et al 1991 shan and chen 1993 liu et al 2016 13 δ t p u l b u p δ x p 14 μ l b μ p u l b u p 1 δ x p μ p δ

and physical space respectively σ lb is the surface tension coefficient in lattice units and is determined by the interaction strength g the space step δxp is determined by the resolution of a porous model and ulb and up are the characteristic velocities in lattice space and physical space respectively the time step δtp is determined by eq 13 the relaxation time λ lb is determined by eq 15 based on viscosity μ p ρ p in eq 16 is a reference density 1000 kg m3 in this study the space step δxlb and time step δtlb in the lattice units are all kept as unity similar to what has been done in many previous lbm based multiphase flow studies hao and cheng 2010 frish et al 1987 liu et al 2012 bao and schaefer 2013 another important subject related to capillary pressure is upscaling to the best of our knowledge there are at least three main types of upscaling methods for capillary pressure fig 2 including boundary averaging type p c d i f miri et al 2014 volume averaging type p c a v e dahle et al 2005 and energy conservation law based type p c e n e raeini et al 2014a b fig 2 is a schematic diagram to interpret the differences among these three capillary pressure upscaling methods in general during a displacement experiment p c d i f p c a v e p c e n e the boundary averaging type p c d i f is widely used in experiment based capillary pressure studies since it is convenient to measure the average pressure pin at the inlet and the average pressure pout at the outlet in laboratory thus p c d i f can be easily calculated by p c d i f p i n p o u t the volume averaging type p c a v e is more popular in analytical and numerical studies because the pressure at every point can be determined precisely however p c d i f and p c a v e are usually larger than the physically based capillary pressure p c e n e during a displacement experiment since d p n v i s and d p w v i s fig 2 are also used to calculate the pressure difference of p c d i f and p c a v e the energy conservation law based type p c e n e is also calculated based on numerical simulations applying the energy conservation law to porous media raeini et al 2014a b one can obtain the following balance equation for energy rate 17 p c d y n q d w p d w vis d t where q is discharge at the inlet p c d y n q is the energy rate of capillary pressure dwp is the energy rate of p c d i f d w v i s d t α n w d w α v i s d t is the total energy rate of viscous force in wetting phase and non wetting phase d w α v i s d t is the energy rate of viscous force in phase α which is calculated by 18 d w α v i s d t i j k μ α i j k u x α i j k 2 u x α i j k x 2 2 u x α i j k y 2 2 u x α i j k z 2 2 u x α i j k x x 2 u y α i j k x y 2 u z α i j k x z u y α i j k 2 u y α i j k x 2 2 u y α i j k y 2 2 u y α i j k

α i j k u y α i j k u z α i j k are the simulated x y and z components of velocities of phase α at grid cell i j k p α i j k and δ v α i j k are respectively the pressure and volume of grid cell i j k with phase α μ α i j k is the viscosity of phase α at grid cell i j k and is treated as a constant in this study 3 data preparation fig 3 a shows the realistic digital porous model developed based on ct image data from zeiss xradia ct scanning with a voxel resolution of 0 1 μm the total size of the digital porous model is 1700 800 400 and the porosity is 22 4 the mean pore radius is 1 6 μm and the permeability is 3 7 10 12 m2 to investigate the effects of fracture on dcp and its associated dcp coefficient of τ an idealized single fracture consisting of two parallel planes is added into above porous models with different orientations apertures and lengths as shown in fig 3 and table 2 the grid cells in original porous media fig 3 a are divided into two types as done in the work of sukop and thorne 2006 one type of grid cell is called solid grid cell which represent the solid the left grid cells are called fluid grid cells which represent the space where the fluids could flow through in our simulations the type of each grid cell is represented by a boolean number b the solid grid cells are marked as b 1 and the fluid grid cells are marked as b 0 to ensuring the connecting of the adjacent pore space and fracture space we implement the idealized single fracture by assigning all the grid cell type number b to 0 between the two parallel fracture planes meaning that the space between the two fracture planes can only be occupied by fluids not by solids see fig 3 to investigate the effects of fracture length on dcp we built two models shown in fig 3 e and f with different fracture lengths of 150 μm and 80 μm respectively we also built a model shown in fig 3 g with the same fracture length and aperture as the model in fig 3 c one additional porous model with a much larger porosity of 34 is also built using an eroding process carried out using the imerode function in matlab with an eroding radius of 3 for the two phase displacement simulations using above eight porous models the densities of displacing and displaced fluids are set as unity because the gravitational force is usually negligible compared to the capillary and viscous forces in our case however it must be noted that gravitational forces can be very significant for chlorinated solvents the contact angle is set to be 140 the same as the contact angle used in the conventional mercury injection capillary pressure experiments zhang et al 2017a which is a standard method to measure scp ultra low flux rates are used in the simulation cases and the max mach number is around ma 0 0029 which is suitable for studying incompressible transient flow problems based on lbm according to the work of hazi 2003 and reider and sterling 1995 to minimize the boundary effects one inlet zone of 400 layers and one outlet zone of 30 layers are added to the model fig 3 we use more layers in the inlet zone than the outlet zone to implement the constant injection velocity boundary before the non wetting phase reaching the porous zone for obtaining the high resolution simulation results the number of elements for the porous model is as large as 2130 800 400 the ada high performance computer cluster at the texas a m university tamu at college station campus of usa is used to simulate these models each simulation case requires approximately 3000 cpus for about 10 5 days 4 results and discussions eighteen simulation cases associated with above eight porous models tables 2 and 3 are considered to investigate the effects of a horizontal or vertical fracture on dcp and dcp coefficient τ in each simulation case the porous media is first saturated with a wetting phase and then a non wetting phase is injected from the inlet side to displace the wetting phase the contact angle is set as 140 for all simulation cases to eliminate the influence of wettability the value of g which is the interaction strength for two phase flow is set as 2 0 to implement surface tension coefficient σ simu 25mn m according standard processes used in lbm simulations shan and chen 1993 huang et al 2007 two injection fluxes 1 mm s and 1 5 mm s are applied at the inlet boundaries to observe flow rate dependent effects on dcp continuous boundary condition is applied to the outlet boundaries non slip wall boundaries are applied to other boundaries the space step and time step are respectively δxp 1 10 7 m δtp 1 10 9 s and the characteristic velocities are ulb 1 10 5 and up 1 10 3 these eighteen cases are classified into seven groups a b c d e f and g a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 and a6 are in group a with no fracture b1 and b2 are in group b with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 2 μm and a fracture length of 170 μm c1 and c2 are in group c with one vertical fracture with an aperture of 2 μm and a fracture length of 80 μm d1 and d2 are in group d with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 4 μm and a fracture length of 170 μm e1 and e2 are in group e with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 1 μm and a fracture length of 80 μm f1 and f2 are in group f with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 1 μm and a fracture length of 150 μm g1 and g2 are in group g with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 2 μm and a fracture length of 80 μm a1 a2 a5 and a6 in group a are designated as the reference cases to calculate the dcp coefficient τ and to investigate the effects of a fracture in groups b f porous models in cases a5 and a6 are generated from the porous models in fig 3 a a3 and a4 in group a are designated to investigate the effect of viscosity ratio on capillary pressure groups b c and g are designated to investigate the effects of fracture orientation on dcp groups e and f are designated to investigate the fracture length on dcp groups b d e and f are designated to investigate the effects of fracture aperture on dcp 4 1 dcp of unfractured porous media fig 4 shows the simulated phase evolution of a1 and a2 table 2 at different injection rates there are three main features in these snapshots first convex non wetting phase fronts form at the beginning fig 4 a1 and b1 next at the dynamical state the non wetting phase does not have enough time to flow through all the flow paths fig 4 a2 and b2 and the channeling of the non wetting phase is evident fig 4 also shows that the channeling pattern becomes more obvious when the injection flux is higher since more pore space filled with the wetting phase is left behind for the high injection flux case the flow pattern in fig 4 can be partially interpreted by capillary number ca uμ w φσcos θ friedman 1999 where u is the inlet velocity μ w is the wetting phase viscosity φ is the porosity σ is the surface tension coefficient θ is the contact angle and viscosity ratio of the non wetting and wetting phases m μ nw μ w lenormand et al 1988 where μ nw is the viscosity of the non wetting phase since μ nw μ w φ σ m are the same in cases a1 and a2 so the flow pattern is determined by ca which is controlled by the injecting flux and the value of ca is larger for case a2 than for case a1 fig 5 a shows the evolution of dcp and saturation of a1 a2 a3 and a4 where dcp increases almost linearly before reaching a peak value and then decreases slowly to an asymptote similar results are obtained in the experiments of bottero et al 2011 and numerical simulations of hao and cheng 2010 fig 5 b shows that the saturation of the non wetting phase first increases rapidly and then slows down to approach an asymptote fig 6 a shows dcp versus saturation of the wetting phase of a1 a2 a3 and a4 there are three main features in this figure as well firstly a higher injection flux will lead to a higher dcp dcp of a2 is higher than that of a1 which agrees with eq 3 secondly the viscosity ratio has notable influence on dcp curves dcp of a3 is higher than that of a1 thirdly dcp curves show non monotonic trends at lower saturation of the wetting phase which is sometimes called overshoot in dcp experiments by some previous investigators hassanizadeh et al 2005 as eq 3 indicates that scp is needed to calculate the dcp coefficient τ simulations with ultra low flux rates are needed to get scp however simulations with ultra low flux rates will require much more computational resources so a standard constant rate mercury injection experiment crmi is carried out with automated system for pore examination 730 with the same sample used in ct scanning the injecting rate is set at an ultra low state of 0 0001cc min the crmi results are plotted in fig 6 a the curve is converted using a multiplier factor of σ simu cos θ simu σ hg cos θ hg where θ simu and σ simu are the contact angle and interfacial tension used in simulation cases respectively and their values are θ simu 140 and σ simu 25 mn m while θ hg and σ hg are the corresponding values of θ simu and σ simu used in the experiment and their values are θ hg 140 and σ hg 485 mn m according to eq 3 to calculate the dcp coefficient τ three terms are needed dcp scp and the rate of change of saturation to facilitate the calculation dcp and scp at specific saturation are firstly calculated by a linear interpolation between two adjacent data points then values of the rate of change of saturation are calculated using a central difference scheme based on the data of fig 5 b next at a given saturation the dcp difference p c d y n p c s t a and sw t are given in pairs and plotted in fig 6 b for the range of 0 45 sw 0 75 the saturation range of wetting phase used in this study is close the saturation range of wetting phase 0 5 sw 0 85 used in previous study bottero et al 2011 according to previous studies hassanizadeh et al 2005 bottero et al 2011 one could assume that the dcp difference is zero when s w t 0 which provides an additional data point of s w t 0 p c d 0 in fig 6 b all these data are used to fit a regression line of p c d s w t in fig 6 b and the slope of the fitting line is the estimated value of τ in previous experimental works of hassanizadeh et al 2005 bottero et al 2011 and hou et al 2012 all data under different injection fluxes are used to fit the dcp coefficient τ in this study we calculate the dcp coefficient τ for each simulation case based on fig 6 a based on a regression procedure using the least squares fitting method bottero et al 2011 see table 4 the slope of the fitting line of cases a1 a2 in fig 6 b is 4 07 106 pa ms table 4 gives the dcp coefficients τ coefficient of determination r 2 and 95 confidence bounds of the fitting lines in fig 6 b fig 6 b also shows that the viscosity ratio has notable influence on dcp coefficient τ which is 6 64 106 pa ms for case a3 a4 with viscosity ratio of 1 5 this indicates that increasing viscosity ratio may lead to increasing dynamic capillary pressure coefficient such a phenomenon is also observed in the work of goel and o carroll 2011 we find that the ratio of τ between a1 a2 and a3 a4 is 1 63 which is close to ratio of the non wetting phase viscosities between a1 a2 and a3 a4 which is 1 5 see table 2 in the work of niasar et al 2010 a similar conclusion is also drawn at the wetting phase saturation range of about 0 5 sw 0 85 4 2 effects of a horizontal or vertical fracture on two phase flow fig 7 shows the results of evolution of phase spatial distribution with time for cases a1 a5 b1 c1 d1 e1 f1 and g1 it is found that a fracture has a significant influence on two phase flow in porous media which is controlled by fracture orientation aperture and length the non wetting fluid phase moves forward much faster in the fracture than in the adjacent porous matrix in b1 and d1 indicating the high conductivity of these horizontal fractures despite the fact that the fracture orientations in b1 and d1 are the same horizontal the saturation distributions of the non wetting fluid in these two cases are clearly different specifically a greater fracture aperture leads to a smaller saturation of the non wetting phase in the adjacent porous matrix quantitative analysis of such phenomenon is important for studying oil accumulation paths in fractured reservoirs or block faulted reservoirs lyu et al 2017 since the crude oil in these systems needs to be extracted from water in the fractures and porous media during the accumulation process the special parameter settings in our simulations indicate that when the fracture aperture is larger than 4 μm d1 none of the non wetting phases will flow into the adjacent porous matrix owing to the much lower capillary pressure of fracture compared to those of the adjacent porous matrix when the aperture of fracture is less than 2 μm b1 e1 f1 the non wetting fluid may partially saturate the adjacent porous matrix since decreasing the fracture aperture also decreases the difference in permeability and capillary pressure between the fracture and the adjacent porous matrix wang 2017 zhang et al 2016 fig 7 also indicates that fracture orientation is a crucial parameter in analyzing the flow paths in fractured porous media compared to a horizontal fracture g1 a vertical fracture has less influence on flow during drainage c1 provided that their apertures and lengths are the same as their counterparts in a horizontal fracture see tables 2 and 3 however a non equilibrium delayed effect on two phase flow can be observed for a vertical fracture by comparing the simulation results of c1 and a1 at 60 ms the spatial distribution of the non wetting phase shows no difference before reaching the vertical fracture but the non wetting phase displacement of the wetting phase becomes slower on the right of the vertical fracture in c1 as compared with a1 at 60 ms this is because the non wetting phase will preferentially fill the vertical fracture first furthermore fig 7 shows that the fracture length is another controlling factor of the flow pattern during the non wetting phase displacement of the wetting phase in fractured porous media as the longer fracture b1 shows more influence on the flow pattern than the shorter fracture g1 when the fracture apertures are the same fig 8 a and b show the effects of microfractures on the dcp curves it is observed that dcps of the fractured porous media b1 b2 c1 c2 d1 d2 e1 e2 f1 f2 and g1 g2 are lower than that of the original unfractured porous medium a1 and a2 at the same injection flux and a smaller fracture aperture will result in a higher dcp a1 a2 b1 b2 and d1 d2 at the same injection flux a shorter fracture length will lead to a higher dcp as well a1 a2 b1 b2 and g1 g2 a1 a2 e1 e2 and f1 f2 at the same injection flux fig 8 c and d show the corresponding effects of microfractures on the saturation of the non wetting phase the residual saturation values of the wetting phase in the fractured porous media b1 b2 c1 c2 d1 d2 e1 e2 f1 f2 g1 and g2 are higher than those in the unfractured porous media a1 a2 at the same injection flux figs 7 9 also show that porosity has crucial influences on dcp and saturation evolution however the relationship between porosity and dcp is very complex this is primarily due to two reasons firstly dcp is not only controlled by fracture aperture and fracture length but also controlled by fracture orientation c1 and g1 which has no notable influence on porosity secondly cases a1 a5 b1 and d1 show that the way the porosity is increased will also influence the effects of porosity on dcp for instance although the increased porosity is higher in a5 comparing with d1 d1 actually has more influence on dcp than a5 the issue of porosity dcp relationship deserves further investigation in the future nevertheless the change of dcp in d1 follows a trend similar to those in a1 b1 c1 e1 f1 and g1 the dcp in d1 decreases to an asymptote of about 1 104 pa which is very close the theoretical value of scp in a fracture which is σ simu cos θ simu rf where rf is the value of half of the fracture aperture zheng et al 2017 this finding also agrees with the discussion on the spatial distribution of the non wetting phase in fig 7 which indicates that flow exchange between the fracture and the adjacent porous matrix ceases for a fracture with an aperture higher than 4 μm fig 8 a also shows that the vertical fracture has a transient delayed effect on dcp comparing with a1 one can see that before reaching the peak value dcp of c1 goes through a delayed period marked as 2 in fig 8 a at approximately 50 ms hence dcp of c1 first increases almost linearly marked as 1 in fig 8 a and then slows down at a delayed period marked as 2 after the delayed period dcp of c1 increases again to the peak value marked as 3 which is followed by a rapidly decreasing period marked as 4 in contrast dcp of a1 increases almost linearly marked as 1 to a peak value higher than that in b1 in the delayed period and dcp of a1 decreases slowly after reaching the peak value marked as 2 and 3 comparing the snapshots of c1 in fig 7 with dcp of c1 in fig 8 a it is found that the non wetting phase also invades the vertical fracture around the delayed period of 50 60 ms c2 also goes through a similar delayed period as c1 at about 40 ms fig 8 b when the non wetting phase invades the vertical fracture at 40 ms see fig 9 therefore one may conclude that the delayed effect in fig 8 a is dominated by the vertical fracture fig 9 shows that the evolution rate of the spatial distribution of the non wetting phase with an injection flux of 1 5 mm s is much faster than that with an injection flux of 1 mm s the dcp curves are also higher for the cases with higher saturation rate changes of the non wetting phase see fig 8 b this agrees with eq 3 which is also validated in dcp experiments reported in a number of studies bottero et al 2011 previous numerical analysis and experiments mostly used constant pressure conditions das and mirzaei 2012 hou et al 2012 bottero et al 2011 while the simulations of this study show that such a phenomenon is also observed under constant flux conditions 4 3 effects of a horizontal or vertical fracture on the dcp coefficient τ fig 10 shows that the fracture has a significant influence on the dcp versus saturation curves for the non wetting phase the absolute value of dcp not only varies greatly with changes in the characteristics of fracture but the maximum saturation is also dominated by the fracture fig 10 also shows a non monotonic trend of dcp with increasing non wetting phase saturation which is different from the monotonic trend observed in static zhang et al 2017b tang et al 2017 or quasi static capillary pressure experiments wang and alvarado 2017 such a non monotonic trend or overshoot has also been observed in high pressure non equilibrium displacement experiments before hassanizadeh et al 2005 although overshoot has been observed in experimental investigations before bottero et al 2011 hassanizadeh et al 2005 the essential mechanism is still not fully understood to the best of our knowledge from the simulation results we find that with a higher injection rate a portion of the non wetting phase will enter nearby smaller pore spaces rather than the farther larger pore spaces at early stage such as shown in the snapshots in fig 7 this in turn could cause dcp to be higher than scp at early stage as time processes the whole system will eventually reestablish its equilibrium state and the non wetting phase will reenter the larger pore spaces as a result dcp declines with time it should be noted that above explanation is based on the observation of the non wetting phase in our simulation results not from a rigorous theoretical perspective according to eq 3 a straightforward way to calculate the dcp coefficient τ is to use one dcp curve one scp curve and the change rate of saturation the imbedded microfracture will change the scp curve however comparing with dcp measuring or simulating scp is often time consuming bottero et al 2011 hassanizadeh et al 2005 here we propose an alternative way to calculate the dcp coefficient τ based on two dcp curves p c d y n 1 p c d y n 2 generated from the same porous model with different injection conditions listed in tables 2 and 3 and two corresponding saturation rate change curves s w 1 t and s w 2 t the procedure is briefly explained as follows firstly curves p c d y n 1 p c d y n 2 s w 1 t and s w 2 t at the same saturation position are calculated by a linear interpolation between two data points bottero et al 2011 then one can obtain the following equations 19 p c d y n 1 s w p c s t a s w τ s w 1 t s w 20 p c d y n 2 s w p c s t a s w τ s w 2 t s w by subtracting eq 19 from eq 20 one can eliminate the scp term p c s t a s w and gets 21 p c d y n 2 s w p c d y n 1 s w τ s w 2 t s w s w 1 t s w according to eq 21 the dcp coefficient τ could be calculated at specific saturation of the wetting phase the resulting dcp coefficient τ values are plotted versus the wetting phase saturation in fig 11 for very high viscosity ratios of m 200 and m 1000 goel and o carroll 2011 and goel et al 2016 found that the dcp coefficient τ will increase with the decrease of the wetting phase saturation our simulation results also show an increase trend of the dcp coefficient τ when the wetting phase saturation drops from 0 65 to 0 45 case a1 a2 however such an increase is very minor as compared with the experimental results of goel and o carroll 2011 and goel et al 2016 but it is similar to the experimental results of bottero et al 2011 it must be noted that in our study the dcp coefficient is not calculated over the entire range of saturation and the viscosity ratio is smaller 1 and 1 5 than that used in the experiments of goel and o carroll 2011 and goel et al 2016 this probably explains the discrepancy of the simulation results of this study and the experimental results of goel and o carroll 2011 goel et al 2016 however further research is necessary to decipher such a discrepancy in this study an alternative procedure inspired by bottero et al 2011 and hou et al 2012 is used to calculate the dcp coefficient τ in this procedure the plots of difference of dcp versus difference of change rate of saturation in fig 12 are used to determine the values of dcp coefficient τ see eq 21 according to the work of bottero et al 2011 when s w 1 t s w 2 t 0 then p c d y n 1 s w p c d y n 2 s w p c s t a s w leading to s w 1 t s w 2 t 0 and p c d y n 2 s w p c d y n 1 s w 0 this provides one additional fitting data point fitting is optimized by applying a least squares algorithm with the difference in the saturation rate change term s w 1 t s w 2 t as the independent variable and the difference in dcp p c d y n 2 s w p c d y n 1 s w as the dependent variable the fitting lines of the fractured and unfractured porous models are shown in fig 11 table 5 lists the corresponding ε and coefficient of determination r 2 of the fitting lines in fig 11 table 5 indicates that fracture regardless horizontal or vertical has a significant effect on the dcp coefficient ε of fractured porous media and the ε values of fractured porous media are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of unfractured porous media for unfractured porous media a1 and a2 τ is 3 98 106 pa ms which is close to the ε value calculated using another method in section 4 1 it should be noted that the previously reported experimental dcp coefficient τ varies over a few orders of magnitude despite the similarities in the porous media and fluids used hassanizadeh et al 2002 hou et al 2012 argued that the changing rate of the wetting phase saturation in those experiments should be corrected before calculating the dcp coefficient τ after such a correction the experimental dcp coefficient τ was about 1 106 pa ms at the wetting phase saturation of sw 0 6 in hou et al 2012 which is slightly smaller than the dcp coefficient of cases a1 a2 of this study see table 5 fig 12 a indicates that both fractures d1 and d2 and eroding process a5 and a6 have significant influence on the dcp coefficient τ fig 11 b shows that fracture orientation has a strong influence on τ the dcp coefficient τ of the porous model with a vertical fracture c1 and c2 is 5 68 105 pa ms while the dcp coefficient ε of the porous model with a horizontal fracture g1 and g2 reduces to 3 10 105 pa ms with the same fracture length of 80 μm it is found that a greater fracture aperture leads to a smaller value of τ the dcp coefficient τ of porous model with a fracture aperture of 4 μm d1 and d2 is 1 1 104 pa ms which is 22 times smaller than that of the porous model with a fracture aperture of 2 μm b1 and b2 and it is about 40 times smaller than that of the porous model with a fracture aperture of 1 μm e1 and e2 f1 and f2 the dcp coefficient τ for a porous model with a horizontal fracture is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the porous model with a vertical fracture c1 and c2 and two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the unfractured porous model a1 and a2 when the fracture aperture is 2 μm doubling the fracture length will cause the reduction of the τ value by 21 29 from 3 10 105 pa ms g1 and g2 to 2 44 105 pa ms b1 and b2 when the fracture aperture decreases by half to 1 μm doubling the fracture length causes the reduction of the τ value by 15 78 from 4 88 105 pa ms f1 and f2 to 4 11 105 pa ms e1 and e2 above analysis reflects the complex interrelated effects of fracture length and fracture aperture on the dcp coefficient the effects of dcp and dcp coefficient of fracture on porous media are important for many practical applications such as petroleum development tang et al 2017 yu et al 2015 and storage of co2 in stimulated saline aquifers raziperchikolaee et al 2013 in petroleum development co2 huff n puff and hydraulic fracturing are effective methods to increase the oil recovery tang et al 2017 one key aspect to simulate and predict the multi phase flow in co2 huff n puff is analyzing the properties of hydraulic fractures from a field scale reservoir simulation perspective the actual hydraulic fracture is usually treated as a wide pseudo fracture to increase the numeric stability tang et al 2017 yu et al 2015 the properties of the pseudo fracture will affect the oil gas distribution and oil recovery and one key property of the pseudo fracture is dcp the simulation results from our studies could be used to understand the performance of hydraulic fractures it should be noted that the actual fracture geometry in oil field is more complex than those used in our model so further research is still needed to expand this research to more complex fracture networks in order to better understand the performance of hydraulic fractures in reservoir scale since the storage of co2 in stimulated saline aquifers also involves the hydraulic fracturing technique thus the pseudo fracture concept is also applicable therefore the effects of fracture on dcp and dcp coefficient will also affect the simulated co2 plume whose shape will affect the long term trapping in stimulated saline aquifers raziperchikolaee et al 2013 5 conclusions a series of two phase displacement flow simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of a microfracture on dcp and the dcp coefficient τ the two phase lbm and ct image based three dimensional porous modeling method are used to execute the simulations based on the simulated results dcp and the dcp coefficient τ are calculated for two unfractured porous models and six fractured models with different fracture orientations apertures and lengths in this study the focus has been to investigate the influence of fracture on the dcp and dcp coefficient τ in addition we also investigate the effects of viscosity ratio on the dcp and dcp coefficient τ we have proposed an innovative way to calculate the dcp coefficient ε based on two dcp curves from the same porous model with different injection conditions this method yields the value of τ which agrees with that obtained using the conventional method based on the scp and dcp curves from the simulation results non monotonic trends in dcp versus saturation curves are observed the dcp curves are higher for the cases with higher saturation rate changes of the non wetting phase the relationship between porosity and dcp is very complex and the way the porosity is increased will also influence the effects of porosity on dcp the results also show that increasing viscosity ratio may lead to increasing dcp coefficient τ this study shows that fracture have significant influence on two phase flow in porous media which is controlled by fracture orientation aperture and length with the same fracture aperture value a horizontal fracture has a greater influence on dcp and the dcp coefficient ε than a vertical fracture with the same fracture orientation a smaller fracture aperture of the horizontal fracture leads to a higher dcp and a longer length of the horizontal fracture will result in a smaller dcp a microfracture has significant effects on the dcp coefficient ε for unfractured porous media the dcp coefficient ε is about 4 106 pa ms for fractured porous media it is 2 44 105 pa ms for the porous model with a horizontal fracture with an aperture of 2 μm it is 1 1 104 pa ms for the porous model with a horizontal fracture with an aperture of 4 μm and it is 5 68 105 pa ms for the porous model with a vertical fracture with an aperture of 2 μm in addition the horizontal fracture length and aperture have complex interrelated effects on dcp and the dcp coefficient τ the vertical fracture has a non equilibrium delayed effect on dcp and the dcp coefficient τ

870,dynamic capillary pressure dcp effects which is vital for predicting multiphase flow behavior in porous media refers to the injection rate dependence capillary pressure observed during non equilibrium displacement experiments however a clear picture of the effects of microscale fractures on dcp remains elusive this study quantified the effects of microscale fractures on dcp and simulated pore scale force and saturation change in fractured porous media using the multiphase lattice boltzmann method lbm eighteen simulation cases were carried out to calculate dcp as a function of wetting phase saturation the effects of viscosity ratio and fracture orientation aperture and length on dcp and dcp coefficient τ were investigated where τ refers to the ratio of the difference of dcp and static capillary pressure scp over the rate of wetting phase saturation change versus time significant differences in τ values were observed between unfractured and fractured porous media the τ values of fractured porous media were 1 1 104 pa ms to 5 68 105 pa ms which were one or two orders of magnitude lower than those of unfractured porous media with a value of 4 106 pa ms a horizontal fracture had greater effects on dcp and τ than a vertical fracture given the same fracture aperture and length this study suggested that a microscale fracture might result in large magnitude changes in dcp for two phase flow keywords fracture porous media dynamic capillary pressure multiphase flow lattice boltzmann method 1 introduction understanding and predicting multiphase flow behavior in fractured porous media is a challenging subject in a number of disciplines and applications such as co2 storage in brine aquifers berg and ott 2012 hall et al 2016 juanes et al 2006 kim and santamarina 2016 pruess and garcia 2002 qi et al 2009 oil recovery in fractured reservoirs tang et al 2017 and water flow back in shale gas development cao et al 2017 recently several field and laboratory experiments and numerical analysis have been conducted to investigate the nonlinear transient and spatial characteristics of multiphase flow in fractured porous media tang et al 2017 faybishenko 2017 fractures not only dramatically change the permeability of the porous media but also change the effective average static capillary pressure in addition fractures usually show unique multiscale characteristics whose main dimensions could span several orders of magnitude in space with numerous microscale fractures and large faults zhang et al 2017c since it is impractical to represent every microscale fracture in a numerical model due to the enormous computational cost associated with a complete discretization of these fractures jerbi et al 2017 matrix and microscale fractures are usually divided into small homogenized continuum blocks in field scale simulations tang et al 2017 such as equivalent continuum models wu 1999 tang et al 2017 dual domain or dual porosity continuum models jerbi et al 2017 lichtner 2000 and their various extensions pruess and garcia 2002 in these models the mass balance and darcy s law are assumed to be valid for each block tang et al 2017 landry et al 2011 for two phase flow which is the primary concern of this study the governing equation can be written as dahle et al 2005 yu et al 2015 tang et al 2017 sussman et al 1998 1 ϕ t s α k s k r a μ α p α where μα is the viscosity of phase α which can be a wetting phase w or a non wetting phase n φ is the porosity k s is the absolute permeability kra is the relative permeability for phase α s α is the saturation of phase α bounded by a constraint of sn sw 1 p α is the pressure of phase α t is time and is the differential operator in space the constitutive equation among pn pw and sw is the capillary pressure equation 2 p n p w p c d y n s w where p c d y n s w is usually called the dynamic capillary pressure dcp hou et al 2012 or non equilibrium fluid pressure difference bottero et al 2011 which is dependent on actual flow dynamics the subscript c means capillary pressure hereinafter and the superscript dyn means dynamic hereinafter different from dcp another widely used capillary pressure called the static capillary pressure scp or equilibrium fluid pressure difference p c s t a which is often measured under a static or quasi static state in laboratory experiments bottero et al 2011 abidoye and das 2014 das et al 2005 is frequently used as a substitute of p c d y n s w in field scale simulations tang et al 2017 yu et al 2015 it is notable that the terms of non equilibrium and dynamic have been used exchangeable in many previous studies and the terms of equilibrium and static have also been used exchangeable by various investigators hassanizadeh et al 2005 and bottero et al 2011 gave a detailed discussion about the terms of non equilibrium and dynamic and the terms of equilibrium and static in respect to the capillary pressure in this study the non equilibrium state refers to a flow field that is still dynamically change with time whereas the equilibrium state refers to a flow field that is not change with time anymore however many studies abidoye and das 2014 das and mirzaei 2012 niasar et al 2010 goel et al 2016 have observed unique features of dcp that has not been seen in scp during non equilibrium two phase flow in porous media suggesting that the conventional scp concept may not accurately describe two phase flow behavior under non equilibrium flow conditions several quantitative equations have been proposed to describe dcp considering the change in saturation rate based on experimental results bottero et al 2011 abidoye and das 2014 goel et al 2016 a common practice of those studies was to relate dcp and scp with a constant coefficient and a widely used equation was proposed by hassanizadeh et al 2005 3 p c d p c d y n p c s t a τ s w t where p c d denotes the difference of dcp and scp τ is called the dcp coefficient hereinafter and sw is the wetting phase saturation in a two phase flow problem the value of τ is crucial for studying two phase flow in porous media bottero et al 2011 dahle et al 2005 hassanizadeh et al 2005 however up to date only a number of values of τ have been published from experimental and modeling studies using unfractured porous media hou et al 2012 bottero et al 2011 hassanizadeh et al 2005 abidoye and das 2014 das and mirzaei 2012 goel et al 2016 a comprehensive investigation of dcp in fractured porous media remain elusive the objective of this study is to fill this knowledge gap specifically we will investigate the effects of fracture characteristics such as fracture orientation aperture and length on dcp and τ and will report innovative methods to determine the τ value in addition we will investigate the effects of viscosity ratio on dcp and τ a realistic porous media model is developed based on x ray micro tomography ct image data of a sandstone sample which is obtained from a borehole drilled to the depth of 1900 m from well long 26 in fuyu formation songliao basin northeast of china the effects of injection rates and fluid mobility ratio which is defined as the ratio of the viscosities of wetting phase and non wetting phase are studied a simplified artificial microscale fracture is added into the porous model to analyze the influence of fracture on two phase flow in particularly to investigate dcp and its associated τ values the lattice boltzmann method lbm is used to simulate two phase flow in the porous model in this study 2 methods many numerical methods have been proposed to simulate multiphase flow in porous media cahn and hilliard 1958 badalassi et al 2003 hirt and nichols 1981 pilliod and puckett 2004 osher and sethian 1988 sussman et al 1998 sukop and thorne 2006 bao and schaefer 2013 tang et al 2015 chen and doolen 1998 among these methods lbm has been proven to be an efficient and effective simulation method for a variety of problems liu et al 2012 gunstensen et al 1991 shan and chen 1993 swift et al 1995 he et al 2000 nourgaliev et al 2003 bao and schaefer 2013 sukop and thorne 2006 succi et al 2014 cahn and hilliard 1958 eshraghi et al 2012 reported that the lbm model could be used on simulation of dendritic solidification with 36 billion grid points and the parallel efficient is almost 100 by using central processing unit cpu cores of 1000 4068 li et al 2016 reported that the three dimensional multi phase lbm simulation cases with a model size of 512 256 256 could achieve a parallel efficiency of about 60 with 400k cpu cores using a hybrid and heterogeneous multiple data programming model up to present there are at least three main three dimensional lbms suga et al 2015 namely the d3q15 model the d3q19 model and the d3q27 model after a careful check of these three lbms we select the d3q27 model fig 1 to simulate two phase flow in the ct image based digital rock model in this study with a specific focus on analyzing the effects of a horizontal or vertical fracture on dcp and τ such a choice is based on two considerations firstly kang and hassan 2013 found that the d3q19 model violated galilean invariance while the d3q27 model did not secondly kuwata and suga 2015 and suga et al 2015 reported that both the d3q19 model and the d3q15 model produced false forces reynolds stresses in particular directions while such an issue was negligible in the d3q27 model therefore the d3q27 model is a proper choice for the type of problem investigated here fig 1 shows the lattice cell of the d3q27 model in which the number notes are the discrete speed vectors there are 27 discrete speed vectors in total the 0th discrete speed vector is placed at the center of the cell with a discrete velocity value of zero and the other discrete speed vectors are pointed from the center of the cell to the center points of faces 1 6 with a discrete velocity value of one the middle points of edges 7 18 with a discrete velocity value of 2 and the corners 19 26 with a discrete velocity value of 3 all in dimensionless forms liu et al 2016 suga et al 2015 in the d3q27 model

discrete speed vectors e k and sound speed used in the d3q27 model based on the d3q27 model we employ the shan chen pseudo potential concept in the present work due to its simplicity and flexibility shan and chen 1993 huang et al 2007 the basic idea of this concept is to use a pseudo potential that depends on the local density and interaction strength to represent the pairwise microscopic molecular interactions at the macroscopic scale huang et al 2007 once the interaction strength is properly chosen the phases will spontaneously segregate chen and doolen 1998 huang et al 2007 this concept represents the microscopic physics closely and is flexible in dealing with the surface tension force tang et al 2015 tang et al 2017 because of its remarkable simplicity flexibility and clear representation of the underlying microscopic physics of phase segregation the pseudo potential concept has been successfully used in a broad range of studies about multiphase flow shan and chen 1993 landry et al 2014 huang et al 2007 especially for multiphase flow in porous media landry et al 2014 landry et al 2011 tang et al 2015 according to this model the total force acting on the particles of fluid phase α denoted as f f f α can be written as succi et al 2014 10 f f f α ψ α x t α 1 s k 0 b g α α w k ψ α x e k δ t t e k where ψα x t is the pseudo potential g α α is the interaction strength between phases α and α s is the number of phases and b is 26 for the two phase flow of this study based on the interaction force there are several implementations of lbm for multiphase flow our implementation is achieved through a common velocity of u x t defined as u x t α 1 s k 1 b f k α e k λ α α 1 s k 1 b f k α λ α huang et al 2007 succi et al 2014 the transient velocity of each phase u

in all simulation cases additional fluid phases can be implemented by changing g α α into an interaction strength matrix contact angle is also controlled by interaction forces between the solid and fluid phases which can be easily implemented by replacing ψ α x e k δ t t in eq 10 with a solid potential π x e k δ t t and replacing g α α in eq 10 with the interaction strength between solid and fluid g a α π bao and schaefer 2013 tang et al 2015 where α and π in the superscript represent the fluid phase and solid phase respectively and a in the subscript is an abbreviation of adhesive force between the fluid and solid phases the solid surface force between fluid phase α and solid wall π could be calculated as 12 f f w α ρ α x t k 1 b g a α π w k π x e k δ t t e k where g a α π is the

dimension analog is applied in all sixteen simulation cases of this study to convert the simulation data from lattice units into physical units for velocity kinematic viscosity relaxation time and surface tension coefficient the following equations are satisfied frish et al 1987 gunstensen et al 1991 shan and chen 1993 liu et al 2016 13 δ t p u l b u p δ x p 14 μ l b μ p u l b u p 1 δ x p μ p δ

previous lbm based multiphase flow studies hao and cheng 2010 frish et al 1987 liu et al 2012 bao and schaefer 2013 another important subject related to capillary pressure is upscaling to the best of our knowledge there are at least three main types of upscaling methods for capillary pressure fig 2 including boundary averaging type p c d i f miri et al 2014 volume averaging type p c a v e dahle et al 2005 and energy conservation law based type p c e n e raeini et al 2014a b fig 2 is a schematic diagram to interpret the differences among these three capillary pressure upscaling methods in general during a displacement experiment p c d i f p c a v e p c e n e the boundary averaging type p c d i f is widely used in experiment based capillary pressure studies since it is convenient to measure the average pressure pin at the inlet and the average pressure pout at the outlet in laboratory thus p c d i f can be easily calculated by p c d i f p i n p o u t the volume averaging type p c a v e is more popular in analytical and numerical studies because the pressure at every point can be determined precisely however p c d i f and p c a v e are usually larger than the physically based capillary pressure p c e n e during a displacement experiment since d p n v i s and d p w v i s fig 2 are also used to calculate the pressure difference of p c d i f and p c a v e the energy conservation law based type p c e n e is also calculated based on numerical simulations applying the energy conservation law to porous media raeini et al 2014a b one can obtain the following balance equation for energy rate 17 p c d y n q d w p d w vis d t where q is discharge at the inlet p c d y n q is the energy rate of capillary pressure dwp is the energy rate of p c d i f d w v i s d t α n w

ct image data from zeiss xradia ct scanning with a voxel resolution of 0 1 μm the total size of the digital porous model is 1700 800 400 and the porosity is 22 4 the mean pore radius is 1 6 μm and the permeability is 3 7 10 12 m2 to investigate the effects of fracture on dcp and its associated dcp coefficient of τ an idealized single fracture consisting of two parallel planes is added into above porous models with different orientations apertures and lengths as shown in fig 3 and table 2 the grid cells in original porous media fig 3 a are divided into two types as done in the work of sukop and thorne 2006 one type of grid cell is called solid grid cell which represent the solid the left grid cells are called fluid grid cells which represent the space where the fluids could flow through in our simulations the type of each grid cell is represented by a boolean number b the solid grid cells are marked as b 1 and the fluid grid cells are marked as b 0 to ensuring the connecting of the adjacent pore space and fracture space we implement the idealized single fracture by assigning all the grid cell type number b to 0 between the two parallel fracture planes meaning that the space between the two fracture planes can only be occupied by fluids not by solids see fig 3 to investigate the effects of fracture length on dcp we built two models shown in fig 3 e and f with different fracture lengths of 150 μm and 80 μm respectively we also built a model shown in fig 3 g with the same fracture length and aperture as the model in fig 3 c one additional porous model with a much larger porosity of 34 is also built using an eroding process carried out using the imerode function in matlab with an eroding radius of 3 for the two phase displacement simulations using above eight porous models the densities of displacing and displaced fluids are set as unity because the gravitational force is usually negligible compared to the capillary and viscous forces in our case however it must be noted that gravitational forces can be very significant for chlorinated solvents the contact angle is set to be 140 the same as the contact angle used in the conventional mercury injection capillary pressure experiments zhang et al 2017a which is a standard method to measure scp ultra low flux rates are used in the simulation cases and the max mach number is around ma 0 0029 which is suitable for studying incompressible transient flow problems based on lbm according to the work of hazi 2003 and reider and sterling 1995 to minimize the boundary effects one inlet zone of 400 layers and one outlet zone of 30 layers are added to the model fig 3 we use more layers in the inlet zone than the outlet zone to implement the constant injection velocity boundary before the non wetting phase reaching the porous zone for obtaining the high resolution simulation results the number of elements for the porous model is as large as 2130 800 400 the ada high performance computer cluster at the texas a m university tamu at college station campus of usa is used to simulate these models each simulation case requires approximately 3000 cpus for about 10 5 days 4 results and discussions eighteen simulation cases associated with above eight porous models tables 2 and 3 are considered to investigate the effects of a horizontal or vertical fracture on dcp and dcp coefficient τ in each simulation case the porous media is first saturated with a wetting phase and then a non wetting phase is injected from the inlet side to displace the wetting phase the contact angle is set as 140 for all simulation cases to eliminate the influence of wettability the value of g which is the interaction strength for two phase flow is set as 2 0 to implement surface tension coefficient σ simu 25mn m according standard processes used in lbm simulations shan and chen 1993 huang et al 2007 two injection fluxes 1 mm s and 1 5 mm s are applied at the inlet boundaries to observe flow rate dependent effects on dcp continuous boundary condition is applied to the outlet boundaries non slip wall boundaries are applied to other boundaries the space step and time step are respectively δxp 1 10 7 m δtp 1 10 9 s and the characteristic velocities are ulb 1 10 5 and up 1 10 3 these eighteen cases are classified into seven groups a b c d e f and g a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 and a6 are in group a with no fracture b1 and b2 are in group b with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 2 μm and a fracture length of 170 μm c1 and c2 are in group c with one vertical fracture with an aperture of 2 μm and a fracture length of 80 μm d1 and d2 are in group d with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 4 μm and a fracture length of 170 μm e1 and e2 are in group e with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 1 μm and a fracture length of 80 μm f1 and f2 are in group f with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 1 μm and a fracture length of 150 μm g1 and g2 are in group g with one horizontal fracture with an aperture of 2 μm and a fracture length of 80 μm a1 a2 a5 and a6 in group a are designated as the reference cases to calculate the dcp coefficient τ and to investigate the effects of a fracture in groups b f porous models in cases a5 and a6 are generated from the porous models in fig 3 a a3 and a4 in group a are designated to investigate the effect of viscosity ratio on capillary pressure groups b c and g are designated to investigate the effects of fracture orientation on dcp groups e and f are designated to investigate the fracture length on dcp groups b d e and f are designated to investigate the effects of fracture aperture on dcp 4 1 dcp of unfractured porous media fig 4 shows the simulated phase evolution of a1 and a2 table 2 at different injection rates there are three main features in these snapshots first convex non wetting phase fronts form at the beginning fig 4 a1 and b1 next at the dynamical state the non wetting phase does not have enough time to flow through all the flow paths fig 4 a2 and b2 and the channeling of the non wetting phase is evident fig 4 also shows that the channeling pattern becomes more obvious when the injection flux is higher since more pore space filled with the wetting phase is left behind for the high injection flux case the flow pattern in fig 4 can be partially interpreted by capillary number ca uμ w φσcos θ friedman 1999 where u is the inlet velocity μ w is the wetting phase viscosity φ is the porosity σ is the surface tension coefficient θ is the contact angle and viscosity ratio of the non wetting and wetting phases m μ nw μ w lenormand et al 1988 where μ nw is the viscosity of the non wetting phase since μ nw μ w φ σ m are the same in cases a1 and a2 so the flow pattern is determined by ca which is controlled by the injecting flux and the value of ca is larger for case a2 than for case a1 fig 5 a shows the evolution of dcp and saturation of a1 a2 a3 and a4 where dcp increases almost linearly before reaching a peak value and then decreases slowly to an asymptote similar results are obtained in the experiments of bottero et al 2011 and numerical simulations of hao and cheng 2010 fig 5 b shows that the saturation of the non wetting phase first increases rapidly and then slows down to approach an asymptote fig 6 a shows dcp versus saturation of the wetting phase of a1 a2 a3 and a4 there are three main features in this figure as well firstly a higher injection flux will lead to a higher dcp dcp of a2 is higher than that of a1 which agrees with eq 3 secondly the viscosity ratio has notable influence on dcp curves dcp of a3 is higher than that of a1 thirdly dcp curves show non monotonic trends at lower saturation of the wetting phase which is sometimes called overshoot in dcp experiments by some previous investigators hassanizadeh et al 2005 as eq 3 indicates that scp is needed to calculate the dcp coefficient τ simulations with ultra low flux rates are needed to get scp however simulations with ultra low flux rates will require much more computational resources so a standard constant rate mercury injection experiment crmi is carried out with automated system for pore examination 730 with the same sample used in ct scanning the injecting rate is set at an ultra low state of 0 0001cc min the crmi results are plotted in fig 6 a the curve is converted using a multiplier factor of σ simu cos θ simu σ hg cos θ hg where θ simu and σ simu are the contact angle and interfacial tension used in simulation cases respectively and their values are θ simu 140 and σ simu 25 mn m while θ hg and σ hg are the corresponding values of θ simu and σ simu used in the experiment and their values are θ hg 140 and σ hg 485 mn m according to eq 3 to calculate the dcp coefficient τ three terms are needed dcp scp and the rate of change of saturation to facilitate the calculation dcp and scp at specific saturation are firstly calculated by a linear interpolation between two adjacent data points then values of the rate of change of saturation are calculated using a central difference scheme based on the data of fig 5 b next at a given saturation the dcp difference p c d y n p c s t a and sw t are given in pairs and plotted in fig 6 b for the range of 0 45 sw 0 75 the saturation range of wetting phase used in this study is close the saturation range of wetting phase 0 5 sw 0 85 used in previous study bottero et al 2011 according to previous studies hassanizadeh et al 2005 bottero et al 2011 one could assume that the dcp difference is zero when s w t 0 which provides an additional data point of s w t 0 p c d 0 in fig 6 b all these data are used to fit a regression line of p c d s w t in fig 6 b and the slope of the fitting line is the estimated value of τ in previous experimental works of hassanizadeh et al 2005 bottero et al 2011 and hou et al 2012 all data under different injection fluxes are used to fit the dcp coefficient τ in this study we calculate the dcp coefficient τ for each simulation case based on fig 6 a based on a regression procedure using the least squares fitting method bottero et al 2011 see table 4 the slope of the fitting line of cases a1 a2 in fig 6 b is 4 07 106 pa ms table 4 gives the dcp coefficients τ coefficient of determination r 2 and 95 confidence bounds of the fitting lines in fig 6 b fig 6 b also shows that the viscosity ratio has notable influence on dcp coefficient τ which is 6 64 106 pa ms for case a3 a4 with viscosity ratio of 1 5 this indicates that increasing viscosity ratio may lead to increasing dynamic capillary pressure coefficient such a phenomenon is also observed in the work of goel and o carroll 2011 we find that the ratio of τ between a1 a2 and a3 a4 is 1 63 which is close to ratio of the non wetting phase viscosities between a1 a2 and a3 a4 which is 1 5 see table 2 in the work of niasar et al 2010 a similar conclusion is also drawn at the wetting phase saturation range of about 0 5 sw 0 85 4 2 effects of a horizontal or vertical fracture on two phase flow fig 7 shows the results of evolution of phase spatial distribution with time for cases a1 a5 b1 c1 d1 e1 f1 and g1 it is found that a fracture has a significant influence on two phase flow in porous media which is controlled by fracture orientation aperture and length the non wetting fluid phase moves forward much faster in the fracture than in the adjacent porous matrix in b1 and d1 indicating the high conductivity of these horizontal fractures despite the fact that the fracture orientations in b1 and d1 are the same horizontal the saturation distributions of the non wetting fluid in these two cases are clearly different specifically a greater fracture aperture leads to a smaller saturation of the non wetting phase in the adjacent porous matrix quantitative analysis of such phenomenon is important for studying oil accumulation paths in fractured reservoirs or block faulted reservoirs lyu et al 2017 since the crude oil in these systems needs to be extracted from water in the fractures and porous media during the accumulation process the special parameter settings in our simulations indicate that when the fracture aperture is larger than 4 μm d1 none of the non wetting phases will flow into the adjacent porous matrix owing to the much lower capillary pressure of fracture compared to those of the adjacent porous matrix when the aperture of fracture is less than 2 μm b1 e1 f1 the non wetting fluid may partially saturate the adjacent porous matrix since decreasing the fracture aperture also decreases the difference in permeability and capillary pressure between the fracture and the adjacent porous matrix wang 2017 zhang et al 2016 fig 7 also indicates that fracture orientation is a crucial parameter in analyzing the flow paths in fractured porous media compared to a horizontal fracture g1 a vertical fracture has less influence on flow during drainage c1 provided that their apertures and lengths are the same as their counterparts in a horizontal fracture see tables 2 and 3 however a non equilibrium delayed effect on two phase flow can be observed for a vertical fracture by comparing the simulation results of c1 and a1 at 60 ms the spatial distribution of the non wetting phase shows no difference before reaching the vertical fracture but the non wetting phase displacement of the wetting phase becomes slower on the right of the vertical fracture in c1 as compared with a1 at 60 ms this is because the non wetting phase will preferentially fill the vertical fracture first furthermore fig 7 shows that the fracture length is another controlling factor of the flow pattern during the non wetting phase displacement of the wetting phase in fractured porous media as the longer fracture b1 shows more influence on the flow pattern than the shorter fracture g1 when the fracture apertures are the same fig 8 a and b show the effects of microfractures on the dcp curves it is observed that dcps of the fractured porous media b1 b2 c1 c2 d1 d2 e1 e2 f1 f2 and g1 g2 are lower than that of the original unfractured porous medium a1 and a2 at the same injection flux and a smaller fracture aperture will result in a higher dcp a1 a2 b1 b2 and d1 d2 at the same injection flux a shorter fracture length will lead to a higher dcp as well a1 a2 b1 b2 and g1 g2 a1 a2 e1 e2 and f1 f2 at the same injection flux fig 8 c and d show the corresponding effects of microfractures on the saturation of the non wetting phase the residual saturation values of the wetting phase in the fractured porous media b1 b2 c1 c2 d1 d2 e1 e2 f1 f2 g1 and g2 are higher than those in the unfractured porous media a1 a2 at the same injection flux figs 7 9 also show that porosity has crucial influences on dcp and saturation evolution however the relationship between porosity and dcp is very complex this is primarily due to two reasons firstly dcp is not only controlled by fracture aperture and fracture length but also controlled by fracture orientation c1 and g1 which has no notable influence on porosity secondly cases a1 a5 b1 and d1 show that the way the porosity is increased will also influence the effects of porosity on dcp for instance although the increased porosity is higher in a5 comparing with d1 d1 actually has more influence on dcp than a5 the issue of porosity dcp relationship deserves further investigation in the future nevertheless the change of dcp in d1 follows a trend similar to those in a1 b1 c1 e1 f1 and g1 the dcp in d1 decreases to an asymptote of about 1 104 pa which is very close the theoretical value of scp in a fracture which is σ simu cos θ simu rf where rf is the value of half of the fracture aperture zheng et al 2017 this finding also agrees with the discussion on the spatial distribution of the non wetting phase in fig 7 which indicates that flow exchange between the fracture and the adjacent porous matrix ceases for a fracture with an aperture higher than 4 μm fig 8 a also shows that the vertical fracture has a transient delayed effect on dcp comparing with a1 one can see that before reaching the peak value dcp of c1 goes through a delayed period marked as 2 in fig 8 a at approximately 50 ms hence dcp of c1 first increases almost linearly marked as 1 in fig 8 a and then slows down at a delayed period marked as 2 after the delayed period dcp of c1 increases again to the peak value marked as 3 which is followed by a rapidly decreasing period marked as 4 in contrast dcp of a1 increases almost linearly marked as 1 to a peak value higher than that in b1 in the delayed period and dcp of a1 decreases slowly after reaching the peak value marked as 2 and 3 comparing the snapshots of c1 in fig 7 with dcp of c1 in fig 8 a it is found that the non wetting phase also invades the vertical fracture around the delayed period of 50 60 ms c2 also goes through a similar delayed period as c1 at about 40 ms fig 8 b when the non wetting phase invades the vertical fracture at 40 ms see fig 9 therefore one may conclude that the delayed effect in fig 8 a is dominated by the vertical fracture fig 9 shows that the evolution rate of the spatial distribution of the non wetting phase with an injection flux of 1 5 mm s is much faster than that with an injection flux of 1 mm s the dcp curves are also higher for the cases with higher saturation rate changes of the non wetting phase see fig 8 b this agrees with eq 3 which is also validated in dcp experiments reported in a number of studies bottero et al 2011 previous numerical analysis and experiments mostly used constant pressure conditions das and mirzaei 2012 hou et al 2012 bottero et al 2011 while the simulations of this study show that such a phenomenon is also observed under constant flux conditions 4 3 effects of a horizontal or vertical fracture on the dcp coefficient τ fig 10 shows that the fracture has a significant influence on the dcp versus saturation curves for the non wetting phase the absolute value of dcp not only varies greatly with changes in the characteristics of fracture but the maximum saturation is also dominated by the fracture fig 10 also shows a non monotonic trend of dcp with increasing non wetting phase saturation which is different from the monotonic trend observed in static zhang et al 2017b tang et al 2017 or quasi static capillary pressure experiments wang and alvarado 2017 such a non monotonic trend or overshoot has also been observed in high pressure non equilibrium displacement experiments before hassanizadeh et al 2005 although overshoot has been observed in experimental investigations before bottero et al 2011 hassanizadeh et al 2005 the essential mechanism is still not fully understood to the best of our knowledge from the simulation results we find that with a higher injection rate a portion of the non wetting phase will enter nearby smaller pore spaces rather than the farther larger pore spaces at early stage such as shown in the snapshots in fig 7 this in turn could cause dcp to be higher than scp at early stage as time processes the whole system will eventually reestablish its equilibrium state and the non wetting phase will reenter the larger pore spaces as a result dcp declines with time it should be noted that above explanation is based on the observation of the non wetting phase in our simulation results not from a rigorous theoretical perspective according to eq 3 a straightforward way to calculate the dcp coefficient τ is to use one dcp curve one scp curve and the change rate of saturation the imbedded microfracture will change the scp curve however comparing with dcp measuring or simulating scp is often time consuming bottero et al 2011 hassanizadeh et al 2005 here we propose an alternative way to calculate the dcp coefficient τ based on two dcp curves p c d y n 1 p c d y n 2 generated from the same porous model with different injection conditions listed in tables 2 and 3 and two corresponding saturation rate change curves s w 1 t and s w 2 t the procedure is briefly explained as follows firstly curves p c d y n 1 p c d y n 2 s w 1 t and s w 2 t at the same saturation position are calculated by a linear interpolation between two data points bottero et al 2011 then one can obtain the following equations 19 p c d y n 1 s w p c s t a s w τ s w 1 t s w 20 p c d y n 2 s w p c s t a s w τ s w 2 t s w by subtracting eq 19 from eq 20 one can eliminate the scp term p c s t a s w and gets 21 p c d y n 2 s w p c d y n 1 s w τ s w 2 t s w s w 1 t s w according to eq 21 the dcp coefficient τ could be calculated at specific saturation of the wetting phase the resulting dcp coefficient τ values are plotted versus the wetting phase saturation in fig 11 for very high viscosity ratios of m 200 and m 1000 goel and o carroll 2011 and goel et al 2016 found that the dcp coefficient τ will increase with the decrease of the wetting phase saturation our simulation results also show an increase trend of the dcp coefficient τ when the wetting phase saturation drops from 0 65 to 0 45 case a1 a2 however such an increase is very minor as compared with the experimental results of goel and o carroll 2011 and goel et al 2016 but it is similar to the experimental results of bottero et al 2011 it must be noted that in our study the dcp coefficient is not calculated over the entire range of saturation and the viscosity ratio is smaller 1 and 1 5 than that used in the experiments of goel and o carroll 2011 and goel et al 2016 this probably explains the discrepancy of the simulation results of this study and the experimental results of goel and o carroll 2011 goel et al 2016 however further research is necessary to decipher such a discrepancy in this study an alternative procedure inspired by bottero et al 2011 and hou et al 2012 is used to calculate the dcp coefficient τ in this procedure the plots of difference of dcp versus difference of change rate of saturation in fig 12 are used to determine the values of dcp coefficient τ see eq 21 according to the work of bottero et al 2011 when s w 1 t s w 2 t 0 then p c d y n 1 s w p c d y n 2 s w p c s t a s w leading to s w 1 t s w 2 t 0 and p c d y n 2 s w p c d y n 1 s w 0 this provides one additional fitting data point fitting is optimized by applying a least squares algorithm with the difference in the saturation rate change term s w 1 t s w 2 t as the independent variable and the difference in dcp p c d y n 2 s w p c d y n 1 s w as the dependent variable the fitting lines of the fractured and unfractured porous models are shown in fig 11 table 5 lists the corresponding ε and coefficient of determination r 2 of the fitting lines in fig 11 table 5 indicates that fracture regardless horizontal or vertical has a significant effect on the dcp coefficient ε of fractured porous media and the ε values of fractured porous media are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of unfractured porous media for unfractured porous media a1 and a2 τ is 3 98 106 pa ms which is close to the ε value calculated using another method in section 4 1 it should be noted that the previously reported experimental dcp coefficient τ varies over a few orders of magnitude despite the similarities in the porous media and fluids used hassanizadeh et al 2002 hou et al 2012 argued that the changing rate of the wetting phase saturation in those experiments should be corrected before calculating the dcp coefficient τ after such a correction the experimental dcp coefficient τ was about 1 106 pa ms at the wetting phase saturation of sw 0 6 in hou et al 2012 which is slightly smaller than the dcp coefficient of cases a1 a2 of this study see table 5 fig 12 a indicates that both fractures d1 and d2 and eroding process a5 and a6 have significant influence on the dcp coefficient τ fig 11 b shows that fracture orientation has a strong influence on τ the dcp coefficient τ of the porous model with a vertical fracture c1 and c2 is 5 68 105 pa ms while the dcp coefficient ε of the porous model with a horizontal fracture g1 and g2 reduces to 3 10 105 pa ms with the same fracture length of 80 μm it is found that a greater fracture aperture leads to a smaller value of τ the dcp coefficient τ of porous model with a fracture aperture of 4 μm d1 and d2 is 1 1 104 pa ms which is 22 times smaller than that of the porous model with a fracture aperture of 2 μm b1 and b2 and it is about 40 times smaller than that of the porous model with a fracture aperture of 1 μm e1 and e2 f1 and f2 the dcp coefficient τ for a porous model with a horizontal fracture is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the porous model with a vertical fracture c1 and c2 and two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the unfractured porous model a1 and a2 when the fracture aperture is 2 μm doubling the fracture length will cause the reduction of the τ value by 21 29 from 3 10 105 pa ms g1 and g2 to 2 44 105 pa ms b1 and b2 when the fracture aperture decreases by half to 1 μm doubling the fracture length causes the reduction of the τ value by 15 78 from 4 88 105 pa ms f1 and f2 to 4 11 105 pa ms e1 and e2 above analysis reflects the complex interrelated effects of fracture length and fracture aperture on the dcp coefficient the effects of dcp and dcp coefficient of fracture on porous media are important for many practical applications such as petroleum development tang et al 2017 yu et al 2015 and storage of co2 in stimulated saline aquifers raziperchikolaee et al 2013 in petroleum development co2 huff n puff and hydraulic fracturing are effective methods to increase the oil recovery tang et al 2017 one key aspect to simulate and predict the multi phase flow in co2 huff n puff is analyzing the properties of hydraulic fractures from a field scale reservoir simulation perspective the actual hydraulic fracture is usually treated as a wide pseudo fracture to increase the numeric stability tang et al 2017 yu et al 2015 the properties of the pseudo fracture will affect the oil gas distribution and oil recovery and one key property of the pseudo fracture is dcp the simulation results from our studies could be used to understand the performance of hydraulic fractures it should be noted that the actual fracture geometry in oil field is more complex than those used in our model so further research is still needed to expand this research to more complex fracture networks in order to better understand the performance of hydraulic fractures in reservoir scale since the storage of co2 in stimulated saline aquifers also involves the hydraulic fracturing technique thus the pseudo fracture concept is also applicable therefore the effects of fracture on dcp and dcp coefficient will also affect the simulated co2 plume whose shape will affect the long term trapping in stimulated saline aquifers raziperchikolaee et al 2013 5 conclusions a series of two phase displacement flow simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of a microfracture on dcp and the dcp coefficient τ the two phase lbm and ct image based three dimensional porous modeling method are used to execute the simulations based on the simulated results dcp and the dcp coefficient τ are calculated for two unfractured porous models and six fractured models with different fracture orientations apertures and lengths in this study the focus has been to investigate the influence of fracture on the dcp and dcp coefficient τ in addition we also investigate the effects of viscosity ratio on the dcp and dcp coefficient τ we have proposed an innovative way to calculate the dcp coefficient ε based on two dcp curves from the same porous model with different injection conditions this method yields the value of τ which agrees with that obtained using the conventional method based on the scp and dcp curves from the simulation results non monotonic trends in dcp versus saturation curves are observed the dcp curves are higher for the cases with higher saturation rate changes of the non wetting phase the relationship between porosity and dcp is very complex and the way the porosity is increased will also influence the effects of porosity on dcp the results also show that increasing viscosity ratio may lead to increasing dcp coefficient τ this study shows that fracture have significant influence on two phase flow in porous media which is controlled by fracture orientation aperture and length with the same fracture aperture value a horizontal fracture has a greater influence on dcp and the dcp coefficient ε than a vertical fracture with the same fracture orientation a smaller fracture aperture of the horizontal fracture leads to a higher dcp and a longer length of the horizontal fracture will result in a smaller dcp a microfracture has significant effects on the dcp coefficient ε for unfractured porous media the dcp coefficient ε is about 4 106 pa ms for fractured porous media it is 2 44 105 pa ms for the porous model with a horizontal fracture with an aperture of 2 μm it is 1 1

871,for centuries humans have resorted to building dams to gain control over freshwater available for human consumption although dams and their reservoirs have made many important contributions to human development they receive negative attention as well because of the large amounts of water they can consume through evaporation we estimate the blue water footprint of the world s artificial reservoirs and attribute it to the purposes hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply residential and industrial water supply flood protection fishing and recreation based on their economic value we estimate that economic benefits from 2235 reservoirs included in this study amount to 265 109 us a year with residential and industrial water supply and hydroelectricity generation as major contributors the water footprint associated with these benefits is the sum of the water footprint of dam construction 1 contribution and evaporation from the reservoir s surface area and globally adds up to 66 109 m3 y 1 the largest share of this water footprint 57 is located in non water scarce basins and only 1 in year round scarce basins the primary purposes of a reservoir change with increasing water scarcity from mainly hydroelectricity generation in non scarce basins to residential and industrial water supply irrigation water supply and flood control in scarcer areas keywords water footprint reservoirs water consumption economic value of reservoirs reservoir purposes hydroelectricity 1 introduction increasing the limited availability of freshwater to meet ever growing and competing demands is on many policy agendas wef 2017 drivers for the growing concern include a growing world population increasing wealth a transition from fossil based to renewable energy sources and climate change un wwap 2015 for centuries humans have resorted to building dams to gain control over freshwater available for human consumption toward the middle of the 20th century construction intensified what started off mainly in the developed world was soon followed by developing countries in the 1970 80s when most suitable locations had been developed and most rivers regulated construction slowed down today new reservoirs are being built mainly for the purpose of hydroelectricity generation shiklomanov and rodda 2003 liu et al 2015 timpe and kaplan 2017 dams and their reservoirs have made an important contribution to human development in many ways such as storing using and diverting water for consumption irrigation cooling transportation construction mills power generation fishing and recreation derived benefits have been and continue to be considerable world commission on dams 2000 gernaat et al 2017 associated costs both in socio economic and ecological terms have been considerable as well pacca and horvath 2002 gleick 2003 latrubesse et al 2017 moreover since artificial reservoirs have become so prevalent in our modern world it is increasingly acknowledged that reservoirs are not mere in stream water users they can be large water consumers because of the water that evaporates from their surface this consumptive term adds to the pressure on regional water resources shiklomanov 2000 hoekstra 2013 liu et al 2015 vanham 2016 a previous influential study to humanity s water footprint wf however excluded the wf of reservoirs altogether hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 in addition despite an addendum acknowledging the importance of water consumption by reservoirs through evaporation aquastat does not list them as water consumers in national statistics fao 2016 about hydropower the international energy agency does not even mention the term evaporation in their recent world energy outlook 2016 iea 2016 by it they ignore one of the most important balance terms of water for energy studies that try to account for water consumption by reservoirs typically employ one of two methods the so called net approach and the gross approach bakken et al 2013 2016 the net approach reduces evaporation from the reservoir surface with evapotranspiration in the natural state before dam development e g shiklomanov and rodda 2003 grubert 2016 scherer and pfister 2016 and strachan et al 2016 the gross approach which most studies use takes total evaporation from the reservoir as measure of reservoir consumption e g torcellini et al 2003 pasqualetti and kelley 2008 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 and zhao and liu 2015 although scholars debate on which approach to use we postulate both approaches have their merit confusion arises because of misinterpretation of the intention for which one method is chosen over the other the net approach is suitable for analyzing changes in hydrology on a catchment scale while the gross approach is preferred for water footprint assessments where the aim is to show the total volume of water appropriated to certain purposes and that is therefore not available for another purpose hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra 2017 this study intents the latter following the global water footprint standard hoekstra et al 2011 the wf related to reservoirs must include all steps of the supply chain the total wf should afterwards be attributed to derived products and services based on their economic value a reservoir generally serves multiple purposes the most common of which are hydroelectricity generation supplying water for residential and industrial use supplying irrigation water regulating the flow of rivers to prevent flooding and enabling inland navigation icold 2011 reservoirs are rarely created for recreational and fishing purposes but after a dam is built these are important secondary purposes ward et al 1996 and therefore share in the wf of reservoirs previous studies attributed the total reservoir water footprint to purposes either partially or using simpler methods instead of using economic value one purpose takes all purposes receive an equal share or some prioritization is set up mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 bakken et al 2016 grubert 2016 scherer and pfister 2016 the aim of this study is to estimate the blue wf of the world s artificial reservoirs and attribute it to the purposes hydroelectricity generation residential and industrial water supply irrigation water supply flood protection fishing and recreation based on their economic value the blue wf refers to consumption which includes evaporation of blue water resources surface water and groundwater for each purpose the wf is expressed in terms of water consumption per unit that is m3 gj 1 for hydroelectricity generation m3 ha 1 for irrigation water supply and so on this unit wf is translated into water consumption per us dollar in m3 us 1 and its inverse economic water productivity in us m 3 productivities of hydroelectricity generation are compared with both productivities found in other studies and those of other types of electricity thereby feeding discussions on energy scenarios although water consumed by reservoirs is no longer available for downstream use the question is how worrisome this consumption is in water scarce river basins the opportunity cost of water consumption may be high and a large wf may worsen scarcity whereas in more water rich basins impact may be small we therefore close with an investigation into the water scarcity levels in all river basins with reservoirs 2 method and data the blue water footprint related to an artificial or man made reservoir wfres m3 y 1 includes both an operational and a supply chain part it thus comprises the wf related to evaporation from the reservoir surface wfevap m3 y 1 and the wf related to reservoir construction wfconstr m3 y 1 1 wf res wf evap wf constr wfevap is determined by means of the gross consumption approach 2 wf evap 10 e a κ where e mm y 1 is the depth of water that evaporates yearly from the reservoir surface a ha the maximum reservoir area and κ an area correction factor set to 0 5625 to correct for the fact that the reservoir surface at average filling conditions is smaller than the maximum area reported in the databases this factor is derived from a volume area relation that is based on the assumption that a reservoir is on average half filled during the year kohli and frenken 2015 and is trapezoid shaped multiplication by 10 adjusts the units since reservoir areas are considered constant in the databases see section 2 1 and also κ is kept constant we fail to capture anomalies in surface areas and hence its effect on wfs we prudently quantified the resulting uncertainty range for two indicators namely the global total wf and global average wf of hydroelectricity generation for these two indicators we calculated two extreme scenarios one in which we set κ to 0 2 indicating all reservoirs evaporate from a surface area that roughly corresponds to the dead storage filling resulting in the smallest possible wfevap and one in which we set κ to 1 indicating all reservoirs evaporate from their maximum surface area yielding the largest possible wfevap the resulting range should be interpreted as a preliminary estimate of uncertainty associated with fluctuating reservoir areas wfconstr depends mainly on the construction material of the dam earth and rock fill dams are usually constructed with materials found near the dam site whereas gravity buttress and arc dams are mostly made of reinforced concrete chen 2015 novak et al 2007 for earth and rock fill dams we accounted only for water consumption related to the energy used to excavate and transport the rock or earth we took average fuel use from ahn et al 2009 and applied to it the wf of diesel 1058 m3 mj 1 from gerbens leenes et al 2008 under the assumption that the material on average is sourced 20 km from the construction site for gravity arc and buttress dams we estimated only the wf of reinforced concrete using the wf of cement and unalloyed steel from gerbens leenes et al 2018 and assuming a mixture of 1 steel 29 cement and 70 aggregates we used the wf for rock and earth as describe above also for aggregates water consumption related to clearing the construction site equipment and installations either lack reliable data or were assumed negligible we therefore did not account for these terms finally the annual wfconstr is calculated by dividing the water footprint of construction by the assumed typical lifespan of a dam of 100 years wfres is assigned to the different reservoir purposes i wfi m3 per unit of production through an allocation coefficient ηi that is based on the economic value v us of each purpose i 3 wf i η i wf res with η i v i v i lastly we placed wfres in the context of local water scarcity we used monthly water scarcity levels per river basin representative of and averaged over the period 1996 2005 as provided by hoekstra et al 2012 to examine the scarcity level of the basin in which the reservoir is located a basin is considered water scarce if the total blue wf of all human activities combined exceeds water availability runoff minus environmental flow requirements in any given month because the study by hoekstra et al 2012 does not cover all basins this scarcity analysis includes 71 of reservoirs in this study that are located in basins with data available the remaining 29 were excluded 2 1 reservoir data dam and reservoir data are obtained by combining two databases the world register of dams wrd from the international commission on large dams icold 2011 and the global dams and reservoirs database grand by lehner et al 2011 wrd contains over 37 000 reservoirs including information on reservoir purpose depth and area dam height type and body volume location latitude longitude and production data for hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply and other benefits grand contains information on 6854 reservoirs including reservoir purpose average depth and maximum area dam height and elevation and comes with a georeferenced vector map of reservoir shaped polygons neither database reports temporal variations either intra or inter annual in any dam or reservoir variable wrd and grand are combined since neither one is complete nor contains all information required we linked the two databases based on the name and country of each dam also we put in a manual effort to match as many entries as possible based on alternative or slightly different dam or country names if an element such as height or area was present in both databases grand entries were selected because of its perceived higher quality after excluding reservoirs with a reported natural origin river and coastal barrages and entries with missing production data our final database contained 2235 reservoirs with full data availability fig 1 these 2235 reservoirs cover a maximum surface area of 129 000 km2 50 of total grand database surface area of manmade reservoirs 2 2 evaporation estimation many methods exist to calculate evaporation to prevent bias toward any one method we estimated open water evaporation from the 2235 reservoirs as an ensemble mean of four different methods the ones provided by kohli and frenken 2015 jensen and haise 1963 hamon 1961 and a modified version of penman kohler et al 1955 harwell 2012 the kohli and frenken kf method is straightforward 4 e kf j 1 365 k c e t 0 where kc is a crop coefficient set to 1 for open water and et0 mm d 1 the daily fao reference evapotranspiration rate the jensen and haise jh method is an energy budget based method which has proven accurate under limited data availability rosenberry et al 2007 majidi et al 2015 5 e jh j 1 365 0 03523 r s 0 014 t a 0 37 where rs w m 2 is incoming solar radiation and ta f mean daily temperature if ta becomes lower than 26 5 f evaporation becomes negative in which case evaporation becomes zero the hamon h method calculates evapotranspiration based on the relation between maximum incoming energy and the moisture capacity of the air it assumes open water evaporation is equal to evapotranspiration we took the modified version of this method as used by the us army corps of engineers harwell 2012 6 e h j 1 365 13 97 n 12 2 s v d 100 where n is the maximum number of daylight hours and svd g m 3 the saturation vapor density the modified penman p method combines mass transfer and energy budget methods which expels the need for the surface water temperature to determine open water evaporation harwell 2012 majidi et al 2015 7 e p j 1 365 δ δ γ r n γ δ γ e a where δ is the gradient of saturated vapor pressure γ the psychrometric constant rn mm d 1 the effective net radiation and ra mm d 1 the evaporation from a class a pan climate data necessary to evaluate the four evaporation methods was taken from the era interim database dee et al 2011 with a spatial resolution of 5 5 for the period 1981 2010 we aggregated sub daily data to daily values because not all variables were available on a daily same time step for each variable we calculated average daily values over the period 1981 2010 to yield evaporation estimates for one climate averaged year evaporation was evaluated at the midpoint of each reservoir 2 3 economic value and attribution the wrd database states the purposes of a reservoir and provides production information on hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply and flood control storage if present for some reservoirs production information was conflicting with purpose data as a rule we recognized hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply and flood control storage as a purpose if production data was available even if the database did not explicitly list it as a purpose we excluded navigation as a reservoir purpose because only a few reservoirs are reported to serve this purpose besides no data are reported on the economic value of reservoirs for the specific purpose of navigation we converted and discounted all prices to represent 2014 equivalent us dollars using inflation correction factors and exchange rates from the world bank 2015 and williamson 2015 2 3 1 hydroelectricity generation the economic value of hydroelectricity generation us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the mean annual electricity generation gwh y 1 with the economic value of electricity in the country where the reservoir is located us gwh 1 for some reservoirs 984 in total wrd reports both mean annual electricity generation and production capacity for reservoirs with only a production capacity reported 359 reservoirs we assumed mean annual electricity generation as 34 of the production capacity this percentage is based on the ratio between mean and capacity production for reservoirs which have both metrics stated national electricity prices were taken from iea 2012 rcreee 2013 or eurostat 2015 or if not available in these based on prices found for comparable neighboring countries 2 3 2 irrigation water supply the economic value of irrigation water supply us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the irrigated area serviced by the reservoir as provided by wrd ha with the average economic value of agricultural land in the country where the reservoir is located us ha 1 y 1 the latter is a proxy for the value of crops that are actually being irrigated with water from the reservoir because the databases are limited to reporting general servicing area for agricultural purposes the average economic value of agricultural land is estimated per country by dividing the value of agricultural production of all crops in the country us y 1 by the production area of all crops in the country ha agricultural value and harvested area per crop per country were taken from faostat 2015 for the year 2013 2 3 3 flood control storage the economic value of flood control storage us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the available flood storage volume as provided by wrd m3 with the economic value of flood storage us m 3 y 1 the only study plainly stating economic value of flood storage to our knowledge is by zhao and liu 2015 who found a value of 0 16 us m 3 y 1 for the three gorges reservoir in china the us army corps of engineers usace 2016 reports on prevented flood damage since the year of completion for several of its projects most noticeably 24 reservoirs in the north east us translated to mean annual values their study yielded estimates of 0 002 to 0 58 us m 3 y 1 with an average of 0 117 us m 3 y 1 which is similar to the aforementioned estimate by zhao and liu 2015 we used 0 117 us m 3 y 1 as a proxy for all reservoirs globally that have flood control as a stated purpose 2 3 4 residential and industrial water supply the economic value of residential and industrial water supply from reservoirs us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the estimated yearly abstracted volume m3 y 1 with the economic value of residential water in the country where the reservoir is located us m 3 however estimates of yearly abstracted volumes are not readily available based on data from 132 reservoirs in the united states iwr 2012 and 30 in australia knook 2016 the ratio between abstracted volume over reservoir volume was determined these ratios showed a large variation mainly because of size of the reservoir and climate small reservoirs in humid climates typically have higher ratios than large ones in arid regions based on the set of 162 reservoirs we drew two rating curves one for humid and one for semi arid regions depending on the climate zone of individual reservoirs either curve prescribes the estimated abstracted volume note that in this procedure other factors that might influence abstracted volumes are not considered national water prices were taken from danilenko et al 2014 iwa 2012 and oecd 2010 or if not available based on prices found for comparable neighboring countries 2 3 5 recreation the economic value of recreation us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the economic value of recreation us ha 1 y 1 with the reservoir surface area ha although expressing values of recreation in terms of surface area is rare costanza et al 1997 gave a value of 368 us ha 1 in 2014 net present value for lack of better estimates we applied this value to all reservoirs with recreation as stated purpose 2 3 6 commercial fishing the economic value of recreation us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the average economic value of wild caught freshwater fish us kg 1 with the reservoir surface area ha and the fishing yield kg ha 1 y 1 economic values were obtained from the world fish center 2008 mitchell et al 2012 and fao 2015 fishing yields depend on multiple factors such as water body volume food supply and climate marmulla 2001 but country average yields were the best metric we could find average national fishing yields were taken from marmulla 2001 van zwieten et al 2011 and mitchell et al 2012 or if not available based on prices found for comparable neighboring countries for lack of reliable data we excluded aquaculture in our analysis 3 results 3 1 the water footprint related to artificial reservoirs the global water footprint of evaporation from the 2235 reservoirs in this study averaged over the four estimation methods is 65 7 109 m3 y 1 fig 2 shows the evaporation distribution for each method over all reservoirs table 1 gives the wfevap aggregated to the continent level we grouped the reservoirs by climate class following the köppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 in fig 3 the different methods vary in their resulting estimates of evaporation typically the straightforward kohli and frenken method gives the highest evaporation estimates especially in warm arid climates the hamon method yields the lowest estimates which was anticipated by previous studies by harwell 2012 and majidi et al 2015 the jensen haise method estimates higher evaporation rates in equatorial climates compared to other methods possibly because the jensen haise method was originally developed for more arid regions jensen and haise 1963 given that this study included only those reservoirs for which all data were available the total global water footprint of reservoirs must be substantially higher than the number presented here the global water footprint of reservoir construction for the 2235 reservoirs in this study is 39 6 106 m3 y 1 table 1 this number represents 0 05 of wfevap and thus hardly contributes to the total yearly wf of reservoirs each reservoir individually shows such insignificant wfcontr share of the total as well note however that wfconstr is only trifling because we discounted it over the dam s lifespan water consumption could be significant still during the period of actual dam construction 3 2 allocation of wfres to purposes based on economic value the total economic value of the reservoirs in this study spawned by hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply flood control domestic and industrial water supply recreation and fishing is us 265 109 in 2014 dollars table 2 shows the total economic value and allocation coefficients for each continent hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply and residential and industrial water supply account for the largest part of reservoirs economic value these are also the most common reservoir purposes with the water footprint and allocation coefficients of each reservoir we calculated the wf per purpose per reservoir table 3 summarizes the results at the continental level the global water footprint study by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 which ignored water losses from reservoirs by evaporation estimated the blue water footprint of crop production at 899 109 m3 y 1 and the blue water footprint of industrial and domestic water supply at 80 109 m3 y 1 on average over the period 1996 2005 to be complete the evaporation from reservoirs assigned to irrigation water supply 4 45 109 m3 y 1 must be added to the wf of crop production likewise the wf of reservoirs assigned to residential and industrial water supply 6 47 109 m3 y 1 and hydroelectricity generation 48 4 109 m3 y 1 must be added to the wf of industrial and domestic supply if we do so the global blue wf of crop production is roughly 0 5 higher than estimated by hoekstra and mekonnen and the global blue wf of industrial and domestic water supply even 69 higher note that these are still conservative estimates since our study includes only 30 of the world s reservoir area table 4 shows the global average wf per unit of production for each purpose using the lowest the highest and the average evaporation estimate of the four evaluated evaporation methods note that results are not comparable among purposes because the unit of production or the unit interpretation differ for example for flood control a cubic meter refers to a volume stored while for residential and industrial water supply it refers to a volume delivered the right hand side of table 4 shows that the wf per unit of production not only differs for each evaporation method but also from reservoir to reservoir the 66 range around the median that is 66 of the reservoirs in this study with the stated purpose have a wf per unit of production between the reported high and low value demonstrates the large variability found among reservoirs this variability is mainly owing to reservoir surface size in relation to each purpose s production size rather than to climate cf liu et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 moreover variation in reservoir surface area itself induced by seasonality or reservoir regulation leads to uncertainty around our estimates table 5 shows the uncertainty associated with the global total wf and the global average wf of hydroelectricity the purposes become mutually comparable if we consider the wf per dollar of economic output m3 us 1 or its reverse the economic water productivity us m 3 table 6 shows the wf per dollar production based on wfs per purpose averaged over the four evaporation methods the wf per dollar of economic output is relatively low high productivity for residential and industrial water supply and irrigation water supply and relatively high low productivity for recreation except for recreation all purposes yield at least several dollars in revenue for each cubic meter of water evaporated zooming in to the country level we find that brazil has the largest total wf related to reservoirs followed by russia and egypt fig 4 this is a different list than that of countries with the highest installed reservoir area which is headed by russia brazil and china this difference can be explained by the climatic conditions which favor high evaporation in these high wf countries for some countries our database included only one reservoir which usually is a very large reservoir that experiences high evaporation rates examples are lake nasser in egypt lake volta in ghana and the brokopondo reservoir in suriname although there are 71 reservoirs included in zimbabwe the total wf of reservoirs there largely results from the kariba reservoir results per reservoir and per country area available in the supplementary materials 3 3 the water footprint of reservoirs in the context of water scarcity the largest part 57 of the wf of reservoirs is located in river basins with a low water scarcity level fig 5 a the other part is located in basins facing 1 3 months 29 4 6 months 7 or 7 11 months 5 of moderate to severe water scarcity a year moderate to severe water scarcity here means that more water is consumed than sustainably available that is environmental flow requirements are violated hoekstra et al 2012 about 1 of the wf of reservoirs lies in basins with year round moderate to severe water scarcity we further find that in river basins with low water scarcity throughout the year hydroelectricity generation constitutes the largest part of wfres the relative contribution of hydroelectricity generation to the total decreases with increasing water scarcity levels fig 5b f in river basins with more than 7 months of moderate to severe water scarcity residential and industrial water supply are the primary reservoir purposes this finding confirms a previous assessment by bakken et al 2015 who found few reservoirs used for hydroelectricity generation are located in water scarce areas 4 discussion we have chosen four different evaporation methods to calculate wfevap out of a host of other available approaches we anticipated these methods would vary as indeed they did so we calculated an ensemble mean however ambiguity remains on what method s to choose to assess open water evaporation in addition adding effects such as thermal heat storage which was disregarded in this study both complicates and improves evaporation estimations finch 2001 majidi et al 2015 it is worth noticing that the simple kohli and frenken method which is often used to calculate open water evaporation turned out to be the most deviant method beside methodological considerations resulting evaporation fluxes depend to a large extent on the shape and surface area of the reservoir as is shown in table 5 although we touched on the uncertainty associated with reservoir area variations adding time series on fluctuating reservoir areas would reduce uncertainty and allow for more detailed time dependent wf estimations the difficulty to determine surface area or any dam or reservoir parameter for that matter became clear when we combined the icold and grand databases incompleteness and differing definitions naming or surveying methods between the two inevitably propagated to our resulting reservoir database especially the lack of data on abstractions for domestic and industrial water supply took away from icold s usefulness moreover data availability of most variables needed to estimate economic value of reservoirs was low especially national values of recreation and of fishing yields and prices were often approximated and data on volumes abstracted for industrial and residential supply should be considered with caution the estimated global wf of reservoirs is based on a selected set of reservoirs for which enough data was available this set represents a combined surface area of 129 000 km2 50 of full grand database surface area of manmade reservoirs or 30 if all grand reservoirs are included shiklomanov and rodda 2003 estimated an installed reservoir area of 500 000 km2 around the beginning of the 21st century which according to their estimate evaporated 208 109 m3 y 1 the total wfres of 66 109 m3 y 1 found in this study could prudently be extrapolated to account for the excluded reservoir surfaces a tentative estimate of global reservoir wf then is about 250 109 m3 y 1 this final figure corresponds to 25 of the total human blue water consumption 1025 109 m3 y 1 as estimated by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 we found the global average wf of hydroelectricity is 14 6 m3 gj 1 table 4 and varies highly among reservoirs gerbens leenes et al 2008 report 22 m3 gj 1 mekonnen et al 2015 15 1 m3 gj 1 scherer and pfister 2016 17 1 m3 gj 1 median or 38 9 m3 gj 1 global average and bakken et al 2017 give a range of wf of hydroelectricity determined via the gross approach of 1 5 65 m3 gj 1 despite the differences in methods and data used these values indicate that hydroelectricity is a water intensive form of energy compared to other energy sources cf mekonnen et al 2015 if we again extrapolate our findings by applying the average wf of hydroelectricity generation of 14 6 m3 gj 1 to the global hydroelectricity production of 3940 twh in 2015 world energy council 2016 we prudently estimate the global wf of hydroelectricity production is 207 109 m3 y 1 adding over 20 to the total global blue water footprint as estimated earlier by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 we confined the spatial system boundaries to the reservoir the influence of reservoirs on evaporation especially in cascaded systems extends beyond the reservoir to the rivers below because of a change in flow regime bakken et al 2013 depending on the system this regime change can lead to decreased downstream evaporation because of decreased flood duration and associated evaporation from flooded land or an increase in evaporation because of raised groundwater levels due to additional percolation and associated evaporation from groundwater although these processes and their importance differ at the individual reservoir level they may cancel out at the larger scale shiklomanov and rodda 2003 this study gives a first glimpse of how the beneficiary purposes of reservoirs share the burden of water consumption the reservoir and climate data are all taken from global databases with all accompanying restraints for individual reservoirs both those covered in this study and those to be developed in the future we recommend to redo this analysis using local data whenever possible 5 conclusion building a dam and reservoir can be a valuable measure to address a host of water related issues this study estimates the economic benefits from reservoir products and services is us 265 109 globally mainly because of value added by hydroelectricity generation residential water supply and industrial water supply we also show that these benefits come at a significant cost in terms of water loss the total blue water footprint of 2235 reservoirs included in this study related to both dam construction and evaporation losses from reservoir surfaces is 66 109 m3 y 1 water use studies dam development plans and water for energy scenarios seldom account for this reservoir water footprint paradoxically a reservoir may be an apt measure to increase water availability during a certain time of the year but only at the cost of reducing total water availability over the whole year since reservoirs typically serve multiple purposes the total wf of reservoirs must be assigned to those purposes rather than leaving them implicit we explicated quantitative wfs per reservoir purpose by attributing the total wf to purposes based on their estimated economic value for the first time and on a global scale from the reservoir purposes considered hydroelectricity generation constitutes the largest share of the total wf followed by residential and industrial water supply the global average wf of hydroelectricity is estimated at 14 6 m3 gj 1 which is in line with estimates by previous studies it demonstrates that hydroelectricity on average is a water intensive form of energy on the positive side economic water productivity us m 3 is high for all purposes except recreation for each reservoir purpose the wf per unit of production shows substantial variability around the global average one factor contributing to the spread is the choice of method to estimate open water evaporation another is climate because cold temperate climates give rise to low wfs and equatorial and arid climates to high wfs however the reservoir surface size in relation to the production size of each purpose contributes most to the variability we investigated the water scarcity levels of the basins in which reservoirs are located and found the majority 57 of reservoir related wfs is located in water abundant basins the remainder is located in basins with one or more months of moderate to severe water scarcity the primary reservoir purpose changes with changing water scarcity levels while hydroelectricity generation is the primary purpose in non scarce basins in scarcer areas residential and industrial water supply and irrigation water supply are the purposes for which the reservoir is mostly used because of growing freshwater demand increasing water scarcity levels worldwide and continuing dam developments water consumption from artificial reservoirs needs to be accounted for all value generating purposes of a reservoir share in this wf burden we therefore recommend to build on this methodology and apply it to future dam development and water for energy scenario studies in specific and to water use

871,for centuries humans have resorted to building dams to gain control over freshwater available for human consumption although dams and their reservoirs have made many important contributions to human development they receive negative attention as well because of the large amounts of water they can consume through evaporation we estimate the blue water footprint of the world s artificial reservoirs and attribute it to the purposes hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply residential and industrial water supply flood protection fishing and recreation based on their economic value we estimate that economic benefits from 2235 reservoirs included in this study amount to 265 109 us a year with residential and industrial water supply and hydroelectricity generation as major contributors the water footprint associated with these benefits is the sum of the water footprint of dam construction 1 contribution and evaporation from the reservoir s surface area and globally adds up to 66 109 m3 y 1 the largest share of this water footprint 57 is located in non water scarce basins and only 1 in year round scarce basins the primary purposes of a reservoir change with increasing water scarcity from mainly hydroelectricity generation in non scarce basins to residential and industrial water supply irrigation water supply and flood control in scarcer areas keywords water footprint reservoirs water consumption economic value of reservoirs reservoir purposes hydroelectricity 1 introduction increasing the limited availability of freshwater to meet ever growing and competing demands is on many policy agendas wef 2017 drivers for the growing concern include a growing world population increasing wealth a transition from fossil based to renewable energy sources and climate change un wwap 2015 for centuries humans have resorted to building dams to gain control over freshwater available for human consumption toward the middle of the 20th century construction intensified what started off mainly in the developed world was soon followed by developing countries in the 1970 80s when most suitable locations had been developed and most rivers regulated construction slowed down today new reservoirs are being built mainly for the purpose of hydroelectricity generation shiklomanov and rodda 2003 liu et al 2015 timpe and kaplan 2017 dams and their reservoirs have made an important contribution to human development in many ways such as storing using and diverting water for consumption irrigation cooling transportation construction mills power generation fishing and recreation derived benefits have been and continue to be considerable world commission on dams 2000 gernaat et al 2017 associated costs both in socio economic and ecological terms have been considerable as well pacca and horvath 2002 gleick 2003 latrubesse et al 2017 moreover since artificial reservoirs have become so prevalent in our modern world it is increasingly acknowledged that reservoirs are not mere in stream water users they can be large water consumers because of the water that evaporates from their surface this consumptive term adds to the pressure on regional water resources shiklomanov 2000 hoekstra 2013 liu et al 2015 vanham 2016 a previous influential study to humanity s water footprint wf however excluded the wf of reservoirs altogether hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 in addition despite an addendum acknowledging the importance of water consumption by reservoirs through evaporation aquastat does not list them as water consumers in national statistics fao 2016 about hydropower the international energy agency does not even mention the term evaporation in their recent world energy outlook 2016 iea 2016 by it they ignore one of the most important balance terms of water for energy studies that try to account for water consumption by reservoirs typically employ one of two methods the so called net approach and the gross approach bakken et al 2013 2016 the net approach reduces evaporation from the reservoir surface with evapotranspiration in the natural state before dam development e g shiklomanov and rodda 2003 grubert 2016 scherer and pfister 2016 and strachan et al 2016 the gross approach which most studies use takes total evaporation from the reservoir as measure of reservoir consumption e g torcellini et al 2003 pasqualetti and kelley 2008 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 and zhao and liu 2015 although scholars debate on which approach to use we postulate both approaches have their merit confusion arises because of misinterpretation of the intention for which one method is chosen over the other the net approach is suitable for analyzing changes in hydrology on a catchment scale while the gross approach is preferred for water footprint assessments where the aim is to show the total volume of water appropriated to certain purposes and that is therefore not available for another purpose hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra 2017 this study intents the latter following the global water footprint standard hoekstra et al 2011 the wf related to reservoirs must include all steps of the supply chain the total wf should afterwards be attributed to derived products and services based on their economic value a reservoir generally serves multiple purposes the most common of which are hydroelectricity generation supplying water for residential and industrial use supplying irrigation water regulating the flow of rivers to prevent flooding and enabling inland navigation icold 2011 reservoirs are rarely created for recreational and fishing purposes but after a dam is built these are important secondary purposes ward et al 1996 and therefore share in the wf of reservoirs previous studies attributed the total reservoir water footprint to purposes either partially or using simpler methods instead of using economic value one purpose takes all purposes receive an equal share or some prioritization is set up mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 bakken et al 2016 grubert 2016 scherer and pfister 2016 the aim of this study is to estimate the blue wf of the world s artificial reservoirs and attribute it to the purposes hydroelectricity generation residential and industrial water supply irrigation water supply flood protection fishing and recreation based on their economic value the blue wf refers to consumption which includes evaporation of blue water resources surface water and groundwater for each purpose the wf is expressed in terms of water consumption per unit that is m3 gj 1 for hydroelectricity generation m3 ha 1 for irrigation water supply and so on this unit wf is translated into water consumption per us dollar in m3 us 1 and its inverse economic water productivity in us m 3 productivities of hydroelectricity generation are compared with both productivities found in other studies and those of other types of electricity thereby feeding discussions on energy scenarios although water consumed by reservoirs is no longer available for downstream use the question is how worrisome this consumption is in water scarce river basins the opportunity cost of water consumption may be high and a large wf may worsen scarcity whereas in more water rich basins impact may be small we therefore close with an investigation into the water scarcity levels in all river basins with reservoirs 2 method and data the blue water footprint related to an artificial or man made reservoir wfres m3 y 1 includes both an operational and a supply chain part it thus comprises the wf related to evaporation from the reservoir surface wfevap m3 y 1 and the wf related to reservoir construction wfconstr m3 y 1 1 wf res wf evap wf constr wfevap is determined by means of the gross consumption approach 2 wf evap 10 e a κ where e mm y 1 is the depth of water that evaporates yearly from the reservoir surface a ha the maximum reservoir area and κ an area correction factor set to 0 5625 to correct for the fact that the reservoir surface at average filling conditions is smaller than the maximum area reported in the databases this factor is derived from a volume area relation that is based on the assumption that a reservoir is on average half filled during the year kohli and frenken 2015 and is trapezoid shaped multiplication by 10 adjusts the units since reservoir areas are considered constant in the databases see section 2 1 and also κ is kept constant we fail to capture anomalies in surface areas and hence its effect on wfs we prudently quantified the resulting uncertainty range for two indicators namely the global total wf and global average wf of hydroelectricity generation for these two indicators we calculated two extreme scenarios one in which we set κ to 0 2 indicating all reservoirs evaporate from a surface area that roughly corresponds to the dead storage filling resulting in the smallest possible wfevap and one in which we set κ to 1 indicating all reservoirs evaporate from their maximum surface area yielding the largest possible wfevap the resulting range should be interpreted as a preliminary estimate of uncertainty associated with fluctuating reservoir areas wfconstr depends mainly on the construction material of the dam earth and rock fill dams are usually constructed with materials found near the dam site whereas gravity buttress and arc dams are mostly made of reinforced concrete chen 2015 novak et al 2007 for earth and rock fill dams we accounted only for water consumption related to the energy used to excavate and transport the rock or earth we took average fuel use from ahn et al 2009 and applied to it the wf of diesel 1058 m3 mj 1 from gerbens leenes et al 2008 under the assumption that the material on average is sourced 20 km from the construction site for gravity arc and buttress dams we estimated only the wf of reinforced concrete using the wf of cement and unalloyed steel from gerbens leenes et al 2018 and assuming a mixture of 1 steel 29 cement and 70 aggregates we used the wf for rock and earth as describe above also for aggregates water consumption related to clearing the construction site equipment and installations either lack reliable data or were assumed negligible we therefore did not account for these terms finally the annual wfconstr is calculated by dividing the water footprint of construction by the assumed typical lifespan of a dam of 100 years wfres is assigned to the different reservoir purposes i wfi m3 per unit of production through an allocation coefficient ηi that is based on the economic value v us of each purpose i 3 wf i η i wf res with η i v i v i lastly we placed wfres in the context of local water scarcity we used monthly water scarcity levels per river basin representative of and averaged over the period 1996 2005 as provided by hoekstra et al 2012 to examine the scarcity level of the basin in which the reservoir is located a basin is considered water scarce if the total blue wf of all human activities combined exceeds water availability runoff minus environmental flow requirements in any given month because the study by hoekstra et al 2012 does not cover all basins this scarcity analysis includes 71 of reservoirs in this study that are located in basins with data available the remaining 29 were excluded 2 1 reservoir data dam and reservoir data are obtained by combining two databases the world register of dams wrd from the international commission on large dams icold 2011 and the global dams and reservoirs database grand by lehner et al 2011 wrd contains over 37 000 reservoirs including information on reservoir purpose depth and area dam height type and body volume location latitude longitude and production data for hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply and other benefits grand contains information on 6854 reservoirs including reservoir purpose average depth and maximum area dam height and elevation and comes with a georeferenced vector map of reservoir shaped polygons neither database reports temporal variations either intra or inter annual in any dam or reservoir variable wrd and grand are combined since neither one is complete nor contains all information required we linked the two databases based on the name and country of each dam also we put in a manual effort to match as many entries as possible based on alternative or slightly different dam or country names if an element such as height or area was present in both databases grand entries were selected because of its perceived higher quality after excluding reservoirs with a reported natural origin river and coastal barrages and entries with missing production data our final database contained 2235 reservoirs with full data availability fig 1 these 2235 reservoirs cover a maximum surface area of 129 000 km2 50 of total grand database surface area of manmade reservoirs 2 2 evaporation estimation many methods exist to calculate evaporation to prevent bias toward any one method we estimated open water evaporation from the 2235 reservoirs as an ensemble mean of four different methods the ones provided by kohli and frenken 2015 jensen and haise 1963 hamon 1961 and a modified version of penman kohler et al 1955 harwell 2012 the kohli and frenken kf method is straightforward 4 e kf j 1 365 k c e t 0 where kc is a crop coefficient set to 1 for open water and et0 mm d 1 the daily fao reference evapotranspiration rate the jensen and haise jh method is an energy budget based method which has proven accurate under limited data availability rosenberry et al 2007 majidi et al 2015 5 e jh j 1 365 0 03523 r s 0 014 t a 0 37 where rs w m 2 is incoming solar radiation and ta f mean daily temperature if ta becomes lower than 26 5 f evaporation becomes negative in which case evaporation becomes zero the hamon h method calculates evapotranspiration based on the relation between maximum incoming energy and the moisture capacity of the air it assumes open water evaporation is equal to evapotranspiration we took the modified version of this method as used by the us army corps of engineers harwell 2012 6 e h j 1 365 13 97 n 12 2 s v d 100 where n is the maximum number of daylight hours and svd g m 3 the saturation vapor density the modified penman p method combines mass transfer and energy budget methods which expels the need for the surface water temperature to determine open water evaporation harwell 2012 majidi et al 2015 7 e p j 1 365 δ δ γ r n γ δ γ e a where δ is the gradient of saturated vapor pressure γ the psychrometric constant rn mm d 1 the effective net radiation and ra mm d 1 the evaporation from a class a pan climate data necessary to evaluate the four evaporation methods was taken from the era interim database dee et al 2011 with a spatial resolution of 5 5 for the period 1981 2010 we aggregated sub daily data to daily values because not all variables were available on a daily same time step for each variable we calculated average daily values over the period 1981 2010 to yield evaporation estimates for one climate averaged year evaporation was evaluated at the midpoint of each reservoir 2 3 economic value and attribution the wrd database states the purposes of a reservoir and provides production information on hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply and flood control storage if present for some reservoirs production information was conflicting with purpose data as a rule we recognized hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply and flood control storage as a purpose if production data was available even if the database did not explicitly list it as a purpose we excluded navigation as a reservoir purpose because only a few reservoirs are reported to serve this purpose besides no data are reported on the economic value of reservoirs for the specific purpose of navigation we converted and discounted all prices to represent 2014 equivalent us dollars using inflation correction factors and exchange rates from the world bank 2015 and williamson 2015 2 3 1 hydroelectricity generation the economic value of hydroelectricity generation us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the mean annual electricity generation gwh y 1 with the economic value of electricity in the country where the reservoir is located us gwh 1 for some reservoirs 984 in total wrd reports both mean annual electricity generation and production capacity for reservoirs with only a production capacity reported 359 reservoirs we assumed mean annual electricity generation as 34 of the production capacity this percentage is based on the ratio between mean and capacity production for reservoirs which have both metrics stated national electricity prices were taken from iea 2012 rcreee 2013 or eurostat 2015 or if not available in these based on prices found for comparable neighboring countries 2 3 2 irrigation water supply the economic value of irrigation water supply us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the irrigated area serviced by the reservoir as provided by wrd ha with the average economic value of agricultural land in the country where the reservoir is located us ha 1 y 1 the latter is a proxy for the value of crops that are actually being irrigated with water from the reservoir because the databases are limited to reporting general servicing area for agricultural purposes the average economic value of agricultural land is estimated per country by dividing the value of agricultural production of all crops in the country us y 1 by the production area of all crops in the country ha agricultural value and harvested area per crop per country were taken from faostat 2015 for the year 2013 2 3 3 flood control storage the economic value of flood control storage us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the available flood storage volume as provided by wrd m3 with the economic value of flood storage us m 3 y 1 the only study plainly stating economic value of flood storage to our knowledge is by zhao and liu 2015 who found a value of 0 16 us m 3 y 1 for the three gorges reservoir in china the us army corps of engineers usace 2016 reports on prevented flood damage since the year of completion for several of its projects most noticeably 24 reservoirs in the north east us translated to mean annual values their study yielded estimates of 0 002 to 0 58 us m 3 y 1 with an average of 0 117 us m 3 y 1 which is similar to the aforementioned estimate by zhao and liu 2015 we used 0 117 us m 3 y 1 as a proxy for all reservoirs globally that have flood control as a stated purpose 2 3 4 residential and industrial water supply the economic value of residential and industrial water supply from reservoirs us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the estimated yearly abstracted volume m3 y 1 with the economic value of residential water in the country where the reservoir is located us m 3 however estimates of yearly abstracted volumes are not readily available based on data from 132 reservoirs in the united states iwr 2012 and 30 in australia knook 2016 the ratio between abstracted volume over reservoir volume was determined these ratios showed a large variation mainly because of size of the reservoir and climate small reservoirs in humid climates typically have higher ratios than large ones in arid regions based on the set of 162 reservoirs we drew two rating curves one for humid and one for semi arid regions depending on the climate zone of individual reservoirs either curve prescribes the estimated abstracted volume note that in this procedure other factors that might influence abstracted volumes are not considered national water prices were taken from danilenko et al 2014 iwa 2012 and oecd 2010 or if not available based on prices found for comparable neighboring countries 2 3 5 recreation the economic value of recreation us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the economic value of recreation us ha 1 y 1 with the reservoir surface area ha although expressing values of recreation in terms of surface area is rare costanza et al 1997 gave a value of 368 us ha 1 in 2014 net present value for lack of better estimates we applied this value to all reservoirs with recreation as stated purpose 2 3 6 commercial fishing the economic value of recreation us y 1 is calculated by multiplying the average economic value of wild caught freshwater fish us kg 1 with the reservoir surface area ha and the fishing yield kg ha 1 y 1 economic values were obtained from the world fish center 2008 mitchell et al 2012 and fao 2015 fishing yields depend on multiple factors such as water body volume food supply and climate marmulla 2001 but country average yields were the best metric we could find average national fishing yields were taken from marmulla 2001 van zwieten et al 2011 and mitchell et al 2012 or if not available based on prices found for comparable neighboring countries for lack of reliable data we excluded aquaculture in our analysis 3 results 3 1 the water footprint related to artificial reservoirs the global water footprint of evaporation from the 2235 reservoirs in this study averaged over the four estimation methods is 65 7 109 m3 y 1 fig 2 shows the evaporation distribution for each method over all reservoirs table 1 gives the wfevap aggregated to the continent level we grouped the reservoirs by climate class following the köppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 in fig 3 the different methods vary in their resulting estimates of evaporation typically the straightforward kohli and frenken method gives the highest evaporation estimates especially in warm arid climates the hamon method yields the lowest estimates which was anticipated by previous studies by harwell 2012 and majidi et al 2015 the jensen haise method estimates higher evaporation rates in equatorial climates compared to other methods possibly because the jensen haise method was originally developed for more arid regions jensen and haise 1963 given that this study included only those reservoirs for which all data were available the total global water footprint of reservoirs must be substantially higher than the number presented here the global water footprint of reservoir construction for the 2235 reservoirs in this study is 39 6 106 m3 y 1 table 1 this number represents 0 05 of wfevap and thus hardly contributes to the total yearly wf of reservoirs each reservoir individually shows such insignificant wfcontr share of the total as well note however that wfconstr is only trifling because we discounted it over the dam s lifespan water consumption could be significant still during the period of actual dam construction 3 2 allocation of wfres to purposes based on economic value the total economic value of the reservoirs in this study spawned by hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply flood control domestic and industrial water supply recreation and fishing is us 265 109 in 2014 dollars table 2 shows the total economic value and allocation coefficients for each continent hydroelectricity generation irrigation water supply and residential and industrial water supply account for the largest part of reservoirs economic value these are also the most common reservoir purposes with the water footprint and allocation coefficients of each reservoir we calculated the wf per purpose per reservoir table 3 summarizes the results at the continental level the global water footprint study by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 which ignored water losses from reservoirs by evaporation estimated the blue water footprint of crop production at 899 109 m3 y 1 and the blue water footprint of industrial and domestic water supply at 80 109 m3 y 1 on average over the period 1996 2005 to be complete the evaporation from reservoirs assigned to irrigation water supply 4 45 109 m3 y 1 must be added to the wf of crop production likewise the wf of reservoirs assigned to residential and industrial water supply 6 47 109 m3 y 1 and hydroelectricity generation 48 4 109 m3 y 1 must be added to the wf of industrial and domestic supply if we do so the global blue wf of crop production is roughly 0 5 higher than estimated by hoekstra and mekonnen and the global blue wf of industrial and domestic water supply even 69 higher note that these are still conservative estimates since our study includes only 30 of the world s reservoir area table 4 shows the global average wf per unit of production for each purpose using the lowest the highest and the average evaporation estimate of the four evaluated evaporation methods note that results are not comparable among purposes because the unit of production or the unit interpretation differ for example for flood control a cubic meter refers to a volume stored while for residential and industrial water supply it refers to a volume delivered the right hand side of table 4 shows that the wf per unit of production not only differs for each evaporation method but also from reservoir to reservoir the 66 range around the median that is 66 of the reservoirs in this study with the stated purpose have a wf per unit of production between the reported high and low value demonstrates the large variability found among reservoirs this variability is mainly owing to reservoir surface size in relation to each purpose s production size rather than to climate cf liu et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 moreover variation in reservoir surface area itself induced by seasonality or reservoir regulation leads to uncertainty around our estimates table 5 shows the uncertainty associated with the global total wf and the global average wf of hydroelectricity the purposes become mutually comparable if we consider the wf per dollar of economic output m3 us 1 or its reverse the economic water productivity us m 3 table 6 shows the wf per dollar production based on wfs per purpose averaged over the four evaporation methods the wf per dollar of economic output is relatively low high productivity for residential and industrial water supply and irrigation water supply and relatively high low productivity for recreation except for recreation all purposes yield at least several dollars in revenue for each cubic meter of water evaporated zooming in to the country level we find that brazil has the largest total wf related to reservoirs followed by russia and egypt fig 4 this is a different list than that of countries with the highest installed reservoir area which is headed by russia brazil and china this difference can be explained by the climatic conditions which favor high evaporation in these high wf countries for some countries our database included only one reservoir which usually is a very large reservoir that experiences high evaporation rates examples are lake nasser in egypt lake volta in ghana and the brokopondo reservoir in suriname although there are 71 reservoirs included in zimbabwe the total wf of reservoirs there largely results from the kariba reservoir results per reservoir and per country area available in the supplementary materials 3 3 the water footprint of reservoirs in the context of water scarcity the largest part 57 of the wf of reservoirs is located in river basins with a low water scarcity level fig 5 a the other part is located in basins facing 1 3 months 29 4 6 months 7 or 7 11 months 5 of moderate to severe water scarcity a year moderate to severe water scarcity here means that more water is consumed than sustainably available that is environmental flow requirements are violated hoekstra et al 2012 about 1 of the wf of reservoirs lies in basins with year round moderate to severe water scarcity we further find that in river basins with low water scarcity throughout the year hydroelectricity generation constitutes the largest part of wfres the relative contribution of hydroelectricity generation to the total decreases with increasing water scarcity levels fig 5b f in river basins with more than 7 months of moderate to severe water scarcity residential and industrial water supply are the primary reservoir purposes this finding confirms a previous assessment by bakken et al 2015 who found few reservoirs used for hydroelectricity generation are located in water scarce areas 4 discussion we have chosen four different evaporation methods to calculate wfevap out of a host of other available approaches we anticipated these methods would vary as indeed they did so we calculated an ensemble mean however ambiguity remains on what method s to choose to assess open water evaporation in addition adding effects such as thermal heat storage which was disregarded in this study both complicates and improves evaporation estimations finch 2001 majidi et al 2015 it is worth noticing that the simple kohli and frenken method which is often used to calculate open water evaporation turned out to be the most deviant method beside methodological considerations resulting evaporation fluxes depend to a large extent on the shape and surface area of the reservoir as is shown in table 5 although we touched on the uncertainty associated with reservoir area variations adding time series on fluctuating reservoir areas would reduce uncertainty and allow for more detailed time dependent wf estimations the difficulty to determine surface area or any dam or reservoir parameter for that matter became clear when we combined the icold and grand databases incompleteness and differing definitions naming or surveying methods between the two inevitably propagated to our resulting reservoir database especially the lack of data on abstractions for domestic and industrial water supply took away from icold s usefulness moreover data availability of most variables needed to estimate economic value of reservoirs was low especially national values of recreation and of fishing yields and prices were often approximated and data on volumes abstracted for industrial and residential supply should be considered with caution the estimated global wf of reservoirs is based on a selected set of reservoirs for which enough data was available this set represents a combined surface area of 129 000 km2 50 of full grand database surface area of manmade reservoirs or 30 if all grand reservoirs are included shiklomanov and rodda 2003 estimated an installed reservoir area of 500 000 km2 around the beginning of the 21st century which according to their estimate evaporated 208 109 m3 y 1 the total wfres of 66 109 m3 y 1 found in this study could prudently be extrapolated to account for the excluded reservoir surfaces a tentative estimate of global reservoir wf then is about 250 109 m3 y 1 this final figure corresponds to 25 of the total human blue water consumption 1025 109 m3 y 1 as estimated by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 we found the global average wf of hydroelectricity is 14 6 m3 gj 1 table 4 and varies highly among reservoirs gerbens leenes et al 2008 report 22 m3 gj 1 mekonnen et al 2015 15 1 m3 gj 1 scherer and pfister 2016 17 1 m3 gj 1 median or 38 9 m3 gj 1 global average and bakken et al 2017 give a range of wf of hydroelectricity determined via the gross approach of 1 5 65 m3 gj 1 despite the differences in methods and data used these values indicate that hydroelectricity is a water intensive form of energy compared to other energy sources cf mekonnen et al 2015 if we again extrapolate our findings by applying the average wf of hydroelectricity generation of 14 6 m3 gj 1 to the global hydroelectricity production of 3940 twh in 2015 world energy council 2016 we prudently estimate the global wf of hydroelectricity production is 207 109 m3 y 1 adding over 20 to the total global blue water footprint as estimated earlier by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 we confined the spatial system boundaries to the reservoir the influence of reservoirs on evaporation especially in cascaded systems extends beyond the reservoir to the rivers below because of a change in flow regime bakken et al 2013 depending on the system this regime change can lead to decreased downstream evaporation because of decreased flood duration and associated evaporation from flooded land or an increase in evaporation because of raised groundwater levels due to additional percolation and associated evaporation from groundwater although these processes and their importance differ at the individual reservoir level they may cancel out at the larger scale shiklomanov and rodda 2003 this study gives a first glimpse of how the beneficiary purposes of reservoirs share the burden of water consumption the reservoir and climate data are all taken from global databases with all accompanying restraints for individual reservoirs both those covered in this study and those to be developed in the future we recommend to redo this analysis using local data whenever possible 5 conclusion building a dam and reservoir can be a valuable measure to address a host of water related issues this study estimates the economic benefits from reservoir products and services is us 265 109 globally mainly because of value added by hydroelectricity generation residential water supply and industrial water supply we also show that these benefits come at a significant cost in terms of water loss the total blue water footprint of 2235 reservoirs included in this study related to both dam construction and evaporation losses from reservoir surfaces is 66 109 m3 y 1 water use studies dam development plans and water for energy scenarios seldom account for this reservoir water footprint paradoxically a reservoir may be an apt measure to increase water availability during a certain time of the year but only at the cost of reducing total water availability over the whole year since reservoirs typically serve multiple purposes the total wf of reservoirs must be assigned to those purposes rather than leaving them implicit we explicated quantitative wfs per reservoir purpose by attributing the total wf to purposes based on their estimated economic value for the first time and on a global scale from the reservoir purposes considered hydroelectricity generation constitutes the largest share of the total wf followed by residential and industrial water supply the global average wf of hydroelectricity is estimated at 14 6 m3 gj 1 which is in line with estimates by previous studies it demonstrates that hydroelectricity on average is a water intensive form of energy on the positive side economic water productivity us m 3 is high for all purposes except recreation for each reservoir purpose the wf per unit of production shows substantial variability around the global average one factor contributing to the spread is the choice of method to estimate open water evaporation another is climate because cold temperate climates give rise to low wfs and equatorial and arid climates to high wfs however the reservoir surface size in relation to the production size of each purpose contributes most to the variability we investigated the water scarcity levels of the basins in which reservoirs are located and found the majority 57 of reservoir related wfs is located in water abundant basins the remainder is located in basins with one or more months of moderate to severe water scarcity the primary reservoir purpose changes with changing water scarcity levels while hydroelectricity generation is the primary purpose in non scarce basins in scarcer areas residential and industrial water supply and irrigation water supply are the purposes for which the reservoir is mostly used because of growing freshwater demand increasing water scarcity levels worldwide and continuing dam developments water consumption from artificial reservoirs needs to be accounted for all value generating purposes of a reservoir share in this wf burden we therefore recommend to build on this methodology and apply it to future dam development and water for energy scenario studies in specific and to water use

872,there is now widespread awareness of the impact of anthropogenic influences on extreme floods and droughts and thus an increasing need for methods to account for such influences when estimating a frequency distribution we introduce a parsimonious approach to nonstationary flood frequency analysis nffa based on a bivariate regression equation which describes the relationship between annual maximum floods x and an exogenous variable which may explain the nonstationary behavior of x the conditional mean variance and skewness of both x and y ln x are derived and combined with numerous common probability distributions including the lognormal generalized extreme value and log pearson type iii models resulting in a very simple and general approach to nffa our approach offers several advantages over existing approaches including parsimony ease of use graphical display prediction intervals and opportunities for uncertainty analysis we introduce nonstationary probability plots and

and wallis 2005 and review articles greis 1983 bobée and rasmussen 1995 castellarin et al 2012 critical to nearly all traditional approaches to ffa summarized above is the assumption of stationarity loosely defined as the conditions under which key summary statistics of streamflows such as their moments or l moments do not systematically change with time ever since the seminal work by hurst 1957 hydrologists have been keenly aware of the complex behavior of streamflow and its relationships with climatic and other watershed conditions over the ensuing years numerous complex statistical representations were introduced in an effort to reproduce what became known as the hurst phenomenon see o connell et al 2016 more recently interest in the complexity of streamflow dynamics has grown exponentially due to improvements in our understanding of the impacts of numerous physical and social processes on streamflow including increasing urban populations causing major stresses to landscapes as well as water infrastructures and water availability e g vörösmarty et al 2000 global warming due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and a better understanding of the effects of both atmospheric oceanic processes and anthropogenic factors on the hydrological cycle e g ipcc 2013 this increased understanding awareness and interest has led to a tremendous increase in research associated with the detection attribution and prediction of hydrological processes such as the new scientific decadal 2013 2022 initiative of iahs entitled panta rhei everything flows which is dedicated to research activities on change in hydrology and society montanari et al 2013 as evidenced from recent review articles and special journal issues there are now myriad approaches under development for nonstationary flood frequency analysis nffa e g petrow and merz 2009 kiang et al 2011 salas et al 2012 madsen et al 2014 hall et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2017 for a general review of the literature on nffa methods we refer the reader to the review articles cited above after our introductory remarks we describe how our particular approach to nffa differs from previous efforts in spite of the tremendous increase in attention given to nffa there is still no consensus on a methodology for performing nffa in fact there is not even consensus on the need for nffa as described below nevertheless there is some effort by government agencies to update flood protection design guidelines to account for nonstationarity stedinger and griffis 2011 madsen et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2014 yet the proposed methods are by no means widely accepted nor tested despite tremendous interest in the development of methods of nffa considerable debate continues over whether stationary or nonstationary methods should be employed in practice see serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 and recent discussion by salas et al 2017 thus despite the recent interest in the development of nffa approaches milly et al 2008 milly et al 2015 considerable controversy remains as evidenced in the many papers which properly question the need for nonstationary approaches e g cohn and lins 2005 villarini et al 2009a villarini et al 2011 lins and cohn 2011 hirsch and ryberg 2012 matalas 2012 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 for example villarini et al 2011 and villarini et al 2009a summarize numerous studies including their own analyzes which did not provide statistical evidence of nonstationarity in flood series except where major watershed changes occurred even if there were acceptance on an approach to nffa many open questions remain concerning the selection of an appropriate design event under such conditions e g stedinger and griffis 2011 rootzén and katz 2013 obeysekera and salas 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 read and vogel 2015 salas et al 2017 the lack of consensus results in part from the tremendous uncertainty associated with our ability to detect attribute and model past trends and the even greater uncertainty associated with our ability to predict future trends in hydrological processes the question of whether to perform a stationary or nonstationary flood frequency analysis remains an open question and probably should remain so as evidenced from the findings of o brien and burn 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and luke et al 2017 in a careful comparison of the precision uncertainty associated with various estimates of design flood events using both stationary and nonstationary methods luke et al 2017 found that stationary methods were nearly always preferred over nonstationary approaches vogel et al 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 and serinaldi and kilsby 2015 document how one can quantify the various factors which give rise to uncertainty in our ability to detect and model trends in hydrologic series obeysekera and salas 2014 o brien and burn 2014 and serinaldi and kilsby 2015 describe approaches to derive confidence intervals for design events under nonstationary conditions yet even in situations in which there is physical knowledge of the processes causing the hydrologic nonstationarity there is always considerable additional uncertainty associated with nffa so that risk based approaches to design event selection are paramount risk based decision approaches are now well established for selection of a design event based on the expected benefits and damages avoided versus the cost of the investment required national research council 2000 and such approaches are now standard practice by u s federal agencies see brekke et al 2009 stakhiv 2011 importantly given the additional uncertainty associated with nffa it is even more important to employ risk based approaches which consider both the possibility of a stationary and a nonstationary future rosner et al 2014 as well as a wide range of possible forms of future nonstationarity spence and brown 2016 the need for risk based approaches to the selection of a design event cannot be overemphasized because such approaches enable an accounting of most relevant sources of uncertainty e g stedinger and crainiceanu 2001 brekke et al 2009 sivapalan and samuel 2009 stakhiv 2011 rosner et al 2014 spence and brown 2016 the literature on approaches to nffa is growing rapidly as evidenced by the numerous recent reviews on the subject khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 madsen et al 2014 ehret et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2017 such methods may be extremely important in urbanizing watersheds because as shown by vogel et al 2011 the annual maximum flood amf series associated with rivers in urbanized or urbanizing areas of the u s exhibited significant increases in magnitude over the past century a finding consistent with those of others konrad 2003 moglen and shivers 2006 villarini et al 2009b prosdocimi et al 2015 in spite of the fact that variations in stormwater infrastructure and rainfall climatology can lead to a wide spectrum of changes in urban watersheds smith et al 2013 olsen et al 1999 found significant increases in flood magnitudes in tributaries and the main stem of the northern portions of the upper mississippi river basin as well as for portions of the upper mississippi river near st louis mallakpour and villarini 2015 found significant increases in the frequency but not the magnitude of historic flood events in the central region of the u s despite considerable uncertainty over the impact of changes in climate on the behavior of floods e g koutsoyiannis et al 2008 hirsch and ryberg 2012 there is good evidence that changes in land use land cover agricultural practice and water infrastructure have led to considerable changes in the behavior of flood series villarini et al 2011 if an observed flood series is known to exhibit an increasing trend during some particular historical period then the magnitude of all upper quantiles associated with that flood series will also increase over that period under such conditions it would not be appropriate to report a single value of the 99th percentile i e flood with average return period of 100 years or to issue a floodplain delineation map without denoting the date associated with its creation in such situations in which historical trends in flood series are obvious and or overt due to knowledge of changes in historical land use climate and or water infrastructure it is imperative to provide updated estimates of design floods that reflect current conditions the goal of this study is to develop a suite of approaches to nffa which are particularly well suited to updating design events to current conditions 2 on the value of parsimony robustness resistance and efficiency a full appreciation of the methodology introduced here can only be understood with a knowledge of the concepts of parsimony robustness resistance and efficiency all of which have been given little attention in the area of nffa our long history of stationary ffa including a myriad of probability density functions pdf and parameter estimation methods introduced over 50 years ago led kuczera 1986 and others to introduce the concepts of robustness resistance and efficiency to help hydrologists choose a suitable approach kuczera 1986 defined a robust model as one which the analyst is confident to use as a predictive tool in the roles assigned to it he also introduced the properties of resistance and efficiency two properties expected of a robust model kuczera 1986 suggests that a resistant model must be capable of estimating extreme events irrespective of which contending flood distribution best represents the real world without disastrous loss of performance performance is indicated by some criterion such as mean squared error mse others had already sought resistant flood estimators such as in the seminal study by slack et al 1975 which found that in the absence of knowledge about the distribution of floods and associated economic losses the normal distribution was preferred over several more complex and commonly used skewed alternatives identification of a resistant estimator is not sufficient because a robust estimator must also perform efficiently in the sense of exhibiting low mse when compared to alternative estimators it has long been known that efficient low mse estimators tend to also be parsimonious box and jenkins 1976 a parsimonious estimator is one that accomplishes a desired level of prediction efficiency with as few model parameters as possible more recently laio et al 2009 and di baldassarre et al 2009 argue that all model selection criteria implicitly consider the principle of parsimony which they describe in terms of the inverse trade off between the bias and variance of an estimator i e more complex estimators tend to exhibit lower bias at the cost of increased variance still today even after the concept of parsimony has pervaded the early literature on ffa a common assumption of nffa literature is that more accurate estimates of flood quantiles result when more complex and improved estimators are employed thus recent reviews of nffa by khaliq et al 2006 and others describe myriad complex parametric and nonparametric nffa methods most of which have not been evaluated within the context of robustness and many of which are certainly not parsimonious as discussed below the few studies we could find which did evaluate the robustness of alternative nffa estimators in terms of both their resistance and efficiency found that the more parsimonious models tended to perform best serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 as expected from our earlier experience on the value of parsimony in stationary ffa both serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and luke et al 2017 found that in the presence of the uncertainty concerning whether or not a flood series exhibits nonstationarity the more parsimonious stationary estimators were generally preferred however o brien and burn 2014 found that regional approaches to nffa may be preferred over regional approaches to ffa when significant nonstationarity is evident within a region there are many examples of the fact that parsimonious estimators often exhibit lower mse than more complex competing estimators even when the parsimonious estimator assumes an incorrect pdf for example lu and stedinger 1992 consider quantile estimators for the generalized extreme value gev distribution and show that for pdfs with realistic shape parameters a two parameter gev with fixed shape parameter such as the gumbel estimator generally had lower mse than the three parameter gev estimator even if the assumed shape parameter is misrepresented similarly kuczera 1986 found the parsimonious two parameter lognormal ln2 maximum likelihood estimator to exhibit lower mse when compared to numerous realistic three parameter alternatives in summary there exists extensive evidence of the value of parsimony in stationary ffa and after the two recent studies by serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and luke et al 2017 we expect the principle of parsimony to play an equally important role in nffa similarly castellarin et al 2012 found that relatively simple approaches to ffa with minimum data requirements were the preferred choice in many countries and by most of the institutions and agencies in charge of developing flood risk mitigation plans in europe the primary goal of this study is to introduce a parsimonious approach to nffa which only requires estimation of one additional parameter over and beyond a stationary ffa yet can be applied to any pdf regardless of the number of parameters 3 distinguishing features of methodology two general approaches have been applied to ffa and nffa consisting of the peaks over threshold approach pot and the use of the annual maximum flood amf series approach we only consider the amf approach though there may be considerable value to testing the pot approach for nffa in future studies i e see khaliq et al 2006 see stedinger et al 1993 section 18 6 1 and stedinger 2016 section 76 2 3 and associated references for guidance on when an amf analysis is preferred over a pot analysis existing approaches to nffa summarized in review articles by khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 madsen et al 2014 ehret et al 2014 bayazit 2015 and salas et al 2017 usually involve fitting pdfs whose parameters and or moments are related to exogenous variables which are related to drivers of nonstationary behavior a variety of estimation methods have been advanced for estimating the combined nonstationary model consisting of a pdf and one or more models relating either moments or pdf model parameters to exogenous variables to fully understand many of the nffa methods advanced in the above cited reviews would require advanced training in statistics such as those based on generalized maximum likelihood generalized linear models kernel and wavelet density estimation quantile regression and bayesian approaches just to name a few a secondary goal of this study is to introduce a generalized approach to nffa which would not require advanced training in statistics to fully understand and implement one could argue that algorithms now exist in r software r core team 2015 to facilitate implementation of most of these advanced nffa approaches e g see gamlss software by stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 extremes software by gilleland and katz 2011 and neva software by cheng et al 2014 however unlike the methodology introduced here a complete understanding of those methods requires advanced training in statistics and some of these tools are not useful for distributions other than the generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto pdfs our approach differs from all previous work on nffa because it employs a single regression equation based on an exogenous variable from which the conditional mean conditional variance and conditional skewness of both series of annual maximum floods amf x and its logarithms y ln x may be derived to ensure consistency among the resulting moments and distributional model parameters as well as to ensure a parsimonious approach since only a single regression model is used to derive the conditional moments a parsimonious nffa can be developed with only one additional model parameter required to convert a stationary ffa into a nffa another contribution which sets this work apart from all previous work on methods for nffa when combining a pdf with models which relate pdf model parameters or moments to covariates it is important to ensure that the resulting nffa behaves in accord with flood observations another critical and distinguishing feature of our approach consider an example using a nonstationary gev pdf where the location scale and shape parameters are given by ξ α and κ respectively using notation from stedinger et al 1993 and stedinger 2016 consider the parsimonious model proposed by cheng et al 2014 and others in which only the location parameter is linearly related to time t so that ξ a bt with the scale and shape parameters fixed one can pose such a model and even show that the linear relationship is in accord with flood observations however such an approach could not make physical sense because holding α constant implies that the variance of the flood series does not change over time this results in a coefficient of variation of the flood series c which changes over time an unlikely result for flood series and a result inconsistent with many recent studies which have documented that the assumption of a constant value of c is reasonable at thousands of rivers i e vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 and hecht 2017 our parsimonious approach based also on a single model of the flood series versus a covariate employs conditional moments and conditional pdf model parameters derived from that model which ensure that the resulting nffa will always be in accord with the original flood observations another unique aspect of our proposed approach to nffa involves the myriad benefits which arise from the combination of a single possibly multivariate regression equation along with its corresponding exogeneous variable s and associated conditional moments derived for use with any pdf although herein we only apply it to four commonly used in ffa generalized extreme value gev lognormal ln2 lognormal ln3 and log pearson type iii lp3 those benefits summarized in the next section range from the numerous advantages of regression methods including rigorous graphical displays parsimony prediction intervals associated with trend extrapolations accommodation of complex multivariate nonlinear relationships and an ability to account for missing observations abrupt changes the impact of serial correlation and changes in the coefficient of variation of flood series on resulting statistical inference associated with the nffa we then describe our parsimonious approach to nffa which begins by introducing the theoretical regression framework for nffa including a derivation of the conditional moments of x and y ln x we then combine those conditional moments with the four pdfs considered gev ln2 ln3 and lp3 resulting in four different nffa models we then apply the resulting nffa models to amf series for two urbanizing basins near boston massachusetts finally we introduce nonstationary probability plots and associated goodness of fit metrics documenting how such procedures can be used to evaluate and possibly improve the practice of nffa 4 advantages of regression for nonstationary flood frequency analysis regression offers a generalized multivariate statistical approach for relating the behavior of flood series to covariate explanatory variables which can explain a portion of the variability of those floods conditional moments associated with a single bivariate regression model are derived and combined with a pdf to create a parsimonious nffa below we outline a dozen advantages of using regression within nffa which taken together offer significant advantages over alternative approaches ease of application ordinary least squares ols regression is a topic in most introductory statistics courses and is easy to implement in existing statistical software packages effective graphical communication regression is useful for communicating results because the goodness of fit of trend models can be conveyed both quantitatively and qualitatively in a single graphical image parsimonious estimation of conditional moments most previous studies on nffa develop separate independent regression equations for each moment and or model parameter leading to nffa with several additional parameters over stationary ffa instead as we suggest one may derive all conditional moments needed for nffa from a single regression model resulting in a parsimonious approach accommodation of changes in coefficient of variation of flood series a promising extension to our analysis would be through the use of weighted least squares wls regression for accommodating heteroscedastic regression residuals resulting from situations in which the coefficient of variation of flood series is changing see strupczewski and kaczmarek 2001 and hecht 2017 accommodation of nonlinear relationships a wide range of monotonic non linear functions can be linearized with ladder of powers transformations mosteller and tukey 1977 helsel and hirsch 2002 enabling the application of ols and wls linear regression methods for fitting highly nonlinear relationships analytical prediction intervals both confidence intervals corresponding to the true regression relationship as well as prediction intervals associated with future predicted floods are easily computed from analytical relations e g helsel and hirsch 2002 multivariate statistical modeling multivariate regression can be used to model the multiple and interacting impacts of various covariates which quantify the impact of climate land use and other factors on flood series kwon et al 2008 delgado et al 2010 lópez and francés 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2015 condon et al 2015 šraj et al 2016 hypothesis tests are also available for evaluating various alternative hypotheses model selection and evaluation numerous procedures such as cross validation random forests partial least squares ridge regression and best subsets selection methods are available for selection of covariates in multivariate regression models in addition influence statistics are available for evaluating the influence of outliers on regression coefficients helsel and hirsch 2002 such model selection procedures are of critical importance to ensure development of parsimonious multivariate models step changes or abrupt shifts changes in flood series may be either gradual or abrupt due to either anthropogenic perturbations such as reservoir construction or climatic shifts mccabe and wolock 2002 villarini et al 2009a to test for hypothesized abrupt step changes in flood series binary indicator variables that account for whether a covariate lies below or above a threshold can be added to a regression model bates et al 2012 handling of missing and historical information the conditional regression approach described here can easily account for intermittent or missing observations and in addition offers a parsimonious alternative to the expected moments algorithm cohn et al 1997 lamontagne et al 2016 for integrating non instrumental historical flood records into nffa if they are believed to represent an unbiased sample of floods during the historical period these tasks are accomplished by simply accounting for the time of occurrence associated with each flood and associated covariate observation accounting for persistence in hydrologic series given the short records typically available in hydrology it is often difficult to distinguish trends from short and long term persistence vogel et al 1998 both of which have been documented in amf series villarini et al 2009a tan and gan 2015 fortunately matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 developed analytical formulae to adjust standard errors of regression model coefficients for numerous common classes of persistence 5 regression model of annual maximum flood series our central goal is to combine pdfs which are widely accepted for modeling stationary amf series with conditional moments derived from a regression model which can describe the nonstationary behavior of amf series a distinguishing feature of this work is that very careful attention is given to the structure and theoretical properties of the regression models which all take the form 1 y f x β 0 β 1 w 1 β 2 w 2 ɛ where x denotes the amf series and y f x is some transformation of the amf series with w 1 w 2 denoting covariate climate land use and possibly other variables β1 β2 denoting model coefficients and ε denoting model error which is assumed to be independent homoscedastic and normally distributed a model of the form given in 1 with a logarithm transformation y ln x was carefully evaluated by vogel et al 2011 for amf series at thousands of rivers across the u s and by prosdocimi et al 2014 for rivers in the united kingdom in this initial study we employ a linear regression model using a logarithmic transformation of the amf series x in 1 leading to an exponential model for x which was shown by vogel et al 2011 to be an excellent representation of amf series in the u s regardless of whether the series was determined to exhibit a significant trend the basic premise of this work is that a regression of the form given in 1 can be developed for relating the amf series to one or more explanatory variables each of which would describe some portion of the possibly nonstationary behavior of the series another basic premise of this work is that the single regression model can be used to derive conditional moments needed to convert the stationary ln2 ln3 gev lp3 and other models into their nonstationary counterparts in this section we describe the initial regression model employed here along with its theoretical properties and associated conditional moments the goal of this study is to introduce a generalized approach to nffa based on the integration of a single regression model with various stationary pdfs thus we consider only a bivariate regression model here yet we encourage others to extend our work using multivariate yet parsimonious regression models which include covariates known to be drivers of nonstationary behavior to simplify the introduction of our methodology we consider only a single explanatory variable time selected as a surrogate for all the possible time dependent nonstationary influences on the amf series considered in two case studies we recommend that in any future application of our methodology investigators incorporate explanatory variables which can describe the physical influence of whatever nonstationary behavior is hypothesized for example in the case of the two urbanizing watersheds considered later relevant explanatory variables might be the area of directly connected impervious surfaces and other metrics which represent the influence of urbanization on the behavior of flood magnitudes we recommend development of multivariate models which include numerous additional covariates because this approach has been shown to improve upon our ability to describe future nonstationary behavior of flood series kwon et al 2008 delgado et al 2010 lópez and francés 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2015 condon et al 2015 5 1 the regression and its implied conditional and unconditional moments to introduce our generalized approach to nffa we employ the bivariate regression y β0 β1 w ε where y ln x with x representing the amf series and w represents an explanatory variable with other variables as defined in 1 both vogel et al 2011 and prosdocimi et al 2014 found this model with w equal to time to be useful for examining flood trends for rivers in the u s and the u k regardless of whether or not trends exist hirsch and ryberg 2012 also used this model to evaluate amf series at 200 long term rivers in the us with the covariate w equal to carbon dioxide concentrations we emphasize that the form of the regression model in 1 and its simpler form given below make no assumption regarding the probability distribution of y we also note that the results presented in this section for a bivariate regression would need to be extended for the multivariate case as is advocated elsewhere in this paper and by others the bivariate regression model can be rewritten in the form 2 y μ y β w μ w ɛ where y is conditioned upon the explanatory variable w μ y and μ w are the mean of the variables y and w respectively β is the regression coefficient and ε represents the model error which is assumed to be independent in time normally distributed and to have zero mean and constant variance with 3 σ ɛ 2 1 ρ 2 σ y 2 where ρ denotes the cross correlation coefficient between y and w estimates of the single regression coefficient in 2 may be obtained from 4 β ρ σ y σ w with ρ i 1 n w i w y i y t 1 n w i w 2 t 1 n y i y 2 σ y 1 n 1 i 1 n y i y 2 σ w 1 n 1 i 1 n w i w 2 y 1 n i 1 n y i and w 1 n i 1 n w i note for this very special case in which we are employing the explanatory variable w time which is not a random variable prosdocimi et al 2014 appendix a3 derive expressions for its sample mean and variance assuming no missing observations between the first and last years sample estimates of the mean and variance of w are equal to w n 1 2 and σ w 2 n n 1 12 5 2 unconditional moments when performing a stationary analysis the moments of x and y ln x will not depend on the explanatory variable w so that the unconditional moments of xand y are defined by their means μ x and μ y their standard deviations σ x and σ y and their skewnesses γ x and γ y suitable sample at site and or regional estimators of those moments will depend on the assumed pdf of x and y which are given in the appendix a 5 3 conditional moments of y here we use the regression in 2 to derive conditional moments of both x and y for use in nffa without making any assumptions regarding the probability distribution of either x or y taking the expectation of 2 leads to an expression for the expected value of y conditioned upon w 5 μ y w μ y β w μ w similarly the conditional variance of y is obtained by taking the variance of 2 which leads to 6 σ y w 2 σ ɛ 2 σ y 2 1 ρ 2 note that the conditional variance of y decreases as the explanatory power of the trend model increases with the limit approaching zero as ρ approaches unity note also that the conditional variance of y reduces to its original unconditional variance when the regression in 2 has no explanatory power i e ρ 0 note that numerous previous studies which have employed this same regression model in nffa did not account for the fact that the conditional variance of y given in 6 is generally smaller than its unconditional value see for example stedinger and griffis 2011 vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 and luke et al 2017 just to name a few analogous to the conditional mean and variance of y in 5 and 6 one can show that the conditional skewness of y is given by 7 γ y w γ y β 3 γ w the conditional skewness is equal to the unconditional skewness when the skewness of the explanatory variable is equal to zero which is the case when time is used as the explanatory variable w as employed in this study 5 4 conditional moments of x if one takes the exponential of both sides of the regression for y in 2 we obtain an expression for x 8 x w exp y w exp μ y β w μ w ɛ where here the notation xw and yw emphasizes that the values of xw and yw are conditioned upon the value of the explanatory variable w note that we have not yet made any assumptions regarding the pdf of x y xw or yw given the form of the regression in 2 the conditional values yw and xw are likely to be well approximated by a normal and lognormal distribution respectively regardless of the original pdf associated with the variable of interest here x this is true because the only random variable on the right hand side of 8 are the model errors ε and exp ε which were found to be well approximated by normal and lognormal distributions respectively for thousands of rivers in the u s regardless of whether or not the estimated trend model coefficient β was found to be statistically significant see results of normality hypothesis tests in appendix a2 of vogel et al 2011 thus only for the purposes of deriving an approximation to the conditional moments of x we use the fact that xw is likely to be well approximated by a lognormal distribution with conditional moments in log space given by μ y w and σ y w in 5 and 6 respectively regardless of the true underlying distribution of x thus the conditional moments of xcan be approximated using the standard expressions which relate the mean variance and skewness of x and y ln x for a lognormal variate which yields 9a μ x w exp μ y w σ y w 2 2 9b σ x w 2 exp 2 μ y w σ y w 2 exp σ y w 2 1 9c c x w σ x w μ x w exp σ y w 2 1 9d γ x w 3 c x w c x w 3 where c x w denotes the coefficient of variation of x conditioned on w eq 9 can be simplified by combining it with 5 and 6 so that 10a μ x w exp μ y β w μ w σ y 2 1 ρ 2 2 10b σ x w 2 exp 2 μ y 2 β w μ w σ y 2 1 ρ 2 exp σ y 2 1 ρ 2 1 10c c x w exp σ y 2 1 ρ 2 1 10d γ x w 3 c x w c x w 3 here we note that both the conditional mean and the conditional variance of x depend on the value of the explanatory variable w whereas both the conditional coefficient of variation and the conditional coefficient of skewness are constant see discussion below it is very important to understand the impact of nonstationarity in the moments of the flood series x on overall flow variability which can be explained by contrasting the unconditional coefficient of variation c x σ x μ x of the flood series given in 6 with its conditional value c x w given in 10c in general c x w cx as long as ρ 0 which will always be the case for a nonstationary series this can also be seen for the case when x follows an ln2 model where read and vogel 2015 show that the conditional coefficient of variation of x is given by 11 c x w c x 2 1 1 ρ 2 1 under nonstationary conditions there is always the question of whether or not the variability defined by the coefficient of variation of x is changing over time the ln2 case provides an excellent background for understanding this issue so often confused in the literature for the ln2 case the unconditional coefficient of variation of the flood series is given by c x exp σ y 2 1 which can be rewritten using 6 as c x exp σ ɛ 2 1 ρ 2 1 which is only constant if the regression in 2 exhibits homoscedastic residuals or residuals with constant variance thus one could employ a standard test of homoscedasticity of the residuals such as the one introduced by breusch and pagan 1979 or white 1980 to evaluate whether or not the coefficient of variation of the flood series is changing note that if the variance of the residuals σ ɛ 2 changes over time then cx is no longer constant and a heteroscedastic regression model is needed to characterize the conditional coefficient of variation of x as recommended by hecht 2017 one may also employ wls regression in the case of heteroscedastic model errors as described by strupczewski and kaczmarek 2001 interestingly after looking at hundreds of rivers across the u s using a 5 level modified breusch pagan 1979 test hecht 2017 found few examples of rivers even in urbanizing regions which exhibited values of cx which appear to change over time 6 probability distributions of annual maximum flood series vogel and wilson 1996 provide a review of the results of local regional continental and global studies which sought to determine a suitable pdf for modeling series of annual maximum floods they summarize the results of studies available as of that date along with the results of a survey of pdfs used by various agencies and countries worldwide on the basis of those surveys and literature review combined with their own national evaluation based on l moment diagrams for 1490 rivers in the u s vogel and wilson 1996 recommend the use of three distributions for modeling amf series including gev lp3 and the ln3 distributions in the most recent summary of ffa methods stedinger 2016 suggests that the gev and lp3 models are the most widely accepted among all the pdfs considered by the interagency advisory committee on water data 1982 see appendix 14 the ln2 and lp3 distributions performed best in their comparisons and were the only two distributions which did not exhibit significant bias in observed flood frequencies we note that the ln2 model is a special case of both the lp3 and ln3 models on the bases of these extensive national and global comparisons we develop nonstationary versions of the following four pdfs ln2 ln3 lp3 and gev these choices are also consistent with other recent studies including the large scale pan european evaluation by salinas et al 2014 which recommends the gev model england jr et al 2017 which recommends the lp3 model for the u s and ball et al 2016 which recommends both the lp3 and gev models for the australian continent although use of regional information is generally preferred over use of at site methods in both stationary hosking and wallis 2005 ouarda 2016 and nonstationary o brien and burn 2014 ffa in this initial study we employ at site parameter estimation methods which have been proven to be efficient in previous studies for each of the pdfs considered the parsimonious approach introduced here could be combined with the index flood assumption to enable extension to regional nffa 6 1 stationary and nonstationary quantile functions in this section we describe the stationary and nonstationary quantile functions corresponding to the ln2 ln3 gev and lp3 distributions since we employ these quantile functions with actual data for two urbanizing rivers in the following section we introduce both the stationary and the nonstationary quantile estimators to clarify how to implement the procedures introduced here the challenge here is to develop nonstationary quantile estimators which account for both the mean and variance of the amf series x being functions of the explanatory variable w thus our estimation methods must be flexible enough to enable the distributional parameters such as the lower bound of the ln3 and gev distributions to be functions of w yet be readily and easily implemented our experience indicates that whenever a trend in flood series is apparent there appears to be a noticeable trend in the corresponding lower bound of its pdf 6 1 1 lognormal ln2 the lognormal distribution is one of the most widely used distributions in hydrology stedinger 1980 provides guidance on the most efficient estimation methods for the ln2 and ln3 pdfs if the amf series x follows an ln2 distribution then y ln x follows a normal distribution stedinger 1980 shows that an attractive estimator of the quantile of a stationary ln2 variate is the maximum likelihood estimator given by 12 x p exp y z p v y where y 1 n i 1 n y i and v y 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 and zp is the inverse of a standard normal variable with nonexceedance probability p substitution of estimates of the conditional moments of y in 5 and 6 into the stationary quantile function of an ln2 variate leads to the nonstationary ln2 quantile estimator 13 x p w exp μ y w z p σ y w exp y β w i w z p σ y 2 β 2 σ w 2 where zp is the quantile function for a standard normal variable of nonexceedance probability p and the estimators w σ w 2 β y and σ y are given in 4 note that for the stationary case β 0 in which case 13 reduces to the well known stationary ln2 quantile estimator in 12 note also that numerous previous studies which have combined the same regression model used here with the ln2 pdf did not account for the reduction in the conditional standard deviation of y as is done here see for example stedinger and griffis 2011 vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 and luke et al 2017 just to name a few 6 1 2 log pearson type iii lp3 if the amf series x follows an lp3 distribution then y ln x follows a pearson type iii p3 distribution also termed a three parameter gamma pdf which can be characterized by its mean μ y standard deviation σ y and skewness γ y the lp3 is an extremely flexible distribution that can assume a wide range of distributional forms ranging from an exponential pdf when γ y 2 to an ln2 model when γ y 0 detailed procedures for estimation of the lp3 model under stationary conditions based on either at site gaged data as is assumed here or based on regional skew information are provided by both england jr et al 2017 and ball et al 2016 the nonstationary quantile function for an lp3 variate is obtained in a very similar fashion to that of the ln2 case again substitution of the conditional moments of y into the stationary quantile function of an lp variate leads to the nonstationary lp3 quantile estimator 14 x p w exp μ y w k p σ y w exp y β w i w k p σ y 2 β 2 σ w 2 where k p a max h 1 f 6 2 z p f 6 3 b a max 2 γ y w 0 4 b 1 0 0144 max 0 γ y w 2 25 2 f γ y w 0 063 max 0 γ y w 1 1 85 h b 2 γ y w a 1 3 which reduces to the stationary lp3 quantile function x p w exp y k p σ y when β 0 here zp and kp are the inverse of a standard normal and a three parameter gamma variate respectively with nonexceedance probability p while estimates of zp are widely available in most any mathematical software package kp is more difficult to estimate but may be approximated using the computational method recommended by kirby 1972 and given in 14 which is accurate for values of γ y 9 limits well beyond the skew values considered in this and most other studies for the case when the explanatory variable w in the regression does not exhibit skewness as is the case here using the variable time an at site estimator of conditional skewness γ y w in 7 may be estimated using the nearly unbiased estimator introduced by tasker and stedinger 1986 for the lp3 distribution 15 γ y w 1 6 n n i 1 n y i y 3 n 1 n 2 σ y 3 although this initial study only employs at site estimators we emphasize that at site estimates of sample skew are highly variable which is why england jr et al 2017 and others recommend computing a regional skew estimator which weighs estimates of at site and regional skews 6 1 3 generalized extreme value gev the gev distribution is a generalization of the type i ii and iii extreme value distributions also known as the gumbel frechet and weibull pdfs respectively it may be the most widely used pdf for modeling annual series of natural hazards and other extremes perhaps because it is the asymptotic distribution of the maximum value in an infinite sample with an extensive extreme value theory to support its application ghil et al 2011 the amf series represents the series of maxima each drawn from a very large number of discharges measured in each year following the notation from stedinger et al 1993 and stedinger 2016 the stationary quantile function of a gev variate is usually written in terms of the three parameters of the distribution α ξ and κ which characterize its scale location and shape respectively an estimate of the stationary gev quantile estimator is given by 16 x p ξ α κ 1 ln p κ although the generalized mles introduced by martins and stedinger 2000 are likely to be the most attractive parameter estimators for a gev variate especially if one has prior information we employ method of moments estimators here which have been shown to be more efficient than either l moment or mle s see stedinger 2016 for discussion and references stedinger 2016 table 76 4 reports expressions for the mean standard deviation and skewness of x denoted μ x σ x and γ x respectively as function of the pdf model parameters ξ α and κ bhunya et al 2007 report approximations for estimating the parameters ξ α and κ from gev samples based on sample estimates of the moments μ x σ x and γ x which we denote as x σ x and γ x respectively which are reproduced in appendix a substitution of the method of moment estimators of the stationary gev parameters given in a 1 a 2 and a 3 and denoted as ξ α and κ into 16 leads to the stationary gev quantile estimator similarly a nonstationary gev quantile function is obtained by replacing the sample moments μ x σ x and γ x with their conditional moments μ x w σ x w and γ x w given in 10 after substitution of estimates of those conditional moments into the method of moment estimators given in appendix a one obtains estimates of the conditional parameters denoted ξ x w α x w and κ x w leading to the nonstationary quantile function 17 x p w ξ x w α x w κ x w 1 ln p κ x w again we emphasize that much more attractive estimators of the gev distribution would employ regional information for estimation of the shape parameter κ for both stationary and nonstationary cases as is described in martins and stedinger 2000 el adlouni et al 2007 and stedinger 2016 6 1 4 three parameter lognormal ln3 if the amf series x follows an ln3 distribution then the variable u ln x tx follows a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to μ u and σ u the stationary quantile function for an ln3 variate has a very similar form to the stationary quantile function for an ln2 variate in 12 stedinger 1980 documents the most efficient estimators of the ln3 distribution under various conditions of interest to a hydrologist we take an analogous approach to the one we took with the gev distribution where we employed the method of moments for both the nonstationary and stationary cases here our goal is to fit both and stationary and nonstationary lognormal model using the method of moments since both unconditional and conditional estimates of those moments have been derived here for the nonstationary case a method of moment estimator of the stationary ln3 quantile estimator was given by singh et al 1990 as 18 x p τ x exp μ u z p σ u 2 where μ u 1 2 ln σ x 2 λ λ 1 σ u 2 ln λ τ x x σ x θ b 1 2 γ x γ x 2 4 θ 1 b 2 3 b 1 3 λ θ 2 1 with zp defined previously and the sample moments x σ x and γ x given in appendix a similarly the nonstationary ln3 quantile estimator is obtained from 19 x p w τ x w exp μ u w z p σ u w 2 where μ u w 1 2 ln σ x w 2 λ λ 1 σ u w 2 ln λ τ x w μ x w σ x w θ b 1 2 γ x w γ x w 2 4 θ 1 b 2 3 b 1 3 λ θ 2 1 and zp is the quantile function for a standard normal variable of nonexceedance probability p and the estimators μ x w σ x w and γ x w are given in a 4a a 4b and a 4d respectively note that for the stationary case β 0 in 2 in which case the nonstationary ln3 quantile function in 19 reduces to the stationary ln3 quantile function in 18 7 case study regression results in this initial study we consider the aberjona and neponset rivers which drain two urbanizing suburban watersheds near boston massachusetts both have long term u s geological survey gaging records the aberjona river usgs gage 01102500 drains a 24 mi 2 watershed in which impervious cover increased from 6 to 36 during the gaging period from 1940 to 2015 75 years fig 2 in allaire et al 2015 summarizes changes in watershed population and water withdrawals over this period the watershed area has no major flow regulations impoundments withdrawals or storm water detention systems see allaire et al 2015 for further information on the hydrologic properties of the aberjona river the neponset river usgs gage 01105000 at norwood ma has measured discharge from 1938 to 2015 77 years approximately 16 of the 34 7 mi 2 watershed is currently impervious flow in the neponset river is regulated by small mills and reservoirs upstream and is subject to municipal and industrial diversions both the aberjona and neponset river watersheds are obvious laboratories to test the application of nffa methodologies because of the gradual anthropogenic land cover changes that have occurred over the past century figs 1 and 2 use open circles to illustrate the relationship between the natural logarithm of the amf series y ln x and the explanatory variable w time for the aberjona river and the neponset river watersheds respectively using a 5 significance level we were unable to reject the null hypothesis of no trend for either river based on a t test of the regression slope coefficient also shown in each figure is the fitted regression model along with various other metrics associated with the model including the sample size n the goodness of fit metric r 2 which in this case of bivariate regression is simply equal to ρ 2 defined in 4 as well as the attained significance level p associated with the estimated regression coefficient β the attained significance level p is computed from the data and indicates the probability that one would obtain a value of β equal to or greater than the value obtained if the null hypothesis of no trend β 0 were correct in table 2 for both rivers we compare values of β based on ols regression with nonparametric estimates based on the nonparametric kendall theil slope estimator described by helsel and hirsch 2001 chapter 10 the attained significance levels in table 2 for the parametric and nonparametric cases are computed using a t test and the mann kendall trend test respectively we note the near equivalence of the parametric and nonparametric estimates β and very similar attained significance levels using both estimators it is important to consider both nonparametric and parametric estimates of the regression slope because this parameter plays such a critical role in our subsequent nffa and because as we show below the regression model residuals are poorly behaved which raises questions about our ability to perform statistical inference on the resulting models the extremely low attained significance levels for both rivers p 0 001 summarized in table 2 indicate that proof for a trend is so strong that there is very little possibility for evidence this strong or stronger to arise by chance if there were truely no trend it is equally important to consider the likelihood that we would reject a trend if it really existed because as vogel et al 2013 emphasize rejecting a trend when it really exists could have much greater societal consequences than accepting a trend when it does not exist see vogel et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 and prosdocimi et al 2014 for a discussion of the likelihood of type i and ii errors within the context of trend detection and the factors which could lead us to reject a trend when it really exists leading to substantial societal consequences we emphasize that one should never take the result of an individual hypothesis test based on a sample of limited length too seriously neyman and pearson 1933 suggest that no test based upon a theory of probability can by itself provide any valuable evidence of the truth or falsehood of a hypothesis but we may look at the purpose of tests from another viewpoint without hoping to know whether each separate hypothesis is true or false we may search for rules to govern our behavior with regard to them in following which we insure that in the long run of experience we shall not often be wrong it is in this light that we interpret the above results the fitted regression models in figs 1 and 2 represent the model of the conditional mean μ y w y β w w to highlight the uncertainty associated with future predictions of y ln x we also illustrate 95 prediction intervals in figs 1 and 2 which are intervals within which 95 of all flood observations y are expected to lie see section 9 4 5 in helsel and hirsch 2002 for an analytical formula for computing prediction intervals note that such prediction intervals widen considerably under extrapolation highlighting another important advantage of our approach because it emphasizes the increasing uncertainty inherent in extrapolation of trends future studies may wish to derive the variance and or confidence intervals associated with quantile estimates based on the various nonstationary pdf models introduced in this study analogous to the work of obeysekera and salas 2014 we refer the reader to section 9 4 4 of helsel and hirsch 2002 which provides estimates of the variance and or confidence intervals associated with the conditional mean regression estimator μ y w 7 1 regression model evaluations a necessary condition for any statistical inference to be performed on a fitted trend model based on ordinary least squares ols regression requires that model residuals be approximately homoscedastic normally distributed and independent in time figs 3 and 4 illustrate diagnostic plots which summarize the behavior of the regression model residuals for the regressions corresponding to the aberjona and neponset rivers respectively the following subplots are provided for each regression subplot a illustrates a histogram of the model residuals which should appear gaussian with a mean of zero subplot b displays the residuals y i y i versus wi and should appear to exhibit constant variance a breusch pagan 1979 test was performed which enables us to reject the null hypothesis of homoscedastic residuals constant variance at the 5 significance level for the aberjona river and fail to reject the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity for the neponset river the attained significance levels associated with the breusch pagan test were p 0 031 and p 0 628 for the aberjona and neponset river respectively a normal probability plot is illustrated in subplot c as well as the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc and its associated attained significance level p see vogel 1986 here the attained significance level p is interpreted a bit differently than for other tests again p is computed from the observations and indicates the probability of obtaining a value of ppcc smaller than the computed value if the null hypothesis of normality were correct the attained significance levels were p 0 725 and p 0 0062 for the aberjona and neponset river residuals respectively which implies that the aberjona probability plot is typical of what probability plots would look like if the samples were normal whereas very few normal probability plots for normal samples would look like the result obtained for the neponset river thus we cannot reject the null hypothesis of normality of the trend model residuals at the 5 level for the aberjona river but we do reject it for the neponset river finally subplot d is a correlogram displaying the lag k serial correlation coefficient of the residuals for lags of 1 50 along with 95 confidence intervals for the case of independence no serial correlation for the aberjona river the results in fig 3 combined with the breusch pagan and ppcc normality hypothesis tests reveal that model residuals appear to exhibit some heteroscedasticity yet they appear to be approximately independent and normally distributed for the neponset river the results in fig 4 combined with associated breusch pagan and ppcc normality hypothesis tests reveal that model residuals are approximately homoscedastic and independent but are poorly approximated by a normal distribution thus our diagnostic analysis of model residuals raises questions concerning our ability to perform statistical inference concerning nonstationary behavior in the amf at both sites for this reason we included nonparametric estimates of the regression model slope coefficient and associated attained significance levels for both rivers in table 2 7 2 stationary and nonstationary probability plots probability plots helsel and hirsch 2002 are a graphical technique to illustrate the goodness of fit of different pdfs to a set of data the degree of linearity of the observations in a probability plot corresponding to a hypothesized distribution is a measure of the goodness of fit of that particular pdf to the observations thus the linearity of the probability plot measured using a ppcc provides both a quantitative measure of the goodness of fit of the hypothesized pdf to the observations and can also be used to perform a hypothesis test for two parameter distributional alternatives vogel 1986 stedinger et al 1993 heo et al 2008 though hypothesis test results for three parameter distributional alternatives are questionable vogel and mcmartin 1991 until this study all procedures for developing probability plots and for computing ppcc test statistics have assumed stationarity we introduce a procedure for constructing nonstationary probability plots and for computing the ppcc to assess the possible improvement in goodness of fit which results when there is good evidence of nonstationary behavior in the amf series when performing diagnostic evaluations such as probability plots coles 2001 suggests working with a standardized version of the data conditional on the fitted parameter values standardization can remove the trend from the data effectively resulting in a transformation of the time series from nonstationary to stationary thus by standardizing either the x or y series using their conditional moments introduced here one can apply a stationary probability plot to the standardized series resulting in a nonstationary probability plot the steps used to construct stationary and nonstationary probability plots are enumerated below 1 standardize the observations of either x for gev and ln3 cases or y ln x for the ln2 and lp3 cases using the conditional moments for x and y given previously z i y i μ y w σ y w f o r l n 2 a n d l p 3 x i μ x w σ x w f o r g e v ln x i τ x w μ u w σ u w f

suitable plotting position pi from table 1 corresponding to the hypothesized distribution considered 4 plot the ordered set z p i z i i 1 n for the stationary and nonstationary case using the appropriate plotting position pi from table 1 to obtain estimates of the standardized variate z corresponding to each of the pdfs considered using z p i z p i f o r l n 2 a n d l n 3 x p i w μ x w σ x

18 and k p i is the standardized pearson type iii given in 14 5 calculate the ppcc test statistic which is the product moment correlation p p c c i 1 n z p i z z i z i 1 n z p i z 2 i 1 n z i z 2 where z 1 n i 1 n z p i and z 1 n i 1 n z i with z i and z p i defined in steps 1 and 4 respectively 7 2 1 probability plot results probability plots corresponding to the standardized variable z i for the four distributions under both stationary and nonstationary assumptions and the corresponding ppccs are displayed in figs 5 and 6 for the aberjona and neponset watersheds respectively for the aberjona river the probability plots for the four nonstationary models are slightly more linear than the corresponding probability plots for the four stationary cases as evidenced by their slightly higher ppcc values in contrast for the neponset river the probability plots for the four nonstationary models are slightly less linear than the corresponding probability plots for the stationary cases as evidenced by their slightly lower ppcc values 7 3 discussion of hypothesis test results there are several important lessons to be learned from the above analysis first and foremost there is considerable physical evidence of drivers of nonstationarity for these two urbanized watersheds which led us to hypothesize that significant population growth and associated increases in impervious cover over the period of streamflow record led to increases in the amf series importantly this conjecture is supported by our fitted trend model and associated diagnostics the extremely low values of attained significance levels p 0 001 associated with the trend model slope coefficient at both the aberjona fig 1 and neponset fig 2 rivers corresponding to both the parametric t test and the nonparametric mann kendall test table 2 led to a high level of confidence that both amf series exhibited an increasing trend over the historical period diagnosis of the regression model residuals led us to question our ability to perform statistical inference concerning trends in both amf series because the aberjona river model residuals exhibited some heteroscedasticity and the neponset river model residuals exhibited some nonnormality these results lead us to question conclusions derived from statistical inference on both models including hypothesis tests and prediction intervals nevertheless since the nonparametric test results support our parametric test results we remain confident that both rivers exhibit nonstationary behavior which should be considered in any subsequent flood frequency analysis our analysis only considers a trend in the mean of y which implies that the coefficient of variation of x is fixed thus the mean and standard deviation of x both exhibit the identical trends the apparent heteroscedasticity of the model residuals for the aberjona river indicates that a more complex model which allows for a time varying coefficient of variation of x should be considered when model residuals exhibit heteroscedasticity ols estimates of regression model parameters are unbiased but the standard t test of model parameter significance can lead to incorrect inferences long and ervin 2000 to ensure correct inferences concerning regression model parameters in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form long and ervin 2000 and others have suggested the use of a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix and associated standard errors while such approaches enable improved statistical inference in the presence of heteroscedasticity they do not provide an approach to model changes in the coefficient of variation analogous to the regression approach we have introduced to describe the time variation in y corresponding to a trend in both the mean and variance of x holding coefficient of variation constant it is possible to introduce a time varying function for the coefficient of variation of x and to integrate that function into the quantile function of x to enable improved estimation of design events hecht 2017 summarizes several attractive approaches for considering time variations in the coefficient of variation given an assumed model form including the use of weighted least squares regression strupczewski and kaczmarek 2001 heteroscedasticity consistent standard errors long and ervin 2000 as well as by simply fitting independent regression models for the mean and standard deviation of x our parsimonious approach to modeling a trend in the mean and variance of x assuming constant coefficient of variation provides a reasonable initial approach for estimating the nonstationary 100 year flood however further research is needed to develop a parsimonious approach for determining the impact of changes in the mean variance and coefficient of variation of x on a design event 7 4 comparisons of stationary and nonstationary design events of critical interest in practice are estimates of selected quantiles of the distribution of the amf series under both stationary and nonstationary conditions to enable one to update design events to reflect conditions in a particular year one simple yet effective way to understand the impact of the trend model on resulting design events is to compute the decadal magnification factor m exp δ t β exp 10 β vogel et al 2011 corresponding to the nonstationary ln2 model the decadal magnification factors for the neponset and aberjona rivers are 1 089 and 1 136 respectively this indicates that al flood quantiles have increased at the rate of about 9 and 14 per decade over the historical period for the neponset and aberjona rivers respectively table 3 summarizes estimates of the 100 year flood denoted x 100 corresponding to each of the four hypothesized pdfs for both rivers along with corresponding estimates of the ppcc statistics for both the stationary and nonstationary analyzes estimates of the 100 year flood based on nonstationary conditions are obtained for the most current year on record wn so that they reflect the 100 year flood under current conditions as of 2015 in contrast estimates of the 100 year flood under stationary conditions are not updated to current conditions but reflect average conditions over the observed period of flows numerous conclusions can be drawn from table 3 combined with our previous trend model diagnostics if one ignores any possibility of nonstationarity using a traditional stationary ppcc lognormal hypothesis test we were unable to reject the ln2 hypothesis for the amf series at both rivers at the 5 level a nonstationary analysis led to uniform improvements in the goodness of fit as evidenced by increases in ppcc values for all four models considered for the aberjona river in contrast for the neponset river the nonstationary analysis did not result in an improvement in goodness of fit over a stationary analysis though that may be due in part to the occurrence of an unusually large flood of record in the middle of the period of record see fig 2 this is because when there is a positive trend in the flow series the nonstationary quantile function will produce the largest design floods at the end of the historical period table 3 documents the considerable increases in estimates of the 100 year flood which result from using nffa to update design events to reflect current 2015 conditions for both rivers engineers would be advised to consider the nonstationary estimates of x 100 as an improvement over the stationary estimates because there is both good statistical evidence and plausible physical drivers for the increases in amf series physical evidence is provided by the considerable increases in urbanization that have occurred in both basins statistical evidence is provided by the extremely low attained significance levels associated with the nonparametric mann kendall trend test results in table 2 interestingly the design flood estimates in 2015 corresponding to the nonstationary ln2 ln3 and gev models are nearly equal at both rivers it is only the design flood corresponding to the lp3 nonstationary model which differs from the other nonstationary models to enable rigorous comparisons among the precision of these alternative design flood estimates studies of the type performed by obeysekera and salas 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and luke et al 2017 are needed to compare the uncertainty associated with such stationary and nonstationary design flood estimates given the relatively short series of observations available corresponding to potential nonstationary hydrologic conditions there will always be considerable uncertainty as to whether or not a stationary or nonstationary analysis is warranted that fact further highlights the need to include both the stationary and nonstationary results in any decision oriented analysis as recommended and documented by rosner et al 2014 8 conclusions despite widespread awareness of the impact of anthropogenic influences on extreme floods and droughts there remains considerable controversy and debate concerning the development of a generalized sensible and practical methodology for nffa to enable updating of design events to reflect current or future hydrologic conditions the lack of consensus results in part from the tremendous uncertainty associated with our ability to detect attribute and model past trends and the even greater uncertainty associated with our ability to predict future trends in hydrological processes nevertheless risk based decision making rbdm approaches have been used for decades and are now a well established methodology for the determination of appropriate levels of investment based on the expected damages avoided versus the cost of the infrastructure required national research council 2000 usace 2000 tung 2005 incorporation of nonstationarity into such rbdm analysis only increases the level of uncertainty associated with such analysis but does not change our overall approach to selection of a suitable design event see rosner et al 2014 for an example our brief review and discussion of the state of the art of nffa revealed a wide range of modeling approaches including extremely sophisticated statistical methods with little attention given to the concept of parsimony we reviewed historical literature which documents the tremendous value of parsimonious models for stationary ffa and we have good reason to suspect similar value to parsimony in nffa our primary goal was to introduce a generalized sensible parsimonious and practical approach to nffa to enable the determination of a flood quantile when hydrologic change is an obvious concern our nonstationary analysis differs from most previous approaches because it only requires one additional parameter trend model slope over and beyond a stationary analysis our approach is based on derived conditional moments of a single trend regression which accounts for possible changes to the first three conditional moments of streamflow with only the addition of a single additional model parameter we have outlined how integration of a single bivariate regression into nffa offers several advantages over existing approaches including parsimony ease of use graphical display prediction intervals accommodating missing and or historical information accounting for abrupt shifts accounting for persistence extensions to multivariate trend models and opportunities for uncertainty analysis we have also introduced nonstationary probability plots and associated goodness of fit statistics to quantitatively assess the improved goodness of fit associated with a nffa over a stationary analysis many packages written in r software r core team 2015 facilitate the application of advanced nffa approaches e g see gamlss software by stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 extremes software by gilleland and katz 2011 and neva software by cheng et al 2014 however unlike the methodology introduced here a complete understanding of those methods requires advanced training in statistics furthermore unlike our methodology which could be extended to any pdf some of the above referenced software tools are not useful for distributions other than the generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto pdfs our parsimonious approach to nonstationary flood frequency analysis nffa is based on a single bivariate regression equation which describes the relationship between annual maximum floods x and an exogenous variable which can explain the nonstationary behavior of x in this initial study we only consider a single explanatory variable time selected as a surrogate for all the possible time dependent nonstationary influences on the amf series considered in two case studies we recommend development of multivariate models which include numerous additional covariates because this approach has been shown to improve upon our ability to describe future nonstationary behavior of flood series kwon et al 2008 delgado et al 2010 lópez and francés 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 2015 condon et al 2015 šraj et al 2016 using a single bivariate regression model the conditional mean variance and skewness of both x and y ln x are derived and combined with numerous common probability distributions including the lognormal generalized extreme value and log pearson type iii models resulting in a very simple and parsimonious yet very general approach to nffa numerous natural extensions to our initial bivariate regression analysis are possible including consideration of other probabilistic models derivation of conditional moments for multivariate regression derivation of confidence intervals for nonstationary quantile estimators and application to drought and low flow frequency analysis perhaps the most promising extension to our initial work would be to develop regional estimates of the conditional skew and possibly the conditional coefficient

872,there is now widespread awareness of the impact of anthropogenic influences on extreme floods and droughts and thus an increasing need for methods to account for such influences when estimating a frequency distribution we introduce a parsimonious approach to nonstationary flood frequency analysis nffa based on a bivariate regression equation which describes the relationship between annual maximum floods x and an exogenous variable which may explain the nonstationary behavior of x the conditional mean variance and skewness of both x and y ln x are derived and combined with numerous common probability distributions including the lognormal generalized extreme value and log pearson type iii models resulting in a very simple and general approach to nffa our approach offers several advantages over existing approaches including parsimony ease of use graphical display prediction intervals and opportunities for uncertainty analysis we introduce nonstationary probability plots and document how such plots can be used to assess the improved goodness of fit associated with a nffa keywords natural hazards hydrologic design urbanization climate change streamflow rivers infrastructure hydraulic generalized extreme value lognormal log pearson 1 introduction the field of flood frequency analysis ffa has a long and rich history which has led to several manuals of practice available for different continents and countries including the united states iacwd 1982 usace 1993 the united kingdom nerc 1975 robson and reed 1999 stewart et al 2008 australia ball et al 2016 and continental europe madsen et al 2014 as well as summaries of the field of ffa in book chapters stedinger et al 1993 kottegoda and rosso 1997 stedinger 2016 books rao and hamed 2000 hosking and wallis 2005 and review articles greis 1983 bobée and rasmussen 1995 castellarin et al 2012 critical to nearly all traditional approaches to ffa summarized above is the assumption of stationarity loosely defined as the conditions under which key summary statistics of streamflows such as their moments or l moments do not systematically change with time ever since the seminal work by hurst 1957 hydrologists have been keenly aware of the complex behavior of streamflow and its relationships with climatic and other watershed conditions over the ensuing years numerous complex statistical representations were introduced in an effort to reproduce what became known as the hurst phenomenon see o connell et al 2016 more recently interest in the complexity of streamflow dynamics has grown exponentially due to improvements in our understanding of the impacts of numerous physical and social processes on streamflow including increasing urban populations causing major stresses to landscapes as well as water infrastructures and water availability e g vörösmarty et al 2000 global warming due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and a better understanding of the effects of both atmospheric oceanic processes and anthropogenic factors on the hydrological cycle e g ipcc 2013 this increased understanding awareness and interest has led to a tremendous increase in research associated with the detection attribution and prediction of hydrological processes such as the new scientific decadal 2013 2022 initiative of iahs entitled panta rhei everything flows which is dedicated to research activities on change in hydrology and society montanari et al 2013 as evidenced from recent review articles and special journal issues there are now myriad approaches under development for nonstationary flood frequency analysis nffa e g petrow and merz 2009 kiang et al 2011 salas et al 2012 madsen et al 2014 hall et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2017 for a general review of the literature on nffa methods we refer the reader to the review articles cited above after our introductory remarks we describe how our particular approach to nffa differs from previous efforts in spite of the tremendous increase in attention given to nffa there is still no consensus on a methodology for performing nffa in fact there is not even consensus on the need for nffa as described below nevertheless there is some effort by government agencies to update flood protection design guidelines to account for nonstationarity stedinger and griffis 2011 madsen et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2014 yet the proposed methods are by no means widely accepted nor tested despite tremendous interest in the development of methods of nffa considerable debate continues over whether stationary or nonstationary methods should be employed in practice see serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 and recent discussion by salas et al 2017 thus despite the recent interest in the development of nffa approaches milly et al 2008 milly et al 2015 considerable controversy remains as evidenced in the many papers which properly question the need for nonstationary approaches e g cohn and lins 2005 villarini et al 2009a villarini et al 2011 lins and cohn 2011 hirsch and ryberg 2012 matalas 2012 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 for example villarini et al 2011 and villarini et al 2009a summarize numerous studies including their own analyzes which did not provide statistical evidence of nonstationarity in flood series except where major watershed changes occurred even if there were acceptance on an approach to nffa many open questions remain concerning the selection of an appropriate design event under such conditions e g stedinger and griffis 2011 rootzén and katz 2013 obeysekera and salas 2014 salas and obeysekera 2014 read and vogel 2015 salas et al 2017 the lack of consensus results in part from the tremendous uncertainty associated with our ability to detect attribute and model past trends and the even greater uncertainty associated with our ability to predict future trends in hydrological processes the question of whether to perform a stationary or nonstationary flood frequency analysis remains an open question and probably should remain so as evidenced from the findings of o brien and burn 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and luke et al 2017 in a careful comparison of the precision uncertainty associated with various estimates of design flood events using both stationary and nonstationary methods luke et al 2017 found that stationary methods were nearly always preferred over nonstationary approaches vogel et al 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 and serinaldi and kilsby 2015 document how one can quantify the various factors which give rise to uncertainty in our ability to detect and model trends in hydrologic series obeysekera and salas 2014 o brien and burn 2014 and serinaldi and kilsby 2015 describe approaches to derive confidence intervals for design events under nonstationary conditions yet even in situations in which there is physical knowledge of the processes causing the hydrologic nonstationarity there is always considerable additional uncertainty associated with nffa so that risk based approaches to design event selection are paramount risk based decision approaches are now well established for selection of a design event based on the expected benefits and damages avoided versus the cost of the investment required national research council 2000 and such approaches are now standard practice by u s federal agencies see brekke et al 2009 stakhiv 2011 importantly given the additional uncertainty associated with nffa it is even more important to employ risk based approaches which consider both the possibility of a stationary and a nonstationary future rosner et al 2014 as well as a wide range of possible forms of future nonstationarity spence and brown 2016 the need for risk based approaches to the selection of a design event cannot be overemphasized because such approaches enable an accounting of most relevant sources of uncertainty e g stedinger and crainiceanu 2001 brekke et al 2009 sivapalan and samuel 2009 stakhiv 2011 rosner et al 2014 spence and brown 2016 the literature on approaches to nffa is growing rapidly as evidenced by the numerous recent reviews on the subject khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 madsen et al 2014 ehret et al 2014 bayazit 2015 salas et al 2017 such methods may be extremely important in urbanizing watersheds because as shown by vogel et al 2011 the annual maximum flood amf series associated with rivers in urbanized or urbanizing areas of the u s exhibited significant increases in magnitude over the past century a finding consistent with those of others konrad 2003 moglen and shivers 2006 villarini et al 2009b prosdocimi et al 2015 in spite of the fact that variations in stormwater infrastructure and rainfall climatology can lead to a wide spectrum of changes in urban watersheds smith et al 2013 olsen et al 1999 found significant increases in flood magnitudes in tributaries and the main stem of the northern portions of the upper mississippi river basin as well as for portions of the upper mississippi river near st louis mallakpour and villarini 2015 found significant increases in the frequency but not the magnitude of historic flood events in the central region of the u s despite considerable uncertainty over the impact of changes in climate on the behavior of floods e g koutsoyiannis et al 2008 hirsch and ryberg 2012 there is good evidence that changes in land use land cover agricultural practice and water infrastructure have led to considerable changes in the behavior of flood series villarini et al 2011 if an observed flood series is known to exhibit an increasing trend during some particular historical period then the magnitude of all upper quantiles associated with that flood series will also increase over that period under such conditions it would not be appropriate to report a single value of the 99th percentile i e flood with average return period of 100 years or to issue a floodplain delineation map without denoting the date associated with its creation in such situations in which historical trends in flood series are obvious and or overt due to knowledge of changes in historical land use climate and or water infrastructure it is imperative to provide updated estimates of design floods that reflect current conditions the goal of this study is to develop a suite of approaches to nffa which are particularly well suited to updating design events to current conditions 2 on the value of parsimony robustness resistance and efficiency a full appreciation of the methodology introduced here can only be understood with a knowledge of the concepts of parsimony robustness resistance and efficiency all of which have been given little attention in the area of nffa our long history of stationary ffa including a myriad of probability density functions pdf and parameter estimation methods introduced over 50 years ago led kuczera 1986 and others to introduce the concepts of robustness resistance and efficiency to help hydrologists choose a suitable approach kuczera 1986 defined a robust model as one which the analyst is confident to use as a predictive tool in the roles assigned to it he also introduced the properties of resistance and efficiency two properties expected of a robust model kuczera 1986 suggests that a resistant model must be capable of estimating extreme events irrespective of which contending flood distribution best represents the real world without disastrous loss of performance performance is indicated by some criterion such as mean squared error mse others had already sought resistant flood estimators such as in the seminal study by slack et al 1975 which found that in the absence of knowledge about the distribution of floods and associated economic losses the normal distribution was preferred over several more complex and commonly used skewed alternatives identification of a resistant estimator is not sufficient because a robust estimator must also perform efficiently in the sense of exhibiting low mse when compared to alternative estimators it has long been known that efficient low mse estimators tend to also be parsimonious box and jenkins 1976 a parsimonious estimator is one that accomplishes a desired level of prediction efficiency with as few model parameters as possible more recently laio et al 2009 and di baldassarre et al 2009 argue that all model selection criteria implicitly consider the principle of parsimony which they describe in terms of the inverse trade off between the bias and variance of an estimator i e more complex estimators tend to exhibit lower bias at the cost of increased variance still today even after the concept of parsimony has pervaded the early literature on ffa a common assumption of nffa literature is that more accurate estimates of flood quantiles result when more complex and improved estimators are employed thus recent reviews of nffa by khaliq et al 2006 and others describe myriad complex parametric and nonparametric nffa methods most of which have not been evaluated within the context of robustness and many of which are certainly not parsimonious as discussed below the few studies we could find which did evaluate the robustness of alternative nffa estimators in terms of both their resistance and efficiency found that the more parsimonious models tended to perform best serinaldi and kilsby 2015 luke et al 2017 as expected from our earlier experience on the value of parsimony in stationary ffa both serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and luke et al 2017 found that in the presence of the uncertainty concerning whether or not a flood series exhibits nonstationarity the more parsimonious stationary estimators were generally preferred however o brien and burn 2014 found that regional approaches to nffa may be preferred over regional approaches to ffa when significant nonstationarity is evident within a region there are many examples of the fact that parsimonious estimators often exhibit lower mse than more complex competing estimators even when the parsimonious estimator assumes an incorrect pdf for example lu and stedinger 1992 consider quantile estimators for the generalized extreme value gev distribution and show that for pdfs with realistic shape parameters a two parameter gev with fixed shape parameter such as the gumbel estimator generally had lower mse than the three parameter gev estimator even if the assumed shape parameter is misrepresented similarly kuczera 1986 found the parsimonious two parameter lognormal ln2 maximum likelihood estimator to exhibit lower mse when compared to numerous realistic three parameter alternatives in summary there exists extensive evidence of the value of parsimony in stationary ffa and after the two recent studies by serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and luke et al 2017 we expect the principle of parsimony to play an equally important role in nffa similarly castellarin et al 2012 found that relatively simple approaches to ffa with minimum data requirements were the preferred choice in many countries and by most of the institutions and agencies in charge of developing flood risk mitigation plans in europe the primary goal of this study is to introduce a parsimonious approach to nffa which only requires estimation of one additional parameter over and beyond a stationary ffa yet can be applied to any pdf regardless of the number of parameters 3 distinguishing features of methodology two general approaches have been applied to ffa and nffa consisting of the peaks over threshold approach pot and the use of the annual maximum flood amf series approach we only consider the amf approach though there may be considerable value to testing the pot approach for nffa in future studies i e see khaliq et al 2006 see stedinger et al 1993 section 18 6 1 and stedinger 2016 section 76 2 3 and associated references for guidance on when an amf analysis is preferred over a pot analysis existing approaches to nffa summarized in review articles by khaliq et al 2006 petrow and merz 2009 madsen et al 2014 ehret et al 2014 bayazit 2015 and salas et al 2017 usually involve fitting pdfs whose parameters and or moments are related to exogenous variables which are related to drivers of nonstationary behavior a variety of estimation methods have been advanced for estimating the combined nonstationary model consisting of a pdf and one or more models relating either moments or pdf model parameters to exogenous variables to fully understand many of the nffa methods advanced in the above cited reviews would require advanced training in statistics such as those based on generalized maximum likelihood generalized linear models kernel and wavelet density estimation quantile regression and bayesian approaches just to name a few a secondary goal of this study is to introduce a generalized approach to nffa which would not require advanced training in statistics to fully understand and implement one could argue that algorithms now exist in r software r core team 2015 to facilitate implementation of most of these advanced nffa approaches e g see gamlss software by stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 extremes software by gilleland and katz 2011 and neva software by cheng et al 2014 however unlike the methodology introduced here a complete understanding of those methods requires advanced training in statistics and some of these tools are not useful for distributions other than the generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto pdfs our approach differs from all previous work on nffa because it employs a single regression equation based on an exogenous variable from which the conditional mean conditional variance and conditional skewness of both series of annual maximum floods amf x and its logarithms y ln x may be derived to ensure consistency among the resulting moments and distributional model parameters as well as to ensure a parsimonious approach since only a single regression model is used to derive the conditional moments a parsimonious nffa can be developed with only one additional model parameter required to convert a stationary ffa into a nffa another contribution which sets this work apart from all previous work on methods for nffa when combining a pdf with models which relate pdf model parameters or moments to covariates it is important to ensure that the resulting nffa behaves in accord with flood observations another critical and distinguishing feature of our approach consider an example using a nonstationary gev pdf where the location scale and shape parameters are given by ξ α and κ respectively using notation from stedinger et al 1993 and stedinger 2016 consider the parsimonious model proposed by cheng et al 2014 and others in which only the location parameter is linearly related to time t so that ξ a bt with the scale and shape parameters fixed one can pose such a model and even show that the linear relationship is in accord with flood observations however such an approach could not make physical sense because holding α constant implies that the variance of the flood series does not change over time this results in a coefficient of variation of the flood series c which changes over time an unlikely result for flood series and a result inconsistent with many recent studies which have documented that the assumption of a constant value of c is reasonable at thousands of rivers i e vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 and hecht 2017 our parsimonious approach based also on a single model of the flood series versus a covariate employs conditional moments and conditional pdf model parameters derived from that model which ensure that the resulting nffa will always be in accord with the original flood observations another unique aspect of our proposed approach to nffa involves the myriad benefits which arise from the combination of a single possibly multivariate regression equation along with its corresponding exogeneous variable s and associated conditional moments derived for use with any pdf although herein we only apply it to four commonly used in ffa generalized extreme value gev lognormal ln2 lognormal ln3 and log pearson type iii lp3 those benefits summarized in the next section range from the numerous advantages of regression methods including rigorous graphical displays parsimony prediction intervals associated with trend extrapolations accommodation of complex multivariate nonlinear relationships and an ability to account for missing observations abrupt changes the impact of serial correlation and changes in the coefficient of variation of flood series on resulting statistical inference associated with the nffa we then describe our parsimonious approach to nffa which begins by introducing the theoretical regression framework for nffa including a derivation of the conditional moments of x and y ln x we then combine those conditional moments with the four pdfs considered gev ln2 ln3 and lp3 resulting in four different nffa models we then apply the resulting nffa models to amf series for two urbanizing basins near boston massachusetts finally we introduce nonstationary probability plots and associated goodness of fit metrics documenting how such procedures can be used to evaluate and possibly improve the practice of nffa 4 advantages of regression for nonstationary flood frequency analysis regression offers a generalized multivariate statistical approach for relating the behavior of flood series to covariate explanatory variables which can explain a portion of the variability of those floods conditional moments associated with a single bivariate regression model are derived and combined with a pdf to create a parsimonious nffa below we outline a dozen advantages of using regression within nffa which taken together offer significant advantages over alternative approaches ease of application ordinary least squares ols regression is a topic in most introductory statistics courses and is easy to implement in existing statistical software packages effective graphical communication regression is useful for communicating results because the goodness of fit of trend models can be conveyed both quantitatively and qualitatively in a single graphical image parsimonious estimation of conditional moments most previous studies on nffa develop separate independent regression equations for each moment and or model parameter leading to nffa with several additional parameters over stationary ffa instead as we suggest one may derive all conditional moments needed for nffa from a single regression model resulting in a parsimonious approach accommodation of changes in coefficient of variation of flood series a promising extension to our analysis would be through the use of weighted least squares wls regression for accommodating heteroscedastic regression residuals resulting from situations in which the coefficient of variation of flood series is changing see strupczewski and kaczmarek 2001 and hecht 2017 accommodation of nonlinear relationships a wide range of monotonic non linear functions can be linearized with ladder of powers transformations mosteller and tukey 1977 helsel and hirsch 2002 enabling the application of ols and wls linear regression methods for fitting highly nonlinear relationships analytical prediction intervals both confidence intervals corresponding to the true regression relationship as well as prediction intervals associated with future predicted floods are easily computed from analytical relations e g helsel and hirsch 2002 multivariate statistical modeling multivariate regression can be used to model the multiple and interacting impacts of various covariates which quantify the impact of climate land use and other factors on flood series kwon et al 2008 delgado et al 2010 lópez and francés 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2015 condon et al 2015 šraj et al 2016 hypothesis tests are also available for evaluating various alternative hypotheses model selection and evaluation numerous procedures such as cross validation random forests partial least squares ridge regression and best subsets selection methods are available for selection of covariates in multivariate regression models in addition influence statistics are available for evaluating the influence of outliers on regression coefficients helsel and hirsch 2002 such model selection procedures are of critical importance to ensure development of parsimonious multivariate models step changes or abrupt shifts changes in flood series may be either gradual or abrupt due to either anthropogenic perturbations such as reservoir construction or climatic shifts mccabe and wolock 2002 villarini et al 2009a to test for hypothesized abrupt step changes in flood series binary indicator variables that account for whether a covariate lies below or above a threshold can be added to a regression model bates et al 2012 handling of missing and historical information the conditional regression approach described here can easily account for intermittent or missing observations and in addition offers a parsimonious alternative to the expected moments algorithm cohn et al 1997 lamontagne et al 2016 for integrating non instrumental historical flood records into nffa if they are believed to represent an unbiased sample of floods during the historical period these tasks are accomplished by simply accounting for the time of occurrence associated with each flood and associated covariate observation accounting for persistence in hydrologic series given the short records typically available in hydrology it is often difficult to distinguish trends from short and long term persistence vogel et al 1998 both of which have been documented in amf series villarini et al 2009a tan and gan 2015 fortunately matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 developed analytical formulae to adjust standard errors of regression model coefficients for numerous common classes of persistence 5 regression model of annual maximum flood series our central goal is to combine pdfs which are widely accepted for modeling stationary amf series with conditional moments derived from a regression model which can describe the nonstationary behavior of amf series a distinguishing feature of this work is that very careful attention is given to the structure and theoretical properties of the regression models which all take the form 1 y f x β 0 β 1 w 1 β 2 w 2 ɛ where x denotes the amf series and y f x is some transformation of the amf series with w 1 w 2 denoting covariate climate land use and possibly other variables β1 β2 denoting model coefficients and ε denoting model error which is assumed to be independent homoscedastic and normally distributed a model of the form given in 1 with a logarithm transformation y ln x was carefully evaluated by vogel et al 2011 for amf series at thousands of rivers across the u s and by prosdocimi et al 2014 for rivers in the united kingdom in this initial study we employ a linear regression model using a logarithmic transformation of the amf series x in 1 leading to an exponential model for x which was shown by vogel et al 2011 to be an excellent representation of amf series in the u s regardless of whether the series was determined to exhibit a significant trend the basic premise of this work is that a regression of the form given in 1 can be developed for relating the amf series to one or more explanatory variables each of which would describe some portion of the possibly nonstationary behavior of the series another basic premise of this work is that the single regression model can be used to derive conditional moments needed to convert the stationary ln2 ln3 gev lp3 and other models into their nonstationary counterparts in this section we describe the initial regression model employed here along with its theoretical properties and associated conditional moments the goal of this study is to introduce a generalized approach to nffa based on the integration of a single regression model with various stationary pdfs thus we consider only a bivariate regression model here yet we encourage others to extend our work using multivariate yet parsimonious regression models which include covariates known to be drivers of nonstationary behavior to simplify the introduction of our methodology we consider only a single explanatory variable time selected as a surrogate for all the possible time dependent nonstationary influences on the amf series considered in two case studies we recommend that in any future application of our methodology investigators incorporate explanatory variables which can describe the physical influence of whatever nonstationary behavior is hypothesized for example in the case of the two urbanizing watersheds considered later relevant explanatory variables might be the area of directly connected impervious surfaces and other metrics which represent the influence of urbanization on the behavior of flood magnitudes we recommend development of multivariate models which include numerous additional covariates because this approach has been shown to improve upon our ability to describe future nonstationary behavior of flood series kwon et al 2008 delgado et al 2010 lópez and francés 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2015 condon et al 2015 5 1 the regression and its implied conditional and unconditional moments to introduce our generalized approach to nffa we employ the bivariate regression y β0 β1 w ε where y ln x with x representing the amf series and w represents an explanatory variable with other variables as defined in 1 both vogel et al 2011 and prosdocimi et al 2014 found this model with w equal to time to be useful for examining flood trends for rivers in the u s and the u k regardless of whether or not trends exist hirsch and ryberg 2012 also used this model to evaluate amf series at 200 long term rivers in the us with the covariate w equal to carbon dioxide concentrations we emphasize that the form of the regression model in 1 and its simpler form given below make no assumption regarding the probability distribution of y we also note that the results presented in this section for a bivariate regression would need to be extended for the multivariate case as is advocated elsewhere in this paper and by others the bivariate regression model can be rewritten in the form 2 y μ y β w μ w ɛ where y is conditioned upon the explanatory variable w μ y and μ w are the mean of the variables y and w respectively β is the regression coefficient and ε represents the model error which is assumed to be independent in time normally distributed and to have zero mean and constant variance with 3 σ ɛ 2 1 ρ 2 σ y 2 where ρ denotes the cross correlation coefficient between y and w estimates of the single regression coefficient in 2 may be obtained from 4 β ρ σ y σ w with ρ i 1 n w i w y i y t 1 n w i w 2 t 1 n y i y 2 σ y 1 n 1 i 1 n y i y 2 σ w 1 n 1 i 1 n w i w 2 y 1 n i 1 n y i and w 1 n i 1 n w i note for this very special case in which we are employing the explanatory variable w time which is not a random variable prosdocimi et al 2014 appendix a3 derive expressions for its sample mean and variance assuming no missing observations between the first and last years sample estimates of the mean and variance of w are equal to w n 1 2 and σ w 2 n n 1 12 5 2 unconditional moments when performing a stationary analysis the moments of x and y ln x will not depend on the explanatory variable w so that the unconditional moments of xand y are defined by their means μ x and μ y their standard deviations σ x and σ y and their skewnesses γ x and γ y suitable sample at site and or regional estimators of those moments will depend on the assumed pdf of x and y which are given in the appendix a 5 3 conditional moments of y here we use the regression in 2 to derive conditional moments of both x and y for use in nffa without making any assumptions regarding the probability distribution of either x or y taking the expectation of 2 leads to an expression for the expected value of y conditioned upon w 5 μ y w μ y β w μ w similarly the conditional variance of y is obtained by taking the variance of 2 which leads to 6 σ y w 2 σ ɛ 2 σ y 2 1 ρ 2 note that the conditional variance of y decreases as the explanatory power of the trend model increases with the limit approaching zero as ρ approaches unity note also that the conditional variance of y reduces to its original unconditional variance when the regression in 2 has no explanatory power i e ρ 0 note that numerous previous studies which have employed this same regression model in nffa did not account for the fact that the conditional variance of y given in 6 is generally smaller than its unconditional value see for example stedinger and griffis 2011 vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 and luke et al 2017 just to name a few analogous to the conditional mean and variance of y in 5 and 6 one can show that the conditional skewness of y is given by 7 γ y w γ y β 3 γ w the conditional skewness is equal to the unconditional skewness when the skewness of the explanatory variable is equal to zero which is the case when time is used as the explanatory variable w as employed in this study 5 4 conditional moments of x if one takes the exponential of both sides of the regression for y in 2 we obtain an expression for x 8 x w exp y w exp μ y β w μ w ɛ where here the notation xw and yw emphasizes that the values of xw and yw are conditioned upon the value of the explanatory variable w note that we have not yet made any assumptions regarding the pdf of x y xw or yw given the form of the regression in 2 the conditional values yw and xw are likely to be well approximated by a normal and lognormal distribution respectively regardless of the original pdf associated with the variable of interest here x this is true because the only random variable on the right hand side of 8 are the model errors ε and exp ε which were found to be well approximated by normal and lognormal distributions respectively for thousands of rivers in the u s regardless of whether or not the estimated trend model coefficient β was found to be statistically significant see results of normality hypothesis tests in appendix a2 of vogel et al 2011 thus only for the purposes of deriving an approximation to the conditional moments of x we use the fact that xw is likely to be well approximated by a lognormal distribution with conditional moments in log space given by μ y w and σ y w in 5 and 6 respectively regardless of the true underlying distribution of x thus the conditional moments of xcan be approximated using the standard expressions which relate the mean variance and skewness of x and y ln x for a lognormal variate which yields 9a μ x w exp μ y w σ y w 2 2 9b σ x w 2 exp 2 μ y w σ y w 2 exp σ y w 2 1 9c c x w σ x w μ x w exp σ y w 2 1 9d γ x w 3 c x w c x w 3 where c x w denotes the coefficient of variation of x conditioned on w eq 9 can be simplified by combining it with 5 and 6 so that 10a μ x w exp μ y β w μ w σ y 2 1 ρ 2 2 10b σ x w 2 exp 2 μ y 2 β w μ w σ y 2 1 ρ 2 exp σ y 2 1 ρ 2 1 10c c x w exp σ y 2 1 ρ 2 1 10d γ x w 3 c x w c x w 3 here we note that both the conditional mean and the conditional variance of x depend on the value of the explanatory variable w whereas both the conditional coefficient of variation and the conditional coefficient of skewness are constant see discussion below it is very important to understand the impact of nonstationarity in the moments of the flood series x on overall flow variability which can be explained by contrasting the unconditional coefficient of variation c x σ x μ x of the flood series given in 6 with its conditional value c x w given in 10c in general c x w cx as long as ρ 0 which will always be the case for a nonstationary series this can also be seen for the case when x follows an ln2 model where read and vogel 2015 show that the conditional coefficient of variation of x is given by 11 c x w c x 2 1 1 ρ 2 1 under nonstationary conditions there is always the question of whether or not the variability defined by the coefficient of variation of x is changing over time the ln2 case provides an excellent background for understanding this issue so often confused in the literature for the ln2 case the unconditional coefficient of variation of the flood series is given by c x exp σ y 2 1 which can be rewritten using 6 as c x exp σ ɛ 2 1 ρ 2 1 which is only constant if the regression in 2 exhibits homoscedastic residuals or residuals with constant variance thus one could employ a standard test of homoscedasticity of the residuals such as the one introduced by breusch and pagan 1979 or white 1980 to evaluate whether or not the coefficient of variation of the flood series is changing note that if the variance of the residuals σ ɛ 2 changes over time then cx is no longer constant and a heteroscedastic regression model is needed to characterize the conditional coefficient of variation of x as recommended by hecht 2017 one may also employ wls regression in the case of heteroscedastic model errors as described by strupczewski and kaczmarek 2001 interestingly after looking at hundreds of rivers across the u s using a 5 level modified breusch pagan 1979 test hecht 2017 found few examples of rivers even in urbanizing regions which exhibited values of cx which appear to change over time 6 probability distributions of annual maximum flood series vogel and wilson 1996 provide a review of the results of local regional continental and global studies which sought to determine a suitable pdf for modeling series of annual maximum floods they summarize the results of studies available as of that date along with the results of a survey of pdfs used by various agencies and countries worldwide on the basis of those surveys and literature review combined with their own national evaluation based on l moment diagrams for 1490 rivers in the u s vogel and wilson 1996 recommend the use of three distributions for modeling amf series including gev lp3 and the ln3 distributions in the most recent summary of ffa methods stedinger 2016 suggests that the gev and lp3 models are the most widely accepted among all the pdfs considered by the interagency advisory committee on water data 1982 see appendix 14 the ln2 and lp3 distributions performed best in their comparisons and were the only two distributions which did not exhibit significant bias in observed flood frequencies we note that the ln2 model is a special case of both the lp3 and ln3 models on the bases of these extensive national and global comparisons we develop nonstationary versions of the following four pdfs ln2 ln3 lp3 and gev these choices are also consistent with other recent studies including the large scale pan european evaluation by salinas et al 2014 which recommends the gev model england jr et al 2017 which recommends the lp3 model for the u s and ball et al 2016 which recommends both the lp3 and gev models for the australian continent although use of regional information is generally preferred over use of at site methods in both stationary hosking and wallis 2005 ouarda 2016 and nonstationary o brien and burn 2014 ffa in this initial study we employ at site parameter estimation methods which have been proven to be efficient in previous studies for each of the pdfs considered the parsimonious approach introduced here could be combined with the index flood assumption to enable extension to regional nffa 6 1 stationary and nonstationary quantile functions in this section we describe the stationary and nonstationary quantile functions corresponding to the ln2 ln3 gev and lp3 distributions since we employ these quantile functions with actual data for two urbanizing rivers in the following section we introduce both the stationary and the nonstationary quantile estimators to clarify how to implement the procedures introduced here the challenge here is to develop nonstationary quantile estimators which account for both the mean and variance of the amf series x being functions of the explanatory variable w thus our estimation methods must be flexible enough to enable the distributional parameters such as the lower bound of the ln3 and gev distributions to be functions of w yet be readily and easily implemented our experience indicates that whenever a trend in flood series is apparent there appears to be a noticeable trend in the corresponding lower bound of its pdf 6 1 1 lognormal ln2 the lognormal distribution is one of the most widely used distributions in hydrology stedinger 1980 provides guidance on the most efficient estimation methods for the ln2 and ln3 pdfs if the amf series x follows an ln2 distribution then y ln x follows a normal distribution stedinger 1980 shows that an attractive estimator of the quantile of a stationary ln2 variate is the maximum likelihood estimator given by 12 x p exp y z p v y where y 1 n i 1 n y i and v y 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 and zp is the inverse of a standard normal variable with nonexceedance probability p substitution of estimates of the conditional moments of y in 5 and 6 into the stationary quantile function of an ln2 variate leads to the nonstationary ln2 quantile estimator 13 x p w exp μ y w z p σ y w exp y β w i w z p σ y 2 β 2 σ w 2 where zp is the quantile function for a standard normal variable of nonexceedance probability p and the estimators w σ w 2 β y and σ y are given in 4 note that for the stationary case β 0 in which case 13 reduces to the well known stationary ln2 quantile estimator in 12 note also that numerous previous studies which have combined the same regression model used here with the ln2 pdf did not account for the reduction in the conditional standard deviation of y as is done here see for example stedinger and griffis 2011 vogel et al 2011 prosdocimi et al 2014 and luke et al 2017 just to name a few 6 1 2 log pearson type iii lp3 if the amf series x follows an lp3 distribution then y ln x follows a pearson type iii p3 distribution also termed a three parameter gamma pdf which can be characterized by its mean μ y standard deviation σ y and skewness γ y the lp3 is an extremely flexible distribution that can assume a wide range of distributional forms ranging from an exponential pdf when γ y 2 to an ln2 model when γ y 0 detailed procedures for estimation of the lp3 model under stationary conditions based on either at site gaged data as is assumed here or based on regional skew information are provided by both england jr et al 2017 and ball et al 2016 the nonstationary quantile function for an lp3 variate is obtained in a very similar fashion to that of the ln2 case again substitution of the conditional moments of y into the stationary quantile function of an lp variate leads to the nonstationary lp3 quantile estimator 14 x p w exp μ y w k p σ y w exp y β w i w k p σ y 2 β 2 σ w 2 where k p a max h 1 f 6 2 z p f 6 3 b a max 2 γ y w 0 4 b 1 0 0144 max 0 γ y w 2 25 2 f γ y w 0 063 max 0 γ y w 1 1 85 h b 2 γ y w a 1 3 which reduces to the stationary lp3 quantile function x p w exp y k p σ y when β 0 here zp and kp are the inverse of a standard normal and a three parameter gamma variate respectively with nonexceedance probability p while estimates of zp are widely available in most any mathematical software package kp is more difficult to estimate but may be approximated using the computational method recommended by kirby 1972 and given in 14 which is accurate for values of γ y 9 limits well beyond the skew values considered in this and most other studies for the case when the explanatory variable w in the regression does not exhibit skewness as is the case here using the variable time an at site estimator of conditional skewness γ y w in 7 may be estimated using the nearly unbiased estimator introduced by tasker and stedinger 1986 for the lp3 distribution 15 γ y w 1 6 n n i 1 n y i y 3 n 1 n 2 σ y 3 although this initial study only employs at site estimators we emphasize that at site estimates of sample skew are highly variable which is why england jr et al 2017 and others recommend computing a regional skew estimator which weighs estimates of at site and regional skews 6 1 3 generalized extreme value gev the gev distribution is a generalization of the type i ii and iii extreme value distributions also known as the gumbel frechet and weibull pdfs respectively it may be the most widely used pdf for modeling annual series of natural hazards and other extremes perhaps because it is the asymptotic distribution of the maximum value in an infinite sample with an extensive extreme value theory to support its application ghil et al 2011 the amf series represents the series of maxima each drawn from a very large number of discharges measured in each year following the notation from stedinger et al 1993 and stedinger 2016 the stationary quantile function of a gev variate is usually written in terms of the three parameters of the distribution α ξ and κ which characterize its scale location and shape respectively an estimate of the stationary gev quantile estimator is given by 16 x p ξ α κ 1 ln p κ although the generalized mles introduced by martins and stedinger 2000 are likely to be the most attractive parameter estimators for a gev variate especially if one has prior information we employ method of moments estimators here which have been shown to be more efficient than either l moment or mle s see stedinger 2016 for discussion and references stedinger 2016 table 76 4 reports expressions for the mean standard deviation and skewness of x denoted μ x σ x and γ x respectively as function of the pdf model parameters ξ α and κ bhunya et al 2007 report approximations for estimating the parameters ξ α and κ from gev samples based on sample estimates of the moments μ x σ x and γ x which we denote as x σ x and γ x respectively which are reproduced in appendix a substitution of the method of moment estimators of the stationary gev parameters given in a 1 a 2 and a 3 and denoted as ξ α and κ into 16 leads to the stationary gev quantile estimator similarly a nonstationary gev quantile function is obtained by replacing the sample moments μ x σ x and γ x with their conditional moments μ x w σ x w and γ x w given in 10 after substitution of estimates of those conditional moments into the method of moment estimators given in appendix a one obtains estimates of the conditional parameters denoted ξ x w α x w and κ x w leading to the nonstationary quantile function 17 x p w ξ x w α x w κ x w 1 ln p κ x w again we emphasize that much more attractive estimators of the gev distribution would employ regional information for estimation of the shape parameter κ for both stationary and nonstationary cases as is described in martins and stedinger 2000 el adlouni et al 2007 and stedinger 2016 6 1 4 three parameter lognormal ln3 if the amf series x follows an ln3 distribution then the variable u ln x tx follows a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to μ u and σ u the stationary quantile function for an ln3 variate has a very similar form to the stationary quantile function for an ln2 variate in 12 stedinger 1980 documents the most efficient estimators of the ln3 distribution under various conditions of interest to a hydrologist we take an analogous approach to the one we took with the gev distribution where we employed the method of moments for both the nonstationary and stationary cases here our goal is to fit both and stationary and nonstationary lognormal model using the method of moments since both unconditional and conditional estimates of those moments have been derived here for the nonstationary case a method of moment estimator of the stationary ln3 quantile estimator was given by singh et al 1990 as 18 x p τ x exp μ u z p σ u 2 where μ u 1 2 ln σ x 2 λ λ 1 σ u 2 ln λ τ x x σ x θ b 1 2 γ x γ x 2 4 θ 1 b 2 3 b 1 3 λ θ 2 1 with zp defined previously and the sample moments x σ x and γ x given in appendix a similarly the nonstationary ln3 quantile estimator is obtained from 19 x p w τ x w exp μ u w z p σ u w 2 where μ u w 1 2 ln σ x w 2 λ λ 1 σ u w 2 ln λ τ x w μ x w σ x w θ b 1 2 γ x w γ x w 2 4 θ 1 b 2 3 b 1 3 λ θ 2 1 and zp is the quantile function for a standard normal variable of nonexceedance probability p and the estimators μ x w σ x w and γ x w are given in a 4a a 4b and a 4d respectively note that for the stationary case β 0 in 2 in which case the nonstationary ln3 quantile function in 19 reduces to the stationary ln3 quantile function in 18 7 case study regression results in this initial study we consider the aberjona and neponset rivers which drain two urbanizing suburban watersheds near boston massachusetts both have long term u s geological survey gaging records the aberjona river usgs gage 01102500 drains a 24 mi 2 watershed in which impervious cover increased from 6 to 36 during the gaging period from 1940 to 2015 75 years fig 2 in allaire et al 2015 summarizes changes in watershed population and water withdrawals over this period the watershed area has no major flow regulations impoundments withdrawals or storm water detention systems see allaire et al 2015 for further information on the hydrologic properties of the aberjona river the neponset river usgs gage 01105000 at norwood ma has measured discharge from 1938 to 2015 77 years approximately 16 of the 34 7 mi 2 watershed is currently impervious flow in the neponset river is regulated by small mills and reservoirs upstream and is subject to municipal and industrial diversions both the aberjona and neponset river watersheds are obvious laboratories to test the application of nffa methodologies because of the gradual anthropogenic land cover changes that have occurred over the past century figs 1 and 2 use open circles to illustrate the relationship between the natural logarithm of the amf series y ln x and the explanatory variable w time for the aberjona river and the neponset river watersheds respectively using a 5 significance level we were unable to reject the null hypothesis of no trend for either river based on a t test of the regression slope coefficient also shown in each figure is the fitted regression model along with various other metrics associated with the model including the sample size n the goodness of fit metric r 2 which in this case of bivariate regression is simply equal to ρ 2 defined in 4 as well as the attained significance level p associated with the estimated regression coefficient β the attained significance level p is computed from the data and indicates the probability that one would obtain a value of β equal to or greater than the value obtained if the null hypothesis of no trend β 0 were correct in table 2 for both rivers we compare values of β based on ols regression with nonparametric estimates based on the nonparametric kendall theil slope estimator described by helsel and hirsch 2001 chapter 10 the attained significance levels in table 2 for the parametric and nonparametric cases are computed using a t test and the mann kendall trend test respectively we note the near equivalence of the parametric and nonparametric estimates β and very similar attained significance levels using both estimators it is important to consider both nonparametric and parametric estimates of the regression slope because this parameter plays such a critical role in our subsequent nffa and because as we show below the regression model residuals are poorly behaved which raises questions about our ability to perform statistical inference on the resulting models the extremely low attained significance levels for both rivers p 0 001 summarized in table 2 indicate that proof for a trend is so strong that there is very little possibility for evidence this strong or stronger to arise by chance if there were truely no trend it is equally important to consider the likelihood that we would reject a trend if it really existed because as vogel et al 2013 emphasize rejecting a trend when it really exists could have much greater societal consequences than accepting a trend when it does not exist see vogel et al 2013 rosner et al 2014 and prosdocimi et al 2014 for a discussion of the likelihood of type i and ii errors within the context of trend detection and the factors which could lead us to reject a trend when it really exists leading to substantial societal consequences we emphasize that one should never take the result of an individual hypothesis test based on a sample of limited length too seriously neyman and pearson 1933 suggest that no test based upon a theory of probability can by itself provide any valuable evidence of the truth or falsehood of a hypothesis but we may look at the purpose of tests from another viewpoint without hoping to know whether each separate hypothesis is true or false we may search for rules to govern our behavior with regard to them in following which we insure that in the long run of experience we shall not often be wrong it is in this light that we interpret the above results the fitted regression models in figs 1 and 2 represent the model of the conditional mean μ y w y β w w to highlight the uncertainty associated with future predictions of y ln x we also illustrate 95 prediction intervals in figs 1 and 2 which are intervals within which 95 of all flood observations y are expected to lie see section 9 4 5 in helsel and hirsch 2002 for an analytical formula for computing prediction intervals note that such prediction intervals widen considerably under extrapolation highlighting another important advantage of our approach because it emphasizes the increasing uncertainty inherent in extrapolation of trends future studies may wish to derive the variance and or confidence intervals associated with quantile estimates based on the various nonstationary pdf models introduced in this study analogous to the work of obeysekera and salas 2014 we refer the reader to section 9 4 4 of helsel and hirsch 2002 which provides estimates of the variance and or confidence intervals associated with the conditional mean regression estimator μ y w 7 1 regression model evaluations a necessary condition for any statistical inference to be performed on a fitted trend model based on ordinary least squares ols regression requires that model residuals be approximately homoscedastic normally distributed and independent in time figs 3 and 4 illustrate diagnostic plots which summarize the behavior of the regression model residuals for the regressions corresponding to the aberjona and neponset rivers respectively the following subplots are provided for each regression subplot a illustrates a histogram of the model residuals which should appear gaussian with a mean of zero subplot b displays the residuals y i y i versus wi and should appear to exhibit constant variance a breusch pagan 1979 test was performed which enables us to reject the null hypothesis of homoscedastic residuals constant variance at the 5 significance level for the aberjona river and fail to reject the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity for the neponset river the attained significance levels associated with the breusch pagan test were p 0 031 and p 0 628 for the aberjona and neponset river respectively a normal probability plot is illustrated in subplot c as well as the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc and its associated attained significance level p see vogel 1986 here the attained significance level p is interpreted a bit differently than for other tests again p is computed from the observations and indicates the probability of obtaining a value of ppcc smaller than the computed value if the null hypothesis of normality were correct the attained significance levels were p 0 725 and p 0 0062 for the aberjona and neponset river residuals respectively which implies that the aberjona probability plot is typical of what probability plots would look like if the samples were normal whereas very few normal probability plots for normal samples would look like the result obtained for the neponset river thus we cannot reject the null hypothesis of normality of the trend model residuals at the 5 level for the aberjona river but we do reject it for the neponset river finally subplot d is a correlogram displaying the lag k serial correlation coefficient of the residuals for lags of 1 50 along with 95 confidence intervals for the case of independence no serial correlation for the aberjona river the results in fig 3 combined with the breusch pagan and ppcc normality hypothesis tests reveal that model residuals appear to exhibit some heteroscedasticity yet they appear to be approximately independent and normally distributed for the neponset river the results in fig 4 combined with associated breusch pagan and ppcc normality hypothesis tests reveal that model residuals are approximately homoscedastic and independent but are poorly approximated by a normal distribution thus our diagnostic analysis of model residuals raises questions concerning our ability to perform statistical inference concerning nonstationary behavior in the amf at both sites for this reason we included nonparametric estimates of the regression model slope coefficient and associated attained significance levels for both rivers in table 2 7 2 stationary and nonstationary probability plots probability plots helsel and hirsch 2002 are a graphical technique to illustrate the goodness of fit of different pdfs to a set of data the degree of linearity of the observations in a probability plot corresponding to a hypothesized distribution is a measure of the goodness of fit of that particular pdf to the observations thus the linearity of the probability plot measured using a ppcc provides both a quantitative measure of the goodness of fit of the hypothesized pdf to the observations and can also be used to perform a hypothesis test for two parameter distributional alternatives vogel 1986 stedinger et al 1993 heo et al 2008 though hypothesis test results for three parameter distributional alternatives are questionable vogel and mcmartin 1991 until this study all procedures for developing probability plots and for computing ppcc test statistics have assumed stationarity we introduce a procedure for constructing nonstationary probability plots and for computing the ppcc to assess the possible improvement in goodness of fit which results when there is good evidence of nonstationary behavior in the amf series when performing diagnostic evaluations such as probability plots coles 2001 suggests working with a standardized version of the data conditional on the fitted parameter values standardization can remove the trend from the data effectively resulting in a transformation of the time series from nonstationary to stationary thus by standardizing either the x or y series using their conditional moments introduced here one can apply a stationary probability plot to the standardized series resulting in a nonstationary probability plot the steps used to construct stationary and nonstationary probability plots are enumerated below 1 standardize the observations of either x for gev and ln3 cases or y ln x for the ln2 and lp3 cases using the conditional moments for x and y given previously z i y i μ y w σ y w f o r l n 2 a n d l p 3 x i μ x w σ x w f o r g e v ln x i τ x w μ u w σ u w f

suitable plotting position pi from table 1 corresponding to the hypothesized distribution considered 4 plot the ordered set z p i z i i 1 n for the stationary and nonstationary case using the appropriate plotting position pi from table 1 to obtain estimates of the standardized variate z corresponding to each of the pdfs considered using z p i z p i f o r l n 2 a n d l n 3 x p i w μ x w σ x

the four distributions under both stationary and nonstationary assumptions and the corresponding ppccs are displayed in figs 5 and 6 for the aberjona and neponset watersheds respectively for the aberjona river the probability plots for the four nonstationary models are slightly more linear than the corresponding probability plots for the four stationary cases as evidenced by their slightly higher ppcc values in contrast for the neponset river the probability plots for the four nonstationary models are slightly less linear than the corresponding probability plots for the stationary cases as evidenced by their slightly lower ppcc values 7 3 discussion of hypothesis test results there are several important lessons to be learned from the above analysis first and foremost there is considerable physical evidence of drivers of nonstationarity for these two urbanized watersheds which led us to hypothesize that significant population growth and associated increases in impervious cover over the period of streamflow record led to increases in the amf series importantly this conjecture is supported by our fitted trend model and associated diagnostics the extremely low values of attained significance levels p 0 001 associated with the trend model slope coefficient at both the aberjona fig 1 and neponset fig 2 rivers corresponding to both the parametric t test and the nonparametric mann kendall test table 2 led to a high level of confidence that both amf series exhibited an increasing trend over the historical period diagnosis of the regression model residuals led us to question our ability to perform statistical inference concerning trends in both amf series because the aberjona river model residuals exhibited some heteroscedasticity and the neponset river model residuals exhibited some nonnormality these results lead us to question conclusions derived from statistical inference on both models including hypothesis tests and prediction intervals nevertheless since the nonparametric test results support our parametric test results we remain confident that both rivers exhibit nonstationary behavior which should be considered in any subsequent flood frequency analysis our analysis only considers a trend in the mean of y which implies that the coefficient of variation of x is fixed thus the mean and standard deviation of x both exhibit the identical trends the apparent heteroscedasticity of the model residuals for the aberjona river indicates that a more complex model which allows for a time varying coefficient of variation of x should be considered when model residuals exhibit heteroscedasticity ols estimates of regression model parameters are unbiased but the standard t test of model parameter significance can lead to incorrect inferences long and ervin 2000 to ensure correct inferences concerning regression model parameters in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form long and ervin 2000 and others have suggested the use of a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix and associated standard errors while such approaches enable improved statistical inference in the presence of heteroscedasticity they do not provide an approach to model changes in the coefficient of variation analogous to the regression approach we have introduced to describe the time variation in y corresponding to a trend in both the mean and variance of x holding coefficient of variation constant it is possible to introduce a time varying function for the coefficient of variation of x and to integrate that function into the quantile function of x to enable improved estimation of design events hecht 2017 summarizes several attractive approaches for considering time variations in the coefficient of variation given an assumed model form including the use of weighted least squares regression strupczewski and kaczmarek 2001 heteroscedasticity consistent standard errors long and ervin 2000 as well as by simply fitting independent regression models for the mean and standard deviation of x our parsimonious approach to modeling a trend in the mean and variance of x assuming constant coefficient of variation provides a reasonable initial approach for estimating the nonstationary 100 year flood however further research is needed to develop a parsimonious approach for determining the impact of changes in the mean variance and coefficient of variation of x on a design event 7 4 comparisons of stationary and nonstationary design events of critical interest in practice are estimates of selected quantiles of the distribution of the amf series under both stationary and nonstationary conditions to enable one to update design events to reflect conditions in a particular year one simple yet effective way to understand the impact of the trend model on resulting design events is to compute the decadal magnification factor m exp δ t β exp 10 β vogel et al 2011 corresponding to the nonstationary ln2 model the decadal magnification factors for the neponset and aberjona rivers are 1 089 and 1 136 respectively this indicates that al flood quantiles have increased at the rate of about 9 and 14 per decade over the historical period for the neponset and aberjona rivers respectively table 3 summarizes estimates of the 100 year flood denoted x 100 corresponding to each of the four hypothesized pdfs for both rivers along with corresponding estimates of the ppcc statistics for both the stationary and nonstationary analyzes estimates of the 100 year flood based on nonstationary conditions are obtained for the most current year on record wn so that they reflect the 100 year flood under current conditions as of 2015 in contrast estimates of the 100 year flood under stationary conditions are not updated to current conditions but reflect average conditions over the observed period of flows numerous conclusions can be drawn from table 3 combined with our previous trend model diagnostics if one ignores any possibility of nonstationarity using a traditional stationary ppcc lognormal hypothesis test we were unable to reject the ln2 hypothesis for the amf series at both rivers at the 5 level a nonstationary analysis led to uniform improvements in the goodness of fit as evidenced by increases in ppcc values for all four models considered for the aberjona river in contrast for the neponset river the nonstationary analysis did not result in an improvement in goodness of fit over a stationary analysis though that may be due in part to the occurrence of an unusually large flood of record in the middle of the period of record see fig 2 this is because when there is a positive trend in the flow series the nonstationary quantile function will produce the largest design floods at the end of the historical period table 3 documents the considerable increases in estimates of the 100 year flood which result from using nffa to update design events to reflect current 2015 conditions for both rivers engineers would be advised to consider the nonstationary estimates of x 100 as an improvement over the stationary estimates because there is both good statistical evidence and plausible physical drivers for the increases in amf series physical evidence is provided by the considerable increases in urbanization that have occurred in both basins statistical evidence is provided by the extremely low attained significance levels associated with the nonparametric mann kendall trend test results in table 2 interestingly the design flood estimates in 2015 corresponding to the nonstationary ln2 ln3 and gev models are nearly equal at both rivers it is only the design flood corresponding to the lp3 nonstationary model which differs from the other nonstationary models to enable rigorous comparisons among the precision of these alternative design flood estimates studies of the type performed by obeysekera and salas 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 and luke et al 2017 are needed to compare the uncertainty associated with such stationary and nonstationary design flood estimates given the relatively short series of observations available corresponding to potential nonstationary hydrologic conditions there will always be considerable uncertainty as to whether or not a stationary or nonstationary analysis is warranted that fact further highlights the need to include both the stationary and nonstationary results in any decision oriented analysis as recommended and documented by rosner et al 2014 8 conclusions despite widespread awareness of the impact of anthropogenic influences on extreme floods and droughts there remains considerable controversy and debate concerning the development of a generalized sensible and practical methodology for nffa to enable updating of design events to reflect current or future hydrologic conditions the lack of consensus results in part from the tremendous uncertainty associated with our ability to detect attribute and model past trends and the even greater uncertainty associated with our ability to predict future trends in hydrological processes nevertheless risk based decision making rbdm approaches have been used for decades and are now a well established methodology for the determination of appropriate levels of investment based on the expected damages avoided versus the cost of the infrastructure required national research council 2000 usace 2000 tung 2005 incorporation of nonstationarity into such rbdm analysis only increases the level of uncertainty associated with such analysis but does not change our overall approach to selection of a suitable design event see rosner et al 2014 for an example our brief review and discussion of the state of the art of nffa revealed a wide range of modeling approaches including extremely sophisticated statistical methods with little attention given to the concept of parsimony we reviewed historical literature which documents the tremendous value of parsimonious models for stationary ffa and we have good reason to suspect similar value to parsimony in nffa our primary goal was to introduce a generalized sensible parsimonious and practical approach to nffa to enable the determination of a flood quantile when hydrologic change is an obvious concern our nonstationary analysis differs from most previous approaches because it only requires one additional parameter trend model slope over and beyond a stationary analysis our approach is based on derived conditional moments of a single trend regression which accounts for possible changes to the first three conditional moments of streamflow with only the addition of a single additional model parameter we have outlined how integration of a single bivariate regression into nffa offers several advantages over existing approaches including parsimony ease of use graphical display prediction intervals accommodating missing and or historical information accounting for abrupt shifts accounting for persistence extensions to multivariate trend models and opportunities for uncertainty analysis we have also introduced nonstationary probability plots and associated goodness of fit statistics to quantitatively assess the improved goodness of fit associated with a nffa over a stationary analysis many packages written in r software r core team 2015 facilitate the application of advanced nffa approaches e g see gamlss software by stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 extremes software by gilleland and katz 2011 and neva software by cheng et al 2014 however unlike the methodology introduced here a complete understanding of those methods requires advanced training in statistics furthermore unlike our methodology which could be extended to any pdf some of the above referenced software tools are not useful for distributions other than the generalized extreme value gev and generalized pareto pdfs our parsimonious approach to nonstationary flood frequency analysis nffa is based on a single bivariate regression equation which describes the relationship between annual maximum floods x and an exogenous variable which can explain the nonstationary behavior of x in this initial study we only consider a single explanatory variable time selected as a surrogate for all the possible time dependent nonstationary influences on the amf series considered in two case studies we recommend development of multivariate models which include numerous additional covariates because this approach has been shown to improve upon our ability to describe future nonstationary behavior of flood series kwon et al 2008 delgado et al 2010 lópez and francés 2013 prosdocimi et al 2014 2015 condon et al 2015 šraj et al 2016 using a single bivariate regression model the conditional mean variance and skewness of both x and y ln x are derived and combined with numerous common probability distributions including the lognormal generalized extreme value and log pearson type iii models resulting in a very simple and parsimonious yet very general approach to nffa numerous natural extensions to our initial bivariate regression analysis are possible including consideration of other probabilistic models derivation of conditional moments for multivariate regression derivation of confidence intervals for nonstationary quantile estimators and application to drought and low flow frequency analysis perhaps the most promising extension to our initial work would be to develop regional estimates of the conditional skew and possibly the conditional coefficient

873,this paper draws together several lines of argument to suggest that an ecohydrological framework i e laboratory field and theoretical approaches focused on hydrologic controls on biota has contributed substantially to our understanding of the function of river networks as ecological corridors such function proves relevant to the spatial ecology of species population dynamics and biological invasions the spread of waterborne disease as examples we describe metacommunity predictions of fish diversity patterns in the mississippi missouri basin geomorphic controls imposed by the fluvial landscape on elevational gradients of species richness the zebra mussel invasion of the same mississippi missouri river system and the spread of proliferative kidney disease in salmonid fish we conclude that spatial descriptions of ecological processes in the fluvial landscape constrained by their specific hydrologic and ecological dynamics and by the ecosystem matrix for interactions i e the directional dispersal embedded in fluvial and host pathogen mobility networks have already produced a remarkably broad range of significant results notable scientific and practical perspectives are thus open in the authors view to future developments in ecohydrologic research keywords metapopulation models metacommunity models spatially explicit ecology directional dispersal substrate topology 1 introduction 1 1 the context although natural ecosystems are characterized by striking diversity of form and functions they often exhibit symmetries at times emerging across scales of space time and organizational complexity levin 1992 one angle through which such features could be looked at is via the necessary linkages among macroecological laws banavar et al 2007 southwood et al 2006 where scaling theory offers a powerful tool to make way for coherent unified descriptions of patterns in species numbers and their abundance and size patterns also emerge in relation to broad ecosystem features like the topology of the substrate for ecological interactions bertuzzo et al 2007 2011b fagan 2002 muneepeerakul et al 2008 it is remarkable that we observe some emerging features like the distribution of species persistence times at observation sites bertuzzo et al 2011b that are controlled more by the nature of the landscape where interactions occur than by many features specific to the underlying ecosystem a large body of empirical bertuzzo et al 2011b ricklefs 1987 and laboratory altermatt et al 2011a carrara et al 2012 giometto et al 2013 holyoak and lawler 2005 evidence was collected to support such a view this result a rather far reaching one is well captured by spatially explicit ecological approaches which we introduce below within the above ecohydrological framework river network structures and their embedded hydrologic dynamics play an important role rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 in fact they provide supporting landscapes for ecological processes many of which are essential to human life and societies to name a few on which we shall return historically human settlements followed the river networks for the necessary water resources ammermann and cavalli sforza 1984 river networks are home to and provide hierarchical habitat features for freshwater fish bertuzzo et al 2007 fagan 2002 muneepeerakul et al 2008 and in general stream ecology battin et al 2008 2003 as well as pathways to life threatening waterborne human diseases rinaldo et al 2017 and zoonoses i e infections that can be passed between animals and humans river networks may be also seen as meta ecosystems that affect the metabolism of terrestrial organic carbon in freshwater ecosystems an important part of the global carbon cycle battin et al 2003 raymond and bauer 2001 and the amount of nutrients removed from streams and reservoirs affected by network structure and stream ecology therein alexander et al 2000 battin et al 2008 thus a broad and scientifically worth field of research exists where signatures coexist of the hydrologic ecologic and geomorphologic dynamics of river basins this field has proved its importance e g by furthering our understanding of spatially explicit epidemiology and ecology sections 2 4 our ultimate goal is a comprehensive theory of how dendritic structures their associated features and interactions with external forcings chiefly hydrological stochasticity shape emergent properties of various ecosystems such a theory would help us address a wide variety of important questions from conservation plans for freshwater ecosystems to optimal control for containing water borne disease epidemics to proper inclusion of riparian systems into large scale resources management d odorico et al 2010 rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 understanding and control of biological invasions is also part of this scheme while providing what we believe is a useful review the novelty of this paper lies in its global vision of a research area where hydrology ecology and geomorphology intersect and where we feel that important advances and their applications will be made in the near future this is by no means a definitive statement of the roles of river networks as ecological corridors but rather a blueprint for future developments throughout the paper in fact we suggest research areas that look to us as particularly promising including ecological dynamics into riverine systems is not an easy task given the variety of the taxa involved their trophic positions the interactions between the different organisms ranging from competition to predation to parasitism very frequently if the aim is to investigate population dynamics the analysis is restricted to one or few species or functional groups this is what has been done e g when exploring zebra mussel invasions mari et al 2011 or cholera dynamics bertuzzo et al 2011a if instead the aim is to investigate general patterns of biodiversity one usually considers specific taxa or groups usually sharing the same trophic level e g fish or phytoplankton or riparian vegetation in this case the main operating ecological interaction is interspecific competition either indirect e g exploitation of common food resources or nutrients or direct e g via interference available data are usually lists of presence absence of species possibly complemented by their relative abundances the latter s being averaged over time or simply measured in a given year if the identity of the species is neglected it is possible to derive species abundance distributions namely the number of species that have a certain abundance or a certain abundance rank static models of species abundance relations have long been proposed to that goal see e g pielou 1977 for an excellent review dynamic models in which the observed relation is obtained as the long term equilibrium of a model containing the basic time dependent processes that shape community biodiversity are more recent the processes shaping the maintenance of biodiversity are four vellend 2010 selection namely the difference in the species fitnesses and therefore in their competitive ability it operates in both ecological and evolutionary time drift namely the inherent stochasticity which brings species to extinction and operates in ecological time scale only when the size of the community is rather small speciation which counters drift and selection over evolutionary timescales dispersal which counters local species extinction via the movement of organisms across space and acts in ecological timescales the seminal paper for the related dynamic models caswell 1976 borrowed concepts of neutral molecular evolution and applied them to the ecological context the organic development of a neutral theory of biodiversity have been presented in a unified way only much later hubbell 2001 the main tenet therein assumes that all species are competitively equivalent at a per capita level and that selection i e differences in competitive ability stated otherwise is not operating while drift is countered by speciation or dispersal chave et al 2002 concerning this last point it is important to remark that most neutral theories are spatially implicit usually they consider either an isolated community whose composition is not location specific and is driven by drift while community survival is guaranteed by speciation or a local non isolated community whose survival is guaranteed by immigration from a background metacommunity a coherent theory that considers all the four processes in a space explicit framework distinguishing between ecological and evolutionary time scales is still lacking but see chave et al 2002 economo and keitt 2008 for notable attempts the present paper aims at partially filling such a gap by presenting a series of models that are always space explicit and suited to specifically describing the peculiar structure and thus connectivity of river basins we proceed step by step first including the dendritic substrate of river basins into the neutral paradigm of biodiversity then breaking perfect neutrality by adding either space dependent carrying capacities of local communities or elevational niche apportionment species invasion and disease spread is subsequently investigated by paying greater attention to realistic details though with a species specific focus and within fluvial ecological substrates to set the context we start with an example of the simplest dynamic model of biodiversity the neutral one hubbell 2001 in fact inclusion of all factors no matter how detailed and realistic seemed hardly a good starting point for the quest of how biodiversity patterns are influenced by river network configuration rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 it should be noted that some unrealistic assumptions of the neutral theory have attracted much criticism mcgill et al 2006 nee 2005 purves and turnbull 2010 e g in terms of timescales testability and robustness also the neutral theory overlooks much species specific ecological information which is required when studying the dynamics of the system or of a set of particular species and the interactions among them chave et al 2002 however the neutral model has the advantage of letting us introduce the biodiversity shaping processes one by one in fact the neutral theory switches off all the differences between species and all the interactions with the exception of strong competition for space both intra and inter species as we shall recall below being focused on competition for space it is thus particularly suited to test the fundamental differences between the spatial structure of river basins and 2d isotropic landscapes our first approach thus focuses on the quantitative assessment of the role of directionality and network structure on ecological organization in particular on patterns of diversity distribution here we show how the implementation of the neutral theory behaves in 2d lattices or 2d space filling trees imposing directional dispersal muneepeerakul et al 2007 rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 two different frameworks namely an individual based contact model and a metacommunity model will be introduced to that end the investigation on the differences between the two substrates the common name for the ecosystem landscape where interactions occur proved important to later developments chiefly laboratory ones section 2 1 2 neutral individual based models and beyond in our neutral individual based model a 2d lattice is termed savanna to echo its ecohydrological background that is the ecological substrate is represented simply by a square lattice in which each site or pixel is occupied only by one individual say a tree by contrast as river landscapes we use a space filling tree an optimal channel network ocn see appendix built in a lattice of the same size of the savanna in a space filling network all sites are channelized fig 1 b the dynamics at each time step is defined as follows a randomly selected individual i e at a randomly picked pixel dies with probability ν termed diversification rate this site is occupied by a new species with probability 1 ν the site is colonized by an offspring of one of the neighbours with equal probability the two landscapes differ only in the definition of neighbours for the savanna in fact the offspring that colonizes the empty site is chosen among the individuals that occupy the four nearest neighbours boundary effects at the edges of the lattice are removed by implementing a genetic algorithm bertuzzo et al 2011b muneepeerakul et al 2007 for the networked landscape the neighbourhood of a pixel is constituted by the nearest pixels connected to it by the network edges thus dispersion is directional in that physical proximity may not imply connectivity the number of drainage directions in or out of the node define the viable connectivity at any site pixels physically neighboring the site where the individual dies do not count for its replacement if unconnected to the site notice that all pixels except for the outlet have only one downstream neighbour source pixels have no upstream neighbours whereas all the others have one or more upstream neighbours patterns are obtained by iterating the process until it reaches a stationary state the two upper insets of fig 1 illustrate the resulting spatial biodiversity configuration in the two landscapes pixels labeled by the same colour represent individuals belonging to the same species the lower panel shows the typical associated rank abundance curves the results are remarkably different it can be noticed in particular that the configuration of the space and the directionality of the dispersal imposed by the network landscape determine a higher species richness moreover the spatial configuration of the patches of the same species in the network landscape have sharp boundaries that resemble the boundaries of subbasins differences only arise because of the different connectivity imposed by the two landscapes adding another factor typical of the dispersal in network landscape such as biased transport e g offsprings colonizing preferably downstream would only enhance the observed differences this proved an important result although the results from this simple neutral individual based model are not to be taken as fully representative of reality they rather forcefully demonstrate that differences may arise in key biodiversity features simply because of the presence of the drainage network acting as ecological substrate thus the potentially fundamental roles played by the river network warranted more refined modelling schemes to investigate other important issues in that light another set of results from a more structured neutral model muneepeerakul et al 2008 2007 proves revealing in this model the landscape is organized in local communities lc each of which contains a certain number of sites every site contains only one individual in this way a genuine metacommunity model is defined the dynamic rule is similar to the one used for the previous unstructured model and is repeated here for clarity at each time step an individual randomly selected from all individuals in the system dies with probability ν the diversification rate this will be occupied by a new species with probability 1 ν the empty site will be colonized by an offspring of a species already existing in the metacommunity in the latter case the probability pij that the empty site in lc i will be colonized by a species from lc j is determined as follows muneepeerakul et al 2007 1 p i j 1 ν k i j h j j 1 n k i j h j where kij is the dispersal kernel the fraction of offspring produced at lc j that arrives at lc i after dispersal hj is the habitat size of lc j that is the number of sites in lc j and n is the total number of lcs all individuals in lc j have the same probability of colonizing the empty unit in lc i where the death took place note that the standard neutral theory is in a way improved by assuming that different lcs have different habitat size neutrality still holds for dispersal that is the dispersal kernel of every species is assumed to be the same as in the previous example in the context of metacommunity models the dispersal kernel kij contains the information on the landscape spatial structure and how individuals move about therefore the key difference between savanna and river network metacommunities lies in their respective dispersal kernels the dispersal kernels are typically assumed to take the form of exponential decay note that unlike in contact processes ref an offspring can travel farther than its immediate neighbors in each time step in metacommunities biodiversity patterns are measured by α β and γ diversities anderson et al 2011 whittaker 1972 α diversity is a local description of biodiversity and γ a global one both being inventory measures because they refer to the number of species β diversity is a differentiation diversity measuring the rate of change in or the turnover of the species measuring how species compositions in local communities differ from one another in the following γ diversity is defined as the total number of species in the entire metacommunity α diversity is a number of species in a randomly chosen lc it is also useful to consider its mean value averaged across all lcs denoted by α the between community diversity or β diversity is a conceptual quantity that can be defined in many ways all of which share the same general idea the higher the β diversity the more different the local communities here it is defined as γ α and one is referred to the original references for related results muneepeerakul et al 2007 the main result of the structured metacommunity model is that network structure and dispersal anisotropy affect decisively any biodiversity measures in this case the dispersal rate is defined as the fraction of propagules that is dispersed away from their birth local community and the directionality is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio between the fractions of propagules at the nearest neighbors in the preferred and opposite directions of dispersal muneepeerakul et al 2007 all three diversity measures in both types of landscapes shown in fig 1 appear to be quite sensitive to dispersal anisotropy in particular river networks result in metacommunities with higher β diversity i e more localized and heterogeneous ecosystems this is due to a containment effect in river basins cross subbasin dispersal is hindered by topographical divides resulting in subbasins being more dissimilar from one another echoing important field evidence fagan 2002 1 3 distribution of persistence times another macroecological pattern is relevant to our general tenet specifically we study the distributions of local species persistence time τ defined as the timespans between its emergence and local extinction in a given geographic region empirical distributions pertaining to different taxa have been analyzed in the above space explicit framework bertuzzo et al 2011b notably breeding birds and herbaceous plants the approach critically accounts for the finiteness of the observational period of any field data a problem that is often overlooked and that may remarkably distort the true features of persistence times their distributions exhibit power law scaling limited by a cut off determined by the rate of emergence of new species bertuzzo et al 2011b note that although generalizations are possible the study of persistence times was conducted on trophically equivalent co occurring species theoretical investigations on how the scaling features depend on the topological structure of the spatial interaction networks proved worthwhile bertuzzo et al 2011b at a local scale τ is largely controlled by ecological processes operating at short timescales e g population dynamics immigration contractions expansions of species geographic ranges as local extinctions are dynamically balanced by colonizations levins 1969 macarthur and wilson 1967 ricklefs 1987 at a global scale originations and extinctions are controlled by mechanisms acting on macroevolutionary timescales diamond 1989 jablonski 2008 from a theoretical viewpoint the simplest baseline demographic model is a random walk without drift according to which the abundance of a species in a geographic region has the same probability of increasing or decreasing by one individual at every time step according to this scheme local extinction is equivalent to a random walker s first passage to zero and thus the resulting persistence time distribution has a power law decay with exponent 3 2 chandrasekhar 1943 newman 2005 a more realistic description can be achieved by accounting for basic ecological processes like birth death migration and speciation possibly in neutral mean field schemes hubbell 2001 muneepeerakul et al 2008 volkov et al 2003 as described above here when a randomly selected individual dies and the space or resources are freed up for colonization with probability ν the site is taken by an individual of a species not currently present in the system thus ν is equivalent to a diversification rate and accounts for both speciation and immigration from surrounding communities with residual probability 1 ν the died individual is replaced by one offspring of an individual randomly sampled within the community chave et al 2002 durrett and levin 1996 global scale independent dispersal as such the probability of colonization by a species depends solely on its relative abundance in the community the asymptotic behavior t 1 of the resulting persistence time distributions i e pτ t exhibits a power law scaling limited by an exponential cut off 2 p τ t t α e ν t with exponent α 2 pigolotti et al 2005 in eq 4 time is expressed in generation time units hubbell 2001 i e it has been rescaled in such a way that the death rate is equal to one notably in the mean field scheme the probability distribution depends solely on the diversification rate which accounts for speciation and migration processes and imposes a characteristic timescale 1 ν for local extinctions while speciation rates are not expected to vary too much with the spatial scale of analysis immigration rates decrease as the spatial scale increases in fact the possible sources of migration chiefly dependent on the geometrical properties of the boundary and the nature of dispersal processes are argued to scale sub linearly with the community size bertuzzo et al 2011b which in turn is linearly proportional to geographic area brown 1995 macarthur and wilson 1967 as continental scales are approached migration processes almost vanish and the diversification rate ultimately reflects only the speciation rate we now provide evidence of different non trivial exponents observable as a function of the topology of the substrate instead of a mean field model we use a space explicit scheme in which dispersal limitation and the actual network of spatial connections are taken into account the neutral game described above has been implemented in regular one two and three dimensional lattices fig 2 in which every site represents an individual whose species is labeled via a specific color bertuzzo et al 2011b key to our reasoning we explore the patterns emerging from the application of the model to dendritic structures mimicking riverine ecosystems where dispersal processes and ecological organization are constrained by the network structure to this end we use again optimal channel networks ocns rinaldo et al 2014 1992 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 appendix as space filling within arbitrary domains mathematical constructs that yield aggregation patterns and landscape forms statistically indistinguishable from real life river networks rinaldo et al 1999 to account for limited dispersal effects only the offsprings of the nearest neighbors of the dying individual are allowed to possibly colonize the empty site in the networked landscape the neighbourhood of a site is defined by the closest upstream and downstream sites limited dispersal in fact promotes the clumping in space of species which enhances their coexistence and survival probability chave et al 2002 kerr et al 2002 fig 2 shows the results of the neutral exercise described above containing a truly remarkable message in fact in all the considered landscapes persistence time distributions follow a finite size power law behaviour characterized by smaller highly non trivial scaling exponents with respect to the mean field model these power laws too are inevitably limited by an upper exponential cutoff persistence time distributions deducted from the theoretical models change when dispersal kernels more general than dispersal from nearest neighbors are considered as expected as long as the mean dispersal distance remains small with respect to the system size the distribution exhibits a longer transient regime but eventually ends up scaling as the one predicted by the nearest neighbors dispersal bertuzzo et al 2011b relaxing the neutral assumption hubbell 2001 by implementing an individual based competition survival tradeoff model chave et al 2002 has also been tested bertuzzo et al 2011b specifically species with higher mortality rates are assumed to hold more competitive ability in colonizing empty sites brown 1995 tilman et al 1994 it is important to note that the trade off model also exhibits power law distributions of τ showing exponents indeed close to those of the neutral model by contrast the mean time to extinction is larger in the trade off model and consequently species richness is higher we thus conclude that the theoretical results concerning the shape of persistence time distributions are robust with respect to both change in the dispersal range and relaxations of the neutrality assumptions however our results should not be seen as a test for the neutrality hypothesis hubbell 2001 for empirical distributions but rather as tools to reveal emerging universal and macroscopic patterns regardless of the detailed features of the particular model incidentally a meaningful assessment of species local extinction rates is deemed valuable from a conservation perspective species persistence time distributions are in fact a robust tool to quantify the timespan of the species assembly currently observed within a given geographic area and to some extent predict the expected amount of future local extinctions mathematically in fact τ is defined as the time to local extinction of a species randomly sampled from the system regardless of its current abundance although these patterns cannot provide information about the behavior of a specific species or of a particular patch inside the ecosystem considered e g a biodiversity hotspot they can effectively describe the overall dynamical evolution of the ecosystem diversity 1 4 testing directional connectivity in the laboratory the abstract examples discussed above strongly suggest that directional dispersal has a major impact on the resulting biodiversity distributions in other words the above examples imply that the topology of the substrate for ecological interactions has a defining role for the distribution of species richness in space and time regardless of the ecosystem s specific features and environmental drivers clearly this suggestion has had a fundamental importance in the way we now look at river networks as ecological corridors for instance β diversities computed separately for headwaters and confluences test the differences in species composition within the river network structure headwaters exhibit not only a higher variability in α diversity but also a higher β diversity compared with confluences see benda et al 2004 carrara et al 2012 fagan 2002 these results reveal the crucial importance of headwaters as a source of biodiversity for the whole landscape in natural systems other local environmental factors may play a role in structuring ecosystems brown and swan 2010 nevertheless the neutral metacommunity approach sheds light on the single effect of directional dispersal on biodiversity note that the patterns found in river network geometries are predicted to be even stronger in the presence of a downstream dispersal which is typical for many passively transported riparian and aquatic species in river basins bertuzzo et al 2007 morrissey and de kerckhove 2009 we thus suggest that species constrained to disperse within dendritic corridors are characterized by increased spatial persistence and lower extinction risks on the other hand heterogeneous habitats sustain higher levels of biodiversity among local communities that can be altered by modifying the connectivity of the system with broad implications for community ecology and conservation biology for simplified landscapes often described geometrically by linear or lattice structures a variety of local environmental factors exist that create and maintain diversity among habitats de aguiar et al 2009 hubbell 2001 volkov et al 2003 many highly diverse landscapes however exhibit hierarchical spatial structures that are shaped by geomorphological processes they are neither linear nor lattice like and therefore environmental substrates for ecological interactions shaped as trees may be appropriate to describe biodiversity of species living within fluvial dendritic ecosystems benda et al 2004 carrara et al 2012 the above suggestions are far reaching in fact species or populations whose ecological dynamics is constrained by directional dispersal would be inherently more predictable as the effects of other uncontrollable heterogeneities would be less dominant however field validations cannot prove or disprove such ansatz for a number of objective reasons chiefly the practical impossibility of replicating all ecological conditions in diverse topological substrates for the ecological interactions we thus resorted to laboratory experimentation altermatt et al 2011a 2011b holyoak and lawler 2005 to explore the extent of the validity of the theoretical prediction as the theoretical work suggests that dispersal constrained by the connectivity of specific habitat structures such as river networks can explain observed features of biodiversity we designed experiments to that end notice that no direct evidence existed at the time carrara et al 2012 2014 experimentally tested whether connectivity per se is capable of shaping diversity patterns in dendritic microcosm metacommunities at different levels fig 3 illustrates the general setting of the lab experiments the main results produced along the above line of thought are summarized here local dispersal in isotropic lattice landscapes homogenizes local species richness and leads to pronounced spatial persistence fig 4 on the contrary dispersal along dendritic landscapes leads to higher variability in local diversity and among community composition thereby confirming by replicated laboratory experimentation the theoretical prediction based on abstract models carrara et al 2012 although headwaters exhibit relatively lower species richness they are crucial for the maintenance of regional biodiversity this result echoes prior theoretical evidence benda et al 2004 fagan 2002 such results establish that spatially constrained dendritic connectivity is a key factor for community composition and population persistence carrara et al 2012 moreover further laboratory work experimentally disentangled the effect of local habitat capacity i e the patch size and dendritic connectivity on biodiversity in aquatic microcosm metacommunities by suitably arranging patch sizes within river like networks carrara et al 2014 results are summarized in fig 5 specifically the individual effects of connectivity and habitat capacity on microbial diversity was singled out by using three different configurations of patch sizes riverine random and homogeneous connected following a river network topological and aggregation template fig 5 suitably derived from ocns appendix in riverine landscapes local habitat capacity correlates with position along the network and distance to the outlet fig 5 a larger downstream communities thus consistently receive more immigrants from upstream communities in the homogeneous and random landscapes fig 5 b and c respectively local habitat capacity i e the patch size does not preserve any geomorphological hierarchy embedded in the scaling of total contributing area at any point in the network scaling as observed in natural river systems leopold et al 1964 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 overall more connected communities that occupy a central position in the network exhibited higher species richness irrespective of patch size arrangement high regional evenness in community composition was found only in landscapes preserving geomorphological scaling properties of patch sizes i e a patch volume proportional to the number of contributing nodes see carrara et al 2014 in these landscapes some of the rarer species sustained regionally more abundant populations compared to landscapes with homogeneous patch size or landscapes with spatially uncorrelated patch size carrara et al 2014 the bulk of the experimental replicas figs 4 and 5 suggests that altering the natural link between dendritic connectivity and patch size strongly affects community composition and population persistence at multiple scales precisely as predicted by the neutral model and by every neutral and non neutral metacommunity framework applied to the same topologically diverse matrices we note that the same applies to broader classes of networked environments benda et al 2004 including those artificially created by human or host mobility networks erlander and stewart 1990 that are so relevant to the spread of disease epidemics on which we shall return later 2 species dynamics and fluvial landscapes in what follows we shall not pursue a review of the subject broad as it is but rather a specific choice of topics relevant to the general concepts outlined in section 1 which will therefore find support and concrete applications 2 1 fish diversity in the mississippi missouri river system the first example deals with the prediction of fish diversity patterns in the large mississippi missouri mmrs river system in the specific case of riverine fish biodiversity patterns of local and basin scale differences must relate to energy availability habitat heterogeneity scale dependent environmental conditions and river discharge fagan 2002 therefore the neutral metacommunity models of the type introduced in section 1 was made more realistic by better describing the structure of the local community muneepeerakul et al 2008 in fact each local community is endowed with a carrying capacity that depends on its location specifically total contributing catchment area as a proxy for fluvial habitat size rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 and the relevant habitat and each site within the lc does not host a single individual rather a small subpopulation of a certain species the physical context is described in fig 6 model simulations proceed largely through a spatially explicit approach akin to that described in section 1 with slight modifications discussed below every direct tributary area dta fig 6 is assumed to be always saturated at its capacity i e no available resources are left unexploited each dta hosts a certain number of fish units that depends on the location at each time step a fish unit randomly selected from all fish units sensu muneepeerakul et al 2008 present in the system dies and the resources that previously sustained the unit are freed and available for sustaining a new fish unit with probability ν the analog of the diversification rate in section 1 the new unit will be occupied by a new species thus here the diversification is to be interpreted as a rate per death due to speciation to external introduction of non native species or to immigration and reimmigration of a new species from outside the mmrs with probability 1 ν the new unit will belong to a species already existing in the system in the latter case with probability pij eq 1 an empty unit in dta i will be colonized by a species from dta j muneepeerakul et al 2008 in this context with reference to eq 1 hk is the habitat capacity of the dta k defined below and n is the total number of dtas here n 5824 while the total number of fish units is 436 731 all the fish units in dta j have the same probability of colonizing the empty unit in dta i where the death took place death must be interpreted as the extinction of the species subpopulation hosted by the fish unit the model results that we outline in the following are the average patterns after the system reaches a statistically steady state specific dispersal kernels are assumed to determine how the fish species move within the river network muneepeerakul et al 2008 kij in this context is the probability that a randomly selected fish species present in dta j arrives at dta i after dispersal here normalization constants are determined numerically so that no fish can travel out of the network a necessary note pertains to the neutral assumption in this context indeed strong because fish species obviously differ in their dispersal abilities however the functional equivalence between species is a key way in which the neutral theory of biodiversity departs from classical ecological models we assume the species equivalence to study just how good a fit the neutral metacommunity model can produce to our data in the absence of detailed species specific information as such the model is engineered to single out the individual role of the dendritic structure of the topological substrate for ecological interactions an important innovation of the metacommunity model with respect to the zero order model outlined in section 1 concerns the imposition of hierarchical local habitat capacity at any site j hj in fact habitat capacity of dta i hi is determined by a properly normalized relation hi aarpi wai where wai denotes total contributing watershed area at site i and aarpi is the average annual runoff production fig 6c total contributing area at any point of a river network can be directly computed from suitably treated digital elevation maps rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 the map of local species richness shown in fig 6b suggests that the dta endowed with the maximum α diversity 156 species is observed somewhat mid way through the mmrs the sharp decrease empirically observed in species richness occurring around the 100 w meridian is known to correspond to sharp gradients of annual precipitation and runoff production muneepeerakul et al 2008 fig 6c although these gradients may partly explain the semi arid climate and low fish diversity in the western half of the mmrs muneepeerakul et al 2008 argued that the western dtas are low in fish diversity both because their climate is dry and because they are upstream portions of the river network the results are displayed in fig 7 fig 7a illustrates the frequency distribution of local species richness lsr best fit to empirical data muneepeerakul et al 2008 whose two peaks at low and high values reflect the difference between the western and eastern halves of the mmrs fig 7 b c shows computed and measured lsr as a function of the topological distance from the network outlet it is totally remarkable the fact that the lsr profile shows a significant increase in the downstream direction except at the very end where the freshwater fish habitat capacities are significantly reduced by salinity co occurrence intrusion by some freshwater tolerant estuarine or coastal fish species human disturbance and pollution the overall downstream increase in richness results from the converging character of the river network and is steepened by the dry wet climatic gradient muneepeerakul et al 2008 the statistically significant major impact of modulated habitat capacity is clearly suggested by the comparison of the results from the modified neutral metacommunity model and those from zero order model where habitat capacity is assumed constant fig 7c neutral metacommunity patterns result equally good for rank abundance curves and suitable measures of β diversity not shown here see muneepeerakul et al 2008 fig 4 where particularly significant is the resulting long distance similarity in species composition maintained by species endowed with extremely large occupancies the neutral metacommunity model reproduces surprisingly well the general spatial biodiversity patterns of the mmrs freshwater fish once hydrologic controls like the effects of average annual runoff production on fish habitat capacities are enforced a wide spectrum of observed biodiversity patterns are reproduced as suggested by figs 6 and 7 as a specific example in addition to the general trend and magnitude the model also captures fine structured fluctuations of the lsr profile fig 6 simultaneous fits of diverse patterns and others such as the species area relationship make for a very demanding test for any model especially one using few parameters as in this case muneepeerakul et al 2008 the model therefore provides ecological insight despite its simplicity one of the ecological meaningful insights obtained from the theoretical exercise is that the parameters corresponding to the best fit imply that the spread of the average fish species is quite symmetrical i e it is not significantly biased either in the upstream or the downstream direction the model results also suggest that on average most fish disperse locally that is to nearby dtas but a non negligible fraction travel very long distances given the broad range of environmental conditions covered the demonstration that a simple neutral metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity distribution and dispersal kernel can simultaneously reproduce several major observed biodiversity patterns has far reaching implications these results suggest that only parameters characterizing average fish behaviour as opposed to those characterizing biological properties of all different fish species in the system and habitat capacities and connected structure suffice for reasonably accurate predictions of large scale biodiversity patterns namely those patterns that do not include the identity of species as we said in the previous section neutral models cannot explain all those patterns that are species specific however the neutral metacommunity model may represent a null model against which more biologically realistic models ought to be compared sensu akaike akaike 1974 corani and gatto 2007 moreover furthering our understanding of fluvial ecological corridors related to general metapopulation persistence criteria for spatially explicit models casagrandi and gatto 2002 mari et al 2014b will allow us to improve the alignment of ecological models and data 2 2 elevational gradients of biodiversity the second example which we deem paradigmatic as well deals with geomorphic controls on elevational gradients of species richness bertuzzo et al 2005 in this case the lead role is taken by the structure of ecological interactions allowed by the available ecological substrate the mountain landscape which controls the gradients of biodiversity drivers key is the fluvial landscape again this time suitably constructed in three dimensions the fluvial landscapes we adopt are real topographies taken from digital elevation models rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 and replicated synthetic ocns within a given domain through the transformation of a planar aggregation structure into a topographic landscape which is made possible by the use of a slope area relationship relating total contributing area at a point to the local topographic gradient rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 ocns rinaldo et al 2014 1992 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 appendix prove once more extremely versatile the rationale for our choice of examples is simple how biodiversity changes with elevation has long attracted the interest of researchers because it provides key clues to how biota respond to geophysical drivers experimental evidence reveals that biodiversity in ecosystems significantly affected by the elevational gradients often peaks at intermediate elevations colwell et al 2004 gaston 2000 körner 2000 2007 lomolino 2001 mccain and grytnes 2010 nogues bravo et al 2008 rahbek 2005 a factor that had been overlooked for a long time was the fact that mountainous landscapes hold fractal properties mandelbrot 1983 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 with elevational bands forming habitat patches that are characterized by different areal extent and connectivity well known drivers of biodiversity specifically the frequency distribution of elevation in real life landscapes is distinctly hump shaped with the majority of land situated at midelevations mandelbrot 1983 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 fig 8 elevational patterns showing a peak in elevational distributions at mid elevation are ubiquitous in landscapes shaped by fluvial erosion when a sufficiently large region rather than a single slope or mountain is considered it should be noted that this pattern is altered only if large areas outside runoff producing zones e g large plains are included in the domain rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 mountains are no cones nor clouds are spheres or coastlines simple broken lines in the celebrated words of mandelbrot 1983 and therefore simple 1d slopes are highly misleading as representation of nature s topographies mountain landscapes are rather complex self affine fractal structures rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 within an ecological context this fact has seriously misled researchers interested in elevational trends and in natural experiments conducted along gradients of elevation because the mountain cone analogy suggests a monotonically decreasing distribution of elevation the area of available habitat within a given elevational band may have a direct effect on the diversity of the regional community it hosts γ diversity kraft et al 2011 rahbek 1995 2005 sanders 2002 as predicted by the species area relationship rosenzweig 1995 the area of available habitat may also have an indirect effect on the local species richness because local communities can be assembled from a more diverse regional pool of species that are fit to live at similar elevation romdal and grytnes 2007 because there exist two classes of environmental drivers those altitude specific such as atmospheric pressure and temperature and those that are not such as moisture clear sky turbidity and cloudiness sunshine exposure and aspect wind strength season length geology and human land use körner 2000 2007 empirical results may hardly sort out unambiguously general rules if at all existing the importance of theoretical predictions of expected patterns of species richness with elevation could therefore hardly be overestimated bertuzzo et al 2005 moved from this premise by exploiting universal self affine features of elevation fields of fluvial landscapes possibly obtained by planar aggregation structures where sensible local slope area laws reminiscent of the fluvial landscape are enforced rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 incidentally they may apply equally well by using real topographies where the slope area laws breaks down at the drainage density threshold the nature of fluvial landscapes and their physical evolution in fact provide universal invariance of patterns of connected areas at same elevation rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 this second example of biodiversity affected by the fluvial landscape structure thus describes how altitude driven area connectivity fosters elevational gradients of species richness and in particular the origins of empirically observed mid altitude peaks the analysis as we said in the introduction moves one further step away from neutrality by adding niche tradeoffs for a somewhat similar attempt see tilman 2004 in fact the model employs an altitude dependent adaptive fitness of otherwise equal vital rates of species also as briefly discussed in what follows connectivity is based on the altitude area relations expected in general by fluvial patterns in order to investigate the role of the mountainous landscapes in shaping altitude gradient of species richness a zero sum metacommunity model is anyway adopted hubbell 2001 rosindell et al 2011 namely the system is always saturated in this framework the system comprises n local communities which are characterized by their position in space and by their mean altitude only communities organized in an equally spaced two dimensional lattice will be considered however the model could be readily adapted to account for other connectivity structures like those investigated in the previous section each local community assembles n individuals because of the zero sum assumption at any time the system is populated by n n individuals belonging to s different species each species is characterized by a specific altitude niche which expresses in this context how the competitive ability of a species varies with altitude i e ci z measures the competitive ability of the individuals of species i at altitude z this relationship is modelled as a gaussian function 3 c i z c m a x i e z z o p t i 2 2 σ i 2 where z o p t i is the optimal altitude of species i that is where ci z equals its maximum c m a x i the parameter σi controls the dispersion of the gaussian function namely the niche width in this example the analysis is limited for simplicity to a neutral case where all the species have the same parameters σ i σ and c m a x i c max fig 9 illustrates how the niches of different species are modelled edge effects are also prevented bertuzzo et al 2005 while species differ for their altitudinal niches all other ecological traits namely birth death and dispersal rates are identical like in the classical ecological neutral dynamics hubbell 2001 ecological interactions among individuals are simulated as follows at each time step a randomly selected individual dies and the resources are freed up and available for colonization the empty site is occupied by an offspring of one of the individuals occupying either the local community of the dead individual or one of the four nearest neighbour communities a key variant of the standard spatially explicit neutral model follows the offspring in fact is selected randomly with a probability proportional to ci z of all the candidate colonizing individuals evaluated at the elevation z of the local community of the dead individual at each time step with probability ν an additional individual belonging to a species not currently present in the system engages in the competition for colonizing the free spot bertuzzo et al 2005 the optimal altitude z o p t i of this individual is drawn from a uniform distribution spanning twice the altitude range of the system as described before see also fig 9 needless to say introduction of new species is aimed at modelling both speciation and immigration from external communities the model has been run also in three other landscape configurations bertuzzo et al 2005 the alternative landscapes studied insure that the planar slope fig 8a and any linear slopes of variable gradients are such that their hypsographic curves match that of the mountainous landscapes by analyzing comparatively them shape effects can be highlighted the structure in fig 9 has been obtained by using a real life elevation map where each pixel subsumes the mean altitude of a 500 500 m region the local community size n is set to 100 the system is initially populated by one single species and is simulated until a statistically steady state is reached 105 generations where a generation is n n time steps periodic boundaries conditions are prescribed for both landscapes notice that model results do not depend on the actual altitude range z min z max but only on the ratio σ z max z min bertuzzo et al 2005 other pertinent details are reported therein typical results of the metacommunity model are shown in fig 10 all landscapes produce to a different extent hump shaped α diversity curves yet only the one corresponding to a real landscape produces realistic variability akin to that produced by field evidence the values computed therein depend on specific choices of the niche width σ and on other parameters it can be shown however that the trends outlined therein are valid irrespective of parameter values fig 11 fluvial landforms show deep similarities across many orders of magnitude despite great diversity of their drivers and controls e g relief exposed lithology geology vegetation or climate rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 regardless of the self affine nature of the elevation field as a whole a marked heterogeneity of elevational distributions and thus of ecological connectivity characterizes the parts and the whole of real landscapes fig 11 nevertheless the universality of the main attributes of the fluvial landscape naturally lends itself to the quest for general patterns of the ecological dynamics that such landscapes host bertuzzo et al 2011b brown and swan 2010 rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 thus it is appealing that the α diversity maps shown in fig 11 reveal such clear spatial patterns with valleys and mountain tops characterized by lower species richness all geomorphic factors resulting in self affine landscapes where peaks or troughs my occur at any elevation within the range simultaneously concur to the formation of such a pattern regardless of other elevation independent factors a factor is also the finiteness of the landscape elevational range sites at mid elevation can potentially be colonized by species that live at and are fit for higher and lower elevations whereas sites at the lowest highest extreme are only subject to the colonizing pressure from higher lower elevations in addition to this boundary effect the geomorphic structure of fluvial landscapes results in a mid elevation peak in both area and connectivity across the landscape both of which promote diversity specifically designed simulations have disentangled the role of each of these factors bertuzzo et al 2005 results also show that without any of these effects the model predicts no gradients of diversity each geomorphic factor produces independently or in combination with others a hump shaped pattern of species richness moreover the differential elevational connectivity characteristic of fluvial landscapes results in a marked variability of diversity for the same elevation the results reveal that similar mid peak elevational gradients of diversity can be observed at different scales of observation even if the domains span different elevational ranges this pattern is thus a direct consequence of the nature of the substrate for ecological interactions as in all the examples pursued here in particular of the self affine fractal structure of fluvial landscapes that reproduces statistically similar fluvial landforms across scales rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 we thus show that deep similarities occur across many orders of magnitude despite great diversity of their drivers and controls e g relief exposed lithology geology vegetation or climate results also show that when the scale of observation is enlarged different hump shaped patterns are blended together possibly producing a confounding effect bertuzzo et al 2005 especially if the analysis is limited to the average diversity as a function of elevation this feature might help in understanding why elevational diversity is often found to be dependent on the scale of observation nogues bravo et al 2008 rahbek 1995 2005 the above results as in most of the examples put forward in this paper act as a proof of concept in fact we have presented results based on nearest neighbour dispersal to highlight the role of elevational connectivity indeed the effect of elevational isolation is expected to be reduced as dispersal limitation decreases because species can overcome elevational constraints with long distance dispersal e g dispersing from one mountain top to another without going through unfavorable lower elevation habitats moreover we have assumed that the landscape can be uniformly colonized whereas real life habitats are often composed by patches with different spatial connectivity and size hanski 1998 spatial and elevational connectivities can interact in complex ways to shape diversity patterns while the modeling framework proposed can be easily generalized to accommodate both fragmented habitats and generic dispersal kernels the coherent framework presented here has the potential to effectively describe how spatial and elevational connectivities shape diversity in complex 3d landscapes the above exploration of metacommunity patterns concludes our examples on how the ecological substrates affect in a decisive manner the ensuing biological diversity it suggests that the specific spatial arrangement of sites at different elevation in fluvial landscapes suffices in inducing mid peak elevational gradients of species richness without invoking specific assumptions except that each species is fit for a specific elevation in this framework an elevation dependent fitness applied to a real life landscape translates into a fragmented habitat map this conceptualization lends itself to the application of classic concepts of metacommunity dynamics hanski 1998 according to which habitat size and connectivity are key drivers of biodiversity we thus expect different metacommunity models to produce similar results needless to say we do not dismiss as negligible other potential drivers of diversity including those that often covary with elevation e g habitat capacity productivity human disturbance however we argue that these drivers may act on top of the unavoidable effects provided by the geomorphic controls a general consensus has thus been achieved on the fact that the analysis of elevational diversity should not seek one single overriding force but rather understand how different factors covariate to synergistically shape the observed patterns körner 2007 our results strongly suggest however that fluvial geomorphology has an important role yet thus far overlooked in driving emergent diversity elevational gradients of local species richness inasmuch as the topology of the planar substrates dominates the structuring of general biodiversity patterns 3 population dynamics and riverine biological invasions biological dispersal is a key driver of many fundamental processes in nature clobert et al 2001 elton 1958 méndez et al 2010 okubo and levin 2002 shigesada and kawasaki 1997 invasions controls the distribution of species within an ecosystem and critically affect their coexistence in fact the spread of organisms along ecological substrates or corridors governs not only the dynamics of invasive species but also the spread of pathogens and the shifts in species ranges due to climate or environmental change obviously the subject per se is a major chapter of ecology and we shall not deal with it here in a comprehensive manner our narrow perspective here deals rather with river networks as ecological corridors apt to population invasions in fact the role of the structure of river networks in modeling human range expansions i e predicting how populations migrate when settling into new territories has been recognized through quantitative models of diffusion along fractal networks coupled with logistic reaction at their nodes campos et al 2006 an essential ingredient therein is the fact that settlers did not occupy all the territory isotropically in the language of homogeneous continuous models but rather followed rivers and lakes and settled near them to exploit water resources it was thus interestingly argued in a quantitative manner that landscape heterogeneities must have played an essential role in the process of migration ammermann and cavalli sforza 1984 campos et al 2006 campos and mendez 2005 méndez et al 2004 one interesting by product of the analysis of migration fronts is the important role attributed to the structure of the network acting as the substrate for travelling wave propagations this calls for specific structural models to be invoked possibly including fractals that mimic natural forms rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 in the specific case basic invariance properties may refer to the relative independence of the outcome of biological invasions from the seeding point chosen for spreading material and species along the network where reaction and diffusion occur this is seen as a corollary of the type of scaling invariance shown by trees or networks where loops are observed banavar et al 2000 2001 maritan et al 1996 rinaldo et al 2014 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 the topological substrates that we shall consider here namely ocns rinaldo et al 2014 1992 rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 are tailored to the topology and geometry of real rivers rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 they allow us to produce replicas of network shapes and thus to seek for a proper statistic of the resulting biological dispersion processes to derive exact results one often resorts campos et al 2006 mandelbrot 1983 marani et al 1991 to the peano network fig 12 which is a deterministic fractal mandelbrot 1983 whose main topological and metric features have been sorted out exactly marani et al 1991 a good starting point is the analysis of campos et al 2006 concerning a reaction random walk rrw process through a peano construct and several replicas of ocns it is based on the following model a particle at an arbitrary node of the network jumps after a waiting time τ to one of its z nearest neighboring nodes with probability 1 z during the waiting time τ the particles react i e evolve the scalar property mass density labeling the particle by following the logistic equation the determination of the wavefront speed that this process develops along a network path campos and mendez 2005 méndez et al 2004 is the starting point for the ensuing considerations fig 12 illustrates the main result of the above premises it shows that the isotropic diffusion reaction front fisher s model fisher 1937 propagates much faster than the wave forced to choose a treelike pathway this proves that geometrical constraints imposed by a fractal network imply strong corrections on the speed of the fronts it should be noted that it is not surprising that peano networks and ocns lead to similar results because the speed of the front depends on topological features that are indeed quite similar for all tree like networks rather different otherwise rinaldo et al 2006 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 in fact it can be shown campos et al 2006 méndez et al 2004 that the wave speed is affected mostly by the gross structure encountered by the front while propagating along the network chiefly the bifurcations hence topology rather than the fine structure of the subpaths dominates the process it should be noted that the model proposed by campos et al 2006 assumes simple diffusive transport to describe migration fluxes this seems indeed reasonable in the case of human population migrations the need for water resources should drive settlers regardless of the direction of the flow variations on the theme i e whether adding a bias to transport properties would basically alter this interesting picture was investigated later bertuzzo et al 2007 this was done on purpose in fact any other ecological agent be it an aquatic organism or an infective agent of water borne disease would likely be affected by the flow direction to propagate within the network organisms can either move by their own energy active dispersal or be moved by water passive dispersal most likely movements along the flow direction would be favored although movements against flow direction are completely admissible because of various ecological or physical mechanisms muneepeerakul et al 2008 2007 all this is of great interest for the problem of persistence of species along the ecological corridors that are shaped by the river network bertuzzo et al 2007 mari et al 2014b a brief introduction of the theoretical context is perhaps useful in a deterministic framework the fisher kolmogorov equation fisher 1937 kolmogorov et al 1937 reads 4 ρ t d 2 ρ x 2 r ρ 1 ρ k where ρ ρ x t is the density of organisms r the species growth rate d the diffusion coefficient and k the carrying capacity eq 4 is known to foster the development of undeformed traveling waves of the density profile murray 2004 mathematically this implies that ρ x t ρ x v t where v is the speed of the advancing wave fisher 1937 proved that traveling wave solutions can only exist with speed v 2 r d and kolmogorov et al 1937 demonstrated that with suitable initial conditions the speed of the wavefront is the lower bound fig 12 the microscopic movement underlying the fisher kolmogorov eq 4 is brownian motion méndez et al 2010 despite its relevance for important ecological processes however it was argued giometto et al 2014 that the subject suffers an acknowledged lack of experimentation and current assessments point at inherent limitations to predictability even in the simplest ecological settings giometto et al 2014 have instead shown by combining replicated experimentation on the spread of the ciliate tetrahymena sp with a theoretical approach based on stochastic differential equations that information on local unconstrained movement and reproduction of organisms including demographic stochasticity allows to predict reliably both the propagation speed and range of variability of invasion fronts over multiple generations we shall briefly report their main findings as they are functional to the main tenet of this paper first one wonders what are the sources of uncertainty and variance in the spread rates of biological invasions the search for processes that affect biological dispersal and sources of variability observed in ecological range expansions in fact reveals fundamental insight into the study of invasive species dynamics shifts in species ranges due to climate or environmental change and in general the spatial distribution of species andow et al 1990 clobert et al 2001 elton 1958 grosholz 1996 hastings et al 2005 okubo and levin 2002 shigesada and kawasaki 1997 skellam 1951 dispersal is the key agent that brings favorable genotypes or highly competitive species into new ranges much faster than any other ecological or evolutionary process fisher 1937 when organisms spread occurs on the timescale of multiple generations it is the byproduct of active or passive movement and of the reproduction of individuals andow et al 1990 hastings et al 2005 the main difficulty in causally understanding dispersal is thus to upscale processes that happen at the short term individual level to long term and broad scale population patterns andow et al 1990 levin 1992 whether the variability observed in nature or in experimental ensembles might be accounted for by systematic differences between landscapes or by demographic stochasticity affecting basic vital rates of the organisms involved is key giometto et al 2014 hastings et al 2005 modeling of biological dispersal refers to the theoretical framework of reaction diffusion processes fisher 1937 kolmogorov et al 1937 méndez et al 2010 murray 2004 skellam 1951 volpert and petrovskii 2009 which now finds common application in dispersal ecology andow et al 1990 hastings et al 2005 lubina and levin 1988 control of the dynamics of invasive species elton 1958 grosholz 1996 skellam 1951 and in related fields campos et al 2006 murray 2004 as noted in the introduction reaction diffusion models have also been applied to model human colonization processes such as the neolithic transition in europe ammermann and cavalli sforza 1984 or the race to the west in the 19th century continental us campos et al 2006 the extensive use of these models and the good fit to observational data favored their common endorsement as a paradigm for biological dispersal grosholz 1996 however certain assessments melbourne and hastings 2009 suggested inherent limitations to the predictability of the phenomenon due to its intrinsic stochasticity therefore single realizations of a dispersal event might deviate significantly from the mean of the process making replicated experimentation necessary to allow hypothesis testing identification of causal relationships and to potentially falsify the models assumptions giometto et al 2014 provided instead replicated and controlled experimental support to the theory of reaction diffusion processes for modeling biological dispersal in a generalized context that reproduces the observed fluctuations details on the experiment and on the theoretical analyses are reported therein giometto et al 2014 experimentally substantiated the fisher kolmogorov mean speed of traveling wavefronts by measuring the individual components of the process stochasticity was included in the model to reproduce the observed variability in range expansions investigation of the movement behavior of tetrahymena sp shows that individuals trajectories are consistent with a persistent random walk with an autocorrelation time τ 3 9 0 4 s as the autocorrelation time for the study species is much smaller than the growth rate r τ r 10 4 an excellent approximation was provided giometto et al 2014 the stochastic model equation reads 5 ρ t d 2 ρ x 2 r ρ 1 ρ k σ ρ η where η η x t is a gaussian zero mean white noise i e with correlations η x t η x t δ x x δ t t where δ is the dirac s delta distribution and σ 0 is constant the square root multiplicative noise term in eq 5 is interpreted as describing stochasticity of demographic parameters and needs extra care in simulations giometto et al 2014 data from the growth experiment in isolation were fitted to the equation 6 d ρ d t r ρ 1 ρ k σ l ρ η where ρ ρ t is the local density η η t is a gaussian zero mean white noise i e with correlations η t η t δ t t σ 0 is constant and l is the size of the region over which densities were measured giometto et al 2014 details are reported therein in the experiments the freshwater ciliate tetrahymena sp was employed because of its short generation time and its history as a model system in ecology carrara et al 2012 holyoak and lawler 2005 the experimental setup consisted of linear landscapes fig 13 filled with a nutrient medium kept in constant environmental conditions and of suitable size to meet the assumptions about the relevant dispersal timescales see materials and methods in giometto et al 2014 replicated dispersal events were conducted by introducing an ensemble of individuals at one end of the landscape and measuring density profiles throughout the system at different times density profiles are shown in fig 14 for six replicated dispersal events panels a f organisms introduced at one end of the landscape rapidly formed an advancing front that propagated at a remarkably constant speed fig 14 the front position at each time was calculated as the first occurrence starting from the end of the landscape of a fixed value of the density fig 14 as for traveling waves predicted by the fisher kolmogorov equation the mean front speed in the experiment is notably constant for different choices of the reference density value fig 14 note that the species traits r k and d were measured in independent experiments in the local growth experiment a low density population of tetrahymena sp was introduced evenly across the landscape and its density was measured locally at different times recorded density measurements were fitted to the logistic growth model which gave the estimates for r and k giometto et al 2014 in the local unimpeded movement experiment the mean square displacement si of individuals trajectories was computed to estimate the diffusion coefficient d in density independent conditions giometto et al 2014 the growth and movement measurements were performed in the same linear landscape settings as in the dispersal experiment and therefore are assumed to accurately describe the dynamics at the front of the traveling wave in the dispersal events the comparison of the predicted front speed v 2 r d to the wavefront speed measured in the dispersal experiment vo yields a compelling agreement the observed speed in the dispersal experiment was v o 52 0 1 8 cm day mean se giometto et al 2014 which we compare to the predicted one v 51 9 1 1 cm day mean se the two velocities are compatible within one standard error a t test between the replicated observed speeds and bootstrap estimates of v 2 r d gives a p value of p 0 96 t 0 05 d f 9 thus the null hypothesis that the mean difference is 0 was not rejected at the 5 level and there is no indication that the two means are different as the measurements of r and d were performed independently at scales that were orders of magnitude smaller than in the dispersal events the agreement between the two estimates of the front velocity was deemed remarkable the conclusions of the study are remarkable in that the fisher kolmogorov equation correctly predicts the mean speed of the experimentally observed invading wavefront although its deterministic formulation prevents it to reproduce the variability that is inherent to biological dispersal in particular it cannot reproduce the fluctuations in range expansion between different replicates of dispersal experiments the proposed generalization of the fisher kolmogorov equation accounting for stochasticity showed that it is able to capture the observed variability in a linear landscape as local independent estimates were used in solving the generalized model equation the result that the measured front positions agree with simulations show that one source of uncertainty in biological invasions can be quantified estimates for the front speed and its variability in the experiment prove in good agreement with simulations implying that stochasticity in population parameters can explain variability in range expansions not related to the topology of the substrate giometto et al 2014 generalizations to organisms endowed with different biology e g growth rates and diffusion coefficients possibly available in the literature are in sight supporting the view that our tenet may possibly provide a general predictive framework for biological invasions in natural environments a hydrologically notable example of biological invasion within the same mississippi missouri river system mmrs investigated in section 1 follows mari et al 2011 it deals with the zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha a freshwater bivalve native to eurasia owing to its adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions combined with dispersal abilities within fluvial systems that are unrivalled by other freshwater invertebrates this invasive species managed to diffuse all over europe and north america after establishment zebra mussel colonies can rapidly reach population densities in the order of tens or even hundreds of thousands of individuals per square meter and inflict huge ecological and economic damages in fact zebra mussel colonies may deeply alter invaded ecosystems by filtering large volumes of water thus removing phytoplankton and boosting nutrients and by severely impairing the functioning of water works mari et al 2011 the zebra mussel has thus become a prototypical example of invasive species rightly included in the 100 world s worst invasive alien species list drawn up by the international union for conservation of nature one of the noteworthy features of zebra mussel invasions is the speed at which the species can spread over river networks the example of the invasion of the mississippi missouri river system mmrs is particularly revealing see fig 15 data available online at http fl biology usgs gov nonindigenous species zm progression zm progression html the invasion in fact started from the great lakes region michigan where some specimens were first sighted in the late 1980s after being probably introduced via ballast water sheddings by boats sailing from europe by 1990 d polymorpha made its way into the illinois river and by 1991 the zebra mussel started diffusing into the mississippi reaching louisiana as soon as 1993 in the meanwhile the species showed up also in some of its most important tributaries ohio tennessee and arkansas rivers as well as in other north american river systems st lawrence hudson and susquehanna the rate of spread of d polymorpha has decreased remarkably after 1994 primarily because the species did not expand west of the 100th meridian however the zebra mussel has been steadily infilling and colonizing new reaches during the last decade quite surprisingly a few connected river systems most notably the missouri river have not been invaded until recently stokstad 2007 nowadays the zebra mussel steadily occupies much of central and eastern north america d polymorpha invasion patterns result from the interplay between local demographic processes occurring over long time scales and basin scale transport phenomena taking place over much shorter time spans mari et al 2011 this is mainly due to the peculiarity of the species life cycle which can be roughly subdivided into two main periods a short larval phase lasting from a few days to a few weeks stoeckel et al 1997 and a relatively long adult stage up to three years in north america casagrandi et al 2007 adults live anchored to a solid substratum while larvae also known as veligers can be transported by the water flow sometimes traveling for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers before settling stoeckel et al 1997 therefore rivers represent the primary and natural pathway allowing species spread however anthropic activities can often result in extra range dispersal i e in the movement of propagules from the current species range to a new area of habitat thus in turn remarkably favoring both the speed and the extent of the biological invasion mari et al 2011 in the zebra mussel case this has been known for a long time as any human activity that involves the movement of a mass of water can be a potential vector for the spread of d polymorpha carlton 1993 commercial navigation represents a major driver of mobility for the zebra mussel allen and ramcharan 2001 mari et al 2011 for instance large quantities of veligers are often shipped within the ballast water of commercial vessels as ports are located even hundreds of kilometers apart from each other connections among them allow the species to disperse over very long distances and to colonize stretches of the river network that could not have been reached otherwise furthermore empirical evidence suggests that recreational boating may be an important determinant of medium range mussel redistribution chase and bailey 1999 stoeckel et al 2004a 2004b a common mechanism associated with transient recreational boating is the transport of juveniles and adult mussels via macrophytes entangled on boat trailers carlton 1993 this mechanism has been proposed as the most likely cause of d polymorpha interbasin range expansion due to touristic boating therefore commercial navigation represents an efficient vector of long distance dispersal while touristic boating can provide a capillary mechanism for medium range mussel relocation due to the importance of the zebra mussel as an ecosystem invader significant modeling effort has already been devoted to understanding its demographic dynamics at a local scale casagrandi et al 2007 as well as to the description of the species spread along rivers mari et al 2009 stoeckel et al 1997 and the analysis of long distance dispersal wilson et al 2009 to single out the role of drivers and controls of the mmrs invasion spatially explicit time hybrid multilayer network models were set up to address the intertwining of hydrologic controls acting through the ecological corridors defined by the river network with long and medium range dispersal controlled by anthropogenic factors which define secondary movement networks integrating multiple dispersal pathways is crucial to understand zebra mussel invasion patterns and in particular the role played by human activities in promoting the spread in particular in this outstanding case commercial navigation has been the most important determinant of the early invasion of the mississippi missouri and recreational boating can explain the long term capillary penetration of the species into the water system the spatially explicit ecohydrological model is described in detail elsewhere mari et al 2011 suffice here to mention the basic unity of the approaches with the ones described in greater detail in section 2 of great relevance here is the multiplex network of ecological interactions adopted later re discussed in the context of pathogen host mobility in section 4 in fact while veligers diffuse and settle along one dimensional substrates provided by the fluvial ecological corridors hence determining a traditional travelling wave invasion front dynamics sensu fisher 1937 kolmogorov et al 1937 a much faster and heterogeneous spread can be envisioned and proved figs 16 and 17 the infection in fact can be simply propagated by veligers trapped in the ballast water of commercial or recreational boats possibly moved by land surviving the trip and re starting from scratch their colonization process the scale of the modeling attempt and the ecohydrological interactions addressed by mari et al 2011 is noteworthy as noted in section 1 landscape heterogeneities directional dispersal and hydrologic controls shape ecological and epidemiological patterns a novel factor on which we shall elaborate further in the context of the spread of waterborne disease concern human mediated dispersal processes that prove of great importance as they allow species to disperse beyond their normal ranges thus eventually shaping global biogeographical patterns see e g wilson et al 2009 the model thus accounts for the interplay among a few selected mechanisms such as density dependent larval mortality basin scale hydrologic transport and human mediated dispersal due to either port to port commercial navigation or recreational boating that are deemed of key importance in d polymorpha invasions the model which succeeds in reproducing the zebra mussel invasion patterns observed in the mmrs at a regional spatial scale and over a 20 year time span offers a hindcasting exercise for the mmrs yet the proposed multilayer network approach could be applied to predict and control other potential invasions of the same or related alien species in the mmrs or other river systems provided that a comprehensive analysis of extant ecological and hydrologic processes as well as of relevant human mediated transport mechanisms is available this seems of particular ecological relevance in the context of biological invasions in fact taking early actions is difficult yet extremely valuable in the zebra mussel case in particular the containment and or eradication of established colonies are very difficult and costly prevention should thus be favored over control but this is possible only if quantitative tools to predict the development of the spread are available to that end we point out the importance of a fully dynamical and spatially explicit approach to modeling biological invasions for it allows combined predictions of both temporal and spatial patterns of species spread in addition we deem our multilayer approach an effective and general framework to model the spread of species that are characterized by multiple dispersal pathways biological invasions are inherently complex stochastic processes for which only a single realization is available for observation as such there exist obvious limits to our ability to actually predict them from models that necessarily need estimation of parameters from actual data see melbourne and hastings 2009 but also giometto et al 2014 mentioned above however forecasting the main or mean in some ensemble averaging sense patterns of spread of alien species is becoming increasingly important though more and more difficult with anthropic activities rapidly coming abreast of or even overwhelming natural invasion pathways for all these reasons including important details about the role of ecological corridors and of related anthropogenic drivers is very valuable a thorough quantitative understanding of the different processes that boost the spread of alien species is in fact our only hope to prevent and to some extent control biological invasions 4 ecology of pathogens and the spread of waterborne disease here we shall introduce to the modelling rationale that extends and specializes the reasoning presented in the previous sections with a view on a particularly important application i e spatial epidemiology as we shall see river networks and more in general waterways play a fundamental role as epidemiological corridors waterborne diseases are infections caused by ingestion of or more in general contact with water contaminated by pathogenic organisms ranging from micro typically viruses bacteria and protozoans to macro parasites mostly flat and roundworms they still represent a major threat to human health especially in low income countries most of the burden of waterborne infections is attributable to unsafe water supply lack of sanitation and poor hygienic conditions which either directly or indirectly affect exposure and transmission rates 4 1 of drivers and controls hydroclimatological forcings the mobility of susceptible infected individuals and large scale treatment are key drivers of waterborne disease transmission gurarie and seto 2009 rinaldo et al 2012 tien and earn 2010 tien et al 2015 the direct inclusion of these factors into spatially explicit mathematical models of epidemic cholera to quote an example of paramount importance has improved the understanding of complex disease patterns bertuzzo et al 2008 2016 2011a chao et al 2011 eisenberg et al 2013 mari et al 2015 2012 rinaldo et al 2012 tuite et al 2011 spatially explicit mathematical models encapsulate remotely acquired relevant descriptions of human settlements waterways where pathogens and or intermediate hosts disperse movement between human communities hydrologic and climate variables water resources development infrastructure finger et al 2014 jutla et al 2011 2013b objective manipulation of such information yields characterizations of waterborne and water based disease dynamics of unprecedented robustness that provides insight into the course of ongoing epidemics aiding short term emergency management of health care resources and long term assessments of alternative interventions chao et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2012 the general structure of spatially explicit models of waterborne disease is outlined in fig 18 the network nodes are animal communities with population hi in which the disease can diffuse and grow in human diseases the nodes can be identified with cities and villages locally a generalization of classical sir susceptible infected recovered models heesterbeek and roberts 1995 is employed to the traditional compartments one further compartment is added that of pathogens in water siwr emphasizing the role of a water reservoir w determining disease transmission dynamics for bacterial infections such models are typically called sirb for example when the pathogen is a bacterium like in cholera this amounts to including the concentration of bacteria in water therefore the dynamics of the metacommunity model is represented by the evolution in time t of the following variables at each node i si t the susceptible hosts ii t the infected and infectious ri t the recovered individuals bi t the bacterial concentration in the ith water reservoir controlling the force of infection fig 18 more complicate models may include an intermediate host living in water for instance in schistosomiasis humans host the adult stage of trematode parasites of the genus schistosoma which reproduce inside humans releasing eggs via urine or faeces the eggs released out of the human body that reach freshwater can hatch into larvae called miracidia the parasite larval form that is infectious for the second host freshwater snails belonging to different genera in the snail miracidia undergo asexual replication then the snail becomes infective and starts releasing tens of thousands of swimming larval stages called cercariae into the water cercariae infect humans penetrating their skin when they come into contact with contaminated freshwater inside the human body cercariae develop into the adult parasite spatially explicit schemes assume that local human settlements undergo sirb dynamics whereas networks of connectivity redistribute pathogens and or hosts among communities appendix the dynamics of disease spread reflects the spatial heterogeneity of its drivers among which the most important are reference is made to two paradigmatic cases of waterborne disease one micro parasitic epidemic cholera and the other macro parasitic endemic schistosomiasis taken as examples of very diverse infections sharing the same hydrological matrix climate that affects transmission rates by displaying correlation with environmental variables like rainfall and air water temperature colwell 1996 constantin de magny et al 2012 emch et al 2008 hashizume et al 2008 jutla et al 2013a koelle et al 2005 lipp et al 2002 pascual et al 2002 2000 ramírez and grady 2016 reiner jr et al 2012 ruiz moreno et al 2007 vezzulli et al 2016 rodó et al 2013 the role of large scale climatic drivers on cholera dynamics is the subject of a lively debate especially about potential threats posed by warming temperatures and increasingly heterogeneous patterns baker austin et al 2013 cash et al 2014 2010 escobar et al 2015 vezzulli et al 2013 2015 the links between climate and schistosomiasis are also being actively investigated mccreesh and booth 2013 pedersen et al 2014 stensgaard et al 2013 in particular because climate change might hinder progress towards control in endemic countries stensgaard et al 2016 wang et al 2014 climate may also influence pathogen ecology and host exposure prospective climate change is speculated to bear fundamental impacts on the geography of waterborne diseases zhou et al 2008 rainfall that influences both cholera and schistosomiasis as well as other macroparasitic waterborne diseases bergquist et al 2015 a variety of potential mechanisms exist whereby rainfall may alter infection risk specifically through flooding leading to raw sewage contamination of water sources hashizume et al 2008 ruiz moreno et al 2007 and enhanced exposure to human to human transmission due to crowding boelee et al 2013 increased rainfall driven iron availability in environmental waters that enhances pathogen survival and expression of toxins faruque et al 2005 lipp et al 2002 dry spells and decreased water levels leading to increased usage of unsafe water sources rebaudet et al 2013b a clear correlation between rainfall and enhanced transmission is found in regions hit by cholera epidemics constantin de magny et al 2008 jutla et al 2013b rebaudet et al 2013a 2013b notably for the haiti outbreak this link has been found empirically gaudart et al 2013 and justified theoretically eisenberg et al 2013 rinaldo et al 2012 at all spatial scales and locations examined intense rainfall events were significantly correlated with increased cholera incidence with lags of the order of a few days and forcing dynamic models with rainfall data invariably resulted in improved fits of reported infection cases one approach rinaldo et al 2012 suggested that bursts of infections could be best explained by accounting for increased contamination rates flux i w see fig 18 an alternative approach eisenberg et al 2013 employed a rainfall dependent exposure rate s i the relationship between precipitation and schistosomiasis is far from obvious it has been argued mccreesh and booth 2013 in fact that rainfall could not only boost disease transmission especially in dry climates where it is a key driver of habitat formation for the intermediate snail host but also reduce it e g by increasing water flow which in turn decreases habitat suitability for both the snails and the larval stages of the parasites rainfall can also affect human activities related to water contact thus potentially altering exposure and transmission risk lai et al 2015 also the temporal fluctuations of rainfall patterns may be particularly important in determining the seasonality of transmission mccreesh et al 2015 several studies in which the ecology of the intermediate snail hosts has been analyzed through field campaigns and geospatial models highlight the strength of the link between rainfall and schistosomiasis transmission hu et al 2013 lai et al 2015 perez saez et al 2015 stensgaard et al 2016 2013 a hydrology driven assessment of intermediate host habitat suitability thus seems necessary wu et al 2008 snail abundance in fact may depend upon density feedbacks that in turn can be driven by hydrologic controls especially in ephemeral hydrologic regimes like those typical of sub saharan africa perez saez et al 2016 therefore a quantitative link exists between hydrological drivers and snail population dynamics suggesting that statistical methods may provide reliable snail abundance projections perez saez et al 2016 and that state of the art mechanistic models of transmission gurarie et al 2016 could be made dependent on habitat type e g natural vs man made and hydrological characteristics e g ephemeral vs permanent water resources development e g damming and irrigation playing a significant role in the increase of disease burden owing to habitat expansion of pathogens and or hosts especially for schistosomiasis bergquist et al 2015 steinmann et al 2006 habitats are shaped naturally by the hydrology geomorphology connections rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 defining the suitability of certain intermediate host species key to the closure of the pathogens life cycle and the survival of pathogens in natural environments gurarie et al 2016 perez saez et al 2016 however the natural habitats are increasingly altered by humans thus making it necessary to include land use change as one of the most important drivers not only of biodiversity loss but also of increased disease susceptibility the development of agricultural practices is certainly one of the main causes of land use change also the larger and larger use of herbicides and fertilizers has also been shown to alter the ecological food web and favor the proliferation of specific intermediate hosts e g those of schistosomiasis rohr et al 2008 hydrologic transport bertuzzo et al 2008 2010 and human mobility bertuzzo et al 2010 finger et al 2016 mari et al 2015 2012 perez saez et al 2015 which regulate respectively short and long range circulation of pathogens and hosts gurarie and seto 2009 perez saez et al 2015 they also determine the spatial and temporal scales relevant to the analysis of epidemiological processes technological innovation provides information for their description at unprecedented rates bengtsson et al 2015 ciddio et al 2017 mari et al 2017b a significant role relevant in particular to this review emerges for the ecological corridors defined by waterways and river networks such hydrologic control derives from the transportation and redistribution of the free living infective propagules in particular because vibrios of cholera can spread along stream both upstream and downstream with a slightly biased propagation downstream the infection patterns prove markedly anisotropic bertuzzo et al 2008 like all too evident in the early phases of the 2011 haiti epidemics where the artibonite river functioned as the corridor for the initial phase of the epidemic bertuzzo et al 2011b gaudart et al 2013 social drivers i e processes relevant to disease transmission mediated by human practice broadly including inapparent infections king et al 2008 water sanitation hygiene wash conditions azman et al 2016 bi et al 2016 freeman et al 2016 grimes et al 2015 mari et al 2012 sokolow et al 2016 and the differential outcomes of large scale control strategies abubakar et al 2015 azman and lessler 2014 lo et al 2016 considerable research exists on the impact of water treatment practices hand washing and diet in urban dunkle et al 2011 and rural o connor et al 2011 settings on cholera risks in water and food sources hill et al 2011 others have evaluated the effectiveness of intervention efforts like treatment centers educational campaigns and latrine building beau de rochars et al 2011 ernst et al 2011 two main types of large scale medical treatments have been studied so far for cholera vaccinations and the extended use of antibiotics abubakar et al 2015 azman and lessler 2014 ivers et al 2010 spatially explicit process descriptions and data acquisition proved increasingly effective to understand the impact of various drivers on local disease transmission rates and to realistically simulate large scale infection patterns bertuzzo et al 2008 tien and earn 2010 the robustness of simulations and predictions drawn from network models is granted by their spatial structure rooted in remotely acquired and objectively manipulated information as shown e g by applications to epidemic cholera bertuzzo et al 2008 2016 2011a chao et al 2011 finger et al 2016 gatto et al 2012 mari et al 2012 rinaldo et al 2012 tuite et al 2011 and proved formally via model selection techniques mari et al 2015 uncertainty analysis data assimilation and filtering techniques for these spatially explicit schemes are now also available pasetto et al 2017 they can reproduce complex stratifications of disease burden when transmission is heterogeneous in part owing to river networks and connected waterways where the pathogen thrives and in part due to host mobility a key factor in the spreading of the pathogen although our lines of argument are meant to apply in general specific cases and references thereof will first focus on cholera and schistosomiasis as significant examples of vastly different transmission mechanisms 4 2 spatially explicit modelling of cholera and schistosomiasis spatially explicit disease infection models have radically changed the very concept of basic reproduction number r 0 indeed challenging problems arise when observed infection patterns show spatial structure and or temporal asynchrony these features are ironed out by spatially implicit schemes that ignore spatial effects by assuming a uniform distribution of susceptible and infected individuals across the domain of interest with these simplified assumptions the traditional definition of r 0 applies the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected individual introduced in a healthy population which can be rather easily calculated from epidemiological parameters and the size of host population because of the current ease of mapping hydrology sanitation and transportation infrastructures in addition to the actual population distributions and proxies of their wash conditions a byproduct of remotely acquired and objectively manipulated information the conditions leading to waterborne disease outbreaks can be studied in a spatially explicit framework however the adoption of spatially explicit schemes is only recent and mainly with reference to cholera gatto et al 2012 2013 mari et al 2014a and schistosomiasis gurarie and seto 2009 perez saez et al 2015 we expect however that similar approaches will follow up soon for other diseases as well because the underlying mathematical framework is general diekmann and heesterbeek 2000 tien et al 2015 one important result that emerges from all the cases studied so far is that the requirement that all the local reproduction numbers be greater than one i e the traditional epidemiological tenet mediated from spatially implicit approaches is neither necessary nor sufficient a condition for outbreaks to occur when spatial heterogeneity and pathogen redistributions are a factor fig 19 this statement is not limited to waterborne diseases rather it holds in general whenever local epidemiological dynamics are coupled together by spatial connectivity the basic reproduction number must be replaced by the dominant eigenvalue of the 4n 4n jacobian matrix n is the number of nodes linearized about the disease free equilibrium moreover the eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue carries important information about the geography of waterborne or water based disease gatto et al 2012 2013 mari et al 2014a perez saez et al 2015 human infections occurring through contacts with water contaminated with free living macro parasite stages pose other challenges largely mediated by the abundance of intermediate hosts possibly subject to a complex ecology colley et al 2014 in the case of schistosomiasis the disease transmission is controlled by contact with environmental freshwater infested with parasite larvae endowed with a complex life cycle and ecology perez saez et al 2016 sokolow et al 2014 swartz et al 2015 reinfection after treatment is a problem that plagues efforts to control parasites with complex transmission pathways such as schistosomiasis low cost sustainable forms of intermediate host control coupled with drug distribution campaigns could reduce or locally eliminate the parasite grimes et al 2015 sokolow et al 2015 at regional scales where the need for spatially explicit descriptions is particularly compelling different communities are characterized by differential infection risks linked to their geographical and socio economic context a recent global assessment of schistosomiasis control over the past century has suggested that targeting the snail intermediate host works best sokolow et al 2016 however neither safe water supplies could completely prevent human contact with environmental freshwater nor adequate sanitation could guarantee its generalized usage grimes et al 2015 moreover agricultural domestic occupational and recreational tasks may foster contact with potentially infested water leading to non negligible risk factors even in contexts where water provisioning and sanitation are adequate spear 2012 this coupled with differences in lifestyles leads to complex determinants of transmission heterogeneity mari et al 2017a social groups and ages are also a matter of concern for macro parasitic infections as e g people whose routinary activities bring them in contact with water say fishermen and farmers or consider cultural settings in which women are more prone to water contact than men water contact patterns may also vary over time as a response to seasonal changes in human activities e g related to agriculture and farming resulting in temporal heterogeneity in schistosomiasis transmission attempts to incorporate socioeconomic classes and risk groups into waterborne disease models are quite few in both applied remais et al 2009 and theoretical studies barbour 1978 strong seasonal patterns in the transmission intensity and infection prevalence in both human and snail hosts still need a settlement within large scale spatially explicit modeling frameworks 4 3 spatially explicit modelling of pkd one last example which seems particularly fit to the focus on fluvial ecological corridors concerns the spread possibly rapid and deadly of a particular fish disease proliferative kidney disease pkd is a high mortality pathology that critically affects freshwater salmonid populations infection is caused by the endoparasitic myxozoan tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae that cycles between freshwater bryozoans and salmonids exploiting the former as primary hosts proliferative kidney disease pkd is recognized as a major threat to both wild and farmed salmonid populations in europe and north america mortality due to pkd in farmed fish ranges from 20 to 100 clifton hadley et al 1986 feist and longshaw 2006 ferguson and ball 1979 okamura et al 2011 the impacts of pkd on wild fish populations are generally poorly known although pkd has been linked to long term decline of swiss brown trout populations borsuk et al 2006 pkd incidence and relevant fish mortality are strongly correlated with water temperature therefore climate change is feared to extend the disease range to higher altitude and latitude regions with major consequences hari et al 2006 the first dynamical model of pkd epidemiology in local communities has recently been developed carraro et al 2016 the local model accounts for local demographic and epidemiological dynamics of bryozoans and salmonids explicitly incorporates the role of water temperature and couples intra and inter seasonal dynamics fig 20 shows that during the warm season left column susceptible bryozoans bs become covertly infected bc after contact with spores zf released by infected fish infection in bryozoans cycles between covert and overt bo states bs yield uninfected statoblasts ss i e asexually produced propagules while bc release both uninfected and infected si statoblasts infected bryozoans may clear the infection susceptible fish fs are exposed to pkd after contact with spores zb released by bo after an incubation phase fe fish can either become acutely infected fi or directly enter an asymptomatic carrier state fc fi can die owing to pkd or become long term disease carriers fc may become susceptible again both fi and fc shed spores infective to bryozoans at the beginning of a new warm season central column bs are comprised of susceptible colonies that survived during winter and by hatched ss similarly bc consist of survived colonies that were infected at the beginning of winter and of hatched si fs are composed by survived susceptible individuals and newborn fish from all classes the abundance of fc is determined by the number of individuals belonging to classes fe fi and fc that survived through winter other classes are absent the spatially explicit model fig 20c shows the connectivity of local models operating at the scale of a river reach of relatively homogeneous geomorphic features i e a node effectively carried out by the river network the substrate for host and pathogen interactions for mathematical details see carraro et al 2016 a stability analysis of this time hybrid system performed via floquet theory bacaër and ouifki 2007 mari et al 2014a suggests that whenever the epidemiological parameters are set to realistic values the introduction of t bryosalmonae in a previously disease free community will most likely trigger a pkd outbreak a sensitivity analysis of the system shows that when the disease becomes endemic the impact of pkd on fish population size is mostly controlled by the temperature dependent rates of disease development in the fish host on the other hand this first model was still a local one with no regard to the fundamental role played by spatial dynamics indeed understanding how different local communities distributed in space interact with each other is crucial to possibly predict the spreading of a pkd epidemic and the effect of intervention strategies from a theoretical viewpoint as we said above the condition that disease free equilibria in all local communities be unstable is neither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of outbreaks when such communities are connected by different layers of connectivity affecting transmission gatto et al 2012 while the effects of landscape and river network connectivity have extensively been evaluated for waterborne diseases affecting humans the literature focusing on modelling processes of waterborne animal diseases was scarce if not null in a spatial metacommunity framework yet the issue of pinpointing effective mitigation strategies for wildlife diseases such as pkd is becoming increasingly critical for environmental policy makers a noteworthy example is given by the recent pkd outbreak occurred in the yellowstone river montana usa robbins 2016 where due to an unprecedented fish kill the local wildlife authorities imposed the closure of a 300 km long river stretch and related tributaries to all recreational activities to prevent farther spread of the parasite a proper predictive tool for the spatial dynamics of pkd remains elusive to date despite its clear importance for disease control and impact mitigation for this reason carraro et al 2017 set out to study the key influence of network effects on pkd mortality and prevalence patterns and on the celerity of disease propagation building on the recently proposed first local model of pkd transmission carraro et al 2016 a spatially explicit metacommunity framework has been developed to study the spatial effects in the spread of the disease in idealized stream networks at the local community scale the model accounts for demographic and epidemiological dynamics of bryozoan and fish populations at the network scale the model couples the dynamics of each local community through hydrological transport of parasite spores and fish movement the model also explicitly accounts for water temperature variations that influence epidemiological parameters for heterogeneity in habitat characteristics and for hydrological conditions along a river network the idealized stream network is obtained as an ocn which defines a tree that spans the whole landscape we consider landscapes formed by square lattices of d p 2 pixels whose side has length lp in the real world however a drainage path becomes a stream only when certain hydrological conditions are met the simplest and most tested method assumes that pixels form a channel when their contributing area a proxy of landscape forming discharge exceeds a certain threshold a c t carraro et al 2017 the network is then discretized into stretches each of which defined as a sequence t of channelized pixels starting from one pixel having either zero river sources or more than one channelized upstream pixels confluences and containing the downstream sequence of channelized pixels until another confluence or the outlet are reached the obtained network of stretches is an oriented graph suitable for the application of the pkd metacommunity model the second step in the generation of synthetic river networks consists in the definition of the geomorphological properties of each river stretch ns is the number of stretches cross sections are approximated with rectangular shapes having width w depth d and average water velocity v to account for how these geometric variables change along the network we exploit a classical result of river geomorphology rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 according to which w q 0 5 d q 0 4 and v q 0 1 where q is river discharge by invoking the proportionality between landscape forming discharge and contributing area at a site one has w k w o a k 0 5 d k d o a k 0 4 v k v o a k 0 1 where the subscript k identifies a generic stretch k and wo do and vo are the maximum values i e at the outlet for width depth and velocity respectively a k a c i k d p 2 is the normalized contributing area to stretch k subscript ik identifies the last downstream pixel of stretch k the last element of t k the discharge at the outlet of the catchment reads then q o w o d o v o the water volume in a generic stretch k is v k w k d k l s k where the length l s k i t k l i and l i l p if the flow direction along pixel i is parallel to a pixel side or l i 2 l p if parallel to the pixel diagonal the slope area relationship allows one to evaluate the elevation of the network stretches the elevation drop along a network pixel can indeed be expressed as δ z i s o a i 0 5 l i where so is the outlet slope this relationship can be iteratively applied starting from the outlet pixel where an arbitrary elevation zo is imposed towards all upstream paths in order to reconstruct the elevation of each channelized pixel the elevation of a stretch can be defined as the average elevation among all constituting pixels examples of ocns obtained by changing only the location of the output pixel are shown in fig 21 scale parameters that define the metric of the river network were chosen to be representative of a prealpine catchment of around 1000 km2 the seasonal cycle of stream water temperature typically follows that of air temperature albeit being damped and possibly delayed however notable deviations can be observed in streams with large impoundments or lakes upstream or when the thermal regime is dominated by ice snow melting for this exercise we assume that water temperature at the outlet reach to τ follows a sinusoidal function with period equal to one year to derive time series of water temperature for all network stretches we further assume that water temperature mirrors the environmental lapse rate of air temperature water temperature in a generic stretch k is then t k τ t o τ γ w δ z k where γw is the lapse rate and δzk the difference in elevation with respect to the outlet lapse rates for air temperature can range from about 9 8 oc km 1 for dry air dry adiabatic lapse rate dalr to about 4 0 oc km 1 for hot saturated air saturated adiabatic lapse rate we assume γw equal to 6 5 oc km 1 a typical value that is used as global mean environmental lapse rate for air temperature carraro et al 2017 the fish mobility rate li can be thought of as the inverse of the population average residence time within stretch i in general stretches may have different geometric and physical characteristics e g length water volume and depth velocity fish carrying capacity and thus li is expected to change across the river network li is computed in such a way that the stationary state of the underlying diffusion process is a specific spatial distribution of fish abundances fi the underlying idea is that in order to apply the model first a distribution of fish abundance at carrying capacity is assigned according to the characteristics of each stretch then a set of mobility rates li is derived so that fish movement leads at steady state to the desired abundance distribution once movements rules are determined diffusion matrix p the values of li such that a distribution of fish abundances fi is an equilibrium state are obtained by solving the following linear system 7 p i j l i f i p j i l j f j i n s j n s note that only n s 1 of the above equations are nontrivial identities in fact pij 0 only if stretches i and j are directly connected and every stretch has one downstream connection with the exception of the outlet stretch the system has 1 solutions indeed if a set of li is a solution also the same set multiplied by a scalar is a solution it is thus possible to focus on a single solution by specifying the average mobility rate across the network lavg the model has been applied to several replicas of ocn landscapes see appendix fig 21 results show how network connectivity and hydrological conditions critically control the spatial distribution of the prevalence of pkd and the celerity of invasion fronts in the upstream and downstream directions fig 22 shows how connectivity and fish mobility affect the distribution of disease prevalence i e the fraction of infected fish two main types of pattern arise when mobility rates are considerably high prevalence decreases as the distance from the outlet increases fig 22a d when instead fish mobility is negligible the sites with higher prevalence are those whose contributing area is higher fig 22b c contributing area is indeed a proxy of the abundance of parasite spores that enter a given stretch which is the main driver of infection in the absence of fish movement in this case small headwater stretches in the proximity of the outlet are not invaded by the parasite see magenta arrows in fig 22b conversely high mobility rates enhance the mixing process among local communities with the result that the variability in prevalence among neighbouring stretches is low and the average network prevalence increases when mobility rates are tuned to more realistic values i e by assuming the distribution of mean residence times of fig 21b the distribution of prevalence shows an intermediate behaviour blue lines in fig 22c d patterns of fish loss exhibit an analogous trend the inclusion of an elevation gradient has a minor impact on the distribution of prevalence fig 22e of course this depends on the lapse rate chosen as a consequence of diminished temperature a decrease of prevalence in upstream stretches is observed which is not compensated for by a corresponding increment in lower altitude stretches this causes a small reduction in the average network prevalence about 1 5 regardless of fish mobility as for the distribution of fish loss fig 22f the effects of non uniform temperature are slightly accentuated at the outlet fish loss is generally higher 4 3 when lavg is null but the fish loss does not change substantially with respect to the flat landscape case also a sensitivity analysis of disease propagation celerity with respect to the contamination rates pathogen spores produced by both fish and bryozoans and the fish mobility rate lavg has been conducted downstream propagation generally occurs after one to three seasons much faster than upstream propagation which reaches a steady state after around 100 seasons as a consequence of the bias in the hydrological transport of spores and of its fast dynamics expectedly both the fish mobility and the contamination rates are positively correlated with propagation celerity in both directions although the role of lavg in downstream propagation is minor when both contamination and mobility are small rather obviously pkd might not establish in the network note that while the absence of pkd at the outlet stretch implies that the whole network is disease free this is not necessarily true with regards to the headwaters similar effects are produced by variations of fish or variations of bryozoan contamination rates fish movement and hydrological transport within a river network can thus produce a heterogeneous distribution of pkd prevalence and fish loss even in the absence of spatial gradients of fish and bryozoan densities or of transmission rates carraro et al 2017 the typical lifetime of pkd spores around 1 day allow them to travel along with the flow and possibly infect fish tens of kilometers downstream of the point where they are released stretches further downstream thus collect spores from the whole or a large portion of the upstream area and are therefore more likely to exhibit higher pkd prevalence and fish loss conversely headwaters and low order streams are subject only to the spore load that is locally released and thus tend to be relatively less affected by pkd therefore hydrological transport of spores tends to produce spatial patterns of disease prevalence correlated to the upstream drainage area this dominant pattern can partially be affected by fish mobility indeed a headwater connected directly to a high order stream is subject to immigration of likely infected fish that foster local prevalence overall fish mobility promotes the mixing between low and high order streams resulting in a net increase of overall prevalence at the network scale elevation of river stretches is intimately related to the structure of the underlying river network indeed the well established and observed slope drainage area relationship dictates that a network configuration is uniquely associated to a relative elevation distribution of river sites thus network structure controls as a byproduct also the distribution of elevations a proxy of mean water temperature and in turn of pkd prevalence carraro et al 2016 indeed water temperature generally decreases with elevation and thus with the distance to the outlet temperature gradients tend thus to produce distributions of pkd prevalence akin to those discussed above driven by hydrological transport and fish mobility however results report that at least for the above example the effect of temperature might be minor compared to that produced by spatial coupling mechanisms the river network analyzed herein spans an elevation relief of about 1000 m which translates in about 6 5 oc difference in mean water temperature larger network with more pronounced elevation relief can possibly lead to more important effect of temperature gradients the invasion celerity of pkd in the downstream direction is mostly controlled by hydrological transport of spores whereas fish mobility has only a marginal effect for transmission parameters leading to high pkd prevalence above 90 a value sometimes observed in affected river systems wahli et al 2007 2002 the disease can invade from tens to hundreds of kilometers of river within a single proliferation season provided that all sites are equally suitable for fish and bryozoans upstream invasion of pkd from a region of the network close to the outlet can occur only via fish swimming against the flow direction the corresponding celerity is much slower than the downstream one with realistic values of fish mobility e g l a v g 0 02 d 1 pkd can travel upstream only few kilometers per season modelling fish mobility as a diffusion process implicitly assumes that fish engage in trips with a thin tailed distribution of distance carraro et al 2017 as discussed above this is a useful working hypothesis one might assume on the contrary different diffusion processes within the river network like e g a heavy tailed distribution of reachable distances this could lead to anomalous diffusion and enhanced celerity of propagation of disease fronts into disease free regions other factors not included in this analysis e g detailed descriptions of the transport of spores or infection of bryozoans or statoblasts through ballast water or by waterfowl okamura et al 2011 can boost the propagation in both directions via long distance dispersal as well we conclude that spatial coupling mechanisms i e hydrological transport of spores and fish mobility matter only during the bryozoan proliferation season in which pkd can actually be transmitted typically from april to november while this hypothesis is reasonable for parasite spores whose survival time scale is much shorter than the duration of the winter season it might be questionable as concerns fish indeed fish movement in the cold season even if it cannot spread the disease can enhance the redistribution of pkd carriers it is known that salmonids may move by several kilometers upstream in late summer or autumn for spawning and an analogous distance is covered downstream in early spring however brown trout are usually subject to natal homing frank et al 2012 and so they tend to return to the same place moreover pkd is not vertically transmitted to newborn fish hence we argue that neglecting winter fish mobility does not frustrate our model s ability to capture the effect of this crucial process on the patterns of pkd prevalence the above results further our understanding of the drivers of fish distribution in riverine ecosystems and provide the basis for the development of intervention and management tools which is one of the main tenets of this paper 5 concluding remarks general lessons that can be drawn from our perspective pertain a twofold advance that we consider acquired on the one hand the role of directional dispersal embedded in the topology and metrics of river networks as the substrate for ecological interactions proves fundamental theoretically and experimentally its remarkable effects are relevant to unfolding or declining biodiversity population dynamics including biological invasions the spread of waterborne disease this is far from generally acknowledged to date yet particularly clear in our view on the other hand spatially explicit metacommunity models of biodiversity of population dynamics as well as of waterborne and water based disease transmissions are fast learners from any source of distributed information dynamic models of this kind may be particularly effective in understanding patterns of biodiversity and of biological invasions as well as in planning containment efforts of emerging infectious diseases all of them being decisively affected by the topology and metrics of the river network and the embedded directional dispersal allowed by their form and function despite differences in methods that will be tested through model guided field validations mathematical modeling of large scale water controls on biota i e the core business of ecohydrology offer a broad perspective on a range of biological processes only briefly examined in this paper though following a coherent conceptual thread we believe that neglecting opportunities to develop this path or simply fostering a common cultural bias against modelling approaches especially in public health assessment will contribute to keep the world s social inequalities and injustice in the statu quo several open issues remain in a number of areas relevant to this review for example the use of estimated hydrologic controls as a metric for model study comparisons could parallel current practice as data on the biota say related to waterborne disease are often of limited quality such that it is often difficult to distinguish between models on the grounds of better or worse performance progress in data assimilation and model validation is also needed in particular in view of the nature of available field data the different datasets to be utilised in fact have rather different quality because uncertainty on topographic hydrologic or ecological data tends to be radically different this constrains our ability to validate integrated models to some extent and is keen to have an impact on the acceptance of spatial models in other communities e g in the public health area it is the authors belief however that these approach will become mainstream soon enough owing to their intrinsic advantages optimal control of intervention measures possibly in emergency management is a natural development of the current tools it will naturally follow from the solid establishment of the field of spatially explicit ecohydrology of species populations and pathogens of waterborne disease missing steps for advancing this area concern the availability of model guided field validations and suitable data to be assimilated into the model we expect significant steps forward in this area to come from remote sensing and digital image processing and from other technological advances like the widespread availability of human mobility fluxes tracked by cell phones currently arbitrarily managed at times in rather untransparent ways by providers and monopolists environmental dna fingerprinting is also a technique that will increasingly provide large amounts of field data of great ecological importance what limits the widespread uptake of models for decision making at the interface of hydrology and ecology is a serious matter of current debate in the field of hydrology it is widely accepted that modelling tools are needed to overcome the limitation of extrapolating from data in a nonstationary world therein model based decisions are the norm to investigate possible interventions under what if scenarios in biodiversity preservation protection from unfolding biological invasions or public health control of waterborne disease transmission such a transition has not yet happened perhaps what is missing to prompt a radical attitude change in these areas is a massive set of visible applications the haiti cholera epidemic 2011 seems to have represented an important testbed to that end or perhaps visible joint initiatives where direct comparisons between data based strategies and modelling aided scenarios are made what we are about to pursue next is a generalized use of assimilated models of the spatially explicit type to assess optimal control of interventions strategies for the containment of waterborne disease spread say where to best allocate finite batch of vaccines in space and time in epidemiology this is way beyond current public health management of emergences the road traced by hydrologists and by oceanographers and meteorologists before them will be eventually followed in the future by ecologists and public health officials in our not so unbiased perhaps view

opp1114791 the authors wish to thank two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript appendix optimal channel networks ocns and their landscapes moving from the exact result that drainage network configurations minimizing total energy dissipation are stationary solutions of the general equation describing landscape evolution banavar et al 2000 it was argued rinaldo et al 2014 1999 1992 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 that at least in the fluvial landscape nature works through imperfect searches for dynamically accessible optimal configurations and that purely random or deterministic constructs are unsuitable to properly describe natural network forms here we review the model of river networks known as optimal channel network ocn rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 the ocn model was originally based on the ansatz that configurations occurring in nature minimize a functional describing total energy dissipation and on the derivation of an explicit form for such a functional the latter uses locally landscape forming flowrates qi and the drop in potential energy to define energy dissipation qiδzi i e approximated by qi ai where ai is total contributing area at i and by the drop in elevation δ z i a i γ 1 with γ 1 2 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 spanning loopless network configurations characterized by minimum energy dissipation are obtained by selecting the configuration say s that minimizes the functional a 1 h γ s i 1 n q i δ z i i 1 n a i γ where i spans the lattice say of n sites the configuration s determines uniquely on a spanning tree the values of ai see below and it proves crucial banavar et al 2000 rinaldo et al 2014 1992 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 that one has a concave functional i e γ 1 directly from the physics of the problem subsumed by the slope area relation the global minimum i e the ground state of the functional in eq a 1 is exactly characterized by known mean field exponents rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 and one might expect to approach the mean field behavior by reaching a stable local minima upon careful annealing of the system this is in fact the case the proof of the above is not trivial any stationary solution of the landscape evolution equation must locally satisfy the relationship z i a i 1 2 between flux area and the topographic gradient at any point i and gradients are approximated by δzi the largest drop in elevation at i one can thus uniquely associate any landscapes with an oriented spanning and loopless graph on a lattice and reconstruct the field of cumulative areas ai corresponding to a given oriented spanning graph note also that we wish to emphasize the dependence on the configuration s a 1 a 2 a n that the system assumes on the features of the oriented spanning graph associated with the landscape topography z through its gradients z that uniquely defines total contributing areas a i i 1 n in a n site lattice what is totally surprising is that empirically observed scaling features are only reproduced by myopic searches of dynamically accessible configurations that cannot get rid of the inheritance of extant constraints the scaling structure topological and metric of configurations characterized by suboptimal energy dissipation matches perfectly those observed in nature and differs significantly from ground states rinaldo et al 2006 2014 1999 optimal arrangements of network structures and branching patterns thus result from the direct minimization of the functional in eq a 1 the basic operational problem to obtain ocns for a given domain is to find the connected path draining it that minimizes hγ s without postulating predefined features e g the number of sources or the link lengths one key problem is the assessment of the robustness of ocn configurations selected by any minimum procedure this has been studied rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 with respect to the strategy for minimum search the role of initial conditions the robustness of the functional dependence on γ the role of lattice anisotropies the effects of quenched randomness rinaldo et al 1992 the basic optimization strategies are similar to algorithms developed in the context of non numerable np complete problems where the exponential growth of possible configurations prevents complete enumeration iterated random searches work best in that context rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 the basic algorithm proceeds as follows an initial network configuration s is chosen as a spanning tree on the grid to drain an overall area made up by n sites this defines an orientation and a connection for each pixel stating to which of the eight neighboring pixels its area is draining neighbors being assumed at unit distance from the centroid this in turn needed both preliminary and a posteriori speculations on whether a triangular lattice with six neighboring nodes or an anisotropic scheme in which diagonal connections were weighted by a 2 factor would be a better model of local interactions rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 a scalar state variable ai t denotes the total area at a point i at stage t of the optimization process a i t j w i j t a j t 1 where wij is the now dynamic functional operator that has the connectivity matrix as its static counterpart by w i j t 1 if i j are connected 0 otherwise that is wij t implies that j i is a drainage direction note that j spans the 8 neighboring pixels of the arbitrary ith site the unit mass added refers to the area representative of the actual site as a proxy of the distributed injection term from the initial configuration stage t 0 the basic strategy consists of drawing a site at random and perturbing the system by assigning a change δwij i e by modifying at random its connection to the former receiving pixel hence w i j t 1 w i j t δ w i j this corresponds to perturbing the configuration s s s adjusting to such a local modification all aggregated areas ai are modified in the downstream region until the original and the modified path reconvene the change is accepted if the modified value of hγ s is lowered by the random change hγ s hγ s and no loops are formed loops are excluded on a rigorous basis as it was shown exactly that they lead to energetically unfavorable configurations for the functional in eq with γ 1 every tree is a local minimum of total energy expenditure rinaldo et al 2006 as the new configuration is adopted as a base configuration the process is iterated otherwise the change is discarded if hγ s hγ s and the t stage configuration s is perturbed again the procedure leads to a configuration for which no improvement on total energy expenditure appears after a fixed and large number of iterations i e an ocn the whole process may or may not be then reset and restarted from the same initial configuration this is done several times at times to allow the random process a fair chance to capture nonlocal minima should they be of interest the configuration attaining the lowest energy dissipation amongst the trials described before is chosen as the ocn instructive visual schemes of the progress of the basic selection algorithm is illustrated elsewhere briggs and krishnamoorthy 2013 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 this basic procedure at times termed the lin or the greedy approach because of the similarities with the n city traveling salesman algorithm rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 respects the rules of a fair search for approximate solutions but is apt to yield trapping in local minimum energy variants of the basic algorithm implemented to test the importance of choice of strategy for minimum search include the metropolis algorithm multiple simultaneous perturbations and simulated annealing schemes are engineered to avoid trapping of the configuration into unsuitable local minima this is done by accepting perturbations of the current configuration s s even if they yield hγ s hγ s with a probability depending on a state parameter t in practice the probability of acceptance of the perturbation is given by the metropolis rule i e it is 1 if the resulting change corresponds to hγ s hγ s or if δ h h γ s h γ s 0 and e δ h t r and 0 otherwise where r is a random number r 0 1 to carry out proper annealing one makes changes in the parameter t from relatively high values at the start to low values towards the end of the analysis clearly for high values of t the likelihood of accepting unfavorable changes is high whereas for t 0 the rule is equal to that of the basic algorithm a cooling schedule for decreasing values of t as the procedure evolves is thus required rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 optimal arrangements of network structures and branching patterns thus result from the direct minimization of the functional in eq a 1 the basic operational problem to obtain ocns for a given domain is to find the connected path s draining it that minimizes hγ s without postulating predefined features e g the number of sources or the link lengths random perturbations of an initial structure imply disconnecting and reorienting a single link at a time rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 they lead to new configurations that are accepted details aside if they lower total energy expenditure i e the functional in eq a 1 iterated until many perturbations are unable to prompt change by finding better configurations loops possibly generated by the random configuration search in the fitness landscape were excluded at first without a rigorous basis only later it was shown exactly that they lead to energetically unfavorable configurations banavar et al 2000 2001 rinaldo et al 2006 for realistic values of γ derived from slope area empirical evidence boundary conditions are required for the evolving optimal trees as outlet s must be imposed single or multiple outlets along drainage lines as well as no flux or periodic boundary conditions briggs and krishnamoorthy 2013 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 interesting issues emerge on the statics dynamics and complexity of ocns rinaldo et al 2014 exact results reviewed in rinaldo et al 2014 exist on the existence of many dynamically accessible stable states the practical impossibility of pointing out a priori the most stable feasible state among all metastable states without an evolutionary account of the history of the current configuration of the system the hierarchical structure and the universality class of dynamically accessible states although the above are features that river networks share with other natural complex systems the extent of observations and comparative analyses the exact relation to the general evolution equations and the broad range of scales involved suggest their interest as a general model system of how nature works bak 1996 thus one recurrent self organized mechanism for the dynamic origin of fractal forms is the robust strive for imperfect optimality that we see embedded in many natural patterns especially hydrologic ones example of spatially explicit siwr model a spatially explicit siwr model of epidemic cholera is presented here as an appendix to the main text all spatially explicit epidemiological models follow from the same scheme as they belong in a special class of metacommunity models section 2 the basic epidemiological model derives from the spatially distributed siwr model termed sirb for bacterial diseases like cholera bertuzzo et al 2005 pasetto et al 2017 the population is subdivided into n communities each community is represented by a node of the model fig 18 the individuals in each node i are subdivided into three separate categories susceptible symptomatic infected and recovered whose number at time t are denoted with si t ii t and ri t respectively the concentration of v cholerae in the local environment corresponding to node i is indicated with bi t the following set of coupled ordinary differential equations describes the cholera transmission dynamics a 2 d i i d t σ f i t s i γ μ α i i a 3 d r i d t 1 σ f i t s i γ i i ρ μ r i a 4 d b i d t μ b b i p w i 1 ϕ j i t i i ℓ b i j 1 n p j i w j b j w i where the population hi of each node is assumed to be at demographic equilibrium if α 0 thus the equation for susceptibles in this case reduces to s i t h i i i t r i t the term fi t is called force of infection and represents the rate at which susceptible individuals are exposed to contaminated water expressed as f i t β i 1 m b i k b i m j 1 n q i j b j k b j parameter β denotes the maximum exposure rate which in this application is assumed to differ among the nodes the fraction b i k b i is the probability of becoming infected due to the exposure to a concentration bi of v cholerae k being the half saturation constant codeço 2001 the force of infection takes into account the possible disease propagation due to human mobility with the idea that a fraction m of susceptible individuals daily commute between nodes and can thus be exposed to pathogens at the destination two options have been used to compute the probability qij that an individual living at node i commutes to j one is the gravity model erlander and stewart 1990 i e q i j h j e d i j d where the attractiveness of node j depends on its population size hj while the deterrence factor is assumed to be dependent on the distance dij between the two communities via an exponential kernel with shape factor d alternatively a radiation model may be implemented in uniformly dense contexts simini et al 2012 the second option has been to derive mobility fluxes qij directly from the tracking of mobile phone records a tool that proves essential in the case of non routine gatherings like religious pilgrimages in senegal that ignite infection spreads finger et al 2016 a fraction σ of the infected individuals develops symptoms thus entering class ii the remaining fraction 1 σ is asymptomatic and therefore does not contribute to the disease transmission and enters the recovered compartment directly symptomatically infected individuals recover at a rate γ or die due to cholera or other causes at rates α or μ respectively note that here α is set to zero to maintain the demographic equilibrium in fact a value of α different from zero under the assumption of constant population would imply that the birth rate increases to overcome the deaths due to cholera which is inconsistent recovered individuals lose their immunity and return to the susceptible compartment at a rate ρ or die at a rate μ symptomatic individuals contribute to the environmental concentration of v cholerae at a rate p wi where p is the rate at which bacteria excreted by an infected individual reach and contaminate an imaginary environmental water reservoir of volume wi assumed to be proportional to population size i e w i c h i as in rinaldo et al 2012 environmental v cholerae are assumed to decay at a rate μb the hydrologic dispersal of bacteria if embedded in the last term of eq a 4 bacteria undergo hydrologic dispersal at a rate ℓ pathogens can travel from node i to j with probability pij we assume the p i j 1 if j is the downstream nearest neighbor of node i and zero otherwise the mobility of infected individuals are not considered here bertuzzo et al 2016 pasetto et al 2017 while bacterial dispersal along the hydrological network is typically an important transmission process at the first stages of a cholera epidemics subsequent current reported epidemiological data as notably observed for the haitian 2010 epidemics are uncorrelated to the channel network for what concern the mobility of infected individuals most of them require urgent hydration treatment at healthcare points thus the hypothesis that a relevant fraction of infect individuals commutes among the nodes is unconvincing in order to express the deterioration of sanitary conditions caused by rainfall the contamination rate p is increased by the rainfall intensity ji t via a coefficient ϕ rinaldo et al 2012 by introducing the dimensionless bacterial concentrations b i b i k it is possible to group three model parameters into a single ratio θ p c k bertuzzo et al 2008 the weekly cholera cases are computed by integrating the number of new cases in every commune i e σfisi the equations are usually been solved by runge kutta methods bertuzzo et al 2016 pasetto et al 2017 to assess the impact of vaccination campaigns the model needs be adapted to consider vaccinated individuals we assume that vaccination targets individuals independently of their cholera infection history i e both susceptible s and already immune individuals r are eligible with the same probability vaccinated individuals already immune are assumed to remain completely immune while vaccinated susceptibles benefit from a leaky immunity with vaccine efficacy 0 η 1 thus reducing the susceptibility by η oral vaccination is assume to provide immunity with a delay of one week after administration of a single dose due to the short time horizon of the forecast at this stage no assumption is made for the duration of the vaccine induced immunity and individuals remain immune for the duration of this study at each node i the number of vaccinated individuals at a time t is subdivided into three separate categories in addition to si ii and ri denoted as vaccinated susceptible individuals v i s vaccinated individuals that become infected v i i and vaccinated recovered which have a complete immunity v i r the equations are modified accordingly pasetto et al 2017 as shown schematically in the scheme of fig 18d where the number of susceptible individuals is computed as s i h i i i r i v i s v i i v i r the model assumes a linear ramp up of vaccine uptake meaning that daily number of ocv doses distributed in each community νi is computed by equally deploying the available doses during the days of the campaign normally vaccines are evenly distributed among susceptible and recovered individuals the delay of one week in the vaccine derived immunity is modelled by starting the ocv campaign with a delay of one week to model the leaky immunity of vaccinated susceptible individuals the force of infection fi is decreased of a factor 1 η as depicted in fig 18 
873,this paper draws together several lines of argument to suggest that an ecohydrological framework i e laboratory field and theoretical approaches focused on hydrologic controls on biota has contributed substantially to our understanding of the function of river networks as ecological corridors such function proves relevant to the spatial ecology of species population dynamics and biological invasions the spread of waterborne disease as examples we describe metacommunity predictions of fish diversity patterns in the mississippi missouri basin geomorphic controls imposed by the fluvial landscape on elevational gradients of species richness the zebra mussel invasion of the same mississippi missouri river system and the spread of proliferative kidney disease in salmonid fish we conclude that spatial descriptions of ecological processes in the fluvial landscape constrained by their specific hydrologic and ecological dynamics and by the ecosystem matrix for interactions i e the directional dispersal embedded in fluvial and host pathogen mobility networks have already produced a remarkably broad range of significant results notable scientific and practical perspectives are thus open in the authors view to future developments in ecohydrologic research keywords metapopulation models metacommunity models spatially explicit ecology directional dispersal substrate topology 1 introduction 1 1 the context although natural ecosystems are characterized by striking diversity of form and functions they often exhibit symmetries at times emerging across scales of space time and organizational complexity levin 1992 one angle through which such features could be looked at is via the necessary linkages among macroecological laws banavar et al 2007 southwood et al 2006 where scaling theory offers a powerful tool to make way for coherent unified descriptions of patterns in species numbers and their abundance and size patterns also emerge in relation to broad ecosystem features like the topology of the substrate for ecological interactions bertuzzo et al 2007 2011b fagan 2002 muneepeerakul et al 2008 it is remarkable that we observe some emerging features like the distribution of species persistence times at observation sites bertuzzo et al 2011b that are controlled more by the nature of the landscape where interactions occur than by many features specific to the underlying ecosystem a large body of empirical bertuzzo et al 2011b ricklefs 1987 and laboratory altermatt et al 2011a carrara et al 2012 giometto et al 2013 holyoak and lawler 2005 evidence was collected to support such a view this result a rather far reaching one is well captured by spatially explicit ecological approaches which we introduce below within the above ecohydrological framework river network structures and their embedded hydrologic dynamics play an important role rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 in fact they provide supporting landscapes for ecological processes many of which are essential to human life and societies to name a few on which we shall return historically human settlements followed the river networks for the necessary water resources ammermann and cavalli sforza 1984 river networks are home to and provide hierarchical habitat features for freshwater fish bertuzzo et al 2007 fagan 2002 muneepeerakul et al 2008 and in general stream ecology battin et al 2008 2003 as well as pathways to life threatening waterborne human diseases rinaldo et al 2017 and zoonoses i e infections that can be passed between animals and humans river networks may be also seen as meta ecosystems that affect the metabolism of terrestrial organic carbon in freshwater ecosystems an important part of the global carbon cycle battin et al 2003 raymond and bauer 2001 and the amount of nutrients removed from streams and reservoirs affected by network structure and stream ecology therein alexander et al 2000 battin et al 2008 thus a broad and scientifically worth field of research exists where signatures coexist of the hydrologic ecologic and geomorphologic dynamics of river basins this field has proved its importance e g by furthering our understanding of spatially explicit epidemiology and ecology sections 2 4 our ultimate goal is a comprehensive theory of how dendritic structures their associated features and interactions with external forcings chiefly hydrological stochasticity shape emergent properties of various ecosystems such a theory would help us address a wide variety of important questions from conservation plans for freshwater ecosystems to optimal control for containing water borne disease epidemics to proper inclusion of riparian systems into large scale resources management d odorico et al 2010 rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 understanding and control of biological invasions is also part of this scheme while providing what we believe is a useful review the novelty of this paper lies in its global vision of a research area where hydrology ecology and geomorphology intersect and where we feel that important advances and their applications will be made in the near future this is by no means a definitive statement of the roles of river networks as ecological corridors but rather a blueprint for future developments throughout the paper in fact we suggest research areas that look to us as particularly promising including ecological dynamics into riverine systems is not an easy task given the variety of the taxa involved their trophic positions the interactions between the different organisms ranging from competition to predation to parasitism very frequently if the aim is to investigate population dynamics the analysis is restricted to one or few species or functional groups this is what has been done e g when exploring zebra mussel invasions mari et al 2011 or cholera dynamics bertuzzo et al 2011a if instead the aim is to investigate general patterns of biodiversity one usually considers specific taxa or groups usually sharing the same trophic level e g fish or phytoplankton or riparian vegetation in this case the main operating ecological interaction is interspecific competition either indirect e g exploitation of common food resources or nutrients or direct e g via interference available data are usually lists of presence absence of species possibly complemented by their relative abundances the latter s being averaged over time or simply measured in a given year if the identity of the species is neglected it is possible to derive species abundance distributions namely the number of species that have a certain abundance or a certain abundance rank static models of species abundance relations have long been proposed to that goal see e g pielou 1977 for an excellent review dynamic models in which the observed relation is obtained as the long term equilibrium of a model containing the basic time dependent processes that shape community biodiversity are more recent the processes shaping the maintenance of biodiversity are four vellend 2010 selection namely the difference in the species fitnesses and therefore in their competitive ability it operates in both ecological and evolutionary time drift namely the inherent stochasticity which brings species to extinction and operates in ecological time scale only when the size of the community is rather small speciation which counters drift and selection over evolutionary timescales dispersal which counters local species extinction via the movement of organisms across space and acts in ecological timescales the seminal paper for the related dynamic models caswell 1976 borrowed concepts of neutral molecular evolution and applied them to the ecological context the organic development of a neutral theory of biodiversity have been presented in a unified way only much later hubbell 2001 the main tenet therein assumes that all species are competitively equivalent at a per capita level and that selection i e differences in competitive ability stated otherwise is not operating while drift is countered by speciation or dispersal chave et al 2002 concerning this last point it is important to remark that most neutral theories are spatially implicit usually they consider either an isolated community whose composition is not location specific and is driven by drift while community survival is guaranteed by speciation or a local non isolated community whose survival is guaranteed by immigration from a background metacommunity a coherent theory that considers all the four processes in a space explicit framework distinguishing between ecological and evolutionary time scales is still lacking but see chave et al 2002 economo and keitt 2008 for notable attempts the present paper aims at partially filling such a gap by presenting a series of models that are always space explicit and suited to specifically describing the peculiar structure and thus connectivity of river basins we proceed step by step first including the dendritic substrate of river basins into the neutral paradigm of biodiversity then breaking perfect neutrality by adding either space dependent carrying capacities of local communities or elevational niche apportionment species invasion and disease spread is subsequently investigated by paying greater attention to realistic details though with a species specific focus and within fluvial ecological substrates to set the context we start with an example of the simplest dynamic model of biodiversity the neutral one hubbell 2001 in fact inclusion of all factors no matter how detailed and realistic seemed hardly a good starting point for the quest of how biodiversity patterns are influenced by river network configuration rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 it should be noted that some unrealistic assumptions of the neutral theory have attracted much criticism mcgill et al 2006 nee 2005 purves and turnbull 2010 e g in terms of timescales testability and robustness also the neutral theory overlooks much species specific ecological information which is required when studying the dynamics of the system or of a set of particular species and the interactions among them chave et al 2002 however the neutral model has the advantage of letting us introduce the biodiversity shaping processes one by one in fact the neutral theory switches off all the differences between species and all the interactions with the exception of strong competition for space both intra and inter species as we shall recall below being focused on competition for space it is thus particularly suited to test the fundamental differences between the spatial structure of river basins and 2d isotropic landscapes our first approach thus focuses on the quantitative assessment of the role of directionality and network structure on ecological organization in particular on patterns of diversity distribution here we show how the implementation of the neutral theory behaves in 2d lattices or 2d space filling trees imposing directional dispersal muneepeerakul et al 2007 rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 two different frameworks namely an individual based contact model and a metacommunity model will be introduced to that end the investigation on the differences between the two substrates the common name for the ecosystem landscape where interactions occur proved important to later developments chiefly laboratory ones section 2 1 2 neutral individual based models and beyond in our neutral individual based model a 2d lattice is termed savanna to echo its ecohydrological background that is the ecological substrate is represented simply by a square lattice in which each site or pixel is occupied only by one individual say a tree by contrast as river landscapes we use a space filling tree an optimal channel network ocn see appendix built in a lattice of the same size of the savanna in a space filling network all sites are channelized fig 1 b the dynamics at each time step is defined as follows a randomly selected individual i e at a randomly picked pixel dies with probability ν termed diversification rate this site is occupied by a new species with probability 1 ν the site is colonized by an offspring of one of the neighbours with equal probability the two landscapes differ only in the definition of neighbours for the savanna in fact the offspring that colonizes the empty site is chosen among the individuals that occupy the four nearest neighbours boundary effects at the edges of the lattice are removed by implementing a genetic algorithm bertuzzo et al 2011b muneepeerakul et al 2007 for the networked landscape the neighbourhood of a pixel is constituted by the nearest pixels connected to it by the network edges thus dispersion is directional in that physical proximity may not imply connectivity the number of drainage directions in or out of the node define the viable connectivity at any site pixels physically neighboring the site where the individual dies do not count for its replacement if unconnected to the site notice that all pixels except for the outlet have only one downstream neighbour source pixels have no upstream neighbours whereas all the others have one or more upstream neighbours patterns are obtained by iterating the process until it reaches a stationary state the two upper insets of fig 1 illustrate the resulting spatial biodiversity configuration in the two landscapes pixels labeled by the same colour represent individuals belonging to the same species the lower panel shows the typical associated rank abundance curves the results are remarkably different it can be noticed in particular that the configuration of the space and the directionality of the dispersal imposed by the network landscape determine a higher species richness moreover the spatial configuration of the patches of the same species in the network landscape have sharp boundaries that resemble the boundaries of subbasins differences only arise because of the different connectivity imposed by the two landscapes adding another factor typical of the dispersal in network landscape such as biased transport e g offsprings colonizing preferably downstream would only enhance the observed differences this proved an important result although the results from this simple neutral individual based model are not to be taken as fully representative of reality they rather forcefully demonstrate that differences may arise in key biodiversity features simply because of the presence of the drainage network acting as ecological substrate thus the potentially fundamental roles played by the river network warranted more refined modelling schemes to investigate other important issues in that light another set of results from a more structured neutral model muneepeerakul et al 2008 2007 proves revealing in this model the landscape is organized in local communities lc each of which contains a certain number of sites every site contains only one individual in this way a genuine metacommunity model is defined the dynamic rule is similar to the one used for the previous unstructured model and is repeated here for clarity at each time step an individual randomly selected from all individuals in the system dies with probability ν the diversification rate this will be occupied by a new species with probability 1 ν the empty site will be colonized by an offspring of a species already existing in the metacommunity in the latter case the probability pij that the empty site in lc i will be colonized by a species from lc j is determined as follows muneepeerakul et al 2007 1 p i j 1 ν k i j h j j 1 n k i j h j where kij is the dispersal kernel the fraction of offspring produced at lc j that arrives at lc i after dispersal hj is the habitat size of lc j that is the number of sites in lc j and n is the total number of lcs all individuals in lc j have the same probability of colonizing the empty unit in lc i where the death took place note that the standard neutral theory is in a way improved by assuming that different lcs have different habitat size neutrality still holds for dispersal that is the dispersal kernel of every species is assumed to be the same as in the previous example in the context of metacommunity models the dispersal kernel kij contains the information on the landscape spatial structure and how individuals move about therefore the key difference between savanna and river network metacommunities lies in their respective dispersal kernels the dispersal kernels are typically assumed to take the form of exponential decay note that unlike in contact processes ref an offspring can travel farther than its immediate neighbors in each time step in metacommunities biodiversity patterns are measured by α β and γ diversities anderson et al 2011 whittaker 1972 α diversity is a local description of biodiversity and γ a global one both being inventory measures because they refer to the number of species β diversity is a differentiation diversity measuring the rate of change in or the turnover of the species measuring how species compositions in local communities differ from one another in the following γ diversity is defined as the total number of species in the entire metacommunity α diversity is a number of species in a randomly chosen lc it is also useful to consider its mean value averaged across all lcs denoted by α the between community diversity or β diversity is a conceptual quantity that can be defined in many ways all of which share the same general idea the higher the β diversity the more different the local communities here it is defined as γ α and one is referred to the original references for related results muneepeerakul et al 2007 the main result of the structured metacommunity model is that network structure and dispersal anisotropy affect decisively any biodiversity measures in this case the dispersal rate is defined as the fraction of propagules that is dispersed away from their birth local community and the directionality is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio between the fractions of propagules at the nearest neighbors in the preferred and opposite directions of dispersal muneepeerakul et al 2007 all three diversity measures in both types of landscapes shown in fig 1 appear to be quite sensitive to dispersal anisotropy in particular river networks result in metacommunities with higher β diversity i e more localized and heterogeneous ecosystems this is due to a containment effect in river basins cross subbasin dispersal is hindered by topographical divides resulting in subbasins being more dissimilar from one another echoing important field evidence fagan 2002 1 3 distribution of persistence times another macroecological pattern is relevant to our general tenet specifically we study the distributions of local species persistence time τ defined as the timespans between its emergence and local extinction in a given geographic region empirical distributions pertaining to different taxa have been analyzed in the above space explicit framework bertuzzo et al 2011b notably breeding birds and herbaceous plants the approach critically accounts for the finiteness of the observational period of any field data a problem that is often overlooked and that may remarkably distort the true features of persistence times their distributions exhibit power law scaling limited by a cut off determined by the rate of emergence of new species bertuzzo et al 2011b note that although generalizations are possible the study of persistence times was conducted on trophically equivalent co occurring species theoretical investigations on how the scaling features depend on the topological structure of the spatial interaction networks proved worthwhile bertuzzo et al 2011b at a local scale τ is largely controlled by ecological processes operating at short timescales e g population dynamics immigration contractions expansions of species geographic ranges as local extinctions are dynamically balanced by colonizations levins 1969 macarthur and wilson 1967 ricklefs 1987 at a global scale originations and extinctions are controlled by mechanisms acting on macroevolutionary timescales diamond 1989 jablonski 2008 from a theoretical viewpoint the simplest baseline demographic model is a random walk without drift according to which the abundance of a species in a geographic region has the same probability of increasing or decreasing by one individual at every time step according to this scheme local extinction is equivalent to a random walker s first passage to zero and thus the resulting persistence time distribution has a power law decay with exponent 3 2 chandrasekhar 1943 newman 2005 a more realistic description can be achieved by accounting for basic ecological processes like birth death migration and speciation possibly in neutral mean field schemes hubbell 2001 muneepeerakul et al 2008 volkov et al 2003 as described above here when a randomly selected individual dies and the space or resources are freed up for colonization with probability ν the site is taken by an individual of a species not currently present in the system thus ν is equivalent to a diversification rate and accounts for both speciation and immigration from surrounding communities with residual probability 1 ν the died individual is replaced by one offspring of an individual randomly sampled within the community chave et al 2002 durrett and levin 1996 global scale independent dispersal as such the probability of colonization by a species depends solely on its relative abundance in the community the asymptotic behavior t 1 of the resulting persistence time distributions i e pτ t exhibits a power law scaling limited by an exponential cut off 2 p τ t t α e ν t with exponent α 2 pigolotti et al 2005 in eq 4 time is expressed in generation time units hubbell 2001 i e it has been rescaled in such a way that the death rate is equal to one notably in the mean field scheme the probability distribution depends solely on the diversification rate which accounts for speciation and migration processes and imposes a characteristic timescale 1 ν for local extinctions while speciation rates are not expected to vary too much with the spatial scale of analysis immigration rates decrease as the spatial scale increases in fact the possible sources of migration chiefly dependent on the geometrical properties of the boundary and the nature of dispersal processes are argued to scale sub linearly with the community size bertuzzo et al 2011b which in turn is linearly proportional to geographic area brown 1995 macarthur and wilson 1967 as continental scales are approached migration processes almost vanish and the diversification rate ultimately reflects only the speciation rate we now provide evidence of different non trivial exponents observable as a function of the topology of the substrate instead of a mean field model we use a space explicit scheme in which dispersal limitation and the actual network of spatial connections are taken into account the neutral game described above has been implemented in regular one two and three dimensional lattices fig 2 in which every site represents an individual whose species is labeled via a specific color bertuzzo et al 2011b key to our reasoning we explore the patterns emerging from the application of the model to dendritic structures mimicking riverine ecosystems where dispersal processes and ecological organization are constrained by the network structure to this end we use again optimal channel networks ocns rinaldo et al 2014 1992 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 appendix as space filling within arbitrary domains mathematical constructs that yield aggregation patterns and landscape forms statistically indistinguishable from real life river networks rinaldo et al 1999 to account for limited dispersal effects only the offsprings of the nearest neighbors of the dying individual are allowed to possibly colonize the empty site in the networked landscape the neighbourhood of a site is defined by the closest upstream and downstream sites limited dispersal in fact promotes the clumping in space of species which enhances their coexistence and survival probability chave et al 2002 kerr et al 2002 fig 2 shows the results of the neutral exercise described above containing a truly remarkable message in fact in all the considered landscapes persistence time distributions follow a finite size power law behaviour characterized by smaller highly non trivial scaling exponents with respect to the mean field model these power laws too are inevitably limited by an upper exponential cutoff persistence time distributions deducted from the theoretical models change when dispersal kernels more general than dispersal from nearest neighbors are considered as expected as long as the mean dispersal distance remains small with respect to the system size the distribution exhibits a longer transient regime but eventually ends up scaling as the one predicted by the nearest neighbors dispersal bertuzzo et al 2011b relaxing the neutral assumption hubbell 2001 by implementing an individual based competition survival tradeoff model chave et al 2002 has also been tested bertuzzo et al 2011b specifically species with higher mortality rates are assumed to hold more competitive ability in colonizing empty sites brown 1995 tilman et al 1994 it is important to note that the trade off model also exhibits power law distributions of τ showing exponents indeed close to those of the neutral model by contrast the mean time to extinction is larger in the trade off model and consequently species richness is higher we thus conclude that the theoretical results concerning the shape of persistence time distributions are robust with respect to both change in the dispersal range and relaxations of the neutrality assumptions however our results should not be seen as a test for the neutrality hypothesis hubbell 2001 for empirical distributions but rather as tools to reveal emerging universal and macroscopic patterns regardless of the detailed features of the particular model incidentally a meaningful assessment of species local extinction rates is deemed valuable from a conservation perspective species persistence time distributions are in fact a robust tool to quantify the timespan of the species assembly currently observed within a given geographic area and to some extent predict the expected amount of future local extinctions mathematically in fact τ is defined as the time to local extinction of a species randomly sampled from the system regardless of its current abundance although these patterns cannot provide information about the behavior of a specific species or of a particular patch inside the ecosystem considered e g a biodiversity hotspot they can effectively describe the overall dynamical evolution of the ecosystem diversity 1 4 testing directional connectivity in the laboratory the abstract examples discussed above strongly suggest that directional dispersal has a major impact on the resulting biodiversity distributions in other words the above examples imply that the topology of the substrate for ecological interactions has a defining role for the distribution of species richness in space and time regardless of the ecosystem s specific features and environmental drivers clearly this suggestion has had a fundamental importance in the way we now look at river networks as ecological corridors for instance β diversities computed separately for headwaters and confluences test the differences in species composition within the river network structure headwaters exhibit not only a higher variability in α diversity but also a higher β diversity compared with confluences see benda et al 2004 carrara et al 2012 fagan 2002 these results reveal the crucial importance of headwaters as a source of biodiversity for the whole landscape in natural systems other local environmental factors may play a role in structuring ecosystems brown and swan 2010 nevertheless the neutral metacommunity approach sheds light on the single effect of directional dispersal on biodiversity note that the patterns found in river network geometries are predicted to be even stronger in the presence of a downstream dispersal which is typical for many passively transported riparian and aquatic species in river basins bertuzzo et al 2007 morrissey and de kerckhove 2009 we thus suggest that species constrained to disperse within dendritic corridors are characterized by increased spatial persistence and lower extinction risks on the other hand heterogeneous habitats sustain higher levels of biodiversity among local communities that can be altered by modifying the connectivity of the system with broad implications for community ecology and conservation biology for simplified landscapes often described geometrically by linear or lattice structures a variety of local environmental factors exist that create and maintain diversity among habitats de aguiar et al 2009 hubbell 2001 volkov et al 2003 many highly diverse landscapes however exhibit hierarchical spatial structures that are shaped by geomorphological processes they are neither linear nor lattice like and therefore environmental substrates for ecological interactions shaped as trees may be appropriate to describe biodiversity of species living within fluvial dendritic ecosystems benda et al 2004 carrara et al 2012 the above suggestions are far reaching in fact species or populations whose ecological dynamics is constrained by directional dispersal would be inherently more predictable as the effects of other uncontrollable heterogeneities would be less dominant however field validations cannot prove or disprove such ansatz for a number of objective reasons chiefly the practical impossibility of replicating all ecological conditions in diverse topological substrates for the ecological interactions we thus resorted to laboratory experimentation altermatt et al 2011a 2011b holyoak and lawler 2005 to explore the extent of the validity of the theoretical prediction as the theoretical work suggests that dispersal constrained by the connectivity of specific habitat structures such as river networks can explain observed features of biodiversity we designed experiments to that end notice that no direct evidence existed at the time carrara et al 2012 2014 experimentally tested whether connectivity per se is capable of shaping diversity patterns in dendritic microcosm metacommunities at different levels fig 3 illustrates the general setting of the lab experiments the main results produced along the above line of thought are summarized here local dispersal in isotropic lattice landscapes homogenizes local species richness and leads to pronounced spatial persistence fig 4 on the contrary dispersal along dendritic landscapes leads to higher variability in local diversity and among community composition thereby confirming by replicated laboratory experimentation the theoretical prediction based on abstract models carrara et al 2012 although headwaters exhibit relatively lower species richness they are crucial for the maintenance of regional biodiversity this result echoes prior theoretical evidence benda et al 2004 fagan 2002 such results establish that spatially constrained dendritic connectivity is a key factor for community composition and population persistence carrara et al 2012 moreover further laboratory work experimentally disentangled the effect of local habitat capacity i e the patch size and dendritic connectivity on biodiversity in aquatic microcosm metacommunities by suitably arranging patch sizes within river like networks carrara et al 2014 results are summarized in fig 5 specifically the individual effects of connectivity and habitat capacity on microbial diversity was singled out by using three different configurations of patch sizes riverine random and homogeneous connected following a river network topological and aggregation template fig 5 suitably derived from ocns appendix in riverine landscapes local habitat capacity correlates with position along the network and distance to the outlet fig 5 a larger downstream communities thus consistently receive more immigrants from upstream communities in the homogeneous and random landscapes fig 5 b and c respectively local habitat capacity i e the patch size does not preserve any geomorphological hierarchy embedded in the scaling of total contributing area at any point in the network scaling as observed in natural river systems leopold et al 1964 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 overall more connected communities that occupy a central position in the network exhibited higher species richness irrespective of patch size arrangement high regional evenness in community composition was found only in landscapes preserving geomorphological scaling properties of patch sizes i e a patch volume proportional to the number of contributing nodes see carrara et al 2014 in these landscapes some of the rarer species sustained regionally more abundant populations compared to landscapes with homogeneous patch size or landscapes with spatially uncorrelated patch size carrara et al 2014 the bulk of the experimental replicas figs 4 and 5 suggests that altering the natural link between dendritic connectivity and patch size strongly affects community composition and population persistence at multiple scales precisely as predicted by the neutral model and by every neutral and non neutral metacommunity framework applied to the same topologically diverse matrices we note that the same applies to broader classes of networked environments benda et al 2004 including those artificially created by human or host mobility networks erlander and stewart 1990 that are so relevant to the spread of disease epidemics on which we shall return later 2 species dynamics and fluvial landscapes in what follows we shall not pursue a review of the subject broad as it is but rather a specific choice of topics relevant to the general concepts outlined in section 1 which will therefore find support and concrete applications 2 1 fish diversity in the mississippi missouri river system the first example deals with the prediction of fish diversity patterns in the large mississippi missouri mmrs river system in the specific case of riverine fish biodiversity patterns of local and basin scale differences must relate to energy availability habitat heterogeneity scale dependent environmental conditions and river discharge fagan 2002 therefore the neutral metacommunity models of the type introduced in section 1 was made more realistic by better describing the structure of the local community muneepeerakul et al 2008 in fact each local community is endowed with a carrying capacity that depends on its location specifically total contributing catchment area as a proxy for fluvial habitat size rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 and the relevant habitat and each site within the lc does not host a single individual rather a small subpopulation of a certain species the physical context is described in fig 6 model simulations proceed largely through a spatially explicit approach akin to that described in section 1 with slight modifications discussed below every direct tributary area dta fig 6 is assumed to be always saturated at its capacity i e no available resources are left unexploited each dta hosts a certain number of fish units that depends on the location at each time step a fish unit randomly selected from all fish units sensu muneepeerakul et al 2008 present in the system dies and the resources that previously sustained the unit are freed and available for sustaining a new fish unit with probability ν the analog of the diversification rate in section 1 the new unit will be occupied by a new species thus here the diversification is to be interpreted as a rate per death due to speciation to external introduction of non native species or to immigration and reimmigration of a new species from outside the mmrs with probability 1 ν the new unit will belong to a species already existing in the system in the latter case with probability pij eq 1 an empty unit in dta i will be colonized by a species from dta j muneepeerakul et al 2008 in this context with reference to eq 1 hk is the habitat capacity of the dta k defined below and n is the total number of dtas here n 5824 while the total number of fish units is 436 731 all the fish units in dta j have the same probability of colonizing the empty unit in dta i where the death took place death must be interpreted as the extinction of the species subpopulation hosted by the fish unit the model results that we outline in the following are the average patterns after the system reaches a statistically steady state specific dispersal kernels are assumed to determine how the fish species move within the river network muneepeerakul et al 2008 kij in this context is the probability that a randomly selected fish species present in dta j arrives at dta i after dispersal here normalization constants are determined numerically so that no fish can travel out of the network a necessary note pertains to the neutral assumption in this context indeed strong because fish species obviously differ in their dispersal abilities however the functional equivalence between species is a key way in which the neutral theory of biodiversity departs from classical ecological models we assume the species equivalence to study just how good a fit the neutral metacommunity model can produce to our data in the absence of detailed species specific information as such the model is engineered to single out the individual role of the dendritic structure of the topological substrate for ecological interactions an important innovation of the metacommunity model with respect to the zero order model outlined in section 1 concerns the imposition of hierarchical local habitat capacity at any site j hj in fact habitat capacity of dta i hi is determined by a properly normalized relation hi aarpi wai where wai denotes total contributing watershed area at site i and aarpi is the average annual runoff production fig 6c total contributing area at any point of a river network can be directly computed from suitably treated digital elevation maps rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 the map of local species richness shown in fig 6b suggests that the dta endowed with the maximum α diversity 156 species is observed somewhat mid way through the mmrs the sharp decrease empirically observed in species richness occurring around the 100 w meridian is known to correspond to sharp gradients of annual precipitation and runoff production muneepeerakul et al 2008 fig 6c although these gradients may partly explain the semi arid climate and low fish diversity in the western half of the mmrs muneepeerakul et al 2008 argued that the western dtas are low in fish diversity both because their climate is dry and because they are upstream portions of the river network the results are displayed in fig 7 fig 7a illustrates the frequency distribution of local species richness lsr best fit to empirical data muneepeerakul et al 2008 whose two peaks at low and high values reflect the difference between the western and eastern halves of the mmrs fig 7 b c shows computed and measured lsr as a function of the topological distance from the network outlet it is totally remarkable the fact that the lsr profile shows a significant increase in the downstream direction except at the very end where the freshwater fish habitat capacities are significantly reduced by salinity co occurrence intrusion by some freshwater tolerant estuarine or coastal fish species human disturbance and pollution the overall downstream increase in richness results from the converging character of the river network and is steepened by the dry wet climatic gradient muneepeerakul et al 2008 the statistically significant major impact of modulated habitat capacity is clearly suggested by the comparison of the results from the modified neutral metacommunity model and those from zero order model where habitat capacity is assumed constant fig 7c neutral metacommunity patterns result equally good for rank abundance curves and suitable measures of β diversity not shown here see muneepeerakul et al 2008 fig 4 where particularly significant is the resulting long distance similarity in species composition maintained by species endowed with extremely large occupancies the neutral metacommunity model reproduces surprisingly well the general spatial biodiversity patterns of the mmrs freshwater fish once hydrologic controls like the effects of average annual runoff production on fish habitat capacities are enforced a wide spectrum of observed biodiversity patterns are reproduced as suggested by figs 6 and 7 as a specific example in addition to the general trend and magnitude the model also captures fine structured fluctuations of the lsr profile fig 6 simultaneous fits of diverse patterns and others such as the species area relationship make for a very demanding test for any model especially one using few parameters as in this case muneepeerakul et al 2008 the model therefore provides ecological insight despite its simplicity one of the ecological meaningful insights obtained from the theoretical exercise is that the parameters corresponding to the best fit imply that the spread of the average fish species is quite symmetrical i e it is not significantly biased either in the upstream or the downstream direction the model results also suggest that on average most fish disperse locally that is to nearby dtas but a non negligible fraction travel very long distances given the broad range of environmental conditions covered the demonstration that a simple neutral metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity distribution and dispersal kernel can simultaneously reproduce several major observed biodiversity patterns has far reaching implications these results suggest that only parameters characterizing average fish behaviour as opposed to those characterizing biological properties of all different fish species in the system and habitat capacities and connected structure suffice for reasonably accurate predictions of large scale biodiversity patterns namely those patterns that do not include the identity of species as we said in the previous section neutral models cannot explain all those patterns that are species specific however the neutral metacommunity model may represent a null model against which more biologically realistic models ought to be compared sensu akaike akaike 1974 corani and gatto 2007 moreover furthering our understanding of fluvial ecological corridors related to general metapopulation persistence criteria for spatially explicit models casagrandi and gatto 2002 mari et al 2014b will allow us to improve the alignment of ecological models and data 2 2 elevational gradients of biodiversity the second example which we deem paradigmatic as well deals with geomorphic controls on elevational gradients of species richness bertuzzo et al 2005 in this case the lead role is taken by the structure of ecological interactions allowed by the available ecological substrate the mountain landscape which controls the gradients of biodiversity drivers key is the fluvial landscape again this time suitably constructed in three dimensions the fluvial landscapes we adopt are real topographies taken from digital elevation models rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 and replicated synthetic ocns within a given domain through the transformation of a planar aggregation structure into a topographic landscape which is made possible by the use of a slope area relationship relating total contributing area at a point to the local topographic gradient rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 ocns rinaldo et al 2014 1992 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 appendix prove once more extremely versatile the rationale for our choice of examples is simple how biodiversity changes with elevation has long attracted the interest of researchers because it provides key clues to how biota respond to geophysical drivers experimental evidence reveals that biodiversity in ecosystems significantly affected by the elevational gradients often peaks at intermediate elevations colwell et al 2004 gaston 2000 körner 2000 2007 lomolino 2001 mccain and grytnes 2010 nogues bravo et al 2008 rahbek 2005 a factor that had been overlooked for a long time was the fact that mountainous landscapes hold fractal properties mandelbrot 1983 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 with elevational bands forming habitat patches that are characterized by different areal extent and connectivity well known drivers of biodiversity specifically the frequency distribution of elevation in real life landscapes is distinctly hump shaped with the majority of land situated at midelevations mandelbrot 1983 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 fig 8 elevational patterns showing a peak in elevational distributions at mid elevation are ubiquitous in landscapes shaped by fluvial erosion when a sufficiently large region rather than a single slope or mountain is considered it should be noted that this pattern is altered only if large areas outside runoff producing zones e g large plains are included in the domain rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 mountains are no cones nor clouds are spheres or coastlines simple broken lines in the celebrated words of mandelbrot 1983 and therefore simple 1d slopes are highly misleading as representation of nature s topographies mountain landscapes are rather complex self affine fractal structures rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 within an ecological context this fact has seriously misled researchers interested in elevational trends and in natural experiments conducted along gradients of elevation because the mountain cone analogy suggests a monotonically decreasing distribution of elevation the area of available habitat within a given elevational band may have a direct effect on the diversity of the regional community it hosts γ diversity kraft et al 2011 rahbek 1995 2005 sanders 2002 as predicted by the species area relationship rosenzweig 1995 the area of available habitat may also have an indirect effect on the local species richness because local communities can be assembled from a more diverse regional pool of species that are fit to live at similar elevation romdal and grytnes 2007 because there exist two classes of environmental drivers those altitude specific such as atmospheric pressure and temperature and those that are not such as moisture clear sky turbidity and cloudiness sunshine exposure and aspect wind strength season length geology and human land use körner 2000 2007 empirical results may hardly sort out unambiguously general rules if at all existing the importance of theoretical predictions of expected patterns of species richness with elevation could therefore hardly be overestimated bertuzzo et al 2005 moved from this premise by exploiting universal self affine features of elevation fields of fluvial landscapes possibly obtained by planar aggregation structures where sensible local slope area laws reminiscent of the fluvial landscape are enforced rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 incidentally they may apply equally well by using real topographies where the slope area laws breaks down at the drainage density threshold the nature of fluvial landscapes and their physical evolution in fact provide universal invariance of patterns of connected areas at same elevation rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 this second example of biodiversity affected by the fluvial landscape structure thus describes how altitude driven area connectivity fosters elevational gradients of species richness and in particular the origins of empirically observed mid altitude peaks the analysis as we said in the introduction moves one further step away from neutrality by adding niche tradeoffs for a somewhat similar attempt see tilman 2004 in fact the model employs an altitude dependent adaptive fitness of otherwise equal vital rates of species also as briefly discussed in what follows connectivity is based on the altitude area relations expected in general by fluvial patterns in order to investigate the role of the mountainous landscapes in shaping altitude gradient of species richness a zero sum metacommunity model is anyway adopted hubbell 2001 rosindell et al 2011 namely the system is always saturated in this framework the system comprises n local communities which are characterized by their position in space and by their mean altitude only communities organized in an equally spaced two dimensional lattice will be considered however the model could be readily adapted to account for other connectivity structures like those investigated in the previous section each local community assembles n individuals because of the zero sum assumption at any time the system is populated by n n individuals belonging to s different species each species is characterized by a specific altitude niche which expresses in this context how the competitive ability of a species varies with altitude i e ci z measures the competitive ability of the individuals of species i at altitude z this relationship is modelled as a gaussian function 3 c i z c m a x i e z z o p t i 2 2 σ i 2 where z o p t i is the optimal altitude of species i that is where ci z equals its maximum c m a x i the parameter σi controls the dispersion of the gaussian function namely the niche width in this example the analysis is limited for simplicity to a neutral case where all the species have the same parameters σ i σ and c m a x i c max fig 9 illustrates how the niches of different species are modelled edge effects are also prevented bertuzzo et al 2005 while species differ for their altitudinal niches all other ecological traits namely birth death and dispersal rates are identical like in the classical ecological neutral dynamics hubbell 2001 ecological interactions among individuals are simulated as follows at each time step a randomly selected individual dies and the resources are freed up and available for colonization the empty site is occupied by an offspring of one of the individuals occupying either the local community of the dead individual or one of the four nearest neighbour communities a key variant of the standard spatially explicit neutral model follows the offspring in fact is selected randomly with a probability proportional to ci z of all the candidate colonizing individuals evaluated at the elevation z of the local community of the dead individual at each time step with probability ν an additional individual belonging to a species not currently present in the system engages in the competition for colonizing the free spot bertuzzo et al 2005 the optimal altitude z o p t i of this individual is drawn from a uniform distribution spanning twice the altitude range of the system as described before see also fig 9 needless to say introduction of new species is aimed at modelling both speciation and immigration from external communities the model has been run also in three other landscape configurations bertuzzo et al 2005 the alternative landscapes studied insure that the planar slope fig 8a and any linear slopes of variable gradients are such that their hypsographic curves match that of the mountainous landscapes by analyzing comparatively them shape effects can be highlighted the structure in fig 9 has been obtained by using a real life elevation map where each pixel subsumes the mean altitude of a 500 500 m region the local community size n is set to 100 the system is initially populated by one single species and is simulated until a statistically steady state is reached 105 generations where a generation is n n time steps periodic boundaries conditions are prescribed for both landscapes notice that model results do not depend on the actual altitude range z min z max but only on the ratio σ z max z min bertuzzo et al 2005 other pertinent details are reported therein typical results of the metacommunity model are shown in fig 10 all landscapes produce to a different extent hump shaped α diversity curves yet only the one corresponding to a real landscape produces realistic variability akin to that produced by field evidence the values computed therein depend on specific choices of the niche width σ and on other parameters it can be shown however that the trends outlined therein are valid irrespective of parameter values fig 11 fluvial landforms show deep similarities across many orders of magnitude despite great diversity of their drivers and controls e g relief exposed lithology geology vegetation or climate rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 regardless of the self affine nature of the elevation field as a whole a marked heterogeneity of elevational distributions and thus of ecological connectivity characterizes the parts and the whole of real landscapes fig 11 nevertheless the universality of the main attributes of the fluvial landscape naturally lends itself to the quest for general patterns of the ecological dynamics that such landscapes host bertuzzo et al 2011b brown and swan 2010 rodriguez iturbe et al 2009 thus it is appealing that the α diversity maps shown in fig 11 reveal such clear spatial patterns with valleys and mountain tops characterized by lower species richness all geomorphic factors resulting in self affine landscapes where peaks or troughs my occur at any elevation within the range simultaneously concur to the formation of such a pattern regardless of other elevation independent factors a factor is also the finiteness of the landscape elevational range sites at mid elevation can potentially be colonized by species that live at and are fit for higher and lower elevations whereas sites at the lowest highest extreme are only subject to the colonizing pressure from higher lower elevations in addition to this boundary effect the geomorphic structure of fluvial landscapes results in a mid elevation peak in both area and connectivity across the landscape both of which promote diversity specifically designed simulations have disentangled the role of each of these factors bertuzzo et al 2005 results also show that without any of these effects the model predicts no gradients of diversity each geomorphic factor produces independently or in combination with others a hump shaped pattern of species richness moreover the differential elevational connectivity characteristic of fluvial landscapes results in a marked variability of diversity for the same elevation the results reveal that similar mid peak elevational gradients of diversity can be observed at different scales of observation even if the domains span different elevational ranges this pattern is thus a direct consequence of the nature of the substrate for ecological interactions as in all the examples pursued here in particular of the self affine fractal structure of fluvial landscapes that reproduces statistically similar fluvial landforms across scales rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 we thus show that deep similarities occur across many orders of magnitude despite great diversity of their drivers and controls e g relief exposed lithology geology vegetation or climate results also show that when the scale of observation is enlarged different hump shaped patterns are blended together possibly producing a confounding effect bertuzzo et al 2005 especially if the analysis is limited to the average diversity as a function of elevation this feature might help in understanding why elevational diversity is often found to be dependent on the scale of observation nogues bravo et al 2008 rahbek 1995 2005 the above results as in most of the examples put forward in this paper act as a proof of concept in fact we have presented results based on nearest neighbour dispersal to highlight the role of elevational connectivity indeed the effect of elevational isolation is expected to be reduced as dispersal limitation decreases because species can overcome elevational constraints with long distance dispersal e g dispersing from one mountain top to another without going through unfavorable lower elevation habitats moreover we have assumed that the landscape can be uniformly colonized whereas real life habitats are often composed by patches with different spatial connectivity and size hanski 1998 spatial and elevational connectivities can interact in complex ways to shape diversity patterns while the modeling framework proposed can be easily generalized to accommodate both fragmented habitats and generic dispersal kernels the coherent framework presented here has the potential to effectively describe how spatial and elevational connectivities shape diversity in complex 3d landscapes the above exploration of metacommunity patterns concludes our examples on how the ecological substrates affect in a decisive manner the ensuing biological diversity it suggests that the specific spatial arrangement of sites at different elevation in fluvial landscapes suffices in inducing mid peak elevational gradients of species richness without invoking specific assumptions except that each species is fit for a specific elevation in this framework an elevation dependent fitness applied to a real life landscape translates into a fragmented habitat map this conceptualization lends itself to the application of classic concepts of metacommunity dynamics hanski 1998 according to which habitat size and connectivity are key drivers of biodiversity we thus expect different metacommunity models to produce similar results needless to say we do not dismiss as negligible other potential drivers of diversity including those that often covary with elevation e g habitat capacity productivity human disturbance however we argue that these drivers may act on top of the unavoidable effects provided by the geomorphic controls a general consensus has thus been achieved on the fact that the analysis of elevational diversity should not seek one single overriding force but rather understand how different factors covariate to synergistically shape the observed patterns körner 2007 our results strongly suggest however that fluvial geomorphology has an important role yet thus far overlooked in driving emergent diversity elevational gradients of local species richness inasmuch as the topology of the planar substrates dominates the structuring of general biodiversity patterns 3 population dynamics and riverine biological invasions biological dispersal is a key driver of many fundamental processes in nature clobert et al 2001 elton 1958 méndez et al 2010 okubo and levin 2002 shigesada and kawasaki 1997 invasions controls the distribution of species within an ecosystem and critically affect their coexistence in fact the spread of organisms along ecological substrates or corridors governs not only the dynamics of invasive species but also the spread of pathogens and the shifts in species ranges due to climate or environmental change obviously the subject per se is a major chapter of ecology and we shall not deal with it here in a comprehensive manner our narrow perspective here deals rather with river networks as ecological corridors apt to population invasions in fact the role of the structure of river networks in modeling human range expansions i e predicting how populations migrate when settling into new territories has been recognized through quantitative models of diffusion along fractal networks coupled with logistic reaction at their nodes campos et al 2006 an essential ingredient therein is the fact that settlers did not occupy all the territory isotropically in the language of homogeneous continuous models but rather followed rivers and lakes and settled near them to exploit water resources it was thus interestingly argued in a quantitative manner that landscape heterogeneities must have played an essential role in the process of migration ammermann and cavalli sforza 1984 campos et al 2006 campos and mendez 2005 méndez et al 2004 one interesting by product of the analysis of migration fronts is the important role attributed to the structure of the network acting as the substrate for travelling wave propagations this calls for specific structural models to be invoked possibly including fractals that mimic natural forms rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 in the specific case basic invariance properties may refer to the relative independence of the outcome of biological invasions from the seeding point chosen for spreading material and species along the network where reaction and diffusion occur this is seen as a corollary of the type of scaling invariance shown by trees or networks where loops are observed banavar et al 2000 2001 maritan et al 1996 rinaldo et al 2014 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 the topological substrates that we shall consider here namely ocns rinaldo et al 2014 1992 rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 are tailored to the topology and geometry of real rivers rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 they allow us to produce replicas of network shapes and thus to seek for a proper statistic of the resulting biological dispersion processes to derive exact results one often resorts campos et al 2006 mandelbrot 1983 marani et al 1991 to the peano network fig 12 which is a deterministic fractal mandelbrot 1983 whose main topological and metric features have been sorted out exactly marani et al 1991 a good starting point is the analysis of campos et al 2006 concerning a reaction random walk rrw process through a peano construct and several replicas of ocns it is based on the following model a particle at an arbitrary node of the network jumps after a waiting time τ to one of its z nearest neighboring nodes with probability 1 z during the waiting time τ the particles react i e evolve the scalar property mass density labeling the particle by following the logistic equation the determination of the wavefront speed that this process develops along a network path campos and mendez 2005 méndez et al 2004 is the starting point for the ensuing considerations fig 12 illustrates the main result of the above premises it shows that the isotropic diffusion reaction front fisher s model fisher 1937 propagates much faster than the wave forced to choose a treelike pathway this proves that geometrical constraints imposed by a fractal network imply strong corrections on the speed of the fronts it should be noted that it is not surprising that peano networks and ocns lead to similar results because the speed of the front depends on topological features that are indeed quite similar for all tree like networks rather different otherwise rinaldo et al 2006 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 in fact it can be shown campos et al 2006 méndez et al 2004 that the wave speed is affected mostly by the gross structure encountered by the front while propagating along the network chiefly the bifurcations hence topology rather than the fine structure of the subpaths dominates the process it should be noted that the model proposed by campos et al 2006 assumes simple diffusive transport to describe migration fluxes this seems indeed reasonable in the case of human population migrations the need for water resources should drive settlers regardless of the direction of the flow variations on the theme i e whether adding a bias to transport properties would basically alter this interesting picture was investigated later bertuzzo et al 2007 this was done on purpose in fact any other ecological agent be it an aquatic organism or an infective agent of water borne disease would likely be affected by the flow direction to propagate within the network organisms can either move by their own energy active dispersal or be moved by water passive dispersal most likely movements along the flow direction would be favored although movements against flow direction are completely admissible because of various ecological or physical mechanisms muneepeerakul et al 2008 2007 all this is of great interest for the problem of persistence of species along the ecological corridors that are shaped by the river network bertuzzo et al 2007 mari et al 2014b a brief introduction of the theoretical context is perhaps useful in a deterministic framework the fisher kolmogorov equation fisher 1937 kolmogorov et al 1937 reads 4 ρ t d 2 ρ x 2 r ρ 1 ρ k where ρ ρ x t is the density of organisms r the species growth rate d the diffusion coefficient and k the carrying capacity eq 4 is known to foster the development of undeformed traveling waves of the density profile murray 2004 mathematically this implies that ρ x t ρ x v t where v is the speed of the advancing wave fisher 1937 proved that traveling wave solutions can only exist with speed v 2 r d and kolmogorov et al 1937 demonstrated that with suitable initial conditions the speed of the wavefront is the lower bound fig 12 the microscopic movement underlying the fisher kolmogorov eq 4 is brownian motion méndez et al 2010 despite its relevance for important ecological processes however it was argued giometto et al 2014 that the subject suffers an acknowledged lack of experimentation and current assessments point at inherent limitations to predictability even in the simplest ecological settings giometto et al 2014 have instead shown by combining replicated experimentation on the spread of the ciliate tetrahymena sp with a theoretical approach based on stochastic differential equations that information on local unconstrained movement and reproduction of organisms including demographic stochasticity allows to predict reliably both the propagation speed and range of variability of invasion fronts over multiple generations we shall briefly report their main findings as they are functional to the main tenet of this paper first one wonders what are the sources of uncertainty and variance in the spread rates of biological invasions the search for processes that affect biological dispersal and sources of variability observed in ecological range expansions in fact reveals fundamental insight into the study of invasive species dynamics shifts in species ranges due to climate or environmental change and in general the spatial distribution of species andow et al 1990 clobert et al 2001 elton 1958 grosholz 1996 hastings et al 2005 okubo and levin 2002 shigesada and kawasaki 1997 skellam 1951 dispersal is the key agent that brings favorable genotypes or highly competitive species into new ranges much faster than any other ecological or evolutionary process fisher 1937 when organisms spread occurs on the timescale of multiple generations it is the byproduct of active or passive movement and of the reproduction of individuals andow et al 1990 hastings et al 2005 the main difficulty in causally understanding dispersal is thus to upscale processes that happen at the short term individual level to long term and broad scale population patterns andow et al 1990 levin 1992 whether the variability observed in nature or in experimental ensembles might be accounted for by systematic differences between landscapes or by demographic stochasticity affecting basic vital rates of the organisms involved is key giometto et al 2014 hastings et al 2005 modeling of biological dispersal refers to the theoretical framework of reaction diffusion processes fisher 1937 kolmogorov et al 1937 méndez et al 2010 murray 2004 skellam 1951 volpert and petrovskii 2009 which now finds common application in dispersal ecology andow et al 1990 hastings et al 2005 lubina and levin 1988 control of the dynamics of invasive species elton 1958 grosholz 1996 skellam 1951 and in related fields campos et al 2006 murray 2004 as noted in the introduction reaction diffusion models have also been applied to model human colonization processes such as the neolithic transition in europe ammermann and cavalli sforza 1984 or the race to the west in the 19th century continental us campos et al 2006 the extensive use of these models and the good fit to observational data favored their common endorsement as a paradigm for biological dispersal grosholz 1996 however certain assessments melbourne and hastings 2009 suggested inherent limitations to the predictability of the phenomenon due to its intrinsic stochasticity therefore single realizations of a dispersal event might deviate significantly from the mean of the process making replicated experimentation necessary to allow hypothesis testing identification of causal relationships and to potentially falsify the models assumptions giometto et al 2014 provided instead replicated and controlled experimental support to the theory of reaction diffusion processes for modeling biological dispersal in a generalized context that reproduces the observed fluctuations details on the experiment and on the theoretical analyses are reported therein giometto et al 2014 experimentally substantiated the fisher kolmogorov mean speed of traveling wavefronts by measuring the individual components of the process stochasticity was included in the model to reproduce the observed variability in range expansions investigation of the movement behavior of tetrahymena sp shows that individuals trajectories are consistent with a persistent random walk with an autocorrelation time τ 3 9 0 4 s as the autocorrelation time for the study species is much smaller than the growth rate r τ r 10 4 an excellent approximation was provided giometto et al 2014 the stochastic model equation reads 5 ρ t d 2 ρ x 2 r ρ 1 ρ k σ ρ η where η η x t is a gaussian zero mean white noise i e with correlations η x t η x t δ x x δ t t where δ is the dirac s delta distribution and σ 0 is constant the square root multiplicative noise term in eq 5 is interpreted as describing stochasticity of demographic parameters and needs extra care in simulations giometto et al 2014 data from the growth experiment in isolation were fitted to the equation 6 d ρ d t r ρ 1 ρ k σ l ρ η where ρ ρ t is the local density η η t is a gaussian zero mean white noise i e with correlations η t η t δ t t σ 0 is constant and l is the size of the region over which densities were measured giometto et al 2014 details are reported therein in the experiments the freshwater ciliate tetrahymena sp was employed because of its short generation time and its history as a model system in ecology carrara et al 2012 holyoak and lawler 2005 the experimental setup consisted of linear landscapes fig 13 filled with a nutrient medium kept in constant environmental conditions and of suitable size to meet the assumptions about the relevant dispersal timescales see materials and methods in giometto et al 2014 replicated dispersal events were conducted by introducing an ensemble of individuals at one end of the landscape and measuring density profiles throughout the system at different times density profiles are shown in fig 14 for six replicated dispersal events panels a f organisms introduced at one end of the landscape rapidly formed an advancing front that propagated at a remarkably constant speed fig 14 the front position at each time was calculated as the first occurrence starting from the end of the landscape of a fixed value of the density fig 14 as for traveling waves predicted by the fisher kolmogorov equation the mean front speed in the experiment is notably constant for different choices of the reference density value fig 14 note that the species traits r k and d were measured in independent experiments in the local growth experiment a low density population of tetrahymena sp was introduced evenly across the landscape and its density was measured locally at different times recorded density measurements were fitted to the logistic growth model which gave the estimates for r and k giometto et al 2014 in the local unimpeded movement experiment the mean square displacement si of individuals trajectories was computed to estimate the diffusion coefficient d in density independent conditions giometto et al 2014 the growth and movement measurements were performed in the same linear landscape settings as in the dispersal experiment and therefore are assumed to accurately describe the dynamics at the front of the traveling wave in the dispersal events the comparison of the predicted front speed v 2 r d to the wavefront speed measured in the dispersal experiment vo yields a compelling agreement the observed speed in the dispersal experiment was v o 52 0 1 8 cm day mean se giometto et al 2014 which we compare to the predicted one v 51 9 1 1 cm day mean se the two velocities are compatible within one standard error a t test between the replicated observed speeds and bootstrap estimates of v 2 r d gives a p value of p 0 96 t 0 05 d f 9 thus the null hypothesis that the mean difference is 0 was not rejected at the 5 level and there is no indication that the two means are different as the measurements of r and d were performed independently at scales that were orders of magnitude smaller than in the dispersal events the agreement between the two estimates of the front velocity was deemed remarkable the conclusions of the study are remarkable in that the fisher kolmogorov equation correctly predicts the mean speed of the experimentally observed invading wavefront although its deterministic formulation prevents it to reproduce the variability that is inherent to biological dispersal in particular it cannot reproduce the fluctuations in range expansion between different replicates of dispersal experiments the proposed generalization of the fisher kolmogorov equation accounting for stochasticity showed that it is able to capture the observed variability in a linear landscape as local independent estimates were used in solving the generalized model equation the result that the measured front positions agree with simulations show that one source of uncertainty in biological invasions can be quantified estimates for the front speed and its variability in the experiment prove in good agreement with simulations implying that stochasticity in population parameters can explain variability in range expansions not related to the topology of the substrate giometto et al 2014 generalizations to organisms endowed with different biology e g growth rates and diffusion coefficients possibly available in the literature are in sight supporting the view that our tenet may possibly provide a general predictive framework for biological invasions in natural environments a hydrologically notable example of biological invasion within the same mississippi missouri river system mmrs investigated in section 1 follows mari et al 2011 it deals with the zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha a freshwater bivalve native to eurasia owing to its adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions combined with dispersal abilities within fluvial systems that are unrivalled by other freshwater invertebrates this invasive species managed to diffuse all over europe and north america after establishment zebra mussel colonies can rapidly reach population densities in the order of tens or even hundreds of thousands of individuals per square meter and inflict huge ecological and economic damages in fact zebra mussel colonies may deeply alter invaded ecosystems by filtering large volumes of water thus removing phytoplankton and boosting nutrients and by severely impairing the functioning of water works mari et al 2011 the zebra mussel has thus become a prototypical example of invasive species rightly included in the 100 world s worst invasive alien species list drawn up by the international union for conservation of nature one of the noteworthy features of zebra mussel invasions is the speed at which the species can spread over river networks the example of the invasion of the mississippi missouri river system mmrs is particularly revealing see fig 15 data available online at http fl biology usgs gov nonindigenous species zm progression zm progression html the invasion in fact started from the great lakes region michigan where some specimens were first sighted in the late 1980s after being probably introduced via ballast water sheddings by boats sailing from europe by 1990 d polymorpha made its way into the illinois river and by 1991 the zebra mussel started diffusing into the mississippi reaching louisiana as soon as 1993 in the meanwhile the species showed up also in some of its most important tributaries ohio tennessee and arkansas rivers as well as in other north american river systems st lawrence hudson and susquehanna the rate of spread of d polymorpha has decreased remarkably after 1994 primarily because the species did not expand west of the 100th meridian however the zebra mussel has been steadily infilling and colonizing new reaches during the last decade quite surprisingly a few connected river systems most notably the missouri river have not been invaded until recently stokstad 2007 nowadays the zebra mussel steadily occupies much of central and eastern north america d polymorpha invasion patterns result from the interplay between local demographic processes occurring over long time scales and basin scale transport phenomena taking place over much shorter time spans mari et al 2011 this is mainly due to the peculiarity of the species life cycle which can be roughly subdivided into two main periods a short larval phase lasting from a few days to a few weeks stoeckel et al 1997 and a relatively long adult stage up to three years in north america casagrandi et al 2007 adults live anchored to a solid substratum while larvae also known as veligers can be transported by the water flow sometimes traveling for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers before settling stoeckel et al 1997 therefore rivers represent the primary and natural pathway allowing species spread however anthropic activities can often result in extra range dispersal i e in the movement of propagules from the current species range to a new area of habitat thus in turn remarkably favoring both the speed and the extent of the biological invasion mari et al 2011 in the zebra mussel case this has been known for a long time as any human activity that involves the movement of a mass of water can be a potential vector for the spread of d polymorpha carlton 1993 commercial navigation represents a major driver of mobility for the zebra mussel allen and ramcharan 2001 mari et al 2011 for instance large quantities of veligers are often shipped within the ballast water of commercial vessels as ports are located even hundreds of kilometers apart from each other connections among them allow the species to disperse over very long distances and to colonize stretches of the river network that could not have been reached otherwise furthermore empirical evidence suggests that recreational boating may be an important determinant of medium range mussel redistribution chase and bailey 1999 stoeckel et al 2004a 2004b a common mechanism associated with transient recreational boating is the transport of juveniles and adult mussels via macrophytes entangled on boat trailers carlton 1993 this mechanism has been proposed as the most likely cause of d polymorpha interbasin range expansion due to touristic boating therefore commercial navigation represents an efficient vector of long distance dispersal while touristic boating can provide a capillary mechanism for medium range mussel relocation due to the importance of the zebra mussel as an ecosystem invader significant modeling effort has already been devoted to understanding its demographic dynamics at a local scale casagrandi et al 2007 as well as to the description of the species spread along rivers mari et al 2009 stoeckel et al 1997 and the analysis of long distance dispersal wilson et al 2009 to single out the role of drivers and controls of the mmrs invasion spatially explicit time hybrid multilayer network models were set up to address the intertwining of hydrologic controls acting through the ecological corridors defined by the river network with long and medium range dispersal controlled by anthropogenic factors which define secondary movement networks integrating multiple dispersal pathways is crucial to understand zebra mussel invasion patterns and in particular the role played by human activities in promoting the spread in particular in this outstanding case commercial navigation has been the most important determinant of the early invasion of the mississippi missouri and recreational boating can explain the long term capillary penetration of the species into the water system the spatially explicit ecohydrological model is described in detail elsewhere mari et al 2011 suffice here to mention the basic unity of the approaches with the ones described in greater detail in section 2 of great relevance here is the multiplex network of ecological interactions adopted later re discussed in the context of pathogen host mobility in section 4 in fact while veligers diffuse and settle along one dimensional substrates provided by the fluvial ecological corridors hence determining a traditional travelling wave invasion front dynamics sensu fisher 1937 kolmogorov et al 1937 a much faster and heterogeneous spread can be envisioned and proved figs 16 and 17 the infection in fact can be simply propagated by veligers trapped in the ballast water of commercial or recreational boats possibly moved by land surviving the trip and re starting from scratch their colonization process the scale of the modeling attempt and the ecohydrological interactions addressed by mari et al 2011 is noteworthy as noted in section 1 landscape heterogeneities directional dispersal and hydrologic controls shape ecological and epidemiological patterns a novel factor on which we shall elaborate further in the context of the spread of waterborne disease concern human mediated dispersal processes that prove of great importance as they allow species to disperse beyond their normal ranges thus eventually shaping global biogeographical patterns see e g wilson et al 2009 the model thus accounts for the interplay among a few selected mechanisms such as density dependent larval mortality basin scale hydrologic transport and human mediated dispersal due to either port to port commercial navigation or recreational boating that are deemed of key importance in d polymorpha invasions the model which succeeds in reproducing the zebra mussel invasion patterns observed in the mmrs at a regional spatial scale and over a 20 year time span offers a hindcasting exercise for the mmrs yet the proposed multilayer network approach could be applied to predict and control other potential invasions of the same or related alien species in the mmrs or other river systems provided that a comprehensive analysis of extant ecological and hydrologic processes as well as of relevant human mediated transport mechanisms is available this seems of particular ecological relevance in the context of biological invasions in fact taking early actions is difficult yet extremely valuable in the zebra mussel case in particular the containment and or eradication of established colonies are very difficult and costly prevention should thus be favored over control but this is possible only if quantitative tools to predict the development of the spread are available to that end we point out the importance of a fully dynamical and spatially explicit approach to modeling biological invasions for it allows combined predictions of both temporal and spatial patterns of species spread in addition we deem our multilayer approach an effective and general framework to model the spread of species that are characterized by multiple dispersal pathways biological invasions are inherently complex stochastic processes for which only a single realization is available for observation as such there exist obvious limits to our ability to actually predict them from models that necessarily need estimation of parameters from actual data see melbourne and hastings 2009 but also giometto et al 2014 mentioned above however forecasting the main or mean in some ensemble averaging sense patterns of spread of alien species is becoming increasingly important though more and more difficult with anthropic activities rapidly coming abreast of or even overwhelming natural invasion pathways for all these reasons including important details about the role of ecological corridors and of related anthropogenic drivers is very valuable a thorough quantitative understanding of the different processes that boost the spread of alien species is in fact our only hope to prevent and to some extent control biological invasions 4 ecology of pathogens and the spread of waterborne disease here we shall introduce to the modelling rationale that extends and specializes the reasoning presented in the previous sections with a view on a particularly important application i e spatial epidemiology as we shall see river networks and more in general waterways play a fundamental role as epidemiological corridors waterborne diseases are infections caused by ingestion of or more in general contact with water contaminated by pathogenic organisms ranging from micro typically viruses bacteria and protozoans to macro parasites mostly flat and roundworms they still represent a major threat to human health especially in low income countries most of the burden of waterborne infections is attributable to unsafe water supply lack of sanitation and poor hygienic conditions which either directly or indirectly affect exposure and transmission rates 4 1 of drivers and controls hydroclimatological forcings the mobility of susceptible infected individuals and large scale treatment are key drivers of waterborne disease transmission gurarie and seto 2009 rinaldo et al 2012 tien and earn 2010 tien et al 2015 the direct inclusion of these factors into spatially explicit mathematical models of epidemic cholera to quote an example of paramount importance has improved the understanding of complex disease patterns bertuzzo et al 2008 2016 2011a chao et al 2011 eisenberg et al 2013 mari et al 2015 2012 rinaldo et al 2012 tuite et al 2011 spatially explicit mathematical models encapsulate remotely acquired relevant descriptions of human settlements waterways where pathogens and or intermediate hosts disperse movement between human communities hydrologic and climate variables water resources development infrastructure finger et al 2014 jutla et al 2011 2013b objective manipulation of such information yields characterizations of waterborne and water based disease dynamics of unprecedented robustness that provides insight into the course of ongoing epidemics aiding short term emergency management of health care resources and long term assessments of alternative interventions chao et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2012 the general structure of spatially explicit models of waterborne disease is outlined in fig 18 the network nodes are animal communities with population hi in which the disease can diffuse and grow in human diseases the nodes can be identified with cities and villages locally a generalization of classical sir susceptible infected recovered models heesterbeek and roberts 1995 is employed to the traditional compartments one further compartment is added that of pathogens in water siwr emphasizing the role of a water reservoir w determining disease transmission dynamics for bacterial infections such models are typically called sirb for example when the pathogen is a bacterium like in cholera this amounts to including the concentration of bacteria in water therefore the dynamics of the metacommunity model is represented by the evolution in time t of the following variables at each node i si t the susceptible hosts ii t the infected and infectious ri t the recovered individuals bi t the bacterial concentration in the ith water reservoir controlling the force of infection fig 18 more complicate models may include an intermediate host living in water for instance in schistosomiasis humans host the adult stage of trematode parasites of the genus schistosoma which reproduce inside humans releasing eggs via urine or faeces the eggs released out of the human body that reach freshwater can hatch into larvae called miracidia the parasite larval form that is infectious for the second host freshwater snails belonging to different genera in the snail miracidia undergo asexual replication then the snail becomes infective and starts releasing tens of thousands of swimming larval stages called cercariae into the water cercariae infect humans penetrating their skin when they come into contact with contaminated freshwater inside the human body cercariae develop into the adult parasite spatially explicit schemes assume that local human settlements undergo sirb dynamics whereas networks of connectivity redistribute pathogens and or hosts among communities appendix the dynamics of disease spread reflects the spatial heterogeneity of its drivers among which the most important are reference is made to two paradigmatic cases of waterborne disease one micro parasitic epidemic cholera and the other macro parasitic endemic schistosomiasis taken as examples of very diverse infections sharing the same hydrological matrix climate that affects transmission rates by displaying correlation with environmental variables like rainfall and air water temperature colwell

moreno et al 2007 vezzulli et al 2016 rodó et al 2013 the role of large scale climatic drivers on cholera dynamics is the subject of a lively debate especially about potential threats posed by warming temperatures and increasingly heterogeneous patterns baker austin et al 2013 cash et al 2014 2010 escobar et al 2015 vezzulli et al 2013 2015 the links between climate and schistosomiasis are also being actively investigated mccreesh and booth 2013 pedersen et al 2014 stensgaard et al 2013 in particular because climate change might hinder progress towards control in endemic countries stensgaard et al 2016 wang et al 2014 climate may also influence pathogen ecology and host exposure prospective climate change is speculated to bear fundamental impacts on the geography of waterborne diseases zhou et al 2008 rainfall that influences both cholera and schistosomiasis as well as other macroparasitic waterborne diseases bergquist et al 2015 a variety of potential mechanisms exist whereby rainfall may alter infection risk specifically through flooding leading to raw sewage contamination of water sources hashizume et al 2008 ruiz moreno et al 2007 and enhanced exposure to human to human transmission due to crowding boelee et al 2013 increased rainfall driven iron availability in environmental waters that enhances pathogen survival and expression of toxins faruque et al 2005 lipp et al 2002 dry spells and decreased water levels leading to increased usage of unsafe water sources rebaudet et al 2013b a clear correlation between rainfall and enhanced transmission is found in regions hit by cholera epidemics constantin de magny et al 2008 jutla et al 2013b rebaudet et al 2013a 2013b notably for the haiti outbreak this link has been found empirically gaudart et al 2013 and justified theoretically eisenberg et al 2013 rinaldo et al 2012 at all spatial scales and locations examined intense rainfall events were significantly correlated with increased cholera incidence with lags of the order of a few days and forcing dynamic models with rainfall data invariably resulted in improved fits of reported infection cases one approach rinaldo et al 2012 suggested that bursts of infections could be best explained by accounting for increased contamination rates flux i w see fig 18 an alternative approach eisenberg et al 2013 employed a rainfall dependent exposure rate s i the relationship between precipitation and schistosomiasis is far from obvious it has been argued mccreesh and booth 2013 in fact that rainfall could not only boost disease transmission especially in dry climates where it is a key driver of habitat formation for the intermediate snail host but also reduce it e g by increasing water flow which in turn decreases habitat suitability for both the snails and the larval stages of the parasites rainfall can also affect human activities related to water contact thus potentially altering exposure and transmission risk lai et al 2015 also the temporal fluctuations of rainfall patterns may be particularly important in determining the seasonality of transmission mccreesh et al 2015 several studies in which the ecology of the intermediate snail hosts has been analyzed through field campaigns and geospatial models highlight the strength of the link between rainfall and schistosomiasis transmission hu et al 2013 lai et al 2015 perez saez et al 2015 stensgaard et al 2016 2013 a hydrology driven assessment of intermediate host habitat suitability thus seems necessary wu et al 2008 snail abundance in fact may depend upon density feedbacks that in turn can be driven by hydrologic controls especially in ephemeral hydrologic regimes like those typical of sub saharan africa perez saez et al 2016 therefore a quantitative link exists between hydrological drivers and snail population dynamics suggesting that statistical methods may provide reliable snail abundance projections perez saez et al 2016 and that state of the art mechanistic models of transmission gurarie et al 2016 could be made dependent on habitat type e g natural vs man made and hydrological characteristics e g ephemeral vs permanent water resources development e g damming and irrigation playing a significant role in the increase of disease burden owing to habitat expansion of pathogens and or hosts especially for schistosomiasis bergquist et al 2015 steinmann et al 2006 habitats are shaped naturally by the hydrology geomorphology connections rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 defining the suitability of certain intermediate host species key to the closure of the pathogens life cycle and the survival of pathogens in natural environments gurarie et al 2016 perez saez et al 2016 however the natural habitats are increasingly altered by humans thus making it necessary to include land use change as one of the most important drivers not only of biodiversity loss but also of increased disease susceptibility the development of agricultural practices is certainly one of the main causes of land use change also the larger and larger use of herbicides and fertilizers has also been shown to alter the ecological food web and favor the proliferation of specific intermediate hosts e g those of schistosomiasis rohr et al 2008 hydrologic transport bertuzzo et al 2008 2010 and human mobility bertuzzo et al 2010 finger et al 2016 mari et al 2015 2012 perez saez et al 2015 which regulate respectively short and long range circulation of pathogens and hosts gurarie and seto 2009 perez saez et al 2015 they also determine the spatial and temporal scales relevant to the analysis of epidemiological processes technological innovation provides information for their description at unprecedented rates bengtsson et al 2015 ciddio et al 2017 mari et al 2017b a significant role relevant in particular to this review emerges for the ecological corridors defined by waterways and river networks such hydrologic control derives from the transportation and redistribution of the free living infective propagules in particular because vibrios of cholera can spread along stream both upstream and downstream with a slightly biased propagation downstream

extended use of antibiotics abubakar et al 2015 azman and lessler 2014 ivers et al 2010 spatially explicit process descriptions and data acquisition proved increasingly effective to understand the impact of various drivers on local disease transmission rates and to realistically simulate large scale infection patterns bertuzzo et al 2008 tien and earn 2010 the robustness of simulations and predictions drawn from network models is granted by their spatial structure rooted in remotely acquired and objectively manipulated information as shown e g by applications to epidemic cholera bertuzzo et al 2008 2016 2011a chao et al 2011 finger et al 2016 gatto et al 2012 mari et al 2012 rinaldo et al 2012 tuite et al 2011 and proved formally via model selection techniques mari et al 2015 uncertainty analysis data assimilation and filtering techniques for these spatially explicit schemes are now also available pasetto et al 2017 they can reproduce complex stratifications of disease burden when transmission is heterogeneous in part owing to river networks and connected waterways where the pathogen thrives and in part due to host mobility a key factor in the spreading of the pathogen although our lines of argument are meant to apply in general specific cases and references thereof will first focus on cholera and schistosomiasis as significant examples of vastly different transmission mechanisms 4 2 spatially explicit modelling of cholera and schistosomiasis spatially explicit disease infection models have radically changed the very concept of basic reproduction number r 0 indeed challenging problems arise when observed infection patterns show spatial structure and or temporal asynchrony these features are ironed out by spatially implicit schemes that ignore spatial effects by assuming a uniform distribution of susceptible and infected individuals across the domain of interest with these simplified assumptions the traditional definition of r 0 applies the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected individual introduced in a healthy population which can be rather easily calculated from epidemiological parameters and the size of host population because of the current ease of mapping hydrology sanitation and transportation infrastructures in addition to the actual population distributions and proxies of their wash conditions a byproduct of remotely acquired and objectively manipulated information the conditions leading to waterborne disease outbreaks can be studied in a spatially explicit framework however the adoption of spatially explicit schemes is only recent and mainly with reference to cholera gatto et al 2012 2013 mari et al 2014a and schistosomiasis gurarie and seto 2009 perez saez et al 2015 we expect however that similar approaches will follow up soon for other diseases as well because the underlying mathematical framework is general diekmann and heesterbeek 2000 tien et al 2015 one important result that emerges from all the cases studied so far is that the requirement that all the local reproduction numbers be greater than one i e the traditional epidemiological tenet mediated from spatially implicit approaches is neither necessary nor sufficient a condition for outbreaks to occur when spatial heterogeneity and pathogen redistributions are a factor fig 19 this statement is not limited to waterborne diseases rather it holds in general whenever local epidemiological dynamics are coupled together by spatial connectivity the basic reproduction number must be replaced by the dominant eigenvalue of the 4n 4n jacobian matrix n is the number of nodes linearized about the disease free equilibrium moreover the eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue carries important information about the geography of waterborne or water based disease gatto et al 2012 2013 mari et al 2014a perez saez et al 2015 human infections occurring through contacts with water contaminated with free living macro parasite stages pose other challenges largely mediated by the abundance of intermediate hosts possibly subject to a complex ecology colley et al 2014 in the case of schistosomiasis the disease transmission is controlled by contact with environmental freshwater infested with parasite larvae endowed with a complex life cycle and ecology perez saez et al 2016 sokolow et al 2014 swartz et al 2015 reinfection after treatment is a problem that plagues efforts to control parasites with complex transmission pathways such as schistosomiasis low cost sustainable forms of intermediate host control coupled with drug distribution campaigns could reduce or locally eliminate the parasite grimes et al 2015 sokolow et al 2015 at regional scales where the need for spatially explicit descriptions is particularly compelling different communities are characterized by differential infection risks linked to their geographical and socio economic context a recent global assessment of schistosomiasis control over the past century has suggested that targeting the snail intermediate host works best sokolow et al 2016 however neither safe water supplies could completely prevent human contact with environmental freshwater nor adequate sanitation could guarantee its generalized usage grimes et al 2015 moreover agricultural domestic occupational and recreational tasks may foster contact with potentially infested water leading to non negligible risk factors even in contexts where water provisioning and sanitation are adequate spear 2012 this coupled with differences in lifestyles leads to complex determinants of transmission heterogeneity mari et al 2017a social groups and ages are also a matter of concern for macro parasitic infections as e g people whose routinary activities bring them in contact with water say fishermen and farmers or consider cultural settings in which women are more prone to water contact than men water contact patterns may also vary over time as a response to seasonal changes in human activities e g related to agriculture and farming resulting in temporal heterogeneity in schistosomiasis transmission attempts to incorporate socioeconomic classes and risk groups into waterborne disease models are quite few in both applied remais et al 2009 and theoretical studies barbour 1978 strong seasonal patterns in the transmission intensity and infection prevalence in both human and snail hosts still need a settlement within large scale spatially explicit modeling frameworks 4 3 spatially explicit modelling of pkd one last example which seems particularly fit to the focus on fluvial ecological corridors concerns the spread possibly rapid and deadly of a particular fish disease proliferative kidney disease pkd is a high mortality pathology that critically affects freshwater salmonid populations infection is caused by the endoparasitic myxozoan tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae that cycles between freshwater bryozoans and salmonids exploiting the former as primary hosts proliferative kidney disease pkd is recognized as a major threat to both wild and farmed salmonid populations in europe and north america mortality due to pkd in farmed fish ranges from 20 to 100 clifton hadley et al 1986 feist and longshaw 2006 ferguson and ball 1979 okamura et al 2011 the impacts of pkd on wild fish populations are generally poorly known although pkd has been linked to long term decline of swiss brown trout populations borsuk et al 2006 pkd incidence and relevant fish mortality are strongly correlated with water temperature therefore climate change is feared to extend the disease range to higher altitude and latitude regions with major consequences hari et al 2006 the first dynamical model of pkd epidemiology in local communities has recently been developed carraro et al 2016 the local model accounts for local demographic and epidemiological dynamics of bryozoans and salmonids explicitly incorporates the role of water temperature and couples intra and inter seasonal dynamics fig 20 shows that during the warm season left column susceptible bryozoans bs become covertly infected bc after contact with spores zf released by infected fish infection in bryozoans cycles between covert and overt bo states bs yield uninfected statoblasts ss i e asexually produced propagules while bc release both uninfected and infected si statoblasts infected bryozoans may clear the infection susceptible fish fs are exposed to pkd after contact with spores zb released by bo after an incubation phase fe fish can either become acutely infected fi or directly enter an asymptomatic carrier state fc fi can die owing to pkd or become long term disease carriers fc may become susceptible again both fi and fc shed spores infective to bryozoans at the beginning of a new warm season central column bs are comprised of susceptible colonies that survived during winter and by hatched ss similarly bc consist of survived colonies that were infected at the beginning of winter and of hatched si fs are composed by survived susceptible individuals and newborn fish from all classes the abundance of fc is determined by the number of individuals belonging to classes fe fi and fc that survived through winter other classes are absent the spatially explicit model fig 20c shows the connectivity of local models operating at the scale of a river reach of relatively homogeneous geomorphic features i e a node effectively carried out by the river network the substrate for host and pathogen interactions for mathematical details see carraro et al 2016 a stability analysis of this time hybrid system performed via floquet theory bacaër and ouifki 2007 mari et al 2014a suggests that whenever the epidemiological parameters are set to realistic values the introduction of t bryosalmonae in a previously disease free community will most likely trigger a pkd outbreak a sensitivity analysis of the system shows that when the disease becomes endemic the impact of pkd on fish population size is mostly controlled by the temperature dependent rates of disease development in the fish host on the other hand this first model was still a local one with no regard to the fundamental role played by spatial dynamics indeed understanding how different local communities distributed in space interact with each other is crucial to possibly predict the spreading of a pkd epidemic and the effect of intervention strategies from a theoretical viewpoint as we said above the condition that disease free equilibria in all local communities be unstable is neither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of outbreaks when such communities are connected by different layers of connectivity affecting transmission gatto et al 2012 while the effects of landscape and river network connectivity have extensively been evaluated for waterborne diseases affecting humans the literature focusing on modelling processes of waterborne animal diseases was scarce if not null in a spatial metacommunity framework yet the issue of pinpointing effective mitigation strategies for wildlife diseases such as pkd is becoming increasingly critical for environmental policy makers a noteworthy example is given by the recent pkd outbreak occurred in the yellowstone river montana usa robbins 2016 where due to an unprecedented fish kill the local wildlife authorities imposed the closure of a 300 km long river stretch and related tributaries to all recreational activities to prevent farther spread of the parasite a proper predictive tool for the spatial dynamics of pkd remains elusive to date despite its clear importance for disease control and impact mitigation for this reason carraro et al 2017 set out to study the key influence of network effects on pkd mortality and prevalence patterns and on the celerity of disease propagation building on the recently proposed first local model of pkd transmission carraro et al 2016 a spatially explicit metacommunity framework has been developed to study the spatial effects in the spread of the disease in idealized stream networks at the local community scale the model accounts for demographic and epidemiological dynamics of bryozoan and fish populations at the network scale the model couples the dynamics of each local community through hydrological transport of parasite spores and fish movement the model also explicitly accounts for water temperature variations that influence epidemiological parameters for heterogeneity in habitat characteristics and for hydrological conditions along a river network the idealized stream network is obtained as an ocn which defines a tree that spans the whole landscape we consider landscapes formed by square lattices of d p 2 pixels whose side has length lp in the real world however a drainage path becomes a stream only when certain hydrological conditions are met the simplest and most tested method assumes that pixels form a channel when their contributing area a proxy of landscape forming discharge exceeds a certain threshold a c t carraro et al 2017 the network is then discretized into stretches each of which defined as a sequence t of channelized pixels starting from one pixel having either zero river sources or more than one channelized upstream pixels confluences and containing the downstream sequence of channelized pixels until another confluence or the outlet are reached the obtained network of stretches is an oriented graph suitable for the application of the pkd metacommunity model the second step in the generation of synthetic river networks consists in the definition of the geomorphological properties of each river stretch ns is the number of stretches cross sections are approximated with rectangular shapes having width w depth d and average water velocity v to account for how these geometric variables change along the network we exploit a classical result of river geomorphology rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 according to which w q 0 5 d q 0 4 and v q 0 1 where q is river discharge by invoking the proportionality between landscape forming discharge and contributing area at a site one has w k w o a k 0 5 d k d o a k 0 4 v k v o a k 0 1 where the subscript k identifies a generic stretch k and wo do and vo are the maximum values i e at the outlet for width depth and velocity respectively a k a c i k d p 2 is the normalized contributing area to stretch k subscript ik identifies the last downstream pixel of stretch k the last element of t k the discharge at the outlet of the catchment reads then q o w o d o v o the water volume in a generic stretch k is v k w k d k l s k where the length l s k i t k l i and l i l p if the flow direction along pixel i is parallel to a pixel side or l i 2 l p if parallel to the pixel diagonal the slope area relationship allows one to evaluate the elevation of the network stretches the elevation drop along a network pixel can indeed be expressed as δ z i s o a i 0 5 l i where so is the outlet slope this relationship can be iteratively applied starting from the outlet pixel where an arbitrary elevation zo is imposed towards all upstream paths in order to reconstruct the elevation of each channelized pixel the elevation of a stretch can be defined as the average elevation among all constituting pixels examples of ocns obtained by changing only the location of the output pixel are shown in fig 21 scale parameters that define the metric of the river network were chosen to be representative of a prealpine catchment of around 1000 km2 the seasonal cycle of stream water temperature typically follows that of air temperature albeit being damped and possibly delayed however notable deviations can be observed in streams with large impoundments or lakes upstream or when the thermal regime is dominated by ice snow melting for this exercise we assume that water temperature at the outlet reach to τ follows a sinusoidal function with period equal to one year to derive time series of water temperature for all network stretches we further assume that water temperature mirrors the environmental lapse rate of air temperature water temperature in a generic stretch k is then t k τ t o τ γ w δ z k where γw is the lapse rate and δzk the difference in elevation with respect to the outlet lapse rates for air temperature can range from about 9 8 oc km 1 for dry air dry adiabatic lapse rate dalr to about 4 0 oc km 1 for hot saturated air saturated adiabatic lapse rate we assume γw equal to 6 5 oc km 1 a typical value that is used as global mean environmental lapse rate for air temperature carraro et al 2017 the fish mobility rate li can be thought of as the inverse of the population average residence time within stretch i in general stretches may have different geometric and physical characteristics e g length water volume and depth velocity fish carrying capacity and thus li is expected to change across the river network li is computed in such a way that the stationary state of the underlying diffusion process is a specific spatial distribution of fish abundances fi the underlying idea is that in order to apply the model first a distribution of fish abundance at carrying capacity is assigned according to the characteristics of each stretch then a set of mobility rates li is derived so that fish movement leads at steady state to the desired abundance distribution once movements rules are determined diffusion matrix p the values of li such that a distribution of fish abundances fi is an equilibrium state are obtained by solving the following linear system 7 p i j l i f i p j i l j f j i n s j n s note that only n s 1 of the above equations are nontrivial identities in fact pij 0 only if stretches i and j are directly connected and every stretch has one downstream connection with the exception of the outlet stretch the system has 1 solutions indeed if a set of li is a solution also the same set multiplied by a scalar is a solution it is thus possible to focus on a single solution by specifying the average mobility rate across the network lavg the model has been applied to several replicas of ocn landscapes see appendix fig 21 results show how network connectivity and hydrological conditions critically control the spatial distribution of the prevalence of pkd and the celerity of invasion fronts in the upstream and downstream directions fig 22 shows how connectivity and fish mobility affect the distribution of disease prevalence i e the fraction of infected fish two main types of pattern arise when mobility rates are considerably high prevalence decreases as the distance from the outlet increases fig 22a d when instead fish mobility is negligible the sites with higher prevalence are those whose contributing area is higher fig 22b c contributing area is indeed a proxy of the abundance of parasite spores that enter a given stretch which is the main driver of infection in the absence of fish movement in this case small headwater stretches in the proximity of the outlet are not invaded by the parasite see magenta arrows in fig 22b conversely high mobility rates enhance the mixing process among local communities with the result that the variability in prevalence among neighbouring stretches is low and the average network prevalence increases when mobility rates are tuned to more realistic values i e by assuming the distribution of mean residence times of fig 21b the distribution of prevalence shows an intermediate behaviour blue lines in fig 22c d patterns of fish loss exhibit an analogous trend the inclusion of an elevation gradient has a minor impact on the distribution of prevalence fig 22e of course this depends on the lapse rate chosen as a consequence of diminished temperature a decrease of prevalence in upstream stretches is observed which is not compensated for by a corresponding increment in lower altitude stretches this causes a small reduction in the average network prevalence about 1 5 regardless of fish mobility as for the distribution of fish loss fig 22f the effects of non uniform temperature are slightly accentuated at the outlet fish loss is generally higher 4 3 when lavg is null but the fish loss does not change substantially with respect to the flat landscape case also a sensitivity analysis of disease propagation celerity with respect to the contamination rates pathogen spores produced by both fish and bryozoans and the fish mobility rate lavg has been conducted downstream propagation generally occurs after one to three seasons much faster than upstream propagation which reaches a steady state after around 100 seasons as a consequence of the bias in the hydrological transport of spores and of its fast dynamics expectedly both the fish mobility and the contamination rates are positively correlated with propagation celerity in both directions although the role of lavg in downstream propagation is minor when both contamination and mobility are small rather obviously pkd might not establish in the network note that while the absence of pkd at the outlet stretch implies that the whole network is disease free this is not necessarily true with regards to the headwaters similar effects are produced by variations of fish or variations of bryozoan contamination rates fish movement and hydrological transport within a river network can thus produce a heterogeneous distribution of pkd prevalence and fish loss even in the absence of spatial gradients of fish and bryozoan densities or of transmission rates carraro et al 2017 the typical lifetime of pkd spores around 1 day allow them to travel along with the flow and possibly infect fish tens of kilometers downstream of the point where they are released stretches further downstream thus collect spores from the whole or a large portion of the upstream area and are therefore more likely to exhibit higher pkd prevalence and fish loss conversely headwaters and low order streams are subject only to the spore load that is locally released and thus tend to be relatively less affected by pkd therefore hydrological transport of spores tends to produce spatial patterns of disease prevalence correlated to the upstream drainage area this dominant pattern can partially be affected by fish mobility indeed a headwater connected directly to a high order stream is subject to immigration of likely infected fish that foster local prevalence overall fish mobility promotes the mixing between low and high order streams resulting in a net increase of overall prevalence at the network scale elevation of river stretches is intimately related to the structure of the underlying river network indeed the well established and observed slope drainage area relationship dictates that a network configuration is uniquely associated to a relative elevation distribution of river sites thus network structure controls as a byproduct also the distribution of elevations a proxy of mean water temperature and in turn of pkd prevalence carraro et al 2016 indeed water temperature generally decreases with elevation and thus with the distance to the outlet temperature gradients tend thus to produce distributions of pkd prevalence akin to those discussed above driven by hydrological transport and fish mobility however results report that at least for the above example the effect of temperature might be minor compared to that produced by spatial coupling mechanisms the river network analyzed herein spans an elevation relief of about 1000 m which translates in about 6 5 oc difference in mean water temperature larger network with more pronounced elevation relief can possibly lead to more important effect of temperature gradients the invasion celerity of pkd in the downstream direction is mostly controlled by hydrological transport of spores whereas fish mobility has only a marginal effect for transmission parameters leading to high pkd prevalence above 90 a value sometimes observed in affected river systems wahli et al 2007 2002 the disease can invade from tens to hundreds of kilometers of river within a single proliferation season provided that all sites are equally suitable for fish and bryozoans upstream invasion of pkd from a region of the network close to the outlet can occur only via fish swimming against the flow direction the corresponding celerity is much slower than the downstream one with realistic values of fish mobility e g l a v g 0 02 d 1 pkd can travel upstream only few kilometers per season modelling fish mobility as a diffusion process implicitly assumes that fish engage in trips with a thin tailed distribution of distance carraro et al 2017 as discussed above this is a useful working hypothesis one might assume on the contrary different diffusion processes within the river network like e g a heavy tailed distribution of reachable distances this could lead to anomalous diffusion and enhanced celerity of propagation of disease fronts into disease free regions other factors not included in this analysis e g detailed descriptions of the transport of spores or infection of bryozoans or statoblasts through ballast water or by waterfowl okamura et al 2011 can boost the propagation in both directions via long distance dispersal as well we conclude that spatial coupling mechanisms i e hydrological transport of spores and fish mobility matter only during the bryozoan proliferation season in which pkd can actually be transmitted typically from april to november while this hypothesis is reasonable for parasite spores whose survival time scale is much shorter than the duration of the winter season it might be questionable as concerns fish indeed fish movement in the cold season even if it cannot spread the disease can enhance the redistribution of pkd carriers it is known that salmonids may move by several kilometers upstream in late summer or autumn for spawning and an analogous distance is covered downstream in early spring however brown trout are usually subject to natal homing frank et al 2012 and so they tend to return to the same place moreover pkd is not vertically transmitted to newborn fish hence we argue that neglecting winter fish mobility does not frustrate our model s ability to capture the effect of this crucial process on the patterns of pkd prevalence the above results further our understanding of the drivers of fish distribution in riverine ecosystems and provide the basis for the development of intervention and management tools which is one of the main tenets of this paper 5 concluding remarks general lessons that can be drawn from our perspective pertain a twofold advance that we consider acquired on the one hand the role of directional dispersal embedded in the topology and metrics of river networks as the substrate for ecological interactions proves fundamental theoretically and experimentally its remarkable effects are relevant to unfolding or declining biodiversity population dynamics including biological invasions the spread of waterborne disease this is far from generally acknowledged to date yet particularly clear in our view on the other hand spatially explicit metacommunity models of biodiversity of population dynamics as well as of waterborne and water based disease transmissions are fast learners from any source of distributed information dynamic models of this kind may be particularly effective in understanding patterns of biodiversity and of biological invasions as well as in planning containment efforts of emerging infectious diseases all of them being decisively affected by the topology and metrics of the river network and the embedded directional dispersal allowed by their form and function despite differences in methods that will be tested through model guided field validations mathematical modeling of large scale water controls on biota i e the core business of ecohydrology offer a broad perspective on a range of biological processes only briefly examined in this paper though following a coherent conceptual thread we believe that neglecting opportunities to develop this path or simply fostering a common cultural bias against modelling approaches especially in public health assessment will contribute to keep the world s social inequalities and injustice in the statu quo several open issues remain in a number of areas relevant to this review for example the use of estimated hydrologic controls as a metric for model study comparisons could parallel current practice as data on the biota say related to waterborne disease are often of limited quality such that it is often difficult to distinguish between models on the grounds of better or worse performance progress in data assimilation and model validation is also needed in particular in view of the nature of available field data the different datasets to be utilised in fact have rather different quality because uncertainty on topographic hydrologic or ecological data tends to be radically different this constrains our ability to validate integrated models to some extent and is keen to have an impact on the acceptance of spatial models in other communities e g in the public health area it is the authors belief however that these approach will become mainstream soon enough owing to their intrinsic advantages optimal control of intervention measures possibly in emergency management is a natural development of the current tools it will naturally follow from the solid establishment of the field of spatially explicit ecohydrology of species populations and pathogens of waterborne disease missing steps for advancing this area concern the availability of model guided field validations and suitable data to be assimilated into the model we expect significant steps forward in this area to come from remote sensing and digital image processing and from other technological advances like the widespread availability of human mobility fluxes tracked by cell phones currently arbitrarily managed at times in rather untransparent ways by providers and monopolists environmental dna fingerprinting is also a technique that will increasingly provide large amounts of field data of great ecological importance what limits the widespread uptake of models for decision making at the interface of hydrology and ecology is a serious matter of current debate in the field of hydrology it is widely accepted that modelling tools are needed to overcome the limitation of extrapolating from data in a nonstationary world therein model based decisions are the norm to investigate possible interventions under what if scenarios in biodiversity preservation protection from unfolding biological invasions or public health control of waterborne disease transmission such a transition has not yet happened perhaps what is missing to prompt a radical attitude change in these areas is a massive set of visible applications the haiti cholera epidemic 2011 seems to have represented an important testbed to that end or perhaps visible joint initiatives where direct comparisons between data based strategies and modelling aided scenarios are made what we are about to pursue next is a generalized use of assimilated models of the spatially explicit type to assess optimal control of interventions strategies for the containment of waterborne disease spread say where to best allocate finite batch of vaccines in space and time in epidemiology this is way beyond current public health management of emergences the road traced by hydrologists and by oceanographers and meteorologists before them will be eventually followed in the future by ecologists and public health officials in our not so unbiased perhaps view

from the exact result that drainage network configurations minimizing total energy dissipation are stationary solutions of the general equation describing landscape evolution banavar et al 2000 it was argued rinaldo et al 2014 1999 1992 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 that at least in the fluvial landscape nature works through imperfect searches for dynamically accessible optimal configurations and that purely random or deterministic constructs are unsuitable to properly describe natural network forms here we review the model of river networks known as optimal channel network ocn rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 the ocn model was originally based on the ansatz that configurations occurring in nature minimize a functional describing total energy dissipation and on the derivation of an explicit form for such a functional the latter uses locally landscape forming flowrates qi and the drop in potential energy to define energy dissipation qiδzi i

between flux area and the topographic gradient at any point i and gradients are approximated by δzi the largest drop in elevation at i one can thus uniquely associate any landscapes with an oriented spanning and loopless graph on a lattice and reconstruct the field of cumulative areas ai corresponding to a given oriented spanning graph note also that we wish to emphasize the dependence on the configuration s a 1 a 2 a n that the system assumes on the features of the oriented spanning graph associated with the landscape topography z through its gradients z that uniquely defines total contributing areas a i i 1 n in a n site lattice what is totally surprising is that empirically observed scaling features are only reproduced by myopic searches of dynamically accessible configurations that cannot get rid of the inheritance of extant constraints the scaling structure topological and metric of configurations characterized by suboptimal energy dissipation matches perfectly those observed in nature and differs significantly from ground states rinaldo et al 2006 2014 1999 optimal arrangements of network structures and branching patterns thus result from the direct minimization of the functional in eq a 1 the basic operational problem to obtain ocns for a given domain is to find the connected path draining it that minimizes hγ s without postulating predefined features e g the number of sources or the link lengths one key problem is the assessment of the robustness of ocn configurations selected by any minimum procedure this has been studied rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 with respect to the strategy for minimum search the role of initial conditions the robustness of the functional dependence on γ the role of lattice anisotropies the effects of quenched randomness rinaldo et al 1992 the basic optimization strategies are similar to algorithms developed in the context of non numerable np complete problems where the exponential growth of possible configurations prevents complete enumeration iterated random searches work best in that context rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 the basic algorithm proceeds as follows an initial network configuration s is chosen as a spanning tree on the grid to drain an overall area made up by n sites this defines an orientation and a connection for each pixel stating to which of the eight neighboring pixels its area is draining neighbors being assumed at unit distance from the centroid this in turn needed both preliminary and a posteriori speculations on whether a triangular lattice with six neighboring nodes or an anisotropic scheme in which diagonal connections were weighted by a 2 factor would be a better model of local interactions rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 a scalar state variable ai t denotes the total area at a point i at stage t of the optimization process a i t j w i j t a j t 1 where wij is the now dynamic functional operator that has the connectivity matrix as its static counterpart by w i j t 1 if i j are connected 0 otherwise that is wij t implies that j i is a drainage direction note that j spans the 8 neighboring pixels of the arbitrary ith site the unit mass added refers to the area representative of the actual site as a proxy of the distributed injection term from the initial configuration stage t 0 the basic strategy consists of drawing a site at random and perturbing the system by assigning a change δwij i e by modifying at random its connection to the former receiving pixel hence w i j t 1 w i j t δ w i j this corresponds to perturbing the configuration s s s adjusting to such a local modification all aggregated areas ai are modified in the downstream region until the original and the modified path reconvene the change is accepted if the modified value of hγ s is lowered by the random change hγ s hγ s and no loops are formed loops are excluded on a rigorous basis as it was shown exactly that they lead to energetically unfavorable configurations for the functional in eq with γ 1 every tree is a local minimum of total energy expenditure rinaldo et al 2006 as the new configuration is adopted as a base configuration the process is iterated otherwise the change is discarded if hγ s hγ s and the t stage configuration s is perturbed again the procedure leads to a configuration for which no improvement on total energy expenditure appears after a fixed and large number of iterations i e an ocn the whole process may or may not be then reset and restarted from the same initial configuration this is done several times at times to allow the random process a fair chance to capture nonlocal minima should they be of interest the configuration attaining the lowest energy dissipation amongst the trials described before is chosen as the ocn instructive visual schemes of the progress of the basic selection algorithm is illustrated elsewhere briggs and krishnamoorthy 2013 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 this basic procedure at times termed the lin or the greedy approach because of the similarities with the n city traveling salesman algorithm rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 respects the rules of a fair search for approximate solutions but is apt to yield trapping in local minimum energy variants of the basic algorithm implemented to test the importance of choice of strategy for minimum search include the metropolis algorithm multiple simultaneous perturbations and simulated annealing schemes are engineered to avoid trapping of the configuration into unsuitable local minima this is done by accepting perturbations of the current configuration s s even if they yield hγ s hγ s with a probability depending on a state parameter t in practice the probability of acceptance of the perturbation is given by the metropolis rule i e it is 1 if the resulting change corresponds to hγ s hγ s or if δ h h γ s h γ s 0 and e δ h t r and 0 otherwise where r is a random number r 0 1 to carry out proper annealing one makes changes in the parameter t from relatively high values at the start to low values towards the end of the analysis clearly for high values of t the likelihood of accepting unfavorable changes is high whereas for t 0 the rule is equal to that of the basic algorithm a cooling schedule for decreasing values of t as the procedure evolves is thus required rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 optimal arrangements of network structures and branching patterns thus result from the direct minimization of the functional in eq a 1 the basic operational problem to obtain ocns for a given domain is to find the connected path s draining it that minimizes hγ s without postulating predefined features e g the number of sources or the link lengths random perturbations of an initial structure imply disconnecting and reorienting a single link at a time rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 they lead to new configurations that are accepted details aside if they lower total energy expenditure i e the functional in eq a 1 iterated until many perturbations are unable to prompt change by finding better configurations loops possibly generated by the random configuration search in the fitness landscape were excluded at first without a rigorous basis only later it was shown exactly that they lead to energetically unfavorable configurations banavar et al 2000 2001 rinaldo et al 2006 for realistic values of γ derived from slope area empirical evidence boundary conditions are required for the evolving optimal trees as outlet s must be imposed single or multiple outlets along drainage lines as well as no flux or periodic boundary conditions briggs and krishnamoorthy 2013 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 2001 interesting issues emerge on the statics dynamics and complexity of ocns rinaldo et al 2014 exact results reviewed in rinaldo et al 2014 exist on the existence of many dynamically accessible stable states the practical impossibility of pointing out a priori the most stable feasible state among all metastable states without an evolutionary account of the history of the current configuration of the system the hierarchical structure and the universality class of dynamically accessible states although the above are features that river networks share with other natural complex systems the extent of observations and comparative analyses the exact relation to the general evolution equations and the broad range of scales involved suggest their interest as a general model system of how nature works bak 1996 thus one recurrent self organized mechanism for the dynamic origin of fractal forms is the robust strive for imperfect optimality that we see embedded in many natural patterns especially hydrologic ones example of spatially explicit siwr model a spatially explicit siwr model of epidemic cholera is presented here as an appendix to the main text all spatially explicit epidemiological models follow from the same scheme as they belong in a special class of metacommunity models section 2 the basic epidemiological model derives from the spatially distributed siwr model termed sirb for bacterial diseases like cholera bertuzzo et al 2005 pasetto et al 2017 the population is subdivided into n communities each community is represented by a node of the model fig 18 the individuals in each node i are subdivided into three separate categories susceptible symptomatic infected and recovered whose number at time t are denoted with si t ii t and ri t respectively the concentration of v cholerae in the local environment corresponding to node i is indicated with bi t the following set of coupled ordinary differential equations describes the cholera transmission dynamics a 2 d i i d t σ f i t s i γ μ α i i a 3 d r i d t 1 σ f i t s i γ i i ρ μ r i a 4 d b i d t μ b b i p w i 1 ϕ j i t i i ℓ b i j 1 n p j i w j b j w i where the population hi of each node is assumed to be at demographic equilibrium if α 0 thus the equation for susceptibles in this case reduces to s i t h i i i t r i t the term fi t is called force of infection and represents the rate at which susceptible individuals are exposed to contaminated water expressed as f i t β i 1 m b i k b i m j 1 n q i j b j k b j parameter β denotes the maximum exposure rate which in this application is assumed to differ among the nodes the fraction b i k b i is the probability of becoming infected due to the exposure to a concentration bi of v cholerae k being the half saturation constant codeço 2001 the force of infection takes into account the possible disease propagation due to human mobility with the idea that a fraction m of susceptible individuals daily commute between nodes and can thus be exposed to pathogens at the destination two options have been used to compute the probability qij that an individual living at node i commutes to j one is the gravity model erlander and stewart 1990 i e q i j h j e d i j d where the attractiveness of node j depends on its population size hj while the deterrence factor is assumed to be dependent on the distance dij between the two communities via an exponential kernel with shape factor d alternatively a radiation model may be implemented in uniformly dense contexts simini et al 2012 the second option has been to derive mobility fluxes qij directly from the tracking of mobile phone records a tool that proves essential in the case of non routine gatherings like religious pilgrimages in senegal that ignite infection spreads finger et al 2016 a fraction σ of the infected individuals develops symptoms thus entering class ii the remaining fraction 1 σ is asymptomatic and therefore does not contribute to the disease transmission and enters the recovered compartment directly symptomatically infected individuals recover at a rate γ or die due to cholera or other causes at rates α or μ respectively note that here α is set to zero to maintain the demographic equilibrium in fact a value of α different from zero under the assumption of constant population would imply that the birth rate increases to overcome the deaths due to cholera which is inconsistent recovered individuals lose their immunity and return to the susceptible compartment at a rate ρ or die at a rate μ symptomatic individuals contribute to the environmental concentration of v cholerae at a rate p wi where p is the rate at which bacteria excreted by an infected individual reach and contaminate an imaginary environmental water reservoir of volume wi assumed to be proportional to population size i e w i c h i as in rinaldo et al 2012 environmental v cholerae are assumed to decay at a rate μb the hydrologic dispersal of bacteria if embedded in the last term of eq a 4 bacteria undergo hydrologic dispersal at a rate ℓ pathogens can travel from node i to j with probability pij we assume the p i j 1 if j is the downstream nearest neighbor of node i and zero otherwise the mobility of infected individuals are not considered here bertuzzo et al 2016 pasetto et al 2017 while bacterial dispersal along the hydrological network is typically an important transmission process at the first stages of a cholera epidemics subsequent current reported epidemiological data as notably observed for the haitian 2010 epidemics are uncorrelated to the channel network for what concern the mobility of infected individuals most of them require urgent hydration treatment at healthcare points thus the hypothesis that a relevant fraction of infect individuals commutes among the nodes is unconvincing in order to express the deterioration of sanitary conditions caused by rainfall the contamination rate p is increased by the rainfall intensity ji t via a coefficient ϕ rinaldo et al 2012 by introducing the dimensionless bacterial concentrations b i b i k it is possible to group three model parameters into a single ratio θ p c k bertuzzo et al 2008 the weekly cholera cases are computed by integrating the number of new cases in every commune i e σfisi the equations are usually been solved by runge kutta methods bertuzzo et al 2016 pasetto et al 2017 to assess the impact of vaccination campaigns the model needs be adapted to consider vaccinated individuals we assume that vaccination targets individuals independently of their cholera infection history i e both susceptible s and already immune individuals r are eligible with the same probability vaccinated individuals already immune are assumed to remain completely immune while vaccinated susceptibles benefit from a leaky immunity with vaccine efficacy 0 η 1 thus reducing the susceptibility by η oral vaccination is assume to provide immunity with a delay of one week after administration of a single dose due to the short time horizon of the forecast at this stage no assumption is made for the duration of the vaccine induced immunity and individuals remain immune for the duration of this study at each node i the number of vaccinated individuals at a time t is subdivided into three separate categories in addition to si ii and ri denoted as vaccinated susceptible individuals v i s vaccinated individuals that become infected v i i and vaccinated recovered which have a complete immunity v i r the equations are modified accordingly pasetto et al 2017 as shown schematically in the scheme of fig 18d where the number of susceptible individuals is computed as s i h i i i r i v i s v i i v i r the model assumes a linear ramp up of vaccine uptake meaning that daily number of ocv doses distributed in each community νi is computed by equally deploying the available doses during the days of the campaign normally vaccines are evenly distributed among susceptible and recovered individuals the delay of one week in the vaccine derived immunity is modelled by starting the ocv campaign with a delay of one week to model the leaky immunity of vaccinated susceptible individuals the force of infection fi is decreased of a factor 1 η as depicted in fig 18 
874,salt transport and precipitation in porous media constitute a set of complex and fascinating phenomena that are of considerable interest to several important problems ranging from storage of co2 in geological formations to soil fertility and protection of pavements and roads as well as historical monuments the phenomena occur at the pore scale and are greatly influenced by the heterogeneity of the pore space morphology we present a pore network pn model to study the phenomena vapor diffusion capillary effect at the brine vapor interface flow of brine and transport of salt and its precipitation in the pores that plug the pores partially or completely are all accounted for the drying process is modeled by the invasion percolation while transport of salt in brine is accounted for by the convective diffusion equation we demonstrate that the drying patterns the clustering and connectivity of the pore throats in which salt precipitation occurs the saturation distribution and the drying rate are all strongly dependent upon the pore size distribution the correlations among the pore sizes and the anisotropy of the pore space caused by stratification that most natural porous media contain in particular if the strata are more or less parallel to the direction of injection of the gas that dries out the pore space air for example and or causes salt precipitation co2 for example the drying rate increases significantly moreover salt tends to precipitate in clusters of neighboring pores that are parallel to the open surface of the porous medium keywords evaporation salt precipitation pore network simulation correlation 1 introduction salt precipitation in porous media occurs in numerous systems including in soil that represents a global issue affecting salinization of agricultural land nachshon et al 2011 2001 schoups et al 2005 and in geological formations that are being tested for co2 sequestration baumann et al 2014 several mechanisms contribute to salt precipitation in porous media the most important of which is drying and evaporation wicking of saline water veran tissoires and prat 2014 as well as mineral replacement and reactions that contribute to salt crystallization dashtian et al 2017 and growth in soil and rock noiriel et al 2010 salt precipitation damages porous media by reducing their porosity and permeability bacci et al 2011 causing mechanical failure schiro et al 2012 thus numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have been undertaken to understand the effect of various factors on drying of brine and salt distribution bergstad and shokri 2016 norouzi rad and shokri 2012 norouzi rad et al 2013 shokri et al 2008 shokri and or 2011 in order to develop methods for limiting the damage in particular shahidzadeh bonn et al 2010 investigated the effect of the kinetics of salt dissolution and crystallization on salt induced damage to sandstones while flatt 2002 studied the effect of salt concentration on the extent of damage to porous media salt precipitation is preceded by evaporation of saline water thus many experimental studies of brine evaporation shahraeeni et al 2012 shahraeeni and or 2010 shokri and or 2011 and precipitation of salt bergstad and shokri 2016 shokri et al 2010 2012 at the pore scale have been reported elucidating the effect on the drying rates of several factors such as the pore size distribution psd connectivity of the pore space the way pore bodies and pore throats are connected to one another and the wettability for example experiments with various psds indicate that two types of efflorescence crusty and patchy may form on the surface of porous media veran tissoires and prat 2014 that affect the evaporation rates differently thus the psd is a major component of porous medium that should be considered in modeling of drying induced salt precipitation but despite the large number of theoretical and experimental studies of salt crystallization in porous media there is still no comprehensive model and efficient numerical simulation method that can predict salt precipitation patterns in porous media at the pore scale usually referred to as subflorescence salt crystallization in a porous medium is a complex molecular scale phenomenon dashtian et al 2017 that is influenced by the thermodynamic state of the system temperature pressure and humidity and other factors such as the salt type and the morphology of the medium even repeating a given experiment in a sample porous medium undergoing salt crystallization does not guarantee the same precipitation patterns such complexities in the physics of the salt precipitation in porous media exacerbate the inherent difficulties of its modeling the goal of our study is to propose a pore network pn modeling approach that is capable of predicting the spatial distributions of brine vapor and the precipitated salt to develop a physically based pn model one must take into account the mechanism by which the precipitated salt accumulates under the right conditions na and cl ions in a solution give rise to nucleation and growth of salt crystals experimental studies by shahidzadeh bonn et al 2010 demonstrated the effect of the salt type on the extent of damage to the pore space of porous media they showed that the formation of the hydrated sodium sulfate crystals enhances the spreading power of the salt solution on the pn network of sandstone giving rise to very rapid growth of the hydrated phase of sulfate and forming clusters sodium chloride on the other hand only forms anhydrous crystals which explains why less efflorescence is observed compared to sodium sulfate shahidzadeh bonn et al 2010 did not however consider the effect of the chemistry of the pore surface of porous media or the co existence of several types of salt in our pn model we consider only the formation of subflorescence and thus we work with nacl as the salt in the study some experimental and theoretical studies indicate that salt accumulates in a very narrow layer at the soil atmosphere interface where the initial evaporation occurs after which precipitation within the pore space is limited on the other hand experimental studies of roels et al 2014 with core samples indicated that capillary driven flow does not have substantial effect on salt precipitation because of which accumulation of salt near the core surface was low their computed tomography images after drying indicated uniform salt distribution inside the core bönhorst et al 2016 reported that high evaporation rates limit transport of solids on the external surface leading to a more uniform precipitation distribution whereas low drying rates result in strong solid accumulation on the porous medium s external surface but that small throats reduce the solute transport and restrict solid accumulation on the surface one must also recognize the self enhancing of salt growth and salt transport in water films miri et al 2015 aggregated salt crystals form a microporous medium malmir et al 2016a b 2017 with a high degree of capillarity in each throat that enhances solute transport through imbibing brine over long distances but since such phenomena as the growth of salt crystals at the drying interface occur at the molecular scale dashtian et al 2017 it is not possible to include them in a pn model instead one must resort to molecular dynamics simulation dashtian et al 2017 kim et al 2013 reported on two distinct salt crystallization in synthetic porous media one was large bulky crystals that form away from the vapor liquid interface while aggregated randomly oriented crystals that form near the drying interface constituted the second type in addition experiments in circular capillary tubes have shown that salt precipitation is also affected by the boundary conditions imposed on the system when the two ends of capillary tubes are open salt crystals tend to migrate even outside the tube and form a patchy packing in closed end capillaries however salt crystallization occurs inside the tubes miri et al 2015 therefore the question of whether salt precipitates mainly on the external surface of a porous medium or more uniformly in its pore space depends on the medium s morphology the competition between convection and capillarity and the boundary conditions in the pn model that we describe below salt precipitate occurs inside the pore throats and after precipitation its crystals do not migrate from one throat to other throats at the field scale salt precipitation is also influenced by the initial spatial distributions of the porosity and permeability of a porous formation celia et al 2011 zeidouni et al 2008 several experimental studies of salt precipitation in geological formations during co2 injection have also been reported muller et al 2009 bacci et al 2011 ott et al 2011 peysson et al 2014 indicating that salt precipitation reduces permeability and porosity in berea sandstone this supports the view that in such formations crystallization occurs inside the pore throats in the pore space rather than migration to the outside surface given such insights the effect of such distributions on the efflorescence formation has also been studied veran tissoires and prat 2012 in particular sghaier et al 2014 reported on the influence of evaporation flux from the boundary on the subflorescenc e formation and growth while the effect of grain angularity was studied by norouzi rad and shokri 2014 the porous media used by sghaier et al 2014 and norouzi rad and shokri 2014 represented however isotropic medium and did not also include the correlations in the grain or pore sizes that are prevalent in natural porous media sahimi 2011 one major purpose of our study is to show the effect of pore size correlations on drying and the precipitation patterns models of evaporation and salt transport and precipitation in porous formations can be divided into two groups in one group are the thermodynamic models of salt deposition in earth s crust see for example toner et al 2015 the second groups of models contains two subgroups continuum models of fluid flow and transport guglielmini et al 2008 huinink et al 2002 those that are based on the classical averaged equations of hydrodynamics and transport belong to the first subgroup they are capable of modeling evaporation and salt precipitation at the field scale they include models for the evolution of salt crystals le et al 2009 and salt concentration in liquids mahadevan et al 2006 in porous media they only predict however the location of the maximum salt concentration inside porous medium salt precipitation and invasion of the pore space by a gas e g air are not included in such models though continuum models provide valuable insights they cannot take into account the effect of the pore scale heterogeneity of a pore space which is of utmost importance because as already pointed out drying and salt precipitation are pore scale phenomena that are influenced strongly by pore scale heterogeneity thus one needs to develop pn models in order to study the effect of pore scale disorder on evaporation and salt precipitation once the phenomena are understood at the pn scale one can up scale the models to much larger porous media the pn models have been used extensively for decades to study various phenomena in porous media for reviews see blunt 2017 sahimi 2011 recent applications of the pns include coating of surface of paper ghassemzadeh et al 2001 ghassemzadeh and sahimi 2004 transport and separation of gaseous mixture in nanoporous membranes chen et al 2008 mourhatch et al 2010a rajabbeigi et al 2009 flow permporometry for measuring the psd of a mesoporous medium mourhatch et al 2010b and simulation of multiphase fluid flow in reservoir rock blunt 2017 blunt et al 2013 2002 piri and blunt 2005a b development of the pn model of evaporation induced salt precipitation involves simulation of the drying process slow drying of porous media is an invasion percolation ip process for a simple introduction to the ip see ebrahimi 2010 whereby the drying front invades a porous medium shaw 1987 according to the least capillary pressure that a nonwetting fluid air requires to enter a pore throat filled by saline water see below using the ip process many pns have been developed for simulating drying daian and saliba 1991 laurindo and prat 1998 metzger et al 2007 prat 1995 surasani et al 2007 yiotis et al 2001 2006 the performance of pn models of evaporation in porous media have been tested in the previous studies in our modeling we use the same approach to simulate the evaporation part of the process thus the goal of the present study is developing a pn model for evaporation brine transport and salt precipitation in porous media and presenting the results of extensive pn simulations by which we have computed the various important properties of the phenomena to our knowledge only bönhorst et al 2016 presented a pn model of precipitation of solids in porous media which is presumably applicable to salt precipitation their model differs however from what we present in this paper in their work transport of the solids is by diffusion rather than by the convection diffusion process it is known however imdakm and sahimi 1987 1991 sahimi and imdakm 1991 that if the particles are relatively large diffusion is not an effective mode of transport and the range of the particle sizes that their model is applicable for is not clear to us at the same time even if diffusion is an effective mechanism of the particles it could be so only for porous media whose pore throats are very small so that convection may be ignored or that the flow field is very slow moreover the important effect of the heterogeneity of porous media which is due to the psd and the correlations between the pore sizes is taken into account by our pn model whereas this important effect was mostly ignored in the model by bönhorst et al 2016 indeed a major aspect of salt precipitation at the pore scale is the effect of the heterogeneity the rest of this paper is organized as follows in the next section we describe the pn model the details of the models of drying and salt transport and precipitation are presented in section 3 while the computational algorithm is described in section 4 followed by the presentation and discussion of the results in section 5 the paper is summarized in section 6 2 pore network model we use a square network with a pore connectivity of 4 extension of the model to 3d is straightforward but relative to 2d networks computationally expensive and will be reported elsewhere pressure and concentration gradients in pore bodies are ignored the standard practice in many pn modelings thus each pore body is characterized by a single value of liquid or vapor concentration and pressure the calculation of which is described below as a result when we refer to the psd of the pn we mean the size distribution of the pore throats the pore throats are assumed to be cylindrical so long as the effect of thin liquid films on the internal surface of the pore throats is insignificant the assumption of cylindrical throat is accurate and has been used many times in the past in the present paper in which we are interested in precipitation of salt the thin films are indeed unimportant an important aspect of the morphology of porous media that has not been considered in the simulation of drying is the correlations between the size of the pore throats the existence of such correlations in the porosity distribution of field scale porous media was first demonstrated by hewett 1986 followed by similar work by neuman 1994 for the spatial distribution of the permeability of the same type of porous media in fact such correlations manifest themselves over multitudes of scales dashtian et al 2011 2015 mukhopadhyay and sahimi 2000 sahimi and mukhopadhyay 1996 using experiments and pn simulations knackstedt et al 2001 demonstrated that even at the core scale the computed properties of multiphase flow in porous media agree quantitatively with the experiments when such correlations are taken into account to include the effect of the correlations in the size of the throats we used a fractional brownian motion fbm that has been shown to not only represent well the distribution of the permeabilities in field scale porous media for a review see sahimi 2011 but also the correlated distribution of the throat sizes in cores knackstedt et al 1998 2000 the two point correlation function c r of a fbm is given by c r c 1 r 2 h where c 1 c r 1 and h is the hurst exponent the correlations are positive or persistent if h 1 2 and negative or anti persistent if h 1 2 in the limit h 1 2 the successive increments of a fbm are completely uncorrelated an efficient method for generating a fbm array is through its power spectrum s ω which for 2d systems is given by 1 s ω a ω x 2 ω y 2 h 1 where a is a constant while ωx and ωy are the fourier components in the x and y directions to introduce anisotropy layering in the distribution we follow ansari rad et al 2012 and generalize the power spectrum to 2 s ω b β x ω x 2 β y ω y 2 h 1 here βx and βy are the anisotropy parameters and b is a constant to generate anisotropy induced by layering with the layers being parallel to the x direction we set βx βy 1 and similarly for the layers being parallel to the y direction fig 1 presents examples of the heterogeneities generated by the model 3 pore network model and the governing equations as the evaporation proceeds the vapor brine interface advances in the pore space and salt begins to precipitate which we assume to be mainly nacl thus one must simulate both the drying and salt transport and precipitation the computations consist of two distinct parts one is simulation of the drying process by the ip algorithm the pn s top row is assumed to be a layer whose throats are initially empty and through which a gas such as air or co2 flows into the pore space while the other sides are sealed brine flows in the pore space s throats while the vapor diffuses to the boundary layer and induces further evaporation in the ip model a gas invades the brine saturated porous medium throat by throat according to the lowest capillary pressure needed for entering a throat at the interface between the vapor and liquid the capillary pressure for entering a throat of radius rij between pores i and j at the liquid vapor interface is given by 3 p c i j 2 σ r i j where σ is the surface tension each time one or a few throats are dried out by the ip algorithm we switch to the second part of the simulation namely transport of brine and precipitation of salt described below at every step of the simulation we identify the state of the pores which is determined by the filling state of the pore throats connected to them if at least one neighboring throat does not contain brine it is a vapor pore otherwise it is a liquid pore a throat can be filled fully or partially with brine or it can contain vapor that is leaving it through a path of pores and throats that are also filled by the vapor a vapor pore can be either at equilibrium or at an unknown vapor pressure to be determined in reality equilibrium vapor pressure prevails only at the menisci between brine and the vapor as shown in fig 2 but we assume that a pore is at equilibrium vapor pressure if at least one of its neighboring throats still contains brine even if it is only partially so therefore diffusion of vapor between menisci of partially filled throats and the adjoining vapor pore happens without any resistance our preliminary numerical simulation indicated that the assumption leads to slightly only about 5 percent overestimates of the drying rate but simplifies the computations greatly once the states of pores and throats are identified the second stage of the simulation namely modeling of transport of brine throughout the pn and the resulting salt precipitation begins after one or a few steps of the ip that advance the drying front we solve the governing transport equations assuming that the flow is slow enough the liquid flow rate q i j l in a throat ij that connects pores i and j is given by the hagen poiseuille equation 4 q i j l π r i j 4 8 ν l ℓ i j p i l p j l where the liquid viscosity ν l is assumed to be constant as we simulate an isothermal process here p i l is the liquid pressure in pore i and ℓ ij is the length of the throat ij yiotis et al 2001 showed that both advection and viscous effects affect the drying patterns and rates since there is no liquid accumulation in the pores we must have 5 i j ρ l q i j l 0 with ρ l being the brine s mass density the sum is over the set of the throats ij that are connected to pore i the vapor is transported by diffusion and thus we use the equation for evaporation in the so called stefan tube bird et al 2007 to calculate its mass flow rate in the throats ignoring the pressure in the vapor filled throats vapor mass conservation at the pores must hold implying that 6 i j ρ v q i j v i j s i j d v ℓ i j p m v r t ln p p i v p p j v 0 where d v is the vapor diffusion coefficient m v its molecular weight p is the total pressure in the vapor phase and ρ v is the vapor mass density we used ρ v 8 12 10 4 gr cm3 and d v 2 6 10 5 m2s 1 both corresponding to 298 k the vapor concentration at the vapor liquid interface is equal to the equilibrium concentration which is zero outside the boundary layer of the pn writing down eqs 4 6 for all the pores in the liquid and vapor phases results in two sets of equations that govern the pressures in the pores in the two phases which are solved by the conjugate gradient method the pressure at the liquid vapor interface is assumed equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure p 2339 pa at a meniscus between the brine and vapor the kelvin equation describes the dependence of parameters on the vapor pressure 7 ln p v p 2 m v σ r t r i j ρ l p c m v r t ρ l where r is the gas constant and eq 3 was used note that the dissolved salt increases the osmotic potential ψ which in turn decreases the saturation vapor pressure of the saline water battistelli et al 1997 jambhekar et al 2015 in addition capillary pressure might also lower the vapor pressure ψ can be easily computed via ψ r t ρ l ln x s where x s is the solubility limit mole fraction of salt in water one can include the effect of osmotic pressure by replacing pc in eq 7 by p c ψ jambhekar et al 2015 but the effect is believed to be small and thus we ignore it transport of salt through a porous medium is by convection and diffusion shokri 2014 the electroneutrality of brine implies that the concentration c of the salt at time t is governed by convection diffusion equation cde 8 c t d e 2 c x 2 v i j c z where vij is the mean liquid velocity in the throat ij and de is the effective diffusion coefficient in the solution numerous studies have proposed various methods for including the effect of diffusion in flow through pns imdakm and sahimi 1987 koplik et al 1988 sorbie and clifford 1991 one can simply take de to be the molecular diffusivity dm which means that the throats must be narrow enough that the concentration at any given axial position z within the throats is single valued doing so simplifies the computations alternatively one may take d e d l where dl is the taylor aris dispersion coefficient aris 1956 taylor 1953 the choice d e d l which we make in this paper entails imposing some constraints according to mehmani and balhoff 2015 dl can be used in a pn simulation if the aspect ratio a ℓ i j r i j of the throats is 10 or larger note also that it has often been assumed and there is experimental evidence sahimi 2011 that ℓ ij 1 rij given that the throats radii are typically small ℓ ij are typically large which is what we also use thus the condition for using the taylor aris dispersion is satisfied at least approximately in a throat ij dl is given by 9 d l d m r i j 2 v i j 2 48 d m one can show that the salt concentration near the liquid vapor interface is maximum guglielmini et al 2008 huinink et al 2002 thus salt precipitates mostly at the interface throats in the liquid filled pores i the net accumulation of salt at time step n is given by 10 i j s i j j i j i j v i j c i n 1 c i n δ t where j i j v i j c i d l c i z v i j c i d l c j c i ℓ i j is the mass flux in the throat ij over a time step δt if a throat contains partially the vapor that can escape i e it is connected to other pores and throats that are filled with vapor then mass balance will take the mass flow rate of the vapor in that throat into account writing the brine mass balance for each pore i yields a set of equations for the concentrations ci of the salt that we also solve by the conjugate gradient method 4 computational algorithm given the above formulations the computational algorithm is as follows i the pressure distribution in the vapor phase is computed ii the mass evaporation rate in each throat and that from the boundary layer are calculated iii the pressure distribution in the liquid phase and therefore the mean flow velocity and the local dispersion coefficient dl in each throat are computed iv the time step for advancing the vapor liquid interface by the ip algorithm is selected following hekmatzadeh et al 2016 there are two time scales in the problem one is associated with evaporation while the second one is the time scale over which one solves the cde we use the smaller of the two thus the evaporated mass from all the throats in the drying front containing liquid throats which leaves the pn is computed the throat at the interface with the lowest capillary pressure is one with the largest radius the time step for emptying that throat is given by 11 δ t ρ l v i j i j l d m i j where vij is the volume of the throat ij mij is the mass rate of evaporation and the sum is over all the throats ij that are at the drying front l d v the cde is solved in the brine part of the pn in order to compute the salt concentration in the throats vi as drying continues salt concentration in the liquid phase increases as already pointed out the solution of the cde for salt transport in porous media indicates that salt concentration at the drying front is maximum guglielmini et al 2008 huinink et al 2002 thus salt concentrations in the throats next to the drying front l d are compared with a threshold concentration for its precipitation if they exceed the threshold which we take it to be the solubility limit of salt in water at room temperature 36 percent in mass then salt precipitates in such throats note also that preliminary simulations indicated that the salt content of practically no throat away from the interface exceeds the saturation limit then the amount of precipitated salt in the throats is calculated as the difference between the current salt concentration in the throats and the saturation concentration the precipitated salt forms a porous packing of its crystals and therefore it would take some time to plug a throat completely thus the volume of the precipitated salt in each throat is calculated and subtracted from the throat s volume and its radius is updated assuming that salt precipitates uniformly depending on its size and the amount of precipitated salt the throat can either become partially or completely plugged vii the ip algorithm advances further the drying front in the pn by one or a few throats and the procedure is repeated until the evaporation rate from the boundary layer is negligible we note that recent work desarnaud et al 2014 indicated that the precipitation threshold may be as high as 1 5 times the solubility limit but this would not make any difference to the pn model as the threshold may be set at any value the pn is initially saturated with brine at 30 w nacl all the results presented below represent averages over at least 10 realizations of the pn as discussed in section 2 a fbm algorithm was used to generate 2d pns with two values of the hurst exponents h and three values of βx βy table 1 presents the numerical values of h βx βy and the mean throat size radius for each case 5 results and discussion let us first inspect the effect of the psd distribution and the correlations on the spatial distribution of the pore throats that are either filled with brine or with the vapor or are partially or completely plugged by the precipitated salt shown in fig 3 is the evolution of the phase distribution in an isotropic pn β x β y with the hurst exponent h 0 7 implying positive correlations between the sizes of the throats in particular fig 3 a corresponds to the stage in which the drying rate is essentially constant this will be discussed quantitatively shortly close to the open end the throats empty dry out at a faster rate than those deeper in the pore space since the correlations in the psd are positive the throats with similar sizes are clustered together and the drying patterns mimic the underlying connectivity of the throats this is manifested by the large clusters that are clearly visible in fig 3 moreover due to the isotropy of the pore space the drying front advances in both directions shown in fig 3 b and c next consider anisotropic stratified porous media figs 4 present the evolution of the spatial phase distribution with β x β y 1 4 so that the throats with similar sizes tend to extend orthogonal to the open end of pn as also indicated by fig 1 b thus preferential evaporation in the throats with similar sizes that are in the y direction enhances the advancement of the drying front deep into large throats while the liquid phase stays connected to the surface as a result the drying front stretches out to the bottom of the pn faster than the isotropic porous media shown in fig 3 see fig 4 b and c in the case of β x β y 4 the strata are parallel to the open end of the pn thus the throats with similar sizes cluster together and extend parallel to the open end as depicted in fig 5 b and c the drying patterns mimic the direction of the strata altogether figs 3 5 demonstrate a universal effect in that they show the strong effect of positive and extended correlations on the drying patterns and the fact the clusters of dried out throats form based on the underlying correlations salt precipitation does not however follow a universal pattern in all the three cases but looking at the throats that are partially or completely plugged in figs 3 5 it can be seen that salt tends to precipitate in neighboring throats that are parallel to the open end of the pn as reviewed comprehensively by sahimi 2011 extensive data indicate that if the correlations in porous media are of the fbm type then the corresponding hurst exponent h is often less than 0 5 implying negative correlations between the throats sizes and therefore a much more heterogeneous pore space than when h 0 5 therefore we also studied the cases in which h 0 3 with the corresponding means of the psd presented in table 1 when the correlations are negative a larger throat size is more likely to have small throats as its neighbors and vise versa the resulting evolution of the phase distributions are shown in figs 6 8 that correspond respectively to β x β y 1 1 4 and 4 comparison of these figures with their counterparts when h 0 7 demonstrates the effect of correlations and psd consider for example fig 6 and compare them with those in fig 3 whereas clustering of the throats type liquid filled vapor filled or partially or completely plugged is clearly visible in fig 3 and likewise in figs 4 and 5 the negative correlations essentially destroy such clustering effects fig 9 presents the phase distribution in a pn in which there is no correlation between the size of the throats but with the same range of throat sizes as before the differences between the evolution of the phase distribution in fig 9 with those shown in figs 3 8 for h 0 7 are evident in particular the number of clustered brine filled throats as well as isolated liquid filled throats is much higher in the case of random pn than when the morphology of the pore space is correlated we now make a quantitative comparison between the various cases whose phase distribution evolution has been described and discussed so far an important property is the brine saturation s and its evolution with the time figs 10 and 11 show the transversely averaged averaged over the x direction in figs 3 9 saturations in the same six pns of figs 3 9 computed at four times with the colors showing the range of variations over multiple realizations and the black curves indicating the averages over all the realizations as one may expect based on figs 3 8 the correlations affect the saturation distribution strongly at any given time there exist three distinct regions in fig 10 one is associated with zero saturation over a range of the distance from the open end of the porous medium the second region represents a transition zone in which 0 s 1 while in the third region the medium is fully saturated s 1 note the stronger effect of positive correlations with h 0 7 on the saturation profiles indicated by the fact that for negative correlations h 0 3 the range of variations in the saturations over multiple realizations is narrower the effect is most pronounced when the porous medium is isotropic as the advancing drying interface does not have any preferred direction to move another notable difference is the depth at which the transition zone ends i e where s 1 for example consider the time at which the liquid saturation is 40 dark blue color the depth at which the transition zone ends is 40 in units of the throats length for h 0 7 and β x β y 1 4 whereas it is 30 for β x β y 4 similar patterns exist with negative correlations as shown in fig 10 the ranking of the depth at which the transition zone ends is β x β y 4 β x β y 1 β x β y 1 4 under isothermal condition the evaporation rate depends on such driving forces as the capillary and viscous forces lehmann et al 2008 shokri and or 2011 the capillary pressure depends of course on the psd scherer 1990 discussed the difference between the capillary pressures of large and small throats that result in flow of the liquid to the surface of a porous medium keeping the evaporation close to the early stages which is called capillary pumping the evaporation rate at the open side of the porous medium connected to the boundary pores is given by 12 m v i boundary j i s i j d v l p m r t ln p p i v p p j v fig 12 compares the evolution of the evaporation rates usually called the drying curve which were computed for the six types of the pns of figs 3 8 averaged over multiple realizations of the pns and rescaled by the number of pores in the open boundary of the pns and the initial drying rate the qualitative trends of fig 12 are in complete agreement with the recent experimental data of shokri kuehni et al 2017 the results in fig 12 manifest the three main stages of drying and precipitation i the initial constant evaporation ii the relatively fast intermediate falling rate and iii the residual slow rate of evaporation the first stage is essentially independent of the morphology of porous media and is controlled by the external conditions it is visible in fig 12 as a very short period in the initial time steps evaporation in the intermediate stage is dictated by the ability of the porous medium to supply the evaporation zone with brine which in turn depends strongly on the morphology of the pore space and in particular the psd the correlations and the pore connectivity and lasts much longer than the initial stage comparing all the cases the intermediate stage with β x β y 4 and h 0 7 has the highest evaporation rate as shown in fig 12 as we discussed earlier when we described fig 4 in this case the liquid stays connected to the surface of the pore space and therefore evaporation can happen in throats near the surface evaporation from the open end of the pore space dominates drying from the throats deeper into the pore space to better understand the results consider flow of brine through the pn between two points separated by several throats if the throats sizes between the two points are positively correlated there will be smaller resistant against the flow in the pn in which the strata are parallel to the y direction fig 12 b and e the falling rate is slower and thus this stage lasts until almost the end of the process followed by fast declining the third stage emerges when the surface zone has completely dried out so that further flow of liquid through it effectively ceases there are some studies e g or et al 2013 that define the drying in two stages depending on the porous media and the evaporation condition there might be other phenomena such as sorption of water on the throats surface bakhshian and sahimi 2017 we have not included such secondary effects in the simulation because our primary interest is salt precipitation and the effect of the pore space heterogeneity on the phenomenon depending on the morphology porous medium and the chemical composition of its pores surface sorption of water might have some effect on the last stage of drying on the other hand through comprehensive experiments bergstad and shokri 2016 who studied evaporation of brine in sand grains reported drying curves and the images of the phase distributions that are comparable with what we are reporting in the present paper even though they utilized porous media with various structures another important characteristic of drying in porous media is the length ld and shape of its front fig 13 presents the time evolution of ld t in the six types of porous media of figs 3 8 it is clear that the morphology of the porous medium and in particular its correlation structure have a significant effect on ld t for example the average drying length is larger when the strata are parallel to the y direction results shown in fig 13 indicates that at practically all times ld t is larger for β x β y 1 4 that is when the strata are parallel to the y direction the physical effect of this type of morphology was already discussed one may also study the effect of the pore space morphology on salt precipitation by considering the distribution of the throats sizes that are partially or completely plugged by salt precipitation figure 14 depicts such distributions in the same six types of porous media that are shown in figs 3 8 although the shapes of the distributions are more or less similar before and after the precipitation there are also quantitative differences between the two in table 1 we also present the average throat sizes before and after salt precipitation the simulations indicate that the porosity reduction due to precipitation is around 15 which is close to what have been reported for injection of co2 in oil fields 20 percent the results shown in fig 14 should also be compared with those shown in fig 15 which presents the psds before and after salt precipitations in a completely random uncorrelated porous medium miri et al 2015 studied salt precipitation during co2 injection using a fabricated 2d pn initially saturated with brine similar to our pn the connectivity of their pn was 4 but their boundary conditions were different they injected co2 from one side and produced brine from the opposite side the rate of injection was very low with most of the water leaving the pn through evaporation despite the differences in the boundary conditions miri et al 2015 reported uniform salt precipitation in their experiments similar to what we report here experimental results reported by kim et al 2013 also share similarities with our results they used fabricated 3d pns to study drying and salt precipitation and reported formation of uniform large salt crystals away from the vapor liquid interface inside the porous medium 6 summary this paper presented a pore network model of isothermal evaporation of brine flowing in a porous medium and the resulting salt precipitation vapor diffusion in the gas phase flow of brine transport of salt and its precipitation in the pore space were all accounted for by the model the dynamic evolution of the brine saturation the evaporation rate the length of the drying front and the size distribution of the plugged or partially plugged throats were computed and studied furthermore we demonstrated the strong effect of the heterogeneity and correlations between the size of the throats on the evaporation rate and the various drying stages despite extensive experimentation the knowledge about factors that contribute to the phenomenon is still incomplete miri and hellevang 2016 the pn model provides a framework to study salt precipitation under more complex conditions than what we have considered in this paper in particular the lithology of geological formations possesses complex chemistry that affects the wettability which in turn influences not only salt precipitation but also the drying behavior or et al 2013 such effects will be included in the pn model which we hope to report in the near future acknowledgments work at usc was supported as

874,salt transport and precipitation in porous media constitute a set of complex and fascinating phenomena that are of considerable interest to several important problems ranging from storage of co2 in geological formations to soil fertility and protection of pavements and roads as well as historical monuments the phenomena occur at the pore scale and are greatly influenced by the heterogeneity of the pore space morphology we present a pore network pn model to study the phenomena vapor diffusion capillary effect at the brine vapor interface flow of brine and transport of salt and its precipitation in the pores that plug the pores partially or completely are all accounted for the drying process is modeled by the invasion percolation while transport of salt in brine is accounted for by the convective diffusion equation we demonstrate that the drying patterns the clustering and connectivity of the pore throats in which salt precipitation occurs the saturation distribution and the drying rate are all strongly dependent upon the pore size distribution the correlations among the pore sizes and the anisotropy of the pore space caused by stratification that most natural porous media contain in particular if the strata are more or less parallel to the direction of injection of the gas that dries out the pore space air for example and or causes salt precipitation co2 for example the drying rate increases significantly moreover salt tends to precipitate in clusters of neighboring pores that are parallel to the open surface of the porous medium keywords evaporation salt precipitation pore network simulation correlation 1 introduction salt precipitation in porous media occurs in numerous systems including in soil that represents a global issue affecting salinization of agricultural land nachshon et al 2011 2001 schoups et al 2005 and in geological formations that are being tested for co2 sequestration baumann et al 2014 several mechanisms contribute to salt precipitation in porous media the most important of which is drying and evaporation wicking of saline water veran tissoires and prat 2014 as well as mineral replacement and reactions that contribute to salt crystallization dashtian et al 2017 and growth in soil and rock noiriel et al 2010 salt precipitation damages porous media by reducing their porosity and permeability bacci et al 2011 causing mechanical failure schiro et al 2012 thus numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have been undertaken to understand the effect of various factors on drying of brine and salt distribution bergstad and shokri 2016 norouzi rad and shokri 2012 norouzi rad et al 2013 shokri et al 2008 shokri and or 2011 in order to develop methods for limiting the damage in particular shahidzadeh bonn et al 2010 investigated the effect of the kinetics of salt dissolution and crystallization on salt induced damage to sandstones while flatt 2002 studied the effect of salt concentration on the extent of damage to porous media salt precipitation is preceded by evaporation of saline water thus many experimental studies of brine evaporation shahraeeni et al 2012 shahraeeni and or 2010 shokri and or 2011 and precipitation of salt bergstad and shokri 2016 shokri et al 2010 2012 at the pore scale have been reported elucidating the effect on the drying rates of several factors such as the pore size distribution psd connectivity of the pore space the way pore bodies and pore throats are connected to one another and the wettability for example experiments with various psds indicate that two types of efflorescence crusty and patchy may form on the surface of porous media veran tissoires and prat 2014 that affect the evaporation rates differently thus the psd is a major component of porous medium that should be considered in modeling of drying induced salt precipitation but despite the large number of theoretical and experimental studies of salt crystallization in porous media there is still no comprehensive model and efficient numerical simulation method that can predict salt precipitation patterns in porous media at the pore scale usually referred to as subflorescence salt crystallization in a porous medium is a complex molecular scale phenomenon dashtian et al 2017 that is influenced by the thermodynamic state of the system temperature pressure and humidity and other factors such as the salt type and the morphology of the medium even repeating a given experiment in a sample porous medium undergoing salt crystallization does not guarantee the same precipitation patterns such complexities in the physics of the salt precipitation in porous media exacerbate the inherent difficulties of its modeling the goal of our study is to propose a pore network pn modeling approach that is capable of predicting the spatial distributions of brine vapor and the precipitated salt to develop a physically based pn model one must take into account the mechanism by which the precipitated salt accumulates under the right conditions na and cl ions in a solution give rise to nucleation and growth of salt crystals experimental studies by shahidzadeh bonn et al 2010 demonstrated the effect of the salt type on the extent of damage to the pore space of porous media they showed that the formation of the hydrated sodium sulfate crystals enhances the spreading power of the salt solution on the pn network of sandstone giving rise to very rapid growth of the hydrated phase of sulfate and forming clusters sodium chloride on the other hand only forms anhydrous crystals which explains why less efflorescence is observed compared to sodium sulfate shahidzadeh bonn et al 2010 did not however consider the effect of the chemistry of the pore surface of porous media or the co existence of several types of salt in our pn model we consider only the formation of subflorescence and thus we work with nacl as the salt in the study some experimental and theoretical studies indicate that salt accumulates in a very narrow layer at the soil atmosphere interface where the initial evaporation occurs after which precipitation within the pore space is limited on the other hand experimental studies of roels et al 2014 with core samples indicated that capillary driven flow does not have substantial effect on salt precipitation because of which accumulation of salt near the core surface was low their computed tomography images after drying indicated uniform salt distribution inside the core bönhorst et al 2016 reported that high evaporation rates limit transport of solids on the external surface leading to a more uniform precipitation distribution whereas low drying rates result in strong solid accumulation on the porous medium s external surface but that small throats reduce the solute transport and restrict solid accumulation on the surface one must also recognize the self enhancing of salt growth and salt transport in water films miri et al 2015 aggregated salt crystals form a microporous medium malmir et al 2016a b 2017 with a high degree of capillarity in each throat that enhances solute transport through imbibing brine over long distances but since such phenomena as the growth of salt crystals at the drying interface occur at the molecular scale dashtian et al 2017 it is not possible to include them in a pn model instead one must resort to molecular dynamics simulation dashtian et al 2017 kim et al 2013 reported on two distinct salt crystallization in synthetic porous media one was large bulky crystals that form away from the vapor liquid interface while aggregated randomly oriented crystals that form near the drying interface constituted the second type in addition experiments in circular capillary tubes have shown that salt precipitation is also affected by the boundary conditions imposed on the system when the two ends of capillary tubes are open salt crystals tend to migrate even outside the tube and form a patchy packing in closed end capillaries however salt crystallization occurs inside the tubes miri et al 2015 therefore the question of whether salt precipitates mainly on the external surface of a porous medium or more uniformly in its pore space depends on the medium s morphology the competition between convection and capillarity and the boundary conditions in the pn model that we describe below salt precipitate occurs inside the pore throats and after precipitation its crystals do not migrate from one throat to other throats at the field scale salt precipitation is also influenced by the initial spatial distributions of the porosity and permeability of a porous formation celia et al 2011 zeidouni et al 2008 several experimental studies of salt precipitation in geological formations during co2 injection have also been reported muller et al 2009 bacci et al 2011 ott et al 2011 peysson et al 2014 indicating that salt precipitation reduces permeability and porosity in berea sandstone this supports the view that in such formations crystallization occurs inside the pore throats in the pore space rather than migration to the outside surface given such insights the effect of such distributions on the efflorescence formation has also been studied veran tissoires and prat 2012 in particular sghaier et al 2014 reported on the influence of evaporation flux from the boundary on the subflorescenc e formation and growth while the effect of grain angularity was studied by norouzi rad and shokri 2014 the porous media used by sghaier et al 2014 and norouzi rad and shokri 2014 represented however isotropic medium and did not also include the correlations in the grain or pore sizes that are prevalent in natural porous media sahimi 2011 one major purpose of our study is to show the effect of pore size correlations on drying and the precipitation patterns models of evaporation and salt transport and precipitation in porous formations can be divided into two groups in one group are the thermodynamic models of salt deposition in earth s crust see for example toner et al 2015 the second groups of models contains two subgroups continuum models of fluid flow and transport guglielmini et al 2008 huinink et al 2002 those that are based on the classical averaged equations of hydrodynamics and transport belong to the first subgroup they are capable of modeling evaporation and salt precipitation at the field scale they include models for the evolution of salt crystals le et al 2009 and salt concentration in liquids mahadevan et al 2006 in porous media they only predict however the location of the maximum salt concentration inside porous medium salt precipitation and invasion of the pore space by a gas e g air are not included in such models though continuum models provide valuable insights they cannot take into account the effect of the pore scale heterogeneity of a pore space which is of utmost importance because as already pointed out drying and salt precipitation are pore scale phenomena that are influenced strongly by pore scale heterogeneity thus one needs to develop pn models in order to study the effect of pore scale disorder on evaporation and salt precipitation once the phenomena are understood at the pn scale one can up scale the models to much larger porous media the pn models have been used extensively for decades to study various phenomena in porous media for reviews see blunt 2017 sahimi 2011 recent applications of the pns include coating of surface of paper ghassemzadeh et al 2001 ghassemzadeh and sahimi 2004 transport and separation of gaseous mixture in nanoporous membranes chen et al 2008 mourhatch et al 2010a rajabbeigi et al 2009 flow permporometry for measuring the psd of a mesoporous medium mourhatch et al 2010b and simulation of multiphase fluid flow in reservoir rock blunt 2017 blunt et al 2013 2002 piri and blunt 2005a b development of the pn model of evaporation induced salt precipitation involves simulation of the drying process slow drying of porous media is an invasion percolation ip process for a simple introduction to the ip see ebrahimi 2010 whereby the drying front invades a porous medium shaw 1987 according to the least capillary pressure that a nonwetting fluid air requires to enter a pore throat filled by saline water see below using the ip process many pns have been developed for simulating drying daian and saliba 1991 laurindo and prat 1998 metzger et al 2007 prat 1995 surasani et al 2007 yiotis et al 2001 2006 the performance of pn models of evaporation in porous media have been tested in the previous studies in our modeling we use the same approach to simulate the evaporation part of the process thus the goal of the present study is developing a pn model for evaporation brine transport and salt precipitation in porous media and presenting the results of extensive pn simulations by which we have computed the various important properties of the phenomena to our knowledge only bönhorst et al 2016 presented a pn model of precipitation of solids in porous media which is presumably applicable to salt precipitation their model differs however from what we present in this paper in their work transport of the solids is by diffusion rather than by the convection diffusion process it is known however imdakm and sahimi 1987 1991 sahimi and imdakm 1991 that if the particles are relatively large diffusion is not an effective mode of transport and the range of the particle sizes that their model is applicable for is not clear to us at the same time even if diffusion is an effective mechanism of the particles it could be so only for porous media whose pore throats are very small so that convection may be ignored or that the flow field is very slow moreover the important effect of the heterogeneity of porous media which is due to the psd and the correlations between the pore sizes is taken into account by our pn model whereas this important effect was mostly ignored in the model by bönhorst et al 2016 indeed a major aspect of salt precipitation at the pore scale is the effect of the heterogeneity the rest of this paper is organized as follows in the next section we describe the pn model the details of the models of drying and salt transport and precipitation are presented in section 3 while the computational algorithm is described in section 4 followed by the presentation and discussion of the results in section 5 the paper is summarized in section 6 2 pore network model we use a square network with a pore connectivity of 4 extension of the model to 3d is straightforward but relative to 2d networks computationally expensive and will be reported elsewhere pressure and concentration gradients in pore bodies are ignored the standard practice in many pn modelings thus each pore body is characterized by a single value of liquid or vapor concentration and pressure the calculation of which is described below as a result when we refer to the psd of the pn we mean the size distribution of the pore throats the pore throats are assumed to be cylindrical so long as the effect of thin liquid films on the internal surface of the pore throats is insignificant the assumption of cylindrical throat is accurate and has been used many times in the past in the present paper in which we are interested in precipitation of salt the thin films are indeed unimportant an important aspect of the morphology of porous media that has not been considered in the simulation of drying is the correlations between the size of the pore throats the existence of such correlations in the porosity distribution of field scale porous media was first demonstrated by hewett 1986 followed by similar work by neuman 1994 for the spatial distribution of the permeability of the same type of porous media in fact such correlations manifest themselves over multitudes of scales dashtian et al 2011 2015 mukhopadhyay and sahimi 2000 sahimi and mukhopadhyay 1996 using experiments and pn simulations knackstedt et al 2001 demonstrated that even at the core scale the computed properties of multiphase flow in porous media agree quantitatively with the experiments when such correlations are taken into account to include the effect of the correlations in the size of the throats we used a fractional brownian motion fbm that has been shown to not only represent well the distribution of the permeabilities in field scale porous media for a review see sahimi 2011 but also the correlated distribution of the throat sizes in cores knackstedt et al 1998 2000 the two point correlation function c r of a fbm is given by c r c 1 r 2 h where c 1 c r 1 and h is the hurst exponent the correlations are positive or persistent if h 1 2 and negative or anti persistent if h 1 2 in the limit h 1 2 the successive increments of a fbm are completely uncorrelated an efficient method for generating a fbm array is through its power spectrum s ω which for 2d systems is given by 1 s ω a ω x 2 ω y 2 h 1 where a is a constant while ωx and ωy are the fourier components in the x and y directions to introduce anisotropy layering in the distribution we follow ansari rad et al 2012 and generalize the power spectrum to 2 s ω b β x ω x 2 β y ω y 2 h 1 here βx and βy are the anisotropy parameters and b is a constant to generate anisotropy induced by layering with the layers being parallel to the x direction we set βx βy 1 and similarly for the layers being parallel to the y direction fig 1 presents examples of the heterogeneities generated by the model 3 pore network model and the governing equations as the evaporation proceeds the vapor brine interface advances in the pore space and salt begins to precipitate which we assume to be mainly nacl thus one must simulate both the drying and salt transport and precipitation the computations consist of two distinct parts one is simulation of the drying process by the ip algorithm the pn s top row is assumed to be a layer whose throats are initially empty and through which a gas such as air or co2 flows into the pore space while the other sides are sealed brine flows in the pore space s throats while the vapor diffuses to the boundary layer and induces further evaporation in the ip model a gas invades the brine saturated porous medium throat by throat according to the lowest capillary pressure needed for entering a throat at the interface between the vapor and liquid the capillary pressure for entering a throat of radius rij between pores i and j at the liquid vapor interface is given by 3 p c i j 2 σ r i j where σ is the surface tension each time one or a few throats are dried out by the ip algorithm we switch to the second part of the simulation namely transport of brine and precipitation of salt described below at every step of the simulation we identify the state of the pores which is determined by the filling state of the pore throats connected to them if at least one neighboring throat does not contain brine it is a vapor pore otherwise it is a liquid pore a throat can be filled fully or partially with brine or it can contain vapor that is leaving it through a path of pores and throats that are also filled by the vapor a vapor pore can be either at equilibrium or at an unknown vapor pressure to be determined in reality equilibrium vapor pressure prevails only at the menisci between brine and the vapor as shown in fig 2 but we assume that a pore is at equilibrium vapor pressure if at least one of its neighboring throats still contains brine even if it is only partially so therefore diffusion of vapor between menisci of partially filled throats and the adjoining vapor pore happens without any resistance our preliminary numerical simulation indicated that the assumption leads to slightly only about 5 percent overestimates of the drying rate but simplifies the computations greatly once the states of pores and throats are identified the second stage of the simulation namely modeling of transport of brine throughout the pn and the resulting salt precipitation begins after one or a few steps of the ip that advance the drying front we solve the governing transport equations assuming that the flow is slow enough the liquid flow rate q i j l in a throat ij that connects pores i and j is given by the hagen poiseuille equation 4 q i j l π r i j 4 8 ν l ℓ i j p i l p j l where the liquid viscosity ν l is assumed to be constant as we simulate an isothermal process here p i l is the liquid pressure in pore i and ℓ ij is the length of the throat ij yiotis et al 2001 showed that both advection and viscous effects affect the drying patterns and rates since there is no liquid accumulation in the pores we must have 5 i j ρ l q i j l 0 with ρ l being the brine s mass density the sum is over the set of the throats ij that are connected to pore i the vapor is transported by diffusion and thus we use the equation for evaporation in the so called stefan tube bird et al 2007 to calculate its mass flow rate in the throats ignoring the pressure in the vapor filled throats vapor mass conservation at the pores must hold implying that 6 i j ρ v q i j v i j s i j d v ℓ i j p m v r t ln p p i v p p j v 0 where d v is the vapor diffusion coefficient m v its molecular weight p is the total pressure in the vapor phase and ρ v is the vapor mass density we used ρ v 8 12 10 4 gr cm3 and d v 2 6 10 5 m2s 1 both corresponding to 298 k the vapor concentration at the vapor liquid interface is equal to the equilibrium concentration which is zero outside the boundary layer of the pn writing down eqs 4 6 for all the pores in the liquid and vapor phases results in two sets of equations that govern the pressures in the pores in the two phases which are solved by the conjugate gradient method the pressure at the liquid vapor interface is assumed equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure p 2339 pa at a meniscus between the brine and vapor the kelvin equation describes the dependence of parameters on the vapor pressure 7 ln p v p 2 m v σ r t r i j ρ l p c m v r t ρ l where r is the gas constant and eq 3 was used note that the dissolved salt increases the osmotic potential ψ which in turn decreases the saturation vapor pressure of the saline water battistelli et al 1997 jambhekar et al 2015 in addition capillary pressure might also lower the vapor pressure ψ can be easily computed via ψ r t ρ l ln x s where x s is the solubility limit mole fraction of salt in water one can include the effect of osmotic pressure by replacing pc in eq 7 by p c ψ jambhekar et al 2015 but the effect is believed to be small and thus we ignore it transport of salt through a porous medium is by convection and diffusion shokri 2014 the electroneutrality of brine implies that the concentration c of the salt at time t is governed by convection diffusion equation cde 8 c t d e 2 c x 2 v i j c z where vij is the mean liquid velocity in the throat ij and de is the effective diffusion coefficient in the solution numerous studies have proposed various methods for including the effect of diffusion in flow through pns imdakm and sahimi 1987 koplik et al 1988 sorbie and clifford 1991 one can simply take de to be the molecular diffusivity dm which means that the throats must be narrow enough that the concentration at any given axial position z within the throats is single valued doing so simplifies the computations alternatively one may take d e d l where dl is the taylor aris dispersion coefficient aris 1956 taylor 1953 the choice d e d l which we make in this paper entails imposing some constraints according to mehmani and balhoff 2015 dl can be used in a pn simulation if the aspect ratio a ℓ i j r i j of the throats is 10 or larger note also that it has often been assumed and there is experimental evidence sahimi 2011 that ℓ ij 1 rij given that the throats radii are typically small ℓ ij are typically large which is what we also use thus the condition for using the taylor aris dispersion is satisfied at least approximately in a throat ij dl is given by 9 d l d m r i j 2 v i j 2 48 d m one can show that the salt concentration near the liquid vapor interface is maximum guglielmini et al 2008 huinink et al 2002 thus salt precipitates mostly at the interface throats in the liquid filled pores i the net accumulation of salt at time step n is given by 10 i j s i j j i j i j v i j c i n 1 c i n δ t where j i j v i j c i d l c i z v i j c i d l c j c i ℓ i j is the mass flux in the throat ij over a time step δt if a throat contains partially the vapor that can escape i e it is connected to other pores and throats that are filled with vapor then mass balance will take the mass flow rate of the vapor in that throat into account writing the brine mass balance for each pore i yields a set of equations for the concentrations ci of the salt that we also solve by the conjugate gradient method 4 computational algorithm given the above formulations the computational algorithm is as follows i the pressure distribution in the vapor phase is computed ii the mass evaporation rate in each throat and that from the boundary layer are calculated iii the pressure distribution in the liquid phase and therefore the mean flow velocity and the local dispersion coefficient dl in each throat are computed iv the time step for advancing the vapor liquid interface by the ip algorithm is selected following hekmatzadeh et al 2016 there are two time scales in the problem one is associated with evaporation while the second one is the time scale over which one solves the cde we use the smaller of the two thus the evaporated mass from all the throats in the drying front containing liquid throats which leaves the pn is computed the throat at the interface with the lowest capillary pressure is one with the largest radius the time step for emptying that throat is given by 11 δ t ρ l v i j i j l d m i j where vij is the volume of the throat ij mij is the mass rate of evaporation and the sum is over all the throats ij that are at the drying front l d v the cde is solved in the brine part of the pn in order to compute the salt concentration in the throats vi as drying continues salt concentration in the liquid phase increases as already pointed out the solution of the cde for salt transport in porous media indicates that salt concentration at the drying front is maximum guglielmini et al 2008 huinink et al 2002 thus salt concentrations in the throats next to the drying front l d are compared with a threshold concentration for its precipitation if they exceed the threshold which we take it to be the solubility limit of salt in water at room temperature 36 percent in mass then salt precipitates in such throats note also that preliminary simulations indicated that the salt content of practically no throat away from the interface exceeds the saturation limit then the amount of precipitated salt in the throats is calculated as the difference between the current salt concentration in the throats and the saturation concentration the precipitated salt forms a porous packing of its crystals and therefore it would take some time to plug a throat completely thus the volume of the precipitated salt in each throat is calculated and subtracted from the throat s volume and its radius is updated assuming that salt precipitates uniformly depending on its size and the amount of precipitated salt the throat can either become partially or completely plugged vii the ip algorithm advances further the drying front in the pn by one or a few throats and the procedure is repeated until the evaporation rate from the boundary layer is negligible we note that recent work desarnaud et al 2014 indicated that the precipitation threshold may be as high as 1 5 times the solubility limit but this would not make any difference to the pn model as the threshold may be set at any value the pn is initially saturated with brine at 30 w nacl all the results presented below represent averages over at least 10 realizations of the pn as discussed in section 2 a fbm algorithm was used to generate 2d pns with two values of the hurst exponents h and three values of βx βy table 1 presents the numerical values of h βx βy and the mean throat size radius for each case 5 results and discussion let us first inspect the effect of the psd distribution and the correlations on the spatial distribution of the pore throats that are either filled with brine or with the vapor or are partially or completely plugged by the precipitated salt shown in fig 3 is the evolution of the phase distribution in an isotropic pn β x β y with the hurst exponent h 0 7 implying positive correlations between the sizes of the throats in particular fig 3 a corresponds to the stage in which the drying rate is essentially constant this will be discussed quantitatively shortly close to the open end the throats empty dry out at a faster rate than those deeper in the pore space since the correlations in the psd are positive the throats with similar sizes are clustered together and the drying patterns mimic the underlying connectivity of the throats this is manifested by the large clusters that are clearly visible in fig 3 moreover due to the isotropy of the pore space the drying front advances in both directions shown in fig 3 b and c next consider anisotropic stratified porous media figs 4 present the evolution of the spatial phase distribution with β x β y 1 4 so that the throats with similar sizes tend to extend orthogonal to the open end of pn as also indicated by fig 1 b thus preferential evaporation in the throats with similar sizes that are in the y direction enhances the advancement of the drying front deep into large throats while the liquid phase stays connected to the surface as a result the drying front stretches out to the bottom of the pn faster than the isotropic porous media shown in fig 3 see fig 4 b and c in the case of β x β y 4 the strata are parallel to the open end of the pn thus the throats with similar sizes cluster together and extend parallel to the open end as depicted in fig 5 b and c the drying patterns mimic the direction of the strata altogether figs 3 5 demonstrate a universal effect in that they show the strong effect of positive and extended correlations on the drying patterns and the fact the clusters of dried out throats form based on the underlying correlations salt precipitation does not however follow a universal pattern in all the three cases but looking at the throats that are partially or completely plugged in figs 3 5 it can be seen that salt tends to precipitate in neighboring throats that are parallel to the open end of the pn as reviewed comprehensively by sahimi 2011 extensive data indicate that if the correlations in porous media are of the fbm type then the corresponding hurst exponent h is often less than 0 5 implying negative correlations between the throats sizes and therefore a much more heterogeneous pore space than when h 0 5 therefore we also studied the cases in which h 0 3 with the corresponding means of the psd presented in table 1 when the correlations are negative a larger throat size is more likely to have small throats as its neighbors and vise versa the resulting evolution of the phase distributions are shown in figs 6 8 that correspond respectively to β x β y 1 1 4 and 4 comparison of these figures with their counterparts when h 0 7 demonstrates the effect of correlations and psd consider for example fig 6 and compare them with those in fig 3 whereas clustering of the throats type liquid filled vapor filled or partially or completely plugged is clearly visible in fig 3 and likewise in figs 4 and 5 the negative correlations essentially destroy such clustering effects fig 9 presents the phase distribution in a pn in which there is no correlation between the size of the throats but with the same range of throat sizes as before the differences between the evolution of the phase distribution in fig 9 with those shown in figs 3 8 for h 0 7 are evident in particular the number of clustered brine filled throats as well as isolated liquid filled throats is much higher in the case of random pn than when the morphology of the pore space is correlated we now make a quantitative comparison between the various cases whose phase distribution evolution has been described and discussed so far an important property is the brine saturation s and its evolution with the time figs 10 and 11 show the transversely averaged averaged over the x direction in figs 3 9 saturations in the same six pns of figs 3 9 computed at four times with the colors showing the range of variations over multiple realizations and the black curves indicating the averages over all the realizations as one may expect based on figs 3 8 the correlations affect the saturation distribution strongly at any given time there exist three distinct regions in fig 10 one is associated with zero saturation over a range of the distance from the open end of the porous medium the second region represents a transition zone in which 0 s 1 while in the third region the medium is fully saturated s 1 note the stronger effect of positive correlations with h 0 7 on the saturation profiles indicated by the fact that for negative correlations h 0 3 the range of variations in the saturations over multiple realizations is narrower the effect is most pronounced when the porous medium is isotropic as the advancing drying interface does not have any preferred direction to move another notable difference is the depth at which the transition zone ends i e where s 1 for example consider the time at which the liquid saturation is 40 dark blue color the depth at which the transition zone ends is 40 in units of the throats length for h 0 7 and β x β y 1 4 whereas it is 30 for β x β y 4 similar patterns exist with negative correlations as shown in fig 10 the ranking of the depth at which the transition zone ends is β x β y 4 β x β y 1 β x β y 1 4 under isothermal condition the evaporation rate depends on such driving forces as the capillary and viscous forces lehmann et al 2008 shokri and or 2011 the capillary pressure depends of course on the psd scherer 1990 discussed the difference between the capillary pressures of large and small throats that result in flow of the liquid to the surface of a porous medium keeping the evaporation close to the early stages which is called capillary pumping the evaporation rate at the open side of the porous medium connected to the boundary pores is given by 12 m v i boundary j i s i j d v l p m r t ln p p i v p p j v fig 12 compares the evolution of the evaporation rates usually called the drying curve which were computed for the six types of the pns of figs 3 8 averaged over multiple realizations of the pns and rescaled by the number of pores in the open boundary of the pns and the initial drying rate the qualitative trends of fig 12 are in complete agreement with the recent experimental data of shokri kuehni et al 2017 the results in fig 12 manifest the three main stages of drying and precipitation i the initial constant evaporation ii the relatively fast intermediate falling rate and iii the residual slow rate of evaporation the first stage is essentially independent of the morphology of porous media and is controlled by the external conditions it is visible in fig 12 as a very short period in the initial time steps evaporation in the intermediate stage is dictated by the ability of the porous medium to supply the evaporation zone with brine which in turn depends strongly on the morphology of the pore space and in particular the psd the correlations and the pore connectivity and lasts much longer than the initial stage comparing all the cases the intermediate stage with β x β y 4 and h 0 7 has the highest evaporation rate as shown in fig 12 as we discussed earlier when we described fig 4 in this case the liquid stays connected to the surface of the pore space and therefore evaporation can happen in throats near the surface evaporation from the open end of the pore space dominates drying from the throats deeper into the pore space to better understand the results consider flow of brine through the pn between two points separated by several throats if the throats sizes between the two points are positively correlated there will be smaller resistant against the flow in the pn in which the strata are parallel to the y direction fig 12 b and e the falling rate is slower and thus this stage lasts until almost the end of the process followed by fast declining the third stage emerges when the surface zone has completely dried out so that further flow of liquid through it effectively ceases there are some studies e g or et al 2013 that define the drying in two stages depending on the porous media and the evaporation condition there might be other phenomena such as sorption of water on the throats surface bakhshian and sahimi 2017 we have not included such secondary effects in the simulation because our primary interest is salt precipitation and the effect of the pore space heterogeneity on the phenomenon depending on the morphology porous medium and the chemical composition of its pores surface sorption of water might have some effect on the last stage of drying on the other hand through comprehensive experiments bergstad and shokri 2016 who studied evaporation of brine in sand grains reported drying curves and the images of the phase distributions that are comparable with what we are reporting in the present paper even though they utilized porous media with various structures another important characteristic of drying in porous media is the length ld and shape of its front fig 13 presents the time evolution of ld t in the six types of porous media of figs 3 8 it is clear that the morphology of the porous medium and in particular its correlation structure have a significant effect on ld t for example the average drying length is larger when the strata are parallel to the y direction results shown in fig 13 indicates that at practically all times ld t is larger for β x β y 1 4 that is when the strata are parallel to the y direction the physical effect of this type of morphology was already discussed one may also study the effect of the pore space morphology on salt precipitation by considering the distribution of the throats sizes that are partially or completely plugged by salt precipitation figure 14 depicts such distributions in the same six types of porous media that are shown in figs 3 8 although the shapes of the distributions are more or less similar before and after the precipitation there are also quantitative differences between the two in table 1 we also present the average throat sizes before and after salt precipitation the simulations indicate that the porosity reduction due to precipitation is around 15 which is close to what have been reported for injection of co2 in oil fields 20 percent the results shown in fig 14 should also be compared with those shown in fig 15 which presents the psds before and after salt precipitations in a completely random uncorrelated porous medium miri et al 2015 studied salt precipitation during co2 injection using a fabricated 2d pn initially saturated with brine similar to our pn the connectivity of their pn was 4 but their boundary conditions were different they injected co2 from one side and produced brine from the opposite side the rate of injection was very low with most of the water leaving the pn through evaporation despite the differences in the boundary conditions miri et al 2015 reported uniform salt precipitation in their experiments similar to what we report here experimental results reported by kim et al 2013 also share similarities with our results they used fabricated 3d pns to study drying and salt precipitation and reported formation of uniform large salt crystals away from the vapor liquid interface inside the porous medium 6 summary this paper presented a pore network model of isothermal evaporation of brine flowing in a porous medium and the resulting salt precipitation vapor diffusion in the gas phase flow of brine transport of salt and its precipitation in the pore space were all accounted for by the model the dynamic evolution of the brine saturation the evaporation rate the length of the drying front and the size distribution of the plugged or partially plugged throats were computed and studied furthermore we demonstrated the strong effect of the heterogeneity and correlations between the size of the throats on the evaporation rate and the various drying stages despite extensive experimentation the knowledge about factors that contribute to the phenomenon is still incomplete miri and hellevang 2016 the pn model provides a framework to study salt precipitation under more complex conditions than what we have considered in this paper in particular the lithology of geological formations possesses complex chemistry that affects the wettability which in turn influences not only salt precipitation but also the drying behavior or et al 2013 such effects will be included in the pn model which we hope to report in the near future acknowledgments work at usc was supported as
