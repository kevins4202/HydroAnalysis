europe and north america are eutrophic bhagowati and ahamad 2019 cyanobacterial blooms usually appear in surface water during warm seasons when water temperature is 20 30 c yang et al 2020 and when the total nitrogen and phosphorus are higher than 300 ug l and 20 ug l respectively li et al 2022 cyanobacterial blooms result in dissolved oxygen decrease toxin increase and water quality deterioration threatening the ecosystem function and drinking water safety wu et al 2009 generally in subtropical warm temperate monsoon climate zones spring and summer are seasons with high cyanobacterial bloom occurrence however they rarely occur in autumn though the temperature is also appropriate and disappear in winter yao et al 2020 seasonal characteristics imply that temperature change is critical for cyanobacterial blooms for example taihu a large shallow lake in china suffers cyanobacterial blooms when the temperature is 20 c most cyanobacteria disappear in 10 c conditions and the surviving cells sink into the sediment for hibernation cao et al 2022 visser et al 2016 in addition abrupt temperature drop in summer can temporarily decrease cyanobacteria abundance but they rapidly recover and become the dominant species in planktons layden et al 2022 luo et al 2022 based on these phenomena we hypothesize that low temperature is probably involved in inducing cyanobacterial bloom and plays a critical role in blooms outbreak temperature is a major seasonal cue that affects plants and cyanobacteria s growth in some plants flowering will be promoted in the following spring when briefly exposed to cold 0 15 c a process called vernalization ding et al 2020 for example during arabidopsis vernalization cold stress represses flowering locus c flc transcription a key floral repressor gene flowering was accelerated by alteration of flc chromatin protein structure which switched the chromatin state from on to off and remained silent under subsequent warm condition mylne et al 2006 xu et al 2022 phytoplankton species that overwintered in the previous fall were found to initiate spring blooms in a temperate lake ferreira et al 2021 yang et al 2016 and the growth rate of surviving species rapidly resumed as before in a few days fang and sommer 2017 mignot et al 2018 these phenomena implied that vernalization also probably occurs in cyanobacteria inducing blooms however cyanobacteria are different from plants they are not algae eukaryotic phototrophs but photosynthetic bacteria that utilize sunlight to convert carbon dioxide to biomass and produce oxygen huisman et al 2018 vernalization accelerates the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive development in plants however because cyanobacteria cells reproduce by binary fission amasino 2005 vernalization might trigger cyanobacteria growth via different pathways the low temperature period is key in vernalization seasonal cues and cold fronts generally cause cyclical variation of blooms in eutrophic lakes however the mechanism of response and regulation during cyanobacteria vernalization has yet to be explored it has been reported that temperature affects microcystis photosynthetic activity gene expression and growth yang et al 2020 moreover low temperature stress increases reactive oxygen species ros resulting in membrane damage and cellular inactivation yang et al 2020 under abiotic stress such as temperature change bacteria regulate cell growth metabolism and group behaviors via a signaling system to relieve and adapt to adverse environments agostoni et al 2018 for example low temperature 4 12 c triggered the two component systems tcs of synechocystis prakash et al 2013 which utilized histidine kinases and his to asp phosphorelay to sense temperature stress and upregulated cor15a genes expression for cold acclimation browse and xin 2001 recently it was found that microcystis produces acylated homoserine lactones ahls which are possibly involved in cell growth and aggregation via a quorum sensing system zhai et al 2012 these findings suggest that the signaling system is possibly responsible for sensing temperature changes and regulating cellular response during cyanobacteria vernalization vernalization is known to accelerate the flowering process in plant and might play an important but neglected role in cyanobacterial blooms this study explored cyanobacteria vernalization and its signaling regulation mechanism the cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa was exposed to cold stress at 4 c and 10 c

construct the network figures 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of harsh temperature on microbial synthesis 3 1 1 cell density profiles we observed low temperature induced over compensatory growth of m aeruginosa in the vernalization period compared with control 28 c m aeruginosa growth rate increased by 27 3 and 35 4 for 10 c and 4 c samples respectively fig 1 a in addition their maximum cell density was 23 2 and 33 2 higher than the control overall the enhancement was stronger for the 4 c protocols nitrogen and phosphorus consumption is consistent with the growth fig s1 it has been reported that at low temperature chlamydomonas rheinissima increased nucleoli and chloroplast density and cell size but inhibited cell division ermilova 2020 in this way chlamydomonas survive in winter and are prepared to bloom in the following spring and the overwintering microalgae dominate the phytoplankton and initiate blooms yang et al 2016 3 1 2 pigments chlorophyll and carotenoid are important pigments in the m aeruginosa photosystem chlorophyll captures light energy targeting red light and converting it into chemical energy yuan et al 2021 carotenoid absorbs blue light scavenge free radicals and protect against photooxidation gao et al 2020 in the experimental protocols chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents were higher than control after day 18 and day 24 respectively fig 1b during the vernalization period chlorophyll a increased by 40 and carotenoid increased by 31 confirming m aeruginosa growth furthermore the low temperature shock enhanced the biosynthetic ability of m aeruginosa for photosynthetic pigments during vernalization fig s2 the chlorophyll a to carotenoid ratio an important index for photosynthesis wong et al 2020 was 27 4 c and 28 10 c higher in vernalized protocols than in control table s1 indicating that photosynthesis was enhanced vernalization benefited the synthesis of key photosynthetic pigments in cyanobacteria improving the light energy capture and avoiding photooxidation damage consequently cyanobacteria rapidly grew when recovered to a suitable temperature after low temperature treatment 3 2 effects of harsh temperature on water deterioration 3 2 1 soluble microbial products smps in culture were monitored to evaluate the vernalization effects on water deterioration m aeruginosa produced more smps after low temperature treatment the maximum smps concentration was 74 07 mg l 4 c protocol on day 24 about 59 higher than the control furthermore the 4 c protocol had higher content than 10 c fig 2 a during the entire vernalization period smps increased the most on day 18 increasing by 109 5 and 44 5 for 4 c and 10 c respectively after that the differences between experimental and control protocols gradually decreased polysaccharides are the main smps component with a ratio of about 48 83 polysaccharide content in control showed an overall increasing trend with time moreover the increase in polysaccharides in the vernalized protocols was significantly higher than in the control increased up to 128 during the early period and then gradually decreased to lower levels than the control fig 2b it has been reported that m aeruginosa probably utilizes easily degradable organic matter such as glucose acetate pyruvate and α ketoglutarate to heterotrophically grow in darkness or adverse environments elayouty and abdelrahman 1996 kong et al 2019 vernalization enhanced the heterotrophic growth and contributed to the polysaccharide decrease in the later cultivation period in natural water the dissolved organic matter especially the easily degradable components results in the proliferating heterotrophic bacteria and reduced dissolved oxygen protein and humic substances increased with cultivation and their concentration in vernalized protocols was generally higher than in the control fig 2c d the protein and humic substances content of in the 4 c protocol nearly doubled that of control reaching about 17 mg l and 20 mg l on day 36 respectively vernalization stimulated m aeruginosa to release more polysaccharides proteins and humic substances possibly due to the cell permeability change or metabolism activities bai et al 2020 to further analyze the composition of dissolved organic matters related to m aeruginosa the eem spectra were examined accompanying cell growth the soluble microbial byproduct like region i and humic acid like region ii substances increased in culture fig s3 tryptophan and protein like substances peak a were the main components followed by humic acid like substances peak b chen et al 2003 and vernalization substantially enhanced their production because these components are not easily degraded byproducts they persist and accumulate in water for a long time and their slow decomposition prolongs the water deterioration period hua et al 2021 even worse if the water is used as a drinking water source the natural organic matters released by bloom microalgae are potentially converted into hazardous disinfection byproducts and increasing human health risks pal et al 2020 3 2 2 microcystin microcystin synthesized by m aeruginosa is the most widely spread toxin in bloom water due to its hepatotoxicity and stability microcystin has become a high profile index in water and the world health organization proposed a 1 ng ml microcystin limit for drinking water cotruvo 2020 although the total microcystin content had no fundamental change during the cultivation period in vernalized protocols was slightly lower than in the control fig 3 a moreover the extra to intra cellular microcystin ratio decreased from 0 96 to 1 17 to 0 53 0 63 with m aeruginosa growth table s2 suggesting a gradual reduction of microcystin release from the cell to water the microcystin in water achieved the highest level 14 38 ng ml in the initial stage about 14 fold higher than the safety limit the microcystin concentration was similar to other reports for m aeruginosa cultivation wu et al 2021 the normalized results of microcystin production showed that m aeruginosa synthesized and released more microcystin in the initial cultivation and then gradually decreased over time its content was about 2 3 fold higher than in the later period fig 3b during inoculation m aeruginosa cell density changed from high to low consequently in the initial cultivation m aeruginosa adapted to the low density environment it has been reported that m aeruginosa synthesizes and secretes microcystin to improve its environmental adaptability through signaling regulation liu and sun 2015 makower et al 2015 the vernalized protocols produced less microcystin than the control indicating that low temperature treatment and vernalization progress possibly bestowed better adaptability on m aeruginosa kamran et al 2014 3 3 metabolic regulations 3 3 1 photosynthesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and dna replication the important pathways related to growth metabolism and their expression of upregulated genes were compared m aeruginosa takes in co2 through photosynthesis and converts light energy to chemical energy in cells zhao et al 2019 in the thylakoid membrane most photosystem i psi and photosystem ii psii genes were upregulated specifically the mae 56270 mae 56280 and mae 59230 increased 2 5 fold fig s4 cytb6 the key complex of the electron transport chain from psii to psi avenson et al 2005 was highly expressed fig 4 atp synthase was also highly expressed fig 4 therefore vernalization promoted m aeruginosa photosynthesis in the light independent reactions psii co2 is converted into glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate gap by the calvin cycle consuming the atp and nadph from psi carere et al 2008 the gap further generated glucose and other carbohydrates jia et al 2013 glycolysis is an important pathway to utilize glucose which is degraded to pyruvate and further oxidized to acetyl coa by pyruvate dehydrogenase then acetyl coa enters the tca cycle which is involved in the citric acid synthesis vernalization upregulated pk and pdh key enzymes for pyruvate and acetyl coa production in glycolysis and upregulated cs aco2 idh succinyl coa synthase sdh and mdh in the tca cycle most energy is produced in glycolysis and the tca cycle stored it in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh which then generates atp in oxidative phosphorylation oxidative phosphorylation enzymes were upregulated and atp production was enhanced in vernalized m aeruginosa the atp content was 36 higher than in the control fig s5 furthermore dna replication helicase polymerase and ligase were highly expressed fig 4 fig s4 promoting cell division and proliferation pandey and patel 2014 spadari et al 1989 vernalization endowed m aeruginosa with more active metabolisms of substance and energy resulting in the rapid increase of their cells in cyanobacterial bloom 3 3 2 antioxidant system mda is the common membrane lipid peroxidation index produced by cells in an adverse environment djordjevic et al 2020 m aeruginosa mda content increased 8 and 3 fold after the 4 c and 10 c treatments respectively fig 5 a it suggested that the harsh temperature caused oxidative damage in cells and 4 c had the most severe oxidative damage fortunately the antioxidant enzymes sod cat and pod in m aeruginosa can scavenge reactive oxygen species ross and improve the antioxidant defense ni et al 2013 sod was the most important antioxidant enzyme of m aeruginosa at the harsh temperature and its activity was about 9 21 times that of cat and 22 48 times that of pod at day 0 fig 5b d in the initial vernalization period the activity of antioxidant enzymes was much higher than control facilitating the rapid scavenging of ross produced at low temperatures with the action of sod o2 is converted into h2o2 and then further reduced to h2o by cat and pod asayama et al 2003 the level of antioxidant enzymes gradually decreased as ross scavenged and stress disappeared in m aeruginosa consequently the mda content was also reduced approaching control levels while the content in control showed no observed differences through time the self regulation of the antioxidant system provided m aeruginosa with a good environment adaptiveness in low temperatures accumulated ross damaged cell membranes also triggered the calcium signaling pathway to stimulate antioxidant enzymes for scavenging free radicals fig 6 a in addition vernalization upregulated the des gene promoting polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis consequently the membrane fluidity increased and permeability improved braun et al 2007 dennis and peacock 2009 cell permeability is involved in nutrient uptake and metabolites efflux bokhari et al 2014 stebegg et al 2019 slightly high permeability benefited m aeruginosa s nutrient intake and rapid growth in vernalization contributing to the release of intracellular metabolites except for the cell membrane the cell wall is possibly involved in exporting microbial products fig 6b m aeruginosa has a multi layer structure including surface layers outer membrane peptidoglycan and cytoplasmic membrane rajasekhar et al 2012 the microbial products must cross the cell wall to be released into the environment peptidoglycan is the primary cell wall component for m aeruginosa and plays an important role in maintaining cell morphology and cell protection do et al 2020 eleven key enzymes mura murb murc murd mure ddl murg mrca b mrda pbpb and 3 4 16 4 of the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway were downregulated in vernalization fig 6c reducing mechanical strength and increasing cell permeability mishra et al 2005 mura and murb catalyze the formation of udp murnac murc d and e ligases are in charge of appending amino acids dowson et al 2022 murg is one of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic membrane enzymes that transfer a glcnac to lipid i c55 pp murnac pentapeptide and form lipid ii c55 pp murnac pentapeptide glcnac oluwole et al 2022 the downregulation of these enzymes probably promoted the release of microbial products from the intracell to the environment structurally m aeruginosa cell size in the growth term was smaller than the initial inoculum in addition the vernalized cells were coated with more extracellular polymeric substances fig s6a in ultrastructure pictures vernalized cells showed some folds at their surface and the cell wall became concave and thinner fig s6b these results indicated that vernalization regulated m aeruginosa s permeability and increased the release of smps in water 3 4 vernalization triggered signaling pathways quorum sensing and the two component system are important signaling regulators in gram negative bacteria lim et al 2022 vernalization induced significant upregulation of 96 genes including quorum sensing two component system photosynthesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and dna replication genes fig s7 moreover the network analysis showed close connections between signaling pathways and metabolic processes photosynthesis is the leading resource of organics in m aeruginosa cui et al 2013 and 42 7 of the significantly upregulated were related to photosynthesis the correlation between photosynthesis and the two component system was greater than quorum sensing these results indicated that the two component system played a much more important role in regulating m aeruginosa metabolisms during vernalization the low temperature stress and recovery triggered the quorum sensing and two component system of m aeruginosa regulating metabolic process cell growth and smps secretion via signal transduction pathways fig 7 a sec dpp and transporter were upregulated in the quorum sensing signaling pathway of vernalized m aeruginosa cph1 rcp1 nb1s rpab epsp des and dnaa in the two component system were also upregulated their genes expression is shown in the heatmap fig 7b of which mae 12270 corresponding to cph1 was notably upregulated for 10 c and 4 c protocols compared with control the upregulation of nbls rpab and dnaa promoted photosynthesis energy transfer and dna replication kato et al 2011 moreover histidine kinase cph1 and response regulator rcp1 in the two component system pathway and dpp in the quorum sensing pathway were upregulated stimulating cell growth and proliferation yi et al 2019 the high expression of epsp promoted the soluble microbial products synthesis the upregulation of des sec and the transporter enhanced the membrane permeability and the secretory system braun et al 2007 therefore more smps were easily released into the environment 4 conclusions vernalization greatly contributes to cyanobacterial bloom the harsh temperatures 4 c and 10 c stimulated the m aeruginosa growth the growth rate and the maximum cell density increased by 35 4 and 33 2 respectively meanwhile vernalization notably promoted smps synthesis by 109 5 furthermore it exacerbated water deterioration with polysaccharides being the main increasing component initially and tryptophan proteins and humic substances becoming the primary increasing substances later vernalization promotes cell growth by upregulating the gene expression of enzymes related to photosynthesis atp production tca cycle and dna replication although the antioxidant capability of m aeruginosa increased in vernalization oxidative damage caused peptidoglycan synthesis inhibition and membrane permeability increase resulting in more smps being released the temperature change in vernalization triggered the m aeruginosa signal transduction pathways while quorum sensing and the two component system regulated cell growth and metabolism this study found that vernalization increased the risk of cyanobacteria growth and water deterioration providing new insights into the mechanism of seasonal cyanobacterial bloom

construct the network figures 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of harsh temperature on microbial synthesis 3 1 1 cell density profiles we observed low temperature induced over compensatory growth of m aeruginosa in the vernalization period compared with control 28 c m aeruginosa growth rate increased by 27 3 and 35 4 for 10 c and 4 c samples respectively fig 1 a in addition their maximum cell density was 23 2 and 33 2 higher than the control overall the enhancement was stronger for the 4 c protocols nitrogen and phosphorus consumption is consistent with the growth fig s1 it has been reported that at low temperature chlamydomonas rheinissima increased nucleoli and chloroplast density and cell size but inhibited cell division ermilova 2020 in this way chlamydomonas survive in winter and are prepared to bloom in the following spring and the overwintering microalgae dominate the phytoplankton and initiate blooms yang et al 2016 3 1 2 pigments chlorophyll and carotenoid are important pigments in the m aeruginosa photosystem chlorophyll captures light energy targeting red light and converting it into chemical energy yuan et al 2021 carotenoid absorbs blue light scavenge free radicals and protect against photooxidation gao et al 2020 in the experimental protocols chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents were higher than control after day 18 and day 24 respectively fig 1b during the vernalization period chlorophyll a increased by 40 and carotenoid increased by 31 confirming m aeruginosa growth furthermore the low temperature shock enhanced the biosynthetic ability of m aeruginosa for photosynthetic pigments during vernalization fig s2 the chlorophyll a to carotenoid ratio an important index for photosynthesis wong et al 2020 was 27 4 c and 28 10 c higher in vernalized protocols than in control table s1 indicating that photosynthesis was enhanced vernalization benefited the synthesis of key photosynthetic pigments in cyanobacteria improving the light energy capture and avoiding photooxidation damage consequently cyanobacteria rapidly grew when recovered to a suitable temperature after low temperature treatment 3 2 effects of harsh temperature on water deterioration 3 2 1 soluble microbial products smps in culture were monitored to evaluate the vernalization effects on water deterioration m aeruginosa produced more smps after low temperature treatment the maximum smps concentration was 74 07 mg l 4 c protocol on day 24 about 59 higher than the control furthermore the 4 c protocol had higher content than 10 c fig 2 a during the entire vernalization period smps increased the most on day 18 increasing by 109 5 and 44 5 for 4 c and 10 c respectively after that the differences between experimental and control protocols gradually decreased polysaccharides are the main smps component with a ratio of about 48 83 polysaccharide content in control showed an overall increasing trend with time moreover the increase in polysaccharides in the vernalized protocols was significantly higher than in the control increased up to 128 during the early period and then gradually decreased to lower levels than the control fig 2b it has been reported that m aeruginosa probably utilizes easily degradable organic matter such as glucose acetate pyruvate and α ketoglutarate to heterotrophically grow in darkness or adverse environments elayouty and abdelrahman 1996 kong et al 2019 vernalization enhanced the heterotrophic growth and contributed to the polysaccharide decrease in the later cultivation period in natural water the dissolved organic matter especially the easily degradable components results in the proliferating heterotrophic bacteria and reduced dissolved oxygen protein and humic substances increased with cultivation and their concentration in vernalized protocols was generally higher than in the control fig 2c d the protein and humic substances content of in the 4 c protocol nearly doubled that of control reaching about 17 mg l and 20 mg l on day 36 respectively vernalization stimulated m aeruginosa to release more polysaccharides proteins and humic substances possibly due to the cell permeability change or metabolism activities bai et al 2020 to further analyze the composition of dissolved organic matters related to m aeruginosa the eem spectra were examined accompanying cell growth the soluble microbial byproduct like region i and humic acid like region ii substances increased in culture fig s3 tryptophan and protein like substances peak a were the main components followed by humic acid like substances peak b chen et al 2003 and vernalization substantially enhanced their production because these components are not easily degraded byproducts they persist and accumulate in water for a long time and their slow decomposition prolongs the water deterioration period hua et al 2021 even worse if the water is used as a drinking water source the natural organic matters released by bloom microalgae are potentially converted into hazardous disinfection byproducts and increasing human health risks pal et al 2020 3 2 2 microcystin microcystin synthesized by m aeruginosa is the most widely spread toxin in bloom water due to its hepatotoxicity and stability microcystin has become a high profile index in water and the world health organization proposed a 1 ng ml microcystin limit for drinking water cotruvo 2020 although the total microcystin content had no fundamental change during the cultivation period in vernalized protocols was slightly lower than in the control fig 3 a moreover the extra to intra cellular microcystin ratio decreased from 0 96 to 1 17 to 0 53 0 63 with m aeruginosa growth table s2 suggesting a gradual reduction of microcystin release from the cell to water the microcystin in water achieved the highest level 14 38 ng ml in the initial stage about 14 fold higher than the safety limit the microcystin concentration was similar to other reports for m aeruginosa cultivation wu et al 2021 the normalized results of microcystin production showed that m aeruginosa synthesized and released more microcystin in the initial cultivation and then gradually decreased over time its content was about 2 3 fold higher than in the later period fig 3b during inoculation m aeruginosa cell density changed from high to low consequently in the initial cultivation m aeruginosa adapted to the low density environment it has been reported that m aeruginosa synthesizes and secretes microcystin to improve its environmental adaptability through signaling regulation liu and sun 2015 makower et al 2015 the vernalized protocols produced less microcystin than the control indicating that low temperature treatment and vernalization progress possibly bestowed better adaptability on m aeruginosa kamran et al 2014 3 3 metabolic regulations 3 3 1 photosynthesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and dna replication the important pathways related to growth metabolism and their expression of upregulated genes were compared m aeruginosa takes in co2 through photosynthesis and converts light energy to chemical energy in cells zhao et al 2019 in the thylakoid membrane most photosystem i psi and photosystem ii psii genes were upregulated specifically the mae 56270 mae 56280 and mae 59230 increased 2 5 fold fig s4 cytb6 the key complex of the electron transport chain from psii to psi avenson et al 2005 was highly expressed fig 4 atp synthase was also highly expressed fig 4 therefore vernalization promoted m aeruginosa photosynthesis in the light independent reactions psii co2 is converted into glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate gap by the calvin cycle consuming the atp and nadph from psi carere et al 2008 the gap further generated glucose and other carbohydrates jia et al 2013 glycolysis is an important pathway to utilize glucose which is degraded to pyruvate and further oxidized to acetyl coa by pyruvate dehydrogenase then acetyl coa enters the tca cycle which is involved in the citric acid synthesis vernalization upregulated pk and pdh key enzymes for pyruvate and acetyl coa production in glycolysis and upregulated cs aco2 idh succinyl coa synthase sdh and mdh in the tca cycle most energy is produced in glycolysis and the tca cycle stored it in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh which then generates atp in oxidative phosphorylation oxidative phosphorylation enzymes were upregulated and atp production was enhanced in vernalized m aeruginosa the atp content was 36 higher than in the control fig s5 furthermore dna replication helicase polymerase and ligase were highly expressed fig 4 fig s4 promoting cell division and proliferation pandey and patel 2014 spadari et al 1989 vernalization endowed m aeruginosa with more active metabolisms of substance and energy resulting in the rapid increase of their cells in cyanobacterial bloom 3 3 2 antioxidant system mda is the common membrane lipid peroxidation index produced by cells in an adverse environment djordjevic et al 2020 m aeruginosa mda content increased 8 and 3 fold after the 4 c and 10 c treatments respectively fig 5 a it suggested that the harsh temperature caused oxidative damage in cells and 4 c had the most severe oxidative damage fortunately the antioxidant enzymes sod cat and pod in m aeruginosa can scavenge reactive oxygen species ross and improve the antioxidant defense ni et al 2013 sod was the most important antioxidant enzyme of m aeruginosa at the harsh temperature and its activity was about 9 21 times that of cat and 22 48 times that of pod at day 0 fig 5b d in the initial vernalization period the activity of antioxidant enzymes was much higher than control facilitating the rapid scavenging of ross produced at low temperatures with the action of sod o2 is converted into h2o2 and then further reduced to h2o by cat and pod asayama et al 2003 the level of antioxidant enzymes gradually decreased as ross scavenged and stress disappeared in m aeruginosa consequently the mda content was also reduced approaching control levels while the content in control showed no observed differences through time the self regulation of the antioxidant system provided m aeruginosa with a good environment adaptiveness in low temperatures accumulated ross damaged cell membranes also triggered the calcium signaling pathway to stimulate antioxidant enzymes for scavenging free radicals fig 6 a in addition vernalization upregulated the des gene promoting polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis consequently the membrane fluidity increased and permeability improved braun et al 2007 dennis and peacock 2009 cell permeability is involved in nutrient uptake and metabolites efflux bokhari et al 2014 stebegg et al 2019 slightly high permeability benefited m aeruginosa s nutrient intake and rapid growth in vernalization contributing to the release of intracellular metabolites except for the cell membrane the cell wall is possibly involved in exporting microbial products fig 6b m aeruginosa has a multi layer structure including surface layers outer membrane peptidoglycan and cytoplasmic membrane rajasekhar et al 2012 the microbial products must cross the cell wall to be released into the environment peptidoglycan is the primary cell wall component for m aeruginosa and plays an important role in maintaining cell morphology and cell protection do et al 2020 eleven key enzymes mura murb murc murd mure ddl murg mrca b mrda pbpb and 3 4 16 4 of the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway were downregulated in vernalization fig 6c reducing mechanical strength and increasing cell permeability mishra et al 2005 mura and murb catalyze the formation of udp murnac murc d and e ligases are in charge of appending amino acids dowson et al 2022 murg is one of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic membrane enzymes that transfer a glcnac to lipid i c55 pp murnac pentapeptide and form lipid ii c55 pp murnac pentapeptide glcnac oluwole et al 2022 the downregulation of these enzymes probably promoted the release of microbial products from the intracell to the environment structurally m aeruginosa cell size in the growth term was smaller than the initial inoculum in addition the vernalized cells were coated with more extracellular polymeric substances fig s6a in ultrastructure pictures vernalized cells showed some folds at their surface and the cell wall became concave and thinner fig s6b these results indicated that vernalization regulated m aeruginosa s permeability and increased the release of smps in water 3 4 vernalization triggered signaling pathways quorum sensing and the two component system are important signaling regulators in gram negative bacteria lim et al 2022 vernalization induced significant upregulation of 96 genes including quorum sensing two component system photosynthesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and dna replication genes fig s7 moreover the network analysis showed close connections between signaling pathways and metabolic processes photosynthesis is the leading resource of organics in m aeruginosa cui et al 2013 and 42 7 of the significantly upregulated were related to photosynthesis the correlation between photosynthesis and the two component system was greater than quorum sensing these results indicated that the two component system played a much more important role in regulating m aeruginosa metabolisms during vernalization the low temperature stress and recovery triggered the quorum sensing and two component system of m aeruginosa regulating metabolic process cell growth and smps secretion via signal transduction pathways fig 7 a sec dpp and transporter were upregulated in the quorum sensing signaling pathway of vernalized m aeruginosa cph1 rcp1 nb1s rpab epsp des and dnaa in the two component system were also upregulated their genes expression is shown in the heatmap fig 7b of which mae 12270 corresponding to cph1 was notably upregulated for 10 c and 4 c protocols compared with control the upregulation of nbls rpab and dnaa promoted photosynthesis energy transfer and dna replication kato et al 2011 moreover histidine kinase cph1 and response regulator rcp1 in the two component system pathway and dpp in the quorum sensing pathway were upregulated stimulating cell growth and proliferation yi et al 2019 the high expression of epsp promoted the soluble microbial products synthesis the upregulation of des sec and the transporter enhanced the membrane permeability and the secretory system braun et al 2007 therefore more smps were easily released into the environment 4 conclusions vernalization greatly contributes to cyanobacterial bloom the harsh temperatures 4 c and 10 c stimulated the m aeruginosa growth the growth rate and the maximum cell density increased by 35 4 and 33 2 respectively meanwhile vernalization notably promoted smps synthesis by 109 5 furthermore it exacerbated water deterioration with polysaccharides being the main increasing component initially and tryptophan proteins and humic substances becoming the primary increasing substances later vernalization promotes cell growth by upregulating the gene expression of enzymes related to photosynthesis atp production tca cycle and dna replication although the antioxidant capability of m aeruginosa increased in vernalization oxidative damage caused peptidoglycan synthesis inhibition and membrane permeability increase resulting in more smps being released the temperature change in vernalization triggered the m aeruginosa signal transduction pathways while quorum sensing and the two component system regulated cell growth and metabolism this study found that vernalization increased the risk of cyanobacteria growth and water deterioration providing new insights into the mechanism of seasonal cyanobacterial bloom

15561,photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris formed by sunlight irradiation of natural photosensitizers play critical roles in accelerating biogeochemical cycles on earth surface existing ppri studies mostly focus on bulk phase reactions e g bulk water with ppri processes at the environmental interfaces largely unexplored here we report the wetland soil water interface swi as a widespread but previously unappreciated hotspot for ppri productions massive productions of four important ppri species i e triplet state excited organic matter 3om singlet oxygen 1o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh were observed at the swi all four ppri species exhibited higher productions at the swi than those in bulk water where oh production was largely elevated by up to one order of magnitude the enhanced ppri productions at the swi were caused by intensified photon absorption and vibrant fe mediated redox processes where the light absorption by less or non photoactive soil substances partially offset the enhancement on ppri productions nationwide wetland investigations demonstrate that the swi was a ubiquitous hotspot for ppri productions simulations on ppris mediated reactions suggest that the enhanced ppri productions could greatly affect the kinetics and transformation pathways of nutrients and pollutants given that the swi also acts a hotspot for nutrient and pollutant accumulation incorporating the swi enhanced ppri productions into biogeochemical process assessments is pivotal for advancing our understandings on the element cycles and

decades significant progresses have been made on revealing the natural source of ppris yet predominantly focusing on bulk phase reactions recent studies have revealed that ppri processes at environmental interfaces e g air water interface anglada et al 2020 lin et al 2021 ice water interface fede and grannas 2015 etc have unique thermodynamic and kinetic properties compared to those in bulk systems for instance om as ppri photosensitizers were found to concentrate at the ice water interface leading to enhanced productions of ppris and therefore accelerated degradation of organic compounds fede and grannas 2015 grannas et al 2014 further accumulations of ppris at the air water interface were discovered in atmospheric microdroplets attributing to the distinctive enthalpic and entropic conditions anglada et al 2020 given the wide occurrence of interfaces in nature the unique behaviors of ppris at the interfaces could have prominent impacts on environmental processes ruiz lopez et al 2020 sunlit soil water interfaces swi fig 1 a are ubiquitous in wetlands the frequent exchanges on mass and energy between water and soil make the swi a hotspot for pollutant accumulations wang et al 2021 and element cycles liu et al 2021 while light have limited penetration depth in soil the photons could be efficiently absorbed by the abundant photosensitizers at the swi further redox active minerals such as ferrihydrite are rich at the swi sheng et al 2021 which could catalyze fenton or fenton like reactions for oh productions nevertheless whether or not ppris could be efficiently produced at the swi remains unclear which if the case will greatly impact biogeochemical processes and pollutant dynamics in wetlands the goal of this study was to assess the ppri productions at the sunlit swi of wetlands specifically we aim to i spatially map the ppri formations at the swi ii quantitatively assess the formations of four environmentally relevant ppris i e 3om 1o2 h2o2 and oh at the swi iii demonstrate the wide occurrence of enhanced ppri productions at the swi iv reveal the cause for enhanced ppri productions at the swi and v demonstrate the impacts of enhanced ppri productions on ppris mediated processes by coupling ppri productions and reaction kinetics with wetland relevant nutrients and pollutants our results highlight swi as a ubiquitous yet previously overlooked hotspot for ppri productions which provides new insights into biogeochemical processes and pollutant dynamics in wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chemical sources were

fluorescent production in the fluorescence isothiocyanate channels fitc image indicates the formation of ppris in bulk water and at the swi fig 1b right the fluorescence signal was relatively uniform in bulk water sharply increased at the swi and vanished in bulk soil 1 mm below the swi fig 1b right normalized fluorescence intensity confirmed the enhanced ppri productions at the swi which was up to 4 fold as high as compared to those in bulk water fig 1c 3 2 enhanced ppri productions at the swi the productions of four important ppris i e 3om 1o2 h2o2 and oh at the swi were quantitatively assessed using respective probes and compared to those in bulk water and those under dark condition generally all measured ppri productions were higher at the swi as compared to those in bulk water while the enhancements differed among ppri species 3 2 1 3om productions the photochemical transformations of tmp at the swi and in bulk water followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 2 a the transformation rate of tmp at the swi was higher compared to that in bulk water while no tmp transformation was observed at the swi under dark condition accordingly the calculated 3om ss at the swi was 1 7 fold higher than that in bulk water fig s4 3 2 2 1o2 productions the photochemical transformations of ffa resembled those of tmp with transformation rate at the swi higher than that in bulk water and no ffa transformation was observed at the swi under dark condition fig 2b the steady state concentration of 1o2 at the swi was 1 4 fold higher than that in bulk water fig s4 the 1o2 ss was slightly higher than 3om ss and both at pm level in good agreement with previous studies on sunlit waters mcneill and canonica 2016 peterson et al 2012 zeng et al 2021 3 2 3 h2o2 productions the formations of resorufin at the swi and in bulk water followed zero order kinetics fig 2c the measured formation rate of h2o2 in bulk water 41 6 pm s 1 was in good agreement with previously reported r form h 2 o 2 in the range of 1 80 pm s 1 garg et al 2011 the formation rate at the swi was 2 6 fold higher than that in bulk water fig s4 and also much higher than that under dark condition fig 2c 3 2 4 oh productions the formations of htpa resembled those of resorufin following zero order kinetics fig 2d the measured oh ss in bulk water was on the order of 10 17 m agreeing with the literature values burns et al 2012 among the four investigated ppris oh exhibited the largest enhancement at the swi by one order of magnitude as compared to that in bulk water fig s4 we note that the dark source also partially contributed to the elevated oh production yet such contribution was minor and enhanced oh productions at the swi were mainly attributed to photochemical route fig 2d 3 3 physicochemical insights into the enhanced ppri productions at the swi multiple processes could contribute to the elevated ppri productions at the swi as evidenced by the variations on the enhancements of different ppri species in general higher abundance of light absorbing materials at the swi lead to enhanced photon absorption and energy transfer provoking higher productions of all ppri species further the enrichment of redox active materials e g iron minerals at the swi could promote the electrons transfer process resulting in higher productions of related ppri species including h2o2 and oh here we assessed the photon absorption and reactions at the swi to illustrate the elevated ppri productions 3 3 1 enhanced photon absorption at the swi the photon absorptions by the bulk water and swi were assessed under xenon lamp irradiation condition light intensity 100 mw cm2 the light intensity declined from 100 mw cm2 to 94 9 mw cm2 while passing through 10 mm bulk water and sharply decreased to zero after passing through 1 mm swi accordingly the 1 mm swi absorbed 94 9 of incident photons with absorption efficiency 186 fold higher than that of bulk water fig 3 a the enhanced light absorption at the swi could directly translate to elevated ppri productions for instance the light absorption by om increased with increasing om concentration fig 3b and the oh productions in om solution linearly increased with increasing light absorption figs s5 and 3c notably particulate substances such as particulate organic matter appiani and mcneill 2015 abundant in soils could also absorb photons and contribute to ppri productions at the swi notably the enhancement on ppri productions at the swi 1 4 to 10 1 fold was lower than the enhancement on photon absorption 186 fold therefore the apparent quantum yields of ppris at the swi were lower than those in the bulk water we attribute this to the existence of light absorbing components with no or minor ppris producing capabilities in soil which hence leading to a dilution effect on photon absorption and ppri productions for instance clay was a major soil component kumarathilaka et al 2018 and can efficiently absorb photons we applied kaolin as representative clay and investigated its oh production capability as shown in fig 3d the oh production by kaolin was 5 3 fold lower as compared to that by om 10 mgc l this result suggests that while the enhanced photon absorption contributes to the elevated ppri productions at the swi the light absorption by less or non photoactive substances e g clay minerals at the swi could partially offset the photon absorption effect 3 3 2 enhanced fe mediated redox reactions at the swi among the four investigated ppri species oh exhibited the highest elevation at the swi fig s4 we attribute the substantial oh production to the high content of fe at the swi a key element for mediating oh production in natural paulson et al 2019 and engineered systems chen et al 2021 for instance the fe concentration at the swi of site 1 reached 18 84 mm three orders of magnitude higher than that in bulk water 9 13 μm table s1 the abundant and redox active fe at the swi could directly or indirectly enhance oh productions first fe could associate with om forming fe om complex with higher oh yields page et al 2013 page et al 2012 tong et al 2016 vermilyea and voelker 2009 white et al 2003 yu et al 2021 zepp et al 1992 to provide a paradigm we investigated the photochemical oh production activity of om in the absence or presence of fe the results shows that photochemical productions of oh in om solutions sharply increased with addition of dissolved fe fig 3e as well as solid iron minerals fig s6 the results shows that photochemical productions of oh in om solutions sharply increased with addition of fe fig 3e accordingly oh ss was enhanced by up to 7 fold with ferrous iron concentration increased from 0 to 50 μm fig 3f such improved oh productions of fe om was caused by the increased absorbance of the fe om solution southworth and voelker 2003 and the ligand to metal charge transfer miller et al 2013 vione et al 2014 second fe at the swi could indirectly enhance oh formations through catalyzing fenton or fenton like reactions e g h2o2 fe ii h oh fe iii h2o chen et al 2020 those processes including fenton or fenton like reactions consumes h2o2 therefore explaining higher enhancement of oh 10 1 fold at the swi than that of h2o2 2 6 fold overall the above results indicate that the ppri productions at the swi were i elevated by enhanced light absorption ii hindered by light absorption by less or non photoactive substances and iii elevated by enhanced fe mediated redox reactions 3 4 swi as ubiquitous hotspot for ppri productions in wetlands the above results have confirmed the enhanced ppri productions at the swi we then tested whether swi act as a ubiquitous hotspot for ppri productions in wetlands the ppri productions in bulk water and at the swi of six wetlands along the coast of china from tianjin city 39 2 n 117 48 e to shenzhen city 22 31 n 113 59 e were assessed the fluorescent spectroscopy results show that all collected water samples contained photoactive fulvic like substances fig s2 xu et al 2020 with doc ranging from 1 60 0 06 site 6 to 15 5 0 50 mg l site 2 other photochemically important substances such as nitrite ranging from 0 24 0 01 at site 2 to 7 60 0 01 μm at site 3 and nitrate ranging from 3 58 0 04 at site 2 to 44 98 0 09 μm at site 3 were also detected table s1 we then assessed photochemical productions of oh in bulk water and at the swi photochemical productions of oh were detected in all investigated bulk water and at the swi systems the obtained oh ss ranged from 0 6 to 8 3 10 17 m in bulk water and ranged from 8 7 to 35 3 10 17 m at the swi fig 4 b g despite the variations in oh ss higher productions of oh at the swi than those in the bulk water were detected at all sites with the enhancement factor ranging from 2 4 to 19 7 fig 4 the above results demonstrate that the swi was a ubiquitous hotspot for ppri productions in wetlands 3 5 ppris mediated accelerating transformation of nutrient and pollutant at the swi the elevated ppri productions at the swi reported in this work substantiates previous findings of interfaces as hotspots for ppri productions given the ubiquitous existence of soil water interfaces in natural environment the elevated ppri productions could accelerate the biogeochemical processes and pollutant transformations in wetlands here to provide a paradigm we calculated the ppris mediated half lives of nutrients showing cysteine and tryptophan as examples and pesticides showing clopyralid and chlorpyrifos as examples in bulk water and at the swi the selected nutrients were abundant in aquatic environment and involved in biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and sulfur chu et al 2016 janssen et al 2014 the selected pesticides were widely detected in rice paddies and raised concerns regarding their negative impacts on the water quality and food security carena et al 2017 zeng and arnold 2013 therefore a better prediction on their half lives accounting for swi photochemistry will help understand their environmental fate and risk in wetlands with enhanced ppri productions at the swi all investigated nutrient and pollutant species exhibit shorter half lives compared to those in bulk water fig 5 a clopyralid shows the largest half life decrease of 65 8 at the swi in addition to accelerating transformation kinetics elevated ppri productions at the swi further altered the compound transformation pathway and products for instance in bulk water 71 3 of clopyralid transformation proceeded through 3om mediated pathway fig 5b in stark contrast at the swi oh mediated transformation 51 5 dominated clopyralid transformation fig 5b notably these calculations were employed to demonstrate the impacts of elevated ppri productions at the swi on nutrient and pollutant transformations under field conditions other factors and processes such as water qualities and microbial transformations should also be considered for accurate predictions of their half lives 3 6 ppris mediated co2 emissions at the swi the elevated ppri productions at the swi could further facilitate the oxidation mineralization of om and contribute to carbon cycle in wetlands for instance with a oh production rate of 0 17 µm h at site 1 fig s7 oh mediated photo mineralization lead to co2 emission of 0 63 µm day at the swi assuming an irradiation time of 12 hours per day a reported yield of 0 3 mol co2 per mol oh page et al 2013 co2 yield 0 3 0 17 µm h 12 h day moreover swi oh could indirectly accelerate carbon cycle by promoting partial oxidation of om leading to formation of low molecular weight acids with high microbial availability overall accounting for the enhanced ppri productions at the swi will improve our understandings on the photochemical pathways and kinetics of element cycles and pollutant transformations in wetlands 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that swi was a previously unrecognized hotspot for ppri productions in natural wetlands the fluorescence image and quantitative experiments both showed that the enhanced ppri productions at the swi could reached several times or even to one order of magnitude higher than those in bulk water the intensified photon absorption and vibrant fe mediated redox processes contributed a lot to the hotspot of ppris at the swi besides nationwide sampling clarified that the swi as ubiquitous ppri hotspot in wetlands in addition simulations of half lives showed that elevated ppri productions could greatly affect the kinetics and transformation pathways of nutrients and pollutants as well as the biogeochemical processes at the swi findings in this study provide new insights into the interfacial photochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems

existing ppri studies mostly focus on bulk phase reactions e g bulk water with ppri processes at the environmental interfaces largely unexplored here we report the wetland soil water interface swi as a widespread but previously unappreciated hotspot for ppri productions massive productions of four important ppri species i e triplet state excited organic matter 3om singlet oxygen 1o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh were observed at the swi all four ppri species exhibited higher productions at the swi than those in bulk water where oh production was largely elevated by up to one order of magnitude the enhanced ppri productions at the swi were caused by intensified photon absorption and vibrant fe mediated redox processes where the light absorption by less or non photoactive soil substances partially offset the enhancement on ppri productions nationwide wetland investigations demonstrate that the swi was a ubiquitous hotspot for ppri productions simulations on ppris mediated reactions suggest that the enhanced ppri productions could greatly affect the kinetics and transformation pathways of nutrients and pollutants given that the swi also acts a hotspot for

decades significant progresses have been made on revealing the natural source of ppris yet predominantly focusing on bulk phase reactions recent studies have revealed that ppri processes at environmental interfaces e g air water interface anglada et al 2020 lin et al 2021 ice water interface fede and grannas 2015 etc have unique thermodynamic and kinetic properties compared to those in bulk systems for instance om as ppri photosensitizers were found to concentrate at the ice water interface leading to enhanced productions of ppris and therefore accelerated degradation of organic compounds fede and grannas 2015 grannas et al 2014 further accumulations of ppris at the air water interface were discovered in atmospheric microdroplets attributing to the distinctive enthalpic and entropic conditions anglada et al 2020 given the wide occurrence of interfaces in nature the unique behaviors of ppris at the interfaces could have prominent impacts on environmental processes ruiz lopez et al 2020 sunlit soil water interfaces swi fig 1 a are ubiquitous in wetlands the frequent exchanges on mass and energy between water and soil make the swi a hotspot for pollutant accumulations wang et al 2021 and element cycles liu et al 2021 while light have limited penetration depth in soil the photons could be efficiently absorbed by the abundant photosensitizers at the swi further redox active minerals such as ferrihydrite are rich at the swi sheng et al 2021 which could catalyze fenton or fenton like reactions for oh productions nevertheless whether or not ppris could be efficiently produced at the swi remains unclear which if the case will greatly impact biogeochemical processes and pollutant dynamics in wetlands the goal of this study was to assess the ppri productions at the sunlit swi of wetlands specifically we aim to i spatially map the ppri formations at the swi ii quantitatively assess the formations of four environmentally relevant ppris i e 3om 1o2 h2o2 and oh at the swi iii demonstrate the wide occurrence of enhanced ppri productions at the swi iv reveal the cause for enhanced ppri productions at the swi and v demonstrate the impacts of enhanced ppri productions on ppris mediated processes by coupling ppri productions and reaction kinetics with wetland relevant nutrients and pollutants our results highlight swi as a ubiquitous yet previously overlooked hotspot for ppri productions which provides new insights into biogeochemical processes and pollutant dynamics in wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chemical sources were

productions of fe om was caused by the increased absorbance of the fe om solution southworth and voelker 2003 and the ligand to metal charge transfer miller et al 2013 vione et al 2014 second fe at the swi could indirectly enhance oh formations through catalyzing fenton or fenton like reactions e g h2o2 fe ii h oh fe iii h2o chen et al 2020 those processes including fenton or fenton like reactions consumes h2o2 therefore explaining higher enhancement of oh 10 1 fold at the swi than that of h2o2 2 6 fold overall the above results indicate that the ppri productions at the swi were i elevated by enhanced light absorption ii hindered by light absorption by less or non photoactive substances and iii elevated by enhanced fe mediated redox reactions 3 4 swi as ubiquitous hotspot for ppri productions in wetlands the above results have confirmed the enhanced ppri productions at the swi we then tested whether swi act as a ubiquitous hotspot for ppri productions in wetlands the ppri productions in bulk water and at the swi of six wetlands along the coast of china from tianjin city 39 2 n 117 48 e to shenzhen city 22 31 n 113 59 e were assessed the fluorescent spectroscopy results show that all collected water samples contained photoactive fulvic like substances fig s2 xu et al 2020 with doc ranging from 1 60 0 06 site 6 to 15 5 0 50 mg l site 2 other photochemically important substances such as nitrite ranging from 0 24 0 01 at site 2 to 7 60 0 01 μm at site 3 and nitrate ranging from 3 58 0 04 at site 2 to 44 98 0 09 μm at site 3 were also detected table s1 we then assessed photochemical productions of oh in bulk water and at the swi photochemical productions of oh were detected in all investigated bulk water and at the swi systems the obtained oh ss ranged from 0 6 to 8 3 10 17 m in bulk water and ranged from 8 7 to 35 3 10 17 m at the swi fig 4 b g despite the variations in oh ss higher productions of oh at the swi than those in the bulk water were detected at all sites with the enhancement factor ranging from 2 4 to 19 7 fig 4 the above results demonstrate that the swi was a ubiquitous hotspot for ppri productions in wetlands 3 5 ppris mediated accelerating transformation of nutrient and pollutant at the swi the elevated ppri productions at the swi reported in this work substantiates previous findings of interfaces as hotspots for ppri productions given the ubiquitous existence of soil water interfaces in natural environment the elevated ppri productions could accelerate the biogeochemical processes and pollutant transformations in wetlands here to provide a paradigm we calculated the ppris mediated half lives of nutrients showing cysteine and tryptophan as examples and pesticides showing clopyralid and chlorpyrifos as examples in bulk water and at the swi the selected nutrients were abundant in aquatic environment and involved in biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and sulfur chu et al 2016 janssen et al 2014 the selected pesticides were widely detected in rice paddies and raised concerns regarding their negative impacts on the water quality and food security carena et al 2017 zeng and arnold 2013 therefore a better prediction on their half lives accounting for swi photochemistry will help understand their environmental fate and risk in wetlands with enhanced ppri productions at the swi all investigated nutrient and pollutant species exhibit shorter half lives compared to those in bulk water fig 5 a clopyralid shows the largest half life decrease of 65 8 at the swi in addition to accelerating transformation kinetics elevated ppri productions at the swi further altered the compound transformation pathway and products for instance in bulk water 71 3 of clopyralid transformation proceeded through 3om mediated pathway fig 5b in stark contrast at the swi oh mediated transformation 51 5 dominated clopyralid transformation fig 5b notably these calculations were employed to demonstrate the impacts of elevated ppri productions at the swi on nutrient and pollutant transformations under field conditions other factors and processes such as water qualities and microbial transformations should also be considered for accurate predictions of their half lives 3 6 ppris mediated co2 emissions at the swi the elevated ppri productions at the swi could further facilitate the oxidation mineralization of om and contribute to carbon cycle in wetlands for instance with a oh production rate of 0 17 µm h at site 1 fig s7 oh mediated photo mineralization lead to co2 emission of 0 63 µm day at the swi assuming an irradiation time of 12 hours per day a reported yield of 0 3 mol co2 per mol oh page et al 2013 co2 yield 0 3 0 17 µm h 12 h day moreover swi oh could indirectly accelerate carbon cycle by promoting partial oxidation of om leading to formation of low molecular weight acids with high microbial availability overall accounting for the enhanced ppri productions at the swi will improve our understandings on the photochemical pathways and kinetics of element cycles and pollutant transformations in wetlands 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that swi was a previously unrecognized hotspot for ppri productions in natural wetlands the fluorescence image and quantitative experiments both showed that the enhanced ppri productions at the swi could reached several times or even to one order of magnitude higher than those in bulk water the intensified photon absorption and vibrant fe mediated redox processes contributed a lot to the hotspot of ppris at the swi besides nationwide sampling clarified that the swi as ubiquitous ppri hotspot in wetlands in addition simulations of half lives showed that elevated ppri productions could greatly affect the kinetics and transformation pathways of nutrients and pollutants as well as the biogeochemical processes at the swi findings in this study provide new insights into the interfacial photochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems

introduction with the fast growing uses of lithium li ion batteries in portable devices electric vehicles and grid scale energy storage easily accessible li sources such as high grade li ores and high li concentration brines may quickly deplete yang et al 2018 there is abundant li more than 230 billion tons in seawater he et al 2020 yang et al 2018 mining li from the ocean can resolve potential li shortages battistel et al 2020 however li extraction from seawater is challenging because of the low li concentration 0 17 ppm and high concentrations of co existing ions i e sodium na magnesium mg calcium ca and potassium k ions with the large na li molar ratio up to 20 000 he et al 2020 the conventional evaporation precipitation method used to extract li from high concentration brines has a low production rate and selectivity at low concentrations it thus is not economical to extract li from seawater li et al 2021 yang et al 2018 adsorbing li using adsorbents such as λ mno2 nishihama et al 2011 hydrogen manganese oxide hong et al 2015 and li1 6mn1 6o4 chitrakar et al 2001 has relatively low adsorption capacity slow speed and moderate selectivity kim et al 2019 umeno et al 2002 furthermore strong acids are required to regenerate adsorbents nishihama et al 2011 electrodialysis has been explored to extract li from seawater in which an electric field drives li to transport through a selective membrane yang et al 2018 for example lai et al recently demonstrated a continuous multi stage electrodialysis method using a solid state electrolyte membrane which can enrich li from seawater with a high enrichment factor 43 000 and show a high li mg selectivity li et al 2021 however selective membranes cost service life and potential high electrical energy consumption remain concerns zavahir et al 2021 additionally yang et al demonstrated a solar powered electrolysis method using a li superionic conductor nasicon type solid state electrolyte to directly generate metallic li from seawater yang et al 2018 however this method has potential safety issues because of highly oxidative perchlorate organic electrolytes li et al 2021 alternatively electrochemical ion pumping methods employ li selective electrode materials to extract li from aqueous sources battistel et al 2020 see the details of their working principle in part 1 of the supplementary materials sm take an electrochemical cell comprised of lixmn2o4 lmo and knife cn 6 nihcf electrodes as an example eq 1 li capturing releasing is accomplished during the discharging charging of the electrochemical cell

trócoli et al 2015 trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 electrochemical ion pumping methods offer several advantages such as high selectivity fast production rate minimum use of chemicals and less waste generation battistel et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 however most previous studies only worked in high li concentration source solutions with low na li molar ratios less than 1000 or 100 battistel et al 2020 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the main obstacles to exploiting seawater as a li source in the previous studies may lie in the dramatically decreased li recovery capacity i e the amount of li that can be recovered in one cycle as well as low current density i e low li extraction rate available in electrochemical cells in low li concentration solutions 0 2 mm with large na li molar ratio 15 000 kim et al 2020 two recent studies reported li extraction from seawater level source solutions by electrochemical ion pumping methods kim et al reported an lmo ag electrochemical cell operated in a consecutive multi stage mode which achieved rapid and selective li extraction from simulated seawater desalination brine with a na li molar ratio of around 18 000 kim et al 2019 liu et al reported a pulsed electrochemical intercalation method using tio2 coated lifepo4 electrodes for li extraction from authentic seawater with around 1 1 molar ratio li to na recovery zhu et al 2020 however these results still have significant gaps in practical applications due to the use of costly noble metal electrodes complex operation protocols and poor scalability battistel et al 2020 we recently coupled a thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle trec using lmo and nihcf electrodes with poly vinylidene fluoride membrane based thermo osmosis e g membrane distillation md denoted as to trec to extract li from relatively high concentration brines yuan et al 2021 utilizing the positive temperature coefficient α i e the change of the electrode potential with respect to temperature see the details of temperature coefficient measurement and definition in part 8 of the sm of the lmo nihcf electrode pair i e the voltage of the lmo nihcf cell would increase at higher temperatures to trec is capable of converting some thermal energy from a warm li source solution into electricity which can offset the electrical energy required for li extraction liu et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 furthermore preceding battery material studies showed that li diffusion in the electrolyte and electrode materials might be accelerated at high temperatures kulova et al 2006 yang et al 2018 therefore we speculate that elevating solution temperatures may help achieve efficient li extraction from low li concentration source solutions in this study we first discovered that li extraction behaviors in low li concentration source solutions are temperature and concentration dependent characterization of lmo and nihcf electrodes upon li intercalation or k deintercalation showed their structure changes in heated solutions next we conducted comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic analyses to gain a mechanistic understanding of li extraction behaviors of isothermal lmo nihcf cells in heated source solutions based on the acquired knowledge we demonstrated that a thermally assisted electrochemical process based on to trec could achieve efficient li extraction from a seawater level source solution with an ultra high na li molar ratio i e 20 000 given the abundant availability and cost effectiveness of low grade thermal energy temperature 130 c from industrial plants geothermal wells or solar thermal collectors gingerich and mauter 2015 tavakkoli et al 2016 this process shows its potential in utilizing low grade heat for rapid and efficient li extraction from low li concentration source solutions compared with other electrochemical or adsorption methods materials and methods electrodes preparation and characterization the lmo and nihcf electrodes used in this study were prepared by

were performed by an electrochemical workstation 660d chi cv curves of electrodes in different aqueous solutions were recorded in a three electrode configuration with an lmo or nihcf electrode as a working electrode a pt mesh as a counter electrode and an ag agcl electrode as a reference electrode the cycling performance of the lmo nihcf cell was measured by a battery tester ct 2001a land concentration and temperature dependent li intercalation behaviors in lmo nihcf cells isothermal cells consist of an lmo working electrode a nihcf counter electrode and a reference electrode with a 2

workstation 660d chi in source solutions containing nacl 3 m kcl mgcl2 and cacl2 each 30 mm and licl 30 3 or 0 15 mm respectively at 20 c and 60 c although the thermal energy with a temperature below 130 c can be classified as low grade heat the heat sources with higher temperatures are generally more difficult to be obtained they will pose some challenges for the thermal insulation and heat exchange facilities to achieve high energy efficiency when we handle them on the other hand if the thermal energy temperature is too low and close to room temperature the effects and related mechanisms of using thermal energy may be hard to observe and investigate in many studies utilizing or recovering the low grade thermal energy 60 c or a temperature difference of 40 c between the low temperature was frequently selected as the typical temperature to investigate the effects of the low grade heat gao et al 2017 long et al 2020 straub and elimelech 2017 zhao et al 2022 in this study we also chose 60 c as a representative temperature of the low grade thermal energy because it is both high enough to show the temperature effects clearly and in an acceptable level to be handled in practical applications the temperature of source solutions 25 ml was controlled by soaking the isothermal cell in a constant temperature water bath sitting on a hotplate the full cell was discharged

the sm the kinetic analysis of lmo nihcf cells by eis the kinetics analysis of lmo nihcf cells was conducted by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis on the electrochemical workstation 660d chi in various li containing source solutions at 20 c and 60 c before eis tests a constant potential of 0 7 v was applied to lmo electrodes in the three electrode configuration with a nihcf counter electrode and an ag agcl reference electrode in 30 mm licl solution to ensure the same state of charge in lmo electrodes thermally assisted li extraction from simulated seawater thermally assisted li extraction was carried out using the to trec process in a flow cell with two crossflow chambers for feed and permeate solutions and a separate cell for the recovery solution see section 3 5 for a schematic illustration a commercial hydrophobic membrane 0 22 µm durapore membrane filters millipore was used for the md process to separate the feed and permeate chambers simulated seawater containing nacl 3 m kcl 30 mm mgcl2 30 mm cacl2 30 mm and licl 0 15 mm was used as the feed source solution 500 ml which has a na li molar ratio 20000 similar to that of seawater the recovery solution is kcl 30 mm and licl 30 mm hybrid aqueous solution 25 ml the feed and permeate solution temperatures in the md process were controlled at 60 c and 20 c respectively the temperature of the recovery solution for the lithium recovery process was controlled at 20 c the thermally assisted li extraction process was operated in two step cycles in the first step for lithium capturing a constant current of 0 4 ma 0 1 ma cm 2 was applied to the lmo nihcf cell which was placed in the hot feed chamber to capture li from the feed solution until the full cell potential reached 0 v at the same time the mass of freshwater obtained in the md process from the permeate chamber was monitored by a digital balance in the second step for lithium recovery the two electrodes were taken out from the feed chamber and rinsed with di water several times then the two electrodes were put in a separate chamber containing the recovery solution in which the captured li on the lmo electrode would release by applying a constant current of 2 ma 0 5 ma cm 2 on the lmo nihcf cell after each cycle the li k na ca and mg concentration in the recovery solution was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical

extraction as well as current efficiency η c are provided in part 4 of the sm results and discussion concentration and temperature dependent li extraction behaviors lmo nihcf cells were selected for li extraction in this study because of the following considerations first lmo and nihcf electrodes properties e g crystal structure discharge charge capacity stability and energy efficiency and fabrication methods have been well established battistel et al 2020 trócoli et al 2015 trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 they are commercially available at a reasonably low cost second previous studies have reported that lmo has high selectivity towards li against other competing ions e g na mg2 ca2 and k and nihcf has high selectivity of k from a mixture of k and li trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 third α of lmo nihcf cells is positive liu et al 2019 yang et al 2014 yuan et al 2021 which can be used in trec to generate electrical energy commercial lmo powders were first ball milled to yield uniform lmo particles with an average size of 140 44 nm fig s3 nihcf particles with an average particle size of 399 89 nm were synthesized fig s4 lmo and nihcf electrodes were fabricated according to the methods described in the experimental section they were first examined by scanning electron microscopy sem their electrochemical properties in selective and reversible li and k intercalation deintercalation were confirmed by cv analysis in a three electrode configuration as shown in fig s6 the selectivity of lmo electrodes towards li against other co existing cations i e na k mg2 and ca2 at a high temperature i e 60 c was demonstrated in cv tests in our previous study yuan et al 2021 furthermore a cycling test was also performed on an lmo nihcf cell which can retain a high discharge capacity of around 60 70 mah g 1 in 30 cycles with high coulombic efficiency of 98 2 fig s7 indicating the stable cyclability of lmo and nihcf electrodes for electrochemical li extraction we discovered that the li extraction capability of lmo nihcf cells strongly depends on the li concentration and temperature of source solutions the li extraction capability refers to the mass of li that can be intercalated into lmo electrodes during the discharge of lmo nihcf cells battistel et al 2020 kim et al 2020 fig 1 shows galvanostatic discharge profiles of lmo nihcf cells in three source solutions which contain the same concentration of nacl 3 m kcl mgcl2 and cacl2 each 30 mm but different concentrations of licl 30 3 or 0 15 mm these three li concentrations were selected to represent potential source solutions with na li molar ratios ranging from 100 i e brines to 20 000 i e seawater fig 1a shows the discharge profiles in the source solution containing 30 mm licl at 20 oc under a constant discharge current density of 0 5 ma cm 2 the discharge capacity is about 60 mah g 1 similar to a previous study yuan et al 2021 however fig 1b and 1c indicate that when the li concentrations decrease to 3 and 0 15 mm the discharge capacities drop dramatically to less than 5 mah g 1 under the current density of 0 5 ma cm 2 the discharge capacity only recovered partially when the current density was reduced for example the discharge capacity was 17 8 mah g 1 under 0 25 ma cm 2 in 3 mm li source solution and only 10 mah g 1 under 0 1 ma cm 2 in 0 15 mm li source solution these results suggest that the low li concentrations and high na li molar ratios in source solutions are detrimental to li extraction kim et al 2020 although lowering current densities might recover some discharge capacity kim et al 2020 a significantly longer time and a larger area of electrodes would be required making li extraction at room temperature i e 20 c impractical for source solutions with low li concentrations e g 3 mm with a high na li molar ratio 1000 next we increased the source solution to 60 c fig 1d f show that the discharge capacities increase significantly the increases are more substantial in the source solutions with low li concentrations 3 mm than with the high concentration 30 mm as can be seen from fig 1d in the source solution with a relatively high li concentration 30 mm and a low na li molar ratio 100 the discharge capacity slightly increased from 59 2 to 64 1 mah g 1 8 2 increment with the temperature increasing from 20 to 60 c in the source solution with 3 mm li concentration fig 1e the discharge capacity increased from 2 7 to 33 1 mah g 1 under 0 5 ma cm 2 1130 increment and from 17 8 to 52 2 mah g 1 under 0 25 ma cm 2 193 increment when the temperature increased from 20 to 60 c in the source solution with 0 15 mm li concentration fig 1f the discharge capacity increased from 4 2 to 7 0 mah g 1 under 0 5 ma cm 2 66 increment from 6 4 to 15 4 mah g 1 under 0 25 ma cm 2 140 increment or from 9 3 to 31 8 mah g 1 under 0 10 ma cm 2 240 increment when the temperature increased from 20 to 60 c it should be noted that the increased discharge capacities of the electrochemical system at 60 c were not contributed by the intercalation of other cations except li into the lmo electrode from the source solutions which can be demonstrated by the cv test of the lmo electrode in the source solution without li at 60 c see fig s8 characterization of lmo and nihcf by xps and xrd xps and xrd were employed to characterize lmo and nihcf electrodes upon li or k intercalation to understand the above concentration and temperature dependent li extraction capacity changes the samples are denoted as ht or lt x lmo or nihcf where ht refers to 60 c lt represents 20 c and x is the concentration of li in source solutions in the unit of mm for example ht 0 15 lmo refers to lmo after being discharged in 60 c source solution with 0 15 mm li based on eq 1 the valance number of mn in lmo would decrease upon li insertion while fe valance number in nihcf would increase with k deintercalation mn 2p3 2 xps spectra in fig 2 a can be decomposed into two peaks corresponding to mn ⅲ at 641 7 0 2 ev and mn ⅳ at 643 0 0 2 ev respectively zhu et al 2020 the molar ratio of mn4 mn3 was determined by fitting the areas of these two peaks fang et al 2015 fig 2c shows that mn4 mn3 molar ratios decrease upon li insertion the changes are smaller in source solutions with lower li concentration indicating less li insertion consistent with discharge profiles shown in fig 1 mn4 mn3 molar ratios are much lower in source solutions at 60 c than at 20 c indicating that more mn4 were electrochemically reduced mn3 in lmo at the higher discharge temperature the differences in mn4 mn3 molar ratios between the high and low discharge temperatures were more significant in source solutions with lower li concentrations than high concentrations we further characterized lmo by xrd xrd patterns in fig 2b show that the xrd peaks of lmo shift towards smaller diffraction angles upon li insertion the smaller diffraction angles correlate with larger lattice spacings indicating more li insertion trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 we extracted the lattice parameter a of lmo from their 400 diffraction peaks fig 2d the a is larger in source solutions at 60 c than at 20 c indicating more li insertion into lmo structures consistent with xps results in fig 2a and discharge profiles in fig 1 xrd patterns of lt 3 lmo and lt 0 15 lmo also show some bifurcated diffraction peaks the left peaks can be ascribed to lithiated lmo while the right peaks come from delithiated lmo the details are explained in fig s9 and accompanying texts in the sm in contrast ht 3 lmo and ht 0 15 lmo only show xrd peaks from lithiated lmo indicating that higher source solution temperature benefits li intercalation we also characterized nihcf by xps and xrd which also showed that more fe2 in nihcf were oxidized to fe3 in source solutions at 60 oc than at 20 oc especially in the source solutions containing lower li concentrations details in part 7 of si it should be noted that the xrd patterns of both lmo and nihcf electrodes after electrochemical operation at 60 c have the same characteristic diffraction peaks as those of their initial state indicating that their crystalline structures can be retained at 60 c the structural stability of lmo and nihcf electrodes during the electrochemical lithium extraction process at 60 c was also reported in our previous study yuan et al 2021 the solubility of lmo and nihcf electrodes at the higher temperature was also evaluated experimentally in this study the results indicated that the solubility of lmo and nihcf electrodes in di water was not significantly affected by increasing temperature to 60 c and they can be stabilized at the higher temperature in this study the details and the analysis of the experiments are shown in part 7 of the sm overall the characterization of lmo and nihcf by xps and xrd confirmed that higher temperatures enable more li intercalation and k deintercalation especially in the source solutions containing lower li concentrations mechanistic analysis from thermodynamic aspects next we carried out mechanistic analysis from the thermodynamic aspect to understand the concentration and temperature dependent behaviors the li extraction capacity of the lmo nihcf cell is related to its galvanostatic discharge voltage e ovejas and cuadras 2019 trocoli et al 2016 2 δ e δ e e q η where eeq is the cell voltage at the thermodynamic equilibrium state η is the overvoltage the voltage deviation between the actual cell voltage and the equilibrium voltage related to kinetics in the cell eeq is a function of charges stored in its electrode materials q the concentration of li in the source solution cli ss and the reaction temperature t fig 3 a shows ocv changes of lmo and nihcf electrodes and the lmo nihcf cell in the source solution when the temperature varies from 20 to 60 c a fitting with a high linear correlation r2 0 98 provided the temperature coefficient α defined as the change of δ e e q with the temperature of lmo nihcf and the full cell at 0 053 0 548 and 0 601 mv k 1 respectively therefore according to the nernst equation and the definition of α when the temperature increases from t0 to t t0 t the change in eeq for the lmo nihcf cell can be expressed as the details are shown in part 9 of the sm 3 δ

0 δ t we plotted the calculated δ e e q δ e e q 0 vs c l i s s from 0 1 to 30 mm at t of 0 or 40 c t0 20 oc as dash lines depicted in fig 3b we also experimentally measured ocvs of the lmo nihcf cell in source solutions with li concentrations of 30 3 and 0 15 mm at 20 and 60 c and the results were plotted as solid squares and dots in fig 3b the experimental results agree with the calculated results fig 3b indicates that eeq of the lmo nihcf cell decreases when the li concentration in source solutions decreases eeq is higher at 60 oc than at 20 oc because the lmo nihcf cell has a positive α however the difference of eeq at different temperatures becomes smaller at lower li concentrations for example eeq between 20 oc and 60 oc drops from 25 mv in the source solution containing 30 mm li to less than 10 mv when in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li however fig 1 shows that the li extraction capacity is much higher at 60 oc than at 20 oc especially in source solutions with lower li concentrations thus the observed extraction capacity is unlikely to originate from the change of thermodynamic equilibrium under these conditions mechanistic analysis from kinetic aspects from the above thermodynamic analysis the kinetics of li extraction in the lmo nihcf cell other than the thermodynamic equilibrium may play more critical roles in the observed li extraction capacity changes the cell overvoltage η can be used to quantify the effect of the kinetics the larger η is the lower e and the sooner the discharge cutoff voltage is reached which would limit li extraction capacity and reduce electricity output ovejas and cuadras 2019 generally the η has three components ovejas and cuadras 2019 trocoli et al 2016 the ohmic drop ηo originated from the ionic transfer resistance the charge transfer overvoltage ηct required to overcome the activation barrier of the electrochemical reaction and the diffusion overvoltage ηdiff resulting from diffusion mass transfer resistance of ions driven by spatial variations of reactant concentrations in electrodes and the bulk of the liquid eis was used to determine these components in the lmo nihcf cell zhang et al 2019 fig 4 a shows its nyquist plots in source solutions with different li concentrations at 20 and 60 c from the nyquist plots four processes can be identified eliseeva et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 i the ultra high frequency region above 10 khz enlarged in fig 4c is related to the ionic transfer resistance ii the arcs in the high frequency range 10 hz 10 khz enlarged in fig 4c are related to the ion transfer through a surface film between the solid electrode and the bulk of the source solution iii the arcs within the medium frequency range 0 001 10 hz enlarged in fig 4b are related to the charge transfer iv lines inclined at a constant angle to the abscissa within the low frequency range 0 001 hz indicate the mass transfer behaviors of ions more details are described in part 10 of si we fitted experimental data to the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of fig 4a using the z view software scribner associated inc the fitted results are plotted as solid lines in fig 4a c and the fitted parameters of the equivalent circuit are summarized in table 1 fig 4c shows that the nyquist plots obtained at 20 c have approximately the same intercepts with the real axis at 1 2 ω while those obtained at 60 c shift their intercepts to 0 7 ω this indicates that when the temperature increases from 20 to 60 c ionic transfer resistance in the electrolyte r o decreases by around 40 resulting in a much lower ohmic drop ηo the significant decrease in ηo is significant for large scale electrochemical li extraction devices zanzola et al 2019 table 1 shows that the surface film capacitance cf in parallel with the surface film resistance rf are small under all conditions consistent with the previous reports that the surface film effects can be neglected in aqueous electrolytes marchini et al 2018 intercalation of li in lmo involves li de solvation adsorption on tetrahedral sites of lmo electron transfer to surface mn ⅳ ions and the subsequent intercalation into the tetrahedral sublattice of spinel lmo marchini et al 2018 the charge transfer resistance rct comes from the activation polarization driving the electrochemical reaction at the solid electrode surface ovejas and cuadras 2019 which can be described by the butler volmer equation details can be found in part 10 of the sm marchini et al 2018 ovejas and cuadras 2019 we compared rct extracted from the eis results table 1 in fig 4d the solid lines at 20 c rct increases dramatically from less than 7 ω in the source solution containing 30 mm li to more than 400 ω in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li resulting in a large η c t and thus the significant loss of the discharge capacity in source solutions with low li concentrations at 60 c rct only increases to around 110 ω in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li 27 7 of that at 20 c the much lower rct at 60 c led to smaller η c t contributing to the observed higher discharge capacity we further plotted rct against the inverse square root of li concentration cli ss 0 5 in fig 4e at 20 and 60 c the ratio of reaction constants at the two temperatures k0 h k0 l can be calculated by the slops of the linear fitting of rct vs cli ss 0 5 kh and kl marchini et al 2018 4 k 0 h k 0 l k l k h t h t l 167 64 47 2516 333 15 k 293 15 k 4 this result indicates that the reaction constant of li intercalation into lmo increased by 3 times when the temperature rose from 20 to 60 c leading to lower activation polarization and higher reaction rates the double layer capacitance cdl is related to the li adsorption at electrode electrolyte interfaces which may serve as a barrier for li intercalation fedorov and kornyshev 2014 thomas et al 2018 table 1 shows that cdl declines with the decrease of li concentration and increases with the temperature increase this result suggests that the thick double layer formed in low li concentration solutions becomes thinner at the high temperature mitigating the barrier effects and enabling more efficient li mass transfer the diffusion region in the low frequency range was fitted by the warburg impedance element table 1 and fig 4d show that both the diffusion resistance rw and the constant tw related to the effective diffusion length and diffusion coefficient increase dramatically with the decrease of li concentration indicating inefficient li mass transfer raising the temperature can effectively reduce the rw and tw for example in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li rw and tw are 4972 and 79119 ω respectively at 20 c and they decrease to 924 4 and 924 4 ω respectively when the temperature rises to 60 c the low frequency 10 3 hz impedance data further show that higher diffusion coefficient df contributed to the observed changes in rw and tw at the high temperature fig 4f shows that most df calculated from the impedance data as described in part 10 in the sm varies within the range of 10 12 to 10 14 cm2 s 1 which are lower than the values reported in previous studies of li ion batteries yi et al 2020 due to the much lower li concentration in the source solutions used in li extraction df declines with the decrease of li concentrations and it drops to lower than 10 15 cm2 s 1 in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li at 20 c increasing the electrolyte temperature to 60 c can effectively enhance the diffusion of li with much higher df for example df in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li at 60 c increases to around 1 50 10 14 cm2 s 1 approximately 20 times higher than at 20 c the enhancement of li diffusion at the high temperature mitigated the concentration polarization resulting in smaller diffusion overvoltage ηdiff and higher discharge capacity especially in source solutions with low li concentrations overall the above mechanistic analyses indicate that the increased li recovery capacity of the lmo nihcf cell in source solutions with low li concentrations at the higher temperature is mainly attributed to the improved kinetics the equilibrium voltage of the cell has a minor increase with increasing temperature more importantly the higher temperature reduces the overall resistance of the source solution accelerates the li intercalation reaction by mitigating the activation polarization and decreasing the charge transfer resistance and improving the diffusion of li in the source solution thermally assisted electrochemical process for li extraction from simulated seawater as discussed above an electrochemical li extraction system becomes more efficient at higher temperatures in low li concentration source solutions we proposed to use a thermally assisted electrochemical process to extract li at a high temperature directly from low li concentration sources such as seawater and ro brines from desalination plants as illustrated in fig 5 a the source solution with low li concentrations can be first heated by low grade heat sources such as solar thermal collectors and industrial waste heat sources subsequently li extraction can be carried out in 2 step cycles first in a li capturing module li in the heated source solution is intercalated into the electrode i e lmo by the discharging next the electrodes i e lmo and nihcf are transferred to a li recovery module filled with a recovery solution at a lower temperature electricity is supplied to charge the electrochemical cell so li is released from the lmo electrode into the recovery solution by repeating this cycle high purity li is concentrated in the recovery solution furthermore three approaches can be used to improve the thermal energy utilization efficiency of the system first a heat exchanger is employed to recover the thermal energy in the outflow of the li capturing module second a thermal driven membrane process is integrated with the li capturing module which utilizes the temperature difference between the heated source solution and room temperature permeate to concentrate the high salinity li containing source solution and produce freshwater as a byproduct here the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd process was employed in this study as an example but the integrated process in this system is not limited to dcmd other thermal driven membrane processes e g other configurations of md and pervaporation can also be employed in this system based on different application scenarios third based on trec gao et al 2017 yang et al 2014 some thermal energy is converted to electricity by discharging the electrochemical cell with a positive temperature coefficient at a high temperature and charging it at a low temperature a lab scale setup as shown in fig 5b was built to demonstrate the proposed thermally assisted electrochemical system the source solution with an ultrahigh na li moral ratio of 20 000 is similar to that in seawater the source solution heated at 60 c was circulated between the reservoir and the li capturing unit including the md module and the lmo nihcf cell the vapor pressure difference generated from the temperature difference between the hot source solution 60 c and the cold permeate 20 c drove the water vapor from the hot side to penetrate through the pores in the membrane and condense on the cold side thus the high salinity source solution was further concentrated and freshwater was generated as a byproduct from the permeate side in this study the average freshwater production rate from the md module was around 13 2 kg m 2 h 1 based on the membrane s geometric area with a high salt rejection of 99 98 fig s13 in si the lmo nihcf cell was discharged at the current density of 0 1 ma cm 2 to the cutoff voltage of 0 v the li recovery unit was filled with recovery solution initially containing 30 mm licl and 30 mm kcl at 20 c the lmo nihcf was charged at the current density of 0 5 ma cm 2 to the cutoff voltage of 1 v to release the captured li the charging current density was optimized based on the current efficiency li purity in the recovery solution and time efficiency details in part 14 of si the li concentration in the recovery solution continuously increased while the k concentration decreased with multiple capturing and releasing cycles fig 5c shows galvanostatic discharge and charge profiles of the lmo nihcf cell in 5 cycles its discharge capacity in the 5 cycles was 39 65 29 14 24 10 23 75 and 21 48 mah g 1 respectively in comparison when the lmo nihcf cell was operated in the conventional mode with discharging and charging steps both at the same temperature i e 20 c it was not capable of extracting li from the source solution with a low li concentration see details in fig s16 and its accompanying text in the sm it should be noted that the discharge capacity of the lmo nihcf in the thermally assisted mode gradually deteriorated with extended cycles which can be attributed to the stability of electrodes with high active material mass loadings the purity of extracted li was evaluated by measuring concentration changes of all cations i e li k na mg2 ca2 in the recovery solution after each cycle using icp oes fig 5d shows that the specific molar change of li in the recovery solution over the 5 cycles is 64 3 60 2 49 5 45 8 and 38 6 mmol m 2 based on the geometric area of the lmo electrode respectively the error bar of each result was the standard deviation generated from the results of 3 replicates details shown in part 4 and part 16 in the sm the decreased specific molar change of li ions in the recovery solution with the rise in the cycle number can be ascribed to the deteriorating discharge capacity of the cell as shown in fig 5c this phenomenon was also reported in previous studies of electrochemical lithium extraction battistel et al 2020 trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 it may be attributed to the unreleased li ions in the electrode materials during the charging step and the potential instability issue of the electrode materials meanwhile matching k concentration decreases in the recovery solution were also observed fig 5d consistent with the selective exchange mechanism of the lmo nihcf cell trocoli et al 2016 for other cations the increment of na in each cycle was around 34 3 56 0 mmol m 2 which can be ascribed to the ultrahigh na li molar ratio in the source solution however it should be noted that the ultrahigh na li molar ratio of 20 000 in the source solution dropped to less than 1 in the recovery solution we suspected that na mainly came from source solution residues trapped in lmo nihcf electrodes when they were moved from the li capturing unit to the li recovering unit besides the concentration of mg2 and ca2 showed negligible changes less than 3 mmol m 2 in all cycles fig 5d the li selectivity coefficients i e the ratio of the molar concentration change of li to that of secondary cations after the 5 cycles in the recovery solution were 1 15 li na 32 32 li mg and 36 29 li ca see details in table s2 the thermally assisted electrochemical system recovered more than 0 25 mol m 2 li with an average purity of 51 79 from the seawater level source solution after 5 cycles fig 5e the high current efficiency over the 5 cycles remained 80 fig 5e indicates no significant side reactions the electrical energy consumption for each cycle is presented in fig 5f calculated by integrating the area of discharge and charge curves against the electric charges e vs q the electrical energy consumption was 11 3 16 0 wh mol 1 li the gradual increase in the electrical energy consumption mainly originated from increased thermodynamic equilibrium voltage of the charging step with the rise of the li ions and the decrease of the k ions in the recovery solution with the cycling operation we want to emphasize that the electrical energy consumption in the thermally assisted mode is less than that of the conventional mode and a newly developed solar assisted electrochemical system for lithium extraction xie et al 2021 this is because trec can directly convert thermal energy in source solutions into electricity to offset the electrical energy consumption gao et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 further studies on alleviating the issues of discharge capacity deterioration and energy consumption increase with the cycling operation of the thermally assisted electrochemical system can focus on optimizing the operating parameters e g charging methods recovery solution etc and employing new electrode materials or fabrication methods in this work the low grade thermal energy was proposed to provide suitable reaction conditions for the thermally assisted electrochemical system for lithium recovery which has excellent potential to be recycled and recovered by introducing an efficient heat exchanger in the practical application of the system moreover if the seawater brine is available as the lithium source the thermal energy consumption and cost for the related facilities in the system can be further reduced for example the concentration of the seawater desalination brine can go up to 5 6 times higher than the original seawater using some newly developed seawater reverse osmosis systems e g osmotically assisted reverse osmosis system bartholomew et al 2017 as a result the energy required and related costs for the thermally assisted electrochemical system facilities can be further reduced 5 6 times for extracting the same amount of lithium from seawater under the global freshwater scarcity and the concept of zero liquid discharge for seawater desalination the amount of high salinity seawater brine will be further increased choi et al 2019 panagopoulos 2022 zhang et al 2021 we further compared the performance of the thermally assisted electrochemical extraction process in this study with other li extraction methods reported in recent studies the details of comparative data can be found in part 17 and table s2 in the sm fig 6 a shows that na li molar ratios of source solutions used in previous studies are less than 103 lower na li molar ratios are beneficial in improving the purity of extracted li a lower current density would be required in conventional electrochemical li extraction processes i e operated at room temperatures to achieve a high discharge capacity in source solutions with a high na li molar ratio which reduces li extraction speed the total amount of extracted li divided by the operation time sacrificing time efficiency and significantly increasing the energy consumption of circulation pumps over the extended operation time fig 6a shows that the thermally assisted electrochemical extraction process can recover a relatively high purity of li 51 from a source solution with one of the highest na li molar ratios at 20 000 similar to seawater further the high current density used in this study 12 5 ma g 1 of lmo fig 6b enabled a rapid li extraction with a high li extraction rate 36 8 mg g 1 day 1 fig 6c which is much higher than many previous studies such as 5 mg g 1 day 1 by adsorption methods han et al 2012 hong et al 2015 park et al 2015 umeno et al 2002 and 10 mg g 1 day 1 by conventional electrochemical or light assisted extraction methods huang and wang 2019 kim et al 2019 conclusion elevating the temperature of low li concentration source solutions can effectively increase the li extraction capacity by electrochemical cells the discharge capacity of lmo nihcf cells increases from 17 8 mah g 1 at 20 oc to 52 2 mah g 1 at 60 oc in 3 mm li source solution or from 10 to 31 5 mah g 1 in the 0 15 mm li source solution xps xrd and thermodynamic and kinetic analyses by eis show that the thermodynamic equilibrium voltage of lmo nihcf cells has minor shifts when the temperature rises from 20 to 60 c instead the ionic transfer resistance in source solutions decreases by around 40 the reaction constant of li intercalation into lmo increases 3 times and the diffusion coefficient of li increases 20 times from below 10 15 to 1 50 10 14 cm2 s 1 accordingly the thermally assisted electrochemical system is demonstrated which uses low grade waste heat to warm source solutions to 60 c enabling rapid and selective li extraction at 36 8 mg g 1 day 1 based on the mass of lmo and an average purity of 51 79 from simulated seawater 0 15 mm li and na li molar ratio of 20 000 this li extraction performance outperforms most previously reported adsorption based or electrochemical based methods furthermore the integrated trec and dcmd enable heat to electricity conversion with a low electrical energy consumption of 11 3 16 0 wh mol 1 li and 13 2 kg m 2 h 1 freshwater generation considering the massive amount of low grade thermal energy which is widely available in the world as well as the potential generation of valuable byproducts from the system such as the ultrapure water and other metal resources in the seawater we believe that the current concept of the thermally assisted electrochemical system for lithium recovery from the seawater is feasible and promising this

introduction with the fast growing uses of lithium li ion batteries in portable devices electric vehicles and grid scale energy storage easily accessible li sources such as high grade li ores and high li concentration brines may quickly deplete yang et al 2018 there is abundant li more than 230 billion tons in seawater he et al 2020 yang et al 2018 mining li from the ocean can resolve potential li

calcium ca and potassium k ions with the large na li molar ratio up to 20 000 he et al 2020 the conventional evaporation precipitation method used to extract li from high concentration brines has a

furthermore strong acids are required to regenerate adsorbents nishihama et al 2011 electrodialysis has been explored to extract li from seawater in which an electric field drives li to transport through a selective membrane yang et al 2018 for example lai et al recently demonstrated a continuous multi stage electrodialysis method using a solid state electrolyte membrane which can enrich li

concerns zavahir et al 2021 additionally yang et al demonstrated a solar powered electrolysis method using a li superionic conductor nasicon type solid state electrolyte to directly generate metallic li from seawater yang et al 2018 however this method has potential safety issues because of highly oxidative perchlorate organic electrolytes li et al 2021 alternatively electrochemical ion pumping

trócoli et al 2015 trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 electrochemical ion pumping methods offer several advantages such as high selectivity fast production rate minimum use of chemicals and less waste generation battistel et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 however most previous studies only worked in high li concentration source solutions with low na li molar ratios less than 1000 or 100 battistel et al 2020 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the main obstacles to exploiting seawater as a li source in the previous studies may lie in the dramatically decreased li recovery capacity i e the amount of li that can be recovered in one cycle as well as low current density i e low li extraction rate available in electrochemical cells in low li concentration solutions 0 2 mm with large na li molar ratio 15 000 kim et al 2020 two recent studies reported li extraction from seawater level source solutions by electrochemical ion pumping methods kim et al reported an lmo ag electrochemical cell operated in a consecutive multi stage mode which achieved rapid and selective li extraction from simulated seawater desalination brine with a na li molar ratio of around 18 000 kim et al 2019 liu et al reported a pulsed electrochemical intercalation method using tio2 coated lifepo4 electrodes for li extraction from authentic seawater with around 1 1 molar ratio li to na recovery zhu et al 2020 however these results still have significant gaps in practical applications due to the use of costly noble metal electrodes complex operation protocols and poor scalability battistel et al 2020 we recently coupled a thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle trec using lmo and nihcf electrodes with poly vinylidene fluoride membrane based thermo osmosis e g membrane distillation md denoted as to trec to extract li from relatively high concentration brines yuan et al 2021 utilizing the positive temperature coefficient α i e the change of the electrode potential with respect to temperature see the details of temperature coefficient measurement and definition in part 8 of the sm of the lmo nihcf electrode pair i e the voltage of the lmo nihcf cell would increase at higher temperatures to trec is capable of converting some thermal energy from a warm li source solution into electricity which can offset the electrical energy required for li extraction liu et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 furthermore preceding battery material studies showed that li diffusion in the electrolyte and electrode materials might be accelerated at high temperatures kulova et al 2006 yang et al 2018 therefore we speculate that elevating solution temperatures may help achieve efficient li extraction from low li concentration source solutions in this study we first discovered that li extraction behaviors in low li concentration source solutions are temperature and concentration dependent characterization of lmo and nihcf electrodes upon li intercalation or k deintercalation showed their structure changes in heated solutions next we conducted comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic analyses to gain a mechanistic understanding of li extraction behaviors of isothermal lmo nihcf cells in heated source solutions based on the acquired knowledge we demonstrated that a thermally assisted electrochemical process based on to trec could achieve efficient li extraction from a seawater level source solution with an ultra high na li molar ratio i e 20 000 given the abundant availability and cost effectiveness of low grade thermal energy temperature 130 c from industrial plants geothermal wells or solar thermal collectors gingerich and mauter 2015 tavakkoli et al 2016 this process shows its potential in utilizing low grade heat for rapid and efficient li extraction from low li concentration source

130 c can be classified as low grade heat the heat sources with higher temperatures are generally more difficult to be obtained they will pose some challenges for the thermal insulation and heat exchange facilities to achieve high energy efficiency when we handle them on the other hand if the thermal energy temperature is too low and close to room temperature the effects and related mechanisms of using thermal energy may be hard to observe and investigate in many studies utilizing or recovering the low grade thermal energy 60 c or a temperature difference of 40 c between the low temperature was frequently selected as the typical temperature to investigate the effects of the low grade heat gao et al 2017 long et al 2020 straub and elimelech 2017 zhao et al 2022 in this study we also chose 60 c as a representative temperature of the low grade thermal energy because it is both high enough to show the temperature effects clearly and in an acceptable level to be handled in

can retain a high discharge capacity of around 60 70 mah g 1 in 30 cycles with high coulombic efficiency of 98 2 fig s7 indicating the stable cyclability of lmo and nihcf electrodes for electrochemical li extraction we discovered that the li extraction capability of lmo nihcf cells strongly depends on the li concentration and temperature of source solutions the li extraction capability refers to the mass of li that can be intercalated into lmo electrodes during the discharge of lmo nihcf cells battistel et al 2020 kim et al 2020 fig 1 shows galvanostatic discharge profiles of lmo nihcf cells in three source solutions which contain the same concentration of nacl 3 m kcl mgcl2 and cacl2 each 30 mm but different concentrations of licl 30 3 or 0 15 mm these three li concentrations were selected to represent potential source solutions with na li molar ratios ranging from 100 i e brines to 20 000 i e seawater fig 1a shows the discharge profiles in the source solution containing 30 mm licl at 20 oc under a constant discharge current density of 0 5 ma cm 2 the discharge capacity is about 60 mah g 1 similar to a previous study yuan et al 2021 however fig 1b and 1c indicate that when the li concentrations decrease to 3 and 0 15 mm the discharge capacities drop dramatically to less than 5 mah g 1 under the current density of 0 5 ma cm 2 the discharge capacity only recovered partially when the current density was reduced for example the discharge capacity was 17 8 mah g 1 under 0 25 ma cm 2 in 3 mm li source solution and only 10 mah g 1 under 0 1 ma cm 2 in 0 15 mm li source solution these results suggest that the low li concentrations and high na li molar ratios in source solutions are detrimental to li extraction kim et al 2020 although lowering current densities might recover some discharge capacity kim et al 2020 a significantly longer time and a larger area of electrodes would be required making li extraction at room temperature i e 20 c impractical for source solutions with low li concentrations e g 3 mm with a high na li molar ratio 1000 next we increased the source solution to 60 c fig 1d f show that the discharge capacities increase significantly the increases are more substantial in the source solutions with low li concentrations 3 mm than with the high concentration 30 mm as can be seen from fig 1d in the source solution with a relatively high li concentration 30 mm and a low na li molar ratio 100 the discharge capacity slightly increased from 59 2 to 64 1 mah g 1 8 2 increment with the temperature increasing from 20 to 60 c in the source solution with 3 mm li concentration fig 1e the discharge capacity increased from 2 7 to 33 1 mah g 1 under 0 5 ma cm 2 1130 increment and from 17 8 to 52 2 mah g 1 under 0 25 ma cm 2 193 increment when the temperature increased from 20 to 60 c in the source solution with 0 15 mm li concentration fig 1f the discharge capacity increased from 4 2 to 7 0 mah g 1 under 0 5 ma cm 2 66 increment from 6 4 to 15 4 mah g 1 under 0 25 ma cm 2 140 increment or from 9 3 to 31 8 mah g 1 under 0 10 ma cm 2 240 increment when the temperature increased from 20 to 60 c it should be noted that the increased discharge capacities of the electrochemical system at 60 c were not contributed by the intercalation of other cations except li into the lmo electrode from the source solutions which can be demonstrated by the cv test of the lmo electrode in the source solution without li at 60 c see fig s8 characterization of lmo and nihcf by xps and xrd xps and xrd were employed to characterize lmo and nihcf electrodes upon li or k intercalation to understand the above concentration and temperature dependent li extraction capacity changes the samples are denoted as ht or lt x lmo or nihcf where ht refers to 60 c lt represents 20 c and x is the concentration of li in source solutions in the unit of mm for example ht 0 15 lmo refers to lmo after being discharged in 60 c source solution with 0 15 mm li based on eq 1 the valance number of mn in lmo would decrease upon li insertion while fe valance number in nihcf would increase with k deintercalation mn 2p3 2 xps spectra in fig 2 a can be decomposed into two peaks corresponding to mn ⅲ at 641 7 0 2 ev and mn ⅳ at 643 0 0 2 ev respectively zhu et al 2020 the molar ratio of mn4 mn3 was determined by fitting the areas of these two peaks fang et al 2015 fig 2c shows that mn4 mn3 molar ratios decrease upon li insertion the changes are smaller in source solutions with lower li concentration indicating less li insertion consistent with discharge profiles shown in fig 1 mn4 mn3 molar ratios are much lower in source solutions at 60 c than at 20 c indicating that more mn4 were electrochemically reduced mn3 in lmo at the higher discharge temperature the differences in mn4 mn3 molar ratios between the high and low discharge temperatures were more significant in source solutions with lower li concentrations than high concentrations we further characterized lmo by xrd xrd patterns in fig 2b show that the xrd peaks of lmo shift towards smaller diffraction angles upon li insertion the smaller diffraction angles correlate with larger lattice spacings indicating more li insertion trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 we extracted the lattice parameter a of lmo from their 400 diffraction peaks fig 2d the a is larger in source solutions at 60 c than at 20 c indicating more li insertion into lmo structures consistent with xps results in fig 2a and discharge profiles in fig 1 xrd patterns of lt 3 lmo and lt 0 15 lmo also show some bifurcated diffraction peaks the left peaks can be ascribed to lithiated lmo while the right peaks come from delithiated lmo the details are explained in fig s9 and accompanying texts in the sm in contrast ht 3 lmo and ht 0 15 lmo only show xrd peaks from lithiated lmo indicating that higher source solution temperature benefits li intercalation we also characterized nihcf by xps and xrd which also showed that more fe2 in nihcf were oxidized to fe3 in source solutions at 60 oc than at 20 oc especially in the source solutions containing lower li concentrations details in part 7 of si it should be noted that the xrd patterns of both lmo and nihcf electrodes after electrochemical operation at 60 c have the same characteristic diffraction peaks as those of their initial state indicating that their crystalline structures can be retained at 60 c the structural stability of lmo and nihcf electrodes during the electrochemical lithium extraction process at 60 c was also reported in our previous study yuan et al 2021 the solubility of lmo and nihcf electrodes at the higher temperature was also evaluated experimentally in this study the results indicated that the solubility of lmo and nihcf electrodes in di water was not significantly affected by increasing temperature to 60 c and they can be stabilized at the higher temperature in this study the details and the analysis of the experiments are shown in part 7 of the sm overall the characterization of lmo and nihcf by xps and xrd confirmed that higher temperatures enable more li intercalation and k deintercalation especially in the source solutions containing lower li concentrations mechanistic analysis from thermodynamic aspects next we carried out mechanistic analysis from the thermodynamic aspect to understand the concentration and temperature dependent behaviors the li extraction capacity of the lmo nihcf cell is related to its galvanostatic discharge voltage e ovejas and cuadras 2019 trocoli et al 2016 2 δ e δ e e q η where eeq is the cell voltage at the thermodynamic equilibrium state η is the overvoltage the voltage deviation between the actual cell voltage and the equilibrium voltage related to kinetics in the cell eeq is a function of charges stored in its electrode materials q the concentration of li in the source solution cli ss and the reaction temperature t fig 3 a shows ocv changes of lmo and nihcf electrodes and the lmo nihcf cell in the source solution when the temperature varies from 20 to 60 c a fitting with a high linear correlation r2 0 98 provided the temperature coefficient α defined as the change of δ e e q with the temperature of lmo nihcf and the full cell at 0 053 0 548 and 0 601 mv k 1 respectively therefore according to the nernst equation and the definition of α when the temperature increases from t0 to t t0 t the change in eeq for the lmo nihcf cell can be expressed as the details are shown in part 9 of the sm 3 δ

0 δ t we plotted the calculated δ e e q δ e e q 0 vs c l i s s from 0 1 to 30 mm at t of 0 or 40 c t0 20 oc as dash lines depicted in fig 3b we also experimentally measured ocvs of the lmo nihcf cell in source solutions with li concentrations of 30 3 and 0 15 mm at 20 and 60 c and the results were plotted as solid squares and dots in fig 3b the experimental results agree with the calculated results fig 3b indicates that eeq of the lmo nihcf cell decreases when the li concentration in source solutions decreases eeq is higher at 60 oc than at 20 oc because the lmo nihcf cell has a positive α however the difference of eeq at different temperatures becomes smaller at lower li concentrations for example eeq between 20 oc and 60 oc drops from 25 mv in the source solution containing 30 mm li to less than 10 mv when in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li however fig 1 shows that the li extraction capacity is much higher at 60 oc than at 20 oc especially in source solutions with lower li concentrations thus the observed extraction capacity is unlikely to originate from the change of thermodynamic equilibrium under these conditions mechanistic analysis from kinetic aspects from the above thermodynamic analysis the kinetics of li extraction in the lmo nihcf cell other than the thermodynamic equilibrium may play more critical roles in the observed li extraction capacity changes the cell overvoltage η can be used to quantify the effect of the kinetics the larger η is the lower e and the sooner the discharge cutoff voltage is reached which would limit li extraction capacity and reduce electricity output ovejas and cuadras 2019 generally the η has three components ovejas and cuadras 2019 trocoli et al 2016 the ohmic drop ηo originated from the ionic transfer resistance the charge transfer overvoltage ηct required to overcome the activation barrier of the electrochemical reaction and the diffusion overvoltage ηdiff resulting from diffusion mass transfer resistance of ions driven by spatial variations of reactant concentrations in electrodes and the bulk of the liquid eis was used to determine these components in the lmo nihcf cell zhang et al 2019 fig 4 a shows its nyquist plots in source solutions with different li concentrations at 20 and 60 c from the nyquist plots four processes can be identified eliseeva et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 i the ultra high frequency region above 10 khz enlarged in fig 4c is related to the ionic transfer resistance ii the arcs in the high frequency range 10 hz 10 khz enlarged in fig 4c are related to the ion transfer through a surface film between the solid electrode and the bulk of the source solution iii the arcs within the medium frequency range 0 001 10 hz enlarged in fig 4b are related to the charge transfer iv lines inclined at a constant angle to the abscissa within the low frequency range 0 001 hz indicate the mass transfer behaviors of ions more details are described in part 10 of si we fitted experimental data to the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of fig 4a using the z view software scribner associated inc the fitted results are plotted as solid lines in fig 4a c and the fitted parameters of the equivalent circuit are summarized in table 1 fig 4c shows that the nyquist plots obtained at 20 c have approximately the same intercepts with the real axis at 1 2 ω while those obtained at 60 c shift their intercepts to 0 7 ω this indicates that when the temperature increases from 20 to 60 c ionic transfer resistance in the electrolyte r o decreases by around 40 resulting in a much lower ohmic drop ηo the significant decrease in ηo is significant for large scale electrochemical li extraction devices zanzola et al 2019 table 1 shows that the surface film capacitance cf in parallel with the surface film resistance rf are small under all conditions consistent with the previous reports that the surface film effects can be neglected in aqueous electrolytes marchini et al 2018 intercalation of li in lmo involves li de solvation adsorption on tetrahedral sites of lmo electron transfer to surface mn ⅳ ions and the subsequent intercalation into the tetrahedral sublattice of spinel lmo marchini et al 2018 the charge transfer resistance rct comes from the activation polarization driving the electrochemical reaction at the solid electrode surface ovejas and cuadras 2019 which can be described by the butler volmer equation details can be found in part 10 of the sm marchini et al 2018 ovejas and cuadras 2019 we compared rct extracted from the eis results table 1 in fig 4d the solid lines at 20 c rct increases dramatically from less than 7 ω in the source solution containing 30 mm li to more than 400 ω in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li resulting in a large η c t and thus the significant loss of the discharge capacity in source solutions with low li concentrations at 60 c rct only increases to around 110 ω in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li 27 7 of that at 20 c the much lower rct at 60 c led to smaller η c t contributing to the observed higher discharge capacity we further plotted rct against the inverse square root of li concentration cli ss 0 5 in fig 4e at 20 and 60 c the ratio of reaction constants at the two temperatures k0 h k0 l can be calculated by the slops of the linear fitting of rct vs cli ss 0 5 kh and kl marchini et al 2018 4 k 0 h k 0 l k l k h t h t l 167 64 47 2516 333 15 k 293 15 k 4 this result indicates that the reaction constant of li intercalation into lmo increased by 3 times when the temperature rose from 20 to 60 c leading to lower activation polarization and higher reaction rates the double layer capacitance cdl is related to the li adsorption at electrode electrolyte interfaces which may serve as a barrier for li intercalation fedorov and kornyshev 2014 thomas et al 2018 table 1 shows that cdl declines with the decrease of li concentration and increases with the temperature increase this result suggests that the thick double layer formed in low li concentration solutions becomes thinner at the high temperature mitigating the barrier effects and enabling more efficient li mass transfer the diffusion region in the low frequency range was fitted by the warburg impedance element table 1 and fig 4d show that both the diffusion resistance rw and the constant tw related to the effective diffusion length and diffusion coefficient increase dramatically with the decrease of li concentration indicating inefficient li mass transfer raising the temperature can effectively reduce the rw and tw for example in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li rw and tw are 4972 and 79119 ω respectively at 20 c and they decrease to 924 4 and 924 4 ω respectively when the temperature rises to 60 c the low frequency 10 3 hz impedance data further show that higher diffusion coefficient df contributed to the observed changes in rw and tw at the high temperature fig 4f shows that most df calculated from the impedance data as described in part 10 in the sm varies within the range of 10 12 to 10 14 cm2 s 1 which are lower than the values reported in previous studies of li ion batteries yi et al 2020 due to the much lower li concentration in the source solutions used in li extraction df declines with the decrease of li concentrations and it drops to lower than 10 15 cm2 s 1 in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li at 20 c increasing the electrolyte temperature to 60 c can effectively enhance the diffusion of li with much higher df for example df in the source solution containing 0 15 mm li at 60 c increases to around 1 50 10 14 cm2 s 1 approximately 20 times higher than at 20 c the enhancement of li diffusion at the high temperature mitigated the concentration polarization resulting in smaller diffusion overvoltage ηdiff and higher discharge capacity especially in source solutions with low li concentrations overall the above mechanistic analyses indicate that the increased li recovery capacity of the lmo nihcf cell in source solutions with low li concentrations at the higher temperature is mainly attributed to the improved kinetics the equilibrium voltage of the cell has a minor increase with increasing temperature more importantly the higher temperature reduces the overall resistance of the source solution accelerates the li intercalation reaction by mitigating the activation polarization and decreasing the charge transfer resistance and improving the diffusion of li in the source solution thermally assisted electrochemical process for li extraction from simulated seawater as discussed above an electrochemical li extraction system becomes more efficient at higher temperatures in low li concentration source solutions we proposed to use a thermally assisted electrochemical process to extract li at a high temperature directly from low li concentration sources such as seawater and ro brines from desalination plants as illustrated in fig 5 a the source solution with low li concentrations can be first heated by low grade heat sources such as solar thermal collectors and industrial waste heat sources subsequently li extraction can be carried out in 2 step cycles first in a li capturing module li in the heated source solution is intercalated into the electrode i e lmo by the discharging next the electrodes i e lmo and nihcf are transferred to a li recovery module filled with a recovery solution at a lower temperature electricity is supplied to charge the electrochemical cell so li is released from the lmo electrode into the recovery solution by repeating this cycle high purity li is concentrated in the recovery solution furthermore three approaches can be used to improve the thermal energy utilization efficiency of the system first a heat exchanger is employed to recover the thermal energy in the outflow of the li capturing module second a thermal driven membrane process is integrated with the li capturing module which utilizes the temperature difference between the heated source solution and room temperature permeate to concentrate the high salinity li containing source solution and produce freshwater as a byproduct here the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd process was employed in this study as an example but the integrated process in this system is not limited to dcmd other thermal driven membrane processes e g other configurations of md and pervaporation can also be employed in this system based on different application scenarios third based on trec gao et al 2017 yang et al 2014 some thermal energy is converted to electricity by discharging the electrochemical cell with a positive temperature coefficient at a high temperature and charging it at a low temperature a lab scale setup as shown in fig 5b was built to demonstrate the proposed thermally assisted electrochemical system the source solution with an ultrahigh na li moral ratio of 20 000 is similar to that in seawater the source solution heated at 60 c was circulated between the reservoir and the li capturing unit including the md module and the lmo nihcf cell the vapor pressure difference generated from the temperature difference between the hot source solution 60 c and the cold permeate 20 c drove the water vapor from the hot side to penetrate through the pores in the membrane and condense on the cold side thus the high salinity source solution was further concentrated and freshwater was generated as a byproduct from the permeate side in this study the average freshwater production rate from the md module was around 13 2 kg m 2 h 1 based on the membrane s geometric area with a high salt rejection of 99 98 fig s13 in si the lmo nihcf cell was discharged at the current density of 0 1 ma cm 2 to the cutoff voltage of 0 v the li recovery unit was filled with recovery solution initially containing 30 mm licl and 30 mm kcl at 20 c the lmo nihcf was charged at the current density of 0 5 ma cm 2 to the cutoff voltage of 1 v to release the captured li the charging current density was optimized based on the current efficiency li purity in the recovery solution and time efficiency details in part 14 of si the li concentration in the recovery solution continuously increased while the k concentration decreased with multiple capturing and releasing cycles fig 5c shows galvanostatic discharge and charge profiles of the lmo nihcf cell in 5 cycles its discharge capacity in the 5 cycles was 39 65 29 14 24 10 23 75 and 21 48 mah g 1 respectively in comparison when the lmo nihcf cell was operated in the conventional mode with discharging and charging steps both at the same temperature i e 20 c it was not capable of extracting li from the source solution with a low li concentration see details in fig s16 and its accompanying text in the sm it should be noted that the discharge capacity of the lmo nihcf in the thermally assisted mode gradually deteriorated with extended cycles which can be attributed to the stability of electrodes with high active material mass loadings the purity of extracted li was evaluated by measuring concentration changes of all cations i e li k na mg2 ca2 in the recovery solution after each cycle using icp oes fig 5d shows that the specific molar change of li in the recovery solution over the 5 cycles is 64 3 60 2 49 5 45 8 and 38 6 mmol m 2 based on the geometric area of the lmo electrode respectively the error bar of each result was the standard deviation generated from the results of 3 replicates details shown in part 4 and part 16 in the sm the decreased specific molar change of li ions in the recovery solution with the rise in the cycle number can be ascribed to the deteriorating discharge capacity of the cell as shown in fig 5c this phenomenon was also reported in previous studies of electrochemical lithium extraction battistel et al 2020 trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 it may be attributed to the unreleased li ions in the electrode materials during the charging step and the potential instability issue of the electrode materials meanwhile matching k concentration decreases in the recovery solution were also observed fig 5d consistent with the selective exchange mechanism of the lmo nihcf cell trocoli et al 2016 for other cations the increment of na in each cycle was around 34 3 56 0 mmol m 2 which can be ascribed to the ultrahigh na li molar ratio in the source solution however it should be noted that the ultrahigh na li molar ratio of 20 000 in the source solution dropped to less than 1 in the recovery solution we suspected that na mainly came from source solution residues trapped in lmo nihcf electrodes when they were moved from the li capturing unit to the li recovering unit besides the concentration of mg2 and ca2 showed negligible changes less than 3 mmol m 2 in all cycles fig 5d the li selectivity coefficients i e the ratio of the molar concentration change of li to that of secondary cations after the 5 cycles in the recovery solution were 1 15 li na 32 32 li mg and 36 29 li ca see details in table s2 the thermally assisted electrochemical system recovered more than 0 25 mol m 2 li with an average purity of 51 79 from the seawater level source solution after 5 cycles fig 5e the high current efficiency over the 5 cycles remained 80 fig 5e indicates no significant side reactions the electrical energy consumption for each cycle is presented in fig 5f calculated by integrating the area of discharge and charge curves against the electric charges e vs q the electrical energy consumption was 11 3 16 0 wh mol 1 li the gradual increase in the electrical energy consumption mainly originated from increased thermodynamic equilibrium voltage of the charging step with the rise of the li ions and the decrease of the k ions in the recovery solution with the cycling operation we want to emphasize that the electrical energy consumption in the thermally assisted mode is less than that of the conventional mode and a newly developed solar assisted electrochemical system for lithium extraction xie et al 2021 this is because trec can directly convert thermal energy in source solutions into electricity to offset the electrical energy consumption gao et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 further studies on alleviating the issues of discharge capacity deterioration and energy consumption increase with the cycling operation of the thermally assisted electrochemical system can focus on optimizing the operating parameters e g charging methods recovery solution etc and employing new electrode materials or fabrication methods in this work the low grade thermal energy was proposed to provide suitable reaction conditions for the thermally assisted electrochemical system for lithium recovery which has excellent potential to be recycled and recovered by introducing an efficient heat exchanger in the practical application of the system moreover if the seawater brine is available as the lithium source the thermal energy consumption and cost for the related facilities in the system can be further reduced for example the concentration of the seawater desalination brine can go up to 5 6 times higher than the original seawater using some newly developed seawater reverse osmosis systems e g osmotically assisted reverse osmosis system bartholomew et al 2017 as a result the energy required and related costs for the thermally assisted electrochemical system facilities can be further reduced 5 6 times for extracting the same amount of lithium from seawater under the global freshwater scarcity and the concept of zero liquid discharge for seawater desalination the amount of high salinity seawater brine will be further increased choi et al 2019 panagopoulos 2022 zhang et al 2021 we further compared the performance of the thermally assisted electrochemical extraction process in this study with other li extraction methods reported in recent studies the details of comparative data can be found in part 17 and table s2 in the sm fig 6 a shows that na li molar ratios of source solutions used in previous studies are less than 103 lower na li molar ratios are beneficial in improving the purity of extracted li a lower current density would be required in conventional electrochemical li extraction processes i e operated at room temperatures to achieve a high discharge capacity in source solutions with a high na li molar ratio which reduces li extraction speed the total amount of extracted li divided by the operation time sacrificing time efficiency and significantly increasing the energy consumption of circulation pumps over the extended operation time fig 6a shows that the thermally assisted electrochemical extraction process can recover a relatively high purity of li 51 from a source solution with one of the highest na li molar ratios at 20 000 similar to seawater further the high current density used in this study 12 5 ma g 1 of lmo fig 6b enabled a rapid li extraction with a high li extraction rate 36 8 mg g 1 day 1 fig 6c which is much higher than many previous studies such as 5 mg g 1 day 1 by adsorption methods han et al 2012 hong et al 2015 park et al 2015 umeno et al 2002 and 10 mg g 1 day 1 by conventional electrochemical or light assisted extraction methods huang and wang 2019 kim et al 2019 conclusion elevating the temperature of low li concentration source solutions can effectively increase the li extraction capacity by electrochemical cells the discharge capacity of lmo nihcf cells increases from 17 8 mah g 1 at 20 oc to 52 2 mah g 1 at 60 oc in 3 mm li source solution or from 10 to 31 5 mah g 1 in the 0 15 mm li source solution xps xrd and thermodynamic and kinetic analyses by eis show that the thermodynamic equilibrium voltage of lmo nihcf cells has minor shifts when the temperature rises from 20 to 60 c instead the ionic transfer resistance in source solutions decreases by around 40 the reaction constant of li intercalation into lmo increases 3 times and the diffusion coefficient of li increases 20 times from below 10 15 to 1 50 10 14 cm2 s 1 accordingly the thermally assisted electrochemical system is demonstrated which uses low grade waste heat to warm source solutions to 60 c enabling rapid and selective li extraction at 36 8 mg g 1 day 1 based on the mass of lmo and an average purity of 51 79 from simulated seawater 0 15 mm li and na li molar ratio of 20 000 this li extraction performance outperforms most previously reported adsorption based or electrochemical based methods furthermore the integrated trec and dcmd enable heat to electricity conversion with a low electrical energy consumption of 11 3 16 0 wh mol 1 li and 13 2 kg m 2 h 1 freshwater generation considering the massive amount of low grade thermal energy which is widely available in the world as well as the potential generation of valuable byproducts from the system such as the ultrapure water and other metal resources in the seawater we believe that the current concept of the thermally assisted electrochemical system for lithium recovery from the seawater is feasible and promising this

15563,coliphage are viruses that infect escherichia coli e coli and may indicate the presence of enteric viral pathogens in recreational waters there is an increasing interest in using these viruses for water quality monitoring and forecasting however the ability to use statistical models to predict the concentrations of coliphage as often done for cultured fecal indicator bacteria fib such as enterococci and e coli has not been widely assessed the same can be said for fib genetic markers measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods here we institute least angle

quality in recreational waters in recent years christensen et al 2021 francy et al 2020 jones et al 2013 this trend is partly due to the realization that persistence models using water quality

datasets n 100 that are typically available for recreational water quality forecast modeling although cultured fecal indicator bacteria fib predictive modeling is well established research suggests that viruses are a more likely causative agent of many recreational waterborne illnesses compared to bacterial pathogens begier et al 2008 sinclair et al 2009 soller et al 2010 as a result scientists are investigating the use of coliphage as an alternative fecal indicator for water quality testing coliphage f and somatic are viruses that infect coliform bacteria including e coli and may be effective indicators of the presence of human fecal contamination and the associated risk from enteric viruses because they are consistently found in municipal sewage and are similar in size and

further analyses 2 6 data analyses 2 6 1 modeling scenarios and data transformations regression models were generated for the seven microbial indicators f coliphage somatic coliphage cultured e coli cultured enterococci qpcr based e coli qpcr based enterococci and qpcr based bacteroidales prior to any data analyses cultured fib and qpcr based concentrations c were log10 transformed due to a large dynamic range with these datasets coliphage concentrations were transformed as log10 c 1 the small constant added to prevent negative log10 values as some coliphage concentrations were 1 0 a value of ½ the detection limit coliphage or llq qpcr was used for microbial indicator concentrations under the detection limit or llq respectively all covariate data were standardized subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation 2 6 2 microbial indicator measurement correlations pearson correlation coefficients r were used to examine the strength of associations between paired microbial indicator measurements by site to account for potential variability due to occurrence of non detects in some data sets correlation analyses were repeated 100 times for each paired measurement combination and an average r was calculated for each of the 100 coefficients microbial indicators below the detection limit coliphage and cultured fib or llq qpcr targets were assigned a unique uniform random number between zero and the respective detection limit llq significance of the correlation coefficients was assessed using a t test kendall and stuart 1973 2 6 3 model formulation all regression models were developed using the lars package version 1 2 efron et al 2004 in r version 4 1 3 r core team 2021 this package implements an iterative fitting technique lars lasso tibshirani 1997 where the linear regression coefficients are manipulated across successive steps and cp mallows 1973 is tracked the optimum model is determined by the step where cp is minimized this implementation is an l1 regularization technique in which it is possible for regression coefficients for specific covariates to shrink to zero in essence removing them from the model i e there is no evidence that they are useful 2 6 4 model predictive performance evaluation a cross validation approach was used to assess predictive performance of each site specific microbial indicator model for each model corresponding data were randomly split into ten folds each fold was withheld while the other nine folds were used to train a sub model each sub model was then used to predict microbial indicator measurements in the withheld data fold thus ten sub models were developed resulting in a single prediction for every data point as each data point occurs in a withheld data fold only once predicted microbial indicator values from each set of ten sub models was used to compute a standardized root mean squared error of prediction srmsep 1 s r m s e p m i m 1 n m p i m o i m 2 n m c m for each model nm is the number of observations p i m is the ith prediction o i m is the ith observed value and c m is the log10 average concentration of the modeled microbial metric along with a srmsep r2 pred was calculated via a regression using p i m predicted values to o i m observed values for each model for each model srmsep and r2 pred values were also standardized by dividing a given model performance metric by the maximum value observed across all models overall performance for each model was then estimated as follows standardized r2 pred 1 standardized srmsep standardized srmsep was subtracted from one because a high value indicates poor performance 2 6 5 covariate evaluation to assess covariate influence a single lars lasso model was generated for each site and response variable combination using all available measurements for each data set from this model output only the regression coefficients were used models were not used to evaluate predictive performance for each site regression coefficients for each microbial indicator and covariate combination 7 microbial indicators 16 covariates were displayed as heatmaps image function in base r with color gradient created via the rcolorbrewer package the overall influence for each covariate was then evaluated for each covariate across all microbial indicator and site combinations n 21 based on the following metrics 1 sum of regression coefficients absolute values used 2 frequency of non zero regression coefficients and 3 total score sum of metrics 1 and 2 in this analysis the influence of 24 h and 72 h cumulative rainfall were summed and called rainfall in the same way the influence of wind a and wind o were summed and this summed influence was called wind speed direction 3 results 3 1 fib qpcr measurements overall percentages of water sample measurements that gave llq concentration estimates for the entero1a enterococci ec23s857 e coli and genbac3 bacteroidales assays were 27 2 8 1 and 6 2 respectively positive and negative control sample acceptance criteria were met in all 50 instrument runs of the test samples for each method from the study data not shown each sample was also evaluated for suitable dna recovery and absence of amplification interference these quality controls indicated that the percentage of test sample analyses that failed to meet acceptance criteria in the enterococci e coli and total bacteroidales methods were 2 25 2 62 and 3 00 respectively composite standard curve performance metrics are summarized in table 1 individual qpcr measurements for the three study sites are shown in fig 2 3 2 microbial indicator summary statistics and correlations microbial indicator measurements targeting two coliphage somatic and f two cultured fib enterococci e coli and three fib genetic markers enterococci e coli and bacteroidales were used as response variables in lars models table 2 shows summary statistics of each data set including number of total samples number

mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation pearson correlation coefficients r between microbial measures varied by site fig 3 overall edgewater beach showed the most significant correlations 11 of the site specific datasets while washington park showed the least 5 there were only a few coefficients that were significant at every site cultured e coli paired with qpcr based e coli cultured e coli paired with qpcr based enterococci and qpcr based e coli paired with qpcr based enterococci 3 3 predictive model performance predictive performance metrics for each model n 21 are given in table 3 the top performing model fig 4 used the enterococci qpcr edgewater beach data set yielding an r2 pred of 0 52 and srmsep of 0 13 overall performance 1 87 seventy one percent of edgewater beach models 5 of 7 occurred in the top 10 based on the overall performance metric in contrast 71 n 5 of washington park models yielded overall performance scores in the bottom seven including the poorest performing model f overall performance 0 11 f coliphage models exhibited the poorest performance overall performance 0 31 regardless of site in addition all e coli qpcr models resulted in overall performance values ranked in the bottom 10 while enterococci qpcr models exhibited the opposite trend overall performance scored ranked in the top 10 including the top performing model somatic coliphage model overall performance scores ranked 3rd edgewater beach 7th grant park and 18th washington park 3 4 covariate influence lars regression coefficients for each covariate and model combination are shown in fig 5 model covariate regression coefficients ranged from 0 173 bacteroidales qpcr edgewater beach to 0 327 enterococci qpcr washington park discharge from the cuyahoga river at edgewater beach was the only covariate with regression coefficients not equal to zero regardless of microbial indicator model this covariate only available for edgewater beach the somatic and f coliphage models at washington park were the only instances where all covariate regression coefficients were equal to zero in contrast the enterococci qpcr model for edgewater beach was the only occurrence where all covariates yielded regression coefficients not equal to zero the aggregate influence of each covariate across all models is summarized in table 4 of the covariates available across all three sites rainfall exerted the most influence with non zero regression coefficient values in 52 11 of 21 of models bird abundance wave height and wind speed direction were the next most influential covariates across all microbial indicator models total score 1 53 five covariates exerted minimal influence on predictive models total score 0 74 with ph contributing the lowest total score 0 29 4 discussion 4 1 predicting bacterial and viral fecal indicator concentrations in great lake recreational waters this study reports the use of lars lasso modeling to predict concentrations of coliphage f and somatic cultured fib e coli and enterococci and qpcr based genetic markers e coli enterococci and bacteroidales using water and beach site covariate measurements collected five days per week over an entire beach season from three great lake recreational sites due to the limited size of recreational beach season data sets including those reported here the conventional practice of parsing a dataset into training and testing subsets was not feasible instead a cross validation approach was used to compare model predictive performance findings identified multiple trends first a clear difference in predictive model performance was observed between f and somatic coliphage types f coliphage models consistently resulted in poor predictive performance ranking the lowest of all microbial fecal indicators at each recreational beach site the reduced performance of f coliphage models could be due in part to a higher incidence of non detects 25 1 for f compared to 2 5 for somatic and overall lower concentrations in water samples compared to somatic coliphage as a result increasing sample volumes could help alleviate this issue however working with larger volumes 1 l presents additional logistical and expense challenges potentially making this solution impractical for routine water quality monitoring in addition there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that these virus types exhibit different occurrence patterns in untreated sewage korajkic et al 2020 animal fecal samples mcminn et al 2014 and across different surface water types riverine compared to lake beach wanjugi et al 2018 in contrast somatic coliphage predictive modeling exhibited good overall performance table 3 at grant park 1 39 and edgewater beach 1 61 suggesting that this viral indicator could be an important fecal indicator tool for future water quality forecasting applications second enterococci and bacteroidales qpcr outperformed e coli qpcr regardless of site unlike f coliphage e coli qpcr exhibited a reasonable frequency of non detects across samples 5 9 suggesting a different explanation one possible hypothesis is the presence of naturalized e coli populations in soils and beach sand a phenomenon that has been reported in multiple great lake studies ishii et al 2007 ishii et al 2006 the persistence and propagation of naturalized e coli populations could obscure any links between measured covariates and the occurrence of this fecal indicator additional research is warranted to investigate the mechanisms resulting in poor performance of f coliphage and e coli qpcr fecal indicators 4 2 microbial measurement correlation trends new qpcr findings reported here for e coli enterococci and bacteroidales add to the previously published data set consisting of paired measurements of cultured fib and coliphage providing the opportunity to evaluate correlation trends between seven different microbial fecal indicator water quality metrics results are particularly useful because all measurements were generated from the same water sample grabs in the same laboratory utilizing standardized protocols for each methodology correlation analyses identified several trends providing potential insights into the co occurrence or lack thereof between these water quality microbial measures average correlation coefficients r between cultured e coli and qpcr measurements ranged from 0 64 edgewater beach to 0 87 grant park and were significant p 0 05 regardless of sampling site in contrast a significant correlation between enterococci measurements was only observed at one site edgewater beach r 0 90 p 0 001 previous studies investigating fib culture and qpcr paired measurements at great lakes beach sites report similar findings suggesting that the degree of correlation is likely influenced by site specific conditions lavender and kinzelman 2009 shrestha and dorevitch 2019 whitman et al 2010 while correlations between culture and qpcr measurements of e coli and enterococci are well documented little is known regarding the level of agreement between coliphage and qpcr fib metrics in this study coliphage exhibited markedly lower correlations with paired qpcr fecal indicator measurements with most comparisons resulting in non significant results p 0 05 suggesting that the occurrence of these viral and bacterial fecal indicators in great lake recreational beach waters are governed by different conditions potential factors might include different animal source shedding patterns or variable fate and transport behaviors a recent study comparing coliphage with e coli qpcr paired measurements in untreated sewage samples collected across the contiguous united states reported a similar trend where somatic coliphage did not significantly correlate with e coli qpcr r 0 21 p 0 15 but f coliphage exhibited a weak correlation r 0 41 p 0 003 korajkic et al 2020 further research could help elucidate factors contributing to these different occurrence patterns 4 3 the influence of predictive model covariates many covariates were used to predict bacterial and viral fecal indicator concentrations resulting in several notable trends of the covariates used in all models rainfall was the most influential table 4 echoing findings from other microbial water quality modeling efforts focused on cultured fib at recreational beach sites nevers and whitman 2005 whitman and nevers 2008 findings also lend support to the development of a potential core set of physical and beach parameter measurements for future water quality forecasting applications in the great lakes basin as approximately 25 of the covariate data sets exerted minimal influence on microbial indicator predictive models table 4 reducing the number of covariate measurements needed to predict water quality would streamline future applications as well as lower data collection costs the analysis of covariate influence also provided useful clues about potential fecal sources of pollution at sites for example bird abundance was the second most influential covariate across all models table 4 fig 5 notably at grant park and edgewater beach information on potential sources of fecal pollution can help managers identify sites for future microbial source tracking analyses findings also demonstrated the utility of measuring discharge in nearby lotic hydrologic elements e g the importance of cuyahoga discharge at edgewater beach both grant park and washington park are also likely influenced by nearby lotic inputs oak creek and trail creek respectively but discharge in these systems was not measured in this study due to the absence of permanent gauge stations the absence of this potentially useful covariate could in part have contributed to lower model predictive performance at these two sites versus edgewater beach additional research is needed to confirm covariate importance trends identified in this study 5 conclusion lars lasso predictive modeling with cross validation was used to compare the predictive performance of models of coliphage f and somatic cultured e coli and enterococci and qpcr based e coli enterococci and bacteroidales measures using a suite of environmental covariates at three recreational beach sites in the great lakes basin key findings include models yielded highly variable srmsep and r2 pred measures indicating that some microbial measures may be more amenable to statistical modeling approaches than others somatic coliphage models performed at a similar level or better compared to cultured and qpcr fib while f coliphage models consistently performed poorly enterococci and bacteroidales qpcr outperformed e coli qpcr regardless of beach site rainfall bird abundance wave height and wind speed direction were the most influential covariates across all models approximately 25 of covariates exerted minimal influence on predictive models suggesting a potential core set of physical and beach parameters may be optimal for future water quality forecasting applications in the great lakes basin additional research is warranted to further characterize the suitability of statistical predictive models for recreational water quality forecasting of virus and bacterial fecal indicators and confirm trends observed in this study findings also provided useful insights on water quality forecasting in the great lakes demonstrating a challenging reality there can be a large degree of variability from one site to another while lars allowed for the successful comparison of different microbial indicator predictive performance and identified important differences between coliphage types and qpcr based fecal indicators future studies with larger sample sizes could be

15563,coliphage are viruses that infect escherichia coli e coli and may indicate the presence of enteric viral pathogens in recreational waters there is an increasing interest in using these viruses for water quality monitoring and forecasting however the ability to use statistical models to predict the concentrations of coliphage as often done for cultured fecal indicator bacteria fib such as enterococci and e coli has not been widely assessed the same can be said for fib genetic markers measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods here we institute least angle

quality in recreational waters in recent years christensen et al 2021 francy et al 2020 jones et al 2013 this trend is partly due to the realization that persistence models using water quality measures taken one day to predict quality on the following day are often inaccurate whitman and nevers 2008 and waiting 8 24 h for cultured microorganisms to be counted usepa 2021 reduces the level of public health protection in recreational waters wymer et al 2021 statistical predictive models could allow for public advisories to be issued quickly enough to inform beach attendance on the same day of use brooks et al 2013 recreational water quality fecal indicator data such as cultured enterococci and e coli are often modeled using least squares fitting via a multiple linear regression framework de brauwere et al 2014 least angle regression with lasso lars lasso efron et al 2004 modifies the linear regression approach by constraining the sum of absolute regression coefficients i e l1 regularization providing a method for identifying important unnecessary covariates filtering highly collinear covariates and reducing the overfitting of training data linear regression based methods although sometimes outperformed by machine learning techniques like random forests and boosted models brooks et al 2016 thoe et al 2012 may be less susceptible to overfitting with smaller datasets n 100 that are typically available for recreational water quality forecast modeling although cultured fecal indicator bacteria fib predictive modeling is well established research suggests that viruses are a more likely causative agent of many recreational waterborne illnesses compared to bacterial pathogens begier et al 2008 sinclair et al 2009 soller et al 2010 as a result scientists are investigating the use of coliphage as an alternative fecal indicator for water quality testing coliphage f and somatic are viruses that infect coliform bacteria including e coli and may be effective indicators of the presence of human fecal contamination and the associated risk from enteric viruses because they are consistently found in municipal sewage and are similar in size and structure to some human enteric viruses havelaar et al 1993 king et al 2011 mcminn et al 2017a coliphage are found in the digestive systems of humans and other warm blooded animals mcminn et al 2017a

sources of drinking water usepa 2006 in addition there is a growing interest in using genetic methods for recreational beach monitoring the primary advantage of these methods over culture based protocols is the ability to provide water quality information within a few hours griffith and weisberg 2011 several epidemiological studies report a significant relationship between the incidence of swimming related illnesses and genetic enterococci concentration estimates determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods in both marine and great lakes recreational waters colford

same data as presented in wanjugi et al 2018 instrumentation devices and measurement protocols are described in table s1 of wanjugi et al 2018 all measured covariates are routinely collected for statistical modeling of water quality francy et al 2013 usepa 2010a water parameters included water temperature c turbidity ntu dissolved oxygen mg l conductivity μmhos cm ph ultraviolet absorbance in the water column at 254 nm uv 254 1 m and dissolved organic carbon doc mg c l site parameters included wind speed km h wind direction ø air temperature c wave height m relative humidity cumulative rainfall 24 h 48 h and 72 h mm photosynthetically active radiation par mol m2 s and counts of humans birds and dogs at the time of sampling at edgewater beach the discharge from the cuyahoga river was available from a permanent gauging station at its mouth usgs site 04208000 for this analysis wind speed wind direction and beach orientation angle were converted into alongshore wind a and onshore

further analyses 2 6 data analyses 2 6 1 modeling scenarios and data transformations regression models were generated for the seven microbial indicators f coliphage somatic coliphage cultured e coli cultured enterococci qpcr based e coli qpcr based enterococci and qpcr based bacteroidales prior to any data analyses cultured fib and qpcr based concentrations c were log10 transformed due to a large dynamic range with these datasets coliphage concentrations were transformed as log10 c 1 the small constant added to prevent negative log10 values as some coliphage concentrations were 1 0 a value of ½ the detection limit coliphage or llq qpcr was used for microbial indicator concentrations under the detection limit or llq respectively all covariate data were standardized subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation 2 6 2 microbial indicator measurement correlations pearson correlation coefficients r were used to examine the strength of associations between paired microbial indicator measurements by site to account for potential variability due to occurrence of non detects in some data sets correlation analyses were repeated 100 times for each paired measurement combination and an average r was calculated for each of the 100 coefficients microbial indicators below the detection limit coliphage and cultured fib or llq qpcr targets were assigned a unique uniform random number between zero and the respective detection limit llq significance of the correlation coefficients was assessed using a t test kendall and stuart 1973 2 6 3 model formulation all regression models were developed using the lars package version 1 2 efron et al 2004 in r version 4 1 3 r core team 2021 this package implements an iterative fitting technique lars lasso tibshirani 1997 where the linear regression coefficients are manipulated across successive steps and cp mallows 1973 is tracked the optimum model is determined by the step where cp is minimized this implementation is an l1 regularization technique in which it is possible for regression coefficients for specific covariates to shrink to zero in essence removing them from the model i e there is no evidence that they are useful 2 6 4 model predictive performance evaluation a cross validation approach was used to assess predictive performance of each site specific microbial indicator model for each model corresponding data were randomly split into ten folds each fold was withheld while the other nine folds were used to train a sub model each sub model was then used to predict microbial indicator measurements in the withheld data fold thus ten sub models were developed resulting in a single prediction for every data point as each data point occurs in a withheld data fold only once predicted microbial indicator values from each set of ten sub models was used to compute a standardized root mean squared error of prediction srmsep 1 s r m s e p m i m 1 n m p i m o i m 2 n m c m for each model nm is the number of observations p i m is the ith prediction o i m is the ith observed value and c m is the log10 average concentration of the modeled microbial metric along with a srmsep r2 pred was calculated via a regression using p i m predicted values to o i m observed values for each model for each model srmsep and r2 pred values were also standardized by dividing a given model performance metric by the maximum value observed across all models overall performance for each model was then estimated as follows standardized r2 pred 1 standardized srmsep standardized srmsep was subtracted from one because a high value indicates poor performance 2 6 5 covariate evaluation to assess covariate influence a single lars lasso model was generated for each site and response variable combination using all available measurements for each data set from this model output only the regression coefficients were used models were not used to evaluate predictive performance for each site regression coefficients for each microbial indicator and covariate combination 7 microbial indicators 16 covariates were displayed as heatmaps image function in base r with color gradient created via the rcolorbrewer package the overall influence for each covariate was then evaluated for each covariate across all microbial indicator and site combinations n 21 based on the following metrics 1 sum of regression coefficients absolute values used 2 frequency of non zero regression coefficients and 3 total score sum of metrics 1 and 2 in this analysis the influence of 24 h and 72 h cumulative rainfall were summed and called rainfall in the same way the influence of wind a and wind o were summed and this summed influence was called wind speed direction 3 results 3 1 fib qpcr measurements overall percentages of water sample measurements that gave llq concentration estimates for the entero1a enterococci ec23s857 e coli and genbac3 bacteroidales assays were 27 2 8 1 and 6 2 respectively positive and negative control sample acceptance criteria were met in all 50 instrument runs of the test samples for each method from the study data not shown each sample was also evaluated for suitable dna recovery and absence of amplification interference these quality controls indicated that the percentage of test sample analyses that failed to meet acceptance criteria in the enterococci e coli and total bacteroidales methods were 2 25 2 62 and 3 00 respectively composite standard curve performance metrics are summarized in table 1 individual qpcr measurements for the three study sites are shown in fig 2 3 2 microbial indicator summary statistics and correlations microbial indicator measurements targeting two coliphage somatic and f two cultured fib enterococci e coli and three fib genetic markers enterococci e coli and bacteroidales were used as response variables in lars models table 2 shows summary statistics of each data set including number of total samples number of sample non detects and below detection limit coliphage and cultured fib or llq qpcr number of samples that failed quality controls and descriptive statistics excluding non detects minimum maximum mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation pearson correlation coefficients r between microbial measures varied by site fig 3 overall edgewater beach showed the most significant correlations 11 of the site specific datasets while washington park showed the least 5 there were only a few coefficients that were significant at every site cultured e coli paired with qpcr based e coli cultured e coli paired with qpcr based enterococci and qpcr based e coli paired with qpcr based enterococci 3 3 predictive model performance predictive performance metrics for each model n 21 are given in table 3 the top performing model fig 4 used the enterococci qpcr edgewater beach data set yielding an r2 pred of 0 52 and srmsep of 0 13 overall performance 1 87 seventy one percent of edgewater beach models 5 of 7 occurred in the top 10 based on the overall performance metric in contrast 71 n 5 of washington park models yielded overall performance scores in the bottom seven including the poorest performing model f overall performance 0 11 f coliphage models exhibited the poorest performance overall performance 0 31 regardless of site in addition all e coli qpcr models resulted in overall performance values ranked in the bottom 10 while enterococci qpcr models exhibited the opposite trend overall performance scored ranked in the top 10 including the top performing model somatic coliphage model overall performance scores ranked 3rd edgewater beach 7th grant park and 18th washington park 3 4 covariate influence lars regression coefficients for each covariate and model combination are shown in fig 5 model covariate regression coefficients ranged from 0 173 bacteroidales qpcr edgewater beach to 0 327 enterococci qpcr washington park discharge from the cuyahoga river at edgewater beach was the only covariate with regression coefficients not equal to zero regardless of microbial indicator model this covariate only available for edgewater beach the somatic and f coliphage models at washington park were the only instances where all covariate regression coefficients were equal to zero in contrast the enterococci qpcr model for edgewater beach was the only occurrence where all covariates yielded regression coefficients not equal to zero the aggregate influence of each covariate across all models is summarized in table 4 of the covariates available across all three sites rainfall exerted the most influence with non zero regression coefficient values in 52 11 of 21 of models bird abundance wave height and wind speed direction were the next most influential covariates across all microbial indicator models total score 1 53 five covariates exerted minimal influence on predictive models total score 0 74 with ph contributing the lowest total score 0 29 4 discussion 4 1 predicting bacterial and viral fecal indicator concentrations in great lake recreational waters this study reports the use of lars lasso modeling to predict concentrations of coliphage f and somatic cultured fib e coli and enterococci and qpcr based genetic markers e coli enterococci and bacteroidales using water and beach site covariate measurements collected five days per week over an entire beach season from three great lake recreational sites due to the limited size of recreational beach season data sets including those reported here the conventional practice of parsing a dataset into training and testing subsets was not feasible instead a cross validation approach was used to compare model predictive performance findings identified multiple trends first a clear difference in predictive model performance was observed between f and somatic coliphage types f coliphage models consistently resulted in poor predictive performance ranking the lowest of all microbial fecal indicators at each recreational beach site the reduced performance of f coliphage models could be due in part to a higher incidence of non detects 25 1 for f compared to 2 5 for somatic and overall lower concentrations in water samples compared to somatic coliphage as a result increasing sample volumes could help alleviate this issue however working with larger volumes 1 l presents additional logistical and expense challenges potentially making this solution impractical for routine water quality monitoring in addition there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that these virus types exhibit different occurrence patterns in untreated sewage korajkic et al 2020 animal fecal samples mcminn et al 2014 and across different surface water types riverine compared to lake beach wanjugi et al 2018 in contrast somatic coliphage predictive modeling exhibited good overall performance table 3 at grant park 1 39 and edgewater beach 1 61 suggesting that this viral indicator could be an important fecal indicator tool for future water quality forecasting applications second enterococci and bacteroidales qpcr outperformed e coli qpcr regardless of site unlike f coliphage e coli qpcr exhibited a reasonable frequency of non detects across samples 5 9 suggesting a different explanation one possible hypothesis is the presence of naturalized e coli populations in soils and beach sand a phenomenon that has been reported in multiple great lake studies ishii et al 2007 ishii et al 2006 the persistence and propagation of naturalized e coli populations could obscure any links between measured covariates and the occurrence of this fecal indicator additional research is warranted to investigate the mechanisms resulting in poor performance of f coliphage and e coli qpcr fecal indicators 4 2 microbial measurement correlation trends new qpcr findings reported here for e coli enterococci and bacteroidales add to the previously published data set consisting of paired measurements of cultured fib and coliphage providing the opportunity to evaluate correlation trends between seven different microbial fecal indicator water quality metrics results are particularly useful because all measurements were generated from the same water sample grabs in the same laboratory utilizing standardized protocols for each methodology correlation analyses identified several trends providing potential insights into the co occurrence or lack thereof between these water quality microbial measures average correlation coefficients r between cultured e coli and qpcr measurements ranged from 0 64 edgewater beach to 0 87 grant park and were significant p 0 05 regardless of sampling site in contrast a significant correlation between enterococci measurements was only observed at one site edgewater beach r 0 90 p 0 001 previous studies investigating fib culture and qpcr paired measurements at great lakes beach sites report similar findings suggesting that the degree of correlation is likely influenced by site specific conditions lavender and kinzelman 2009 shrestha and dorevitch 2019 whitman et al 2010 while correlations between culture and qpcr measurements of e coli and enterococci are well documented little is known regarding the level of agreement between coliphage and qpcr fib metrics in this study coliphage exhibited markedly lower correlations with paired qpcr fecal indicator measurements with most comparisons resulting in non significant results p 0 05 suggesting that the occurrence of these viral and bacterial fecal indicators in great lake recreational beach waters are governed by different conditions potential factors might include different animal source shedding patterns or variable fate and transport behaviors a recent study comparing coliphage with e coli qpcr paired measurements in untreated sewage samples collected across the contiguous united states reported a similar trend where somatic coliphage did not significantly correlate with e coli qpcr r 0 21 p 0 15 but f coliphage exhibited a weak correlation r 0 41 p 0 003 korajkic et al 2020 further research could help elucidate factors contributing to these different occurrence patterns 4 3 the influence of predictive model covariates many covariates were used to predict bacterial and viral fecal indicator concentrations resulting in several notable trends of the covariates used in all models rainfall was the most influential table 4 echoing findings from other microbial water quality modeling efforts focused on cultured fib at recreational beach sites nevers and whitman 2005 whitman and nevers 2008 findings also lend support to the development of a potential core set of physical and beach parameter measurements for future water quality forecasting applications in the great lakes basin as approximately 25 of the covariate data sets exerted minimal influence on microbial indicator predictive models table 4 reducing the number of covariate measurements needed to predict water quality would streamline future applications as well as lower data collection costs the analysis of covariate influence also provided useful clues about potential fecal sources of pollution at sites for example bird abundance was the second most influential covariate across all models table 4 fig 5 notably at grant park and edgewater beach information on potential sources of fecal pollution can help managers identify sites for future microbial source tracking analyses findings also demonstrated the utility of measuring discharge in nearby lotic hydrologic elements e g the importance of cuyahoga discharge at edgewater beach both grant park and washington park are also likely influenced by nearby lotic inputs oak creek and trail creek respectively but discharge in these systems was not measured in this study due to the absence of permanent gauge stations the absence of this potentially useful covariate could in part have contributed to lower model predictive performance at these two sites versus edgewater beach additional research is needed to confirm covariate importance trends identified in this study 5 conclusion lars lasso predictive modeling with cross validation was used to compare the predictive performance of models of coliphage f and somatic cultured e coli and enterococci and qpcr based e coli enterococci and bacteroidales measures using a suite of environmental covariates at three recreational beach sites in the great lakes basin key findings include models yielded highly variable srmsep and r2 pred measures indicating that some microbial measures may be more amenable to statistical modeling approaches than others somatic coliphage models performed at a similar level or better compared to cultured and qpcr fib while f coliphage models consistently performed poorly enterococci and bacteroidales qpcr outperformed e coli qpcr regardless of beach site rainfall bird abundance wave height and wind speed direction were the most influential covariates across all models approximately 25 of covariates exerted minimal influence on predictive models suggesting a potential core set of physical and beach parameters may be optimal for future water quality forecasting applications in the great lakes basin additional research is warranted to further characterize the suitability of statistical predictive models for recreational water quality forecasting of virus and bacterial fecal indicators and confirm trends observed in this study findings also provided useful insights on water quality forecasting in the great lakes demonstrating a challenging reality there can be a large degree of variability from one site to another while lars allowed for the successful comparison of different microbial indicator predictive performance and identified important differences between coliphage types and qpcr based fecal indicators future studies with larger sample sizes could be

15564,biofouling is a hurdle of seawater desalination that increases water costs and energy consumption in membrane distillation md biofouling development is complicated due to the temperature effect that adversely affects microbial growth given the high relevance of md to regions with abundant warm seawater it is essential to explore the biofouling propensity of microbial communities with higher tolerance to elevated temperature conditions this study presents a comprehensive analysis of the spatial and temporal biofilm distribution and associated membrane fouling during direct contact md dcmd of the red sea water we found that structure and composition of the biofilm layer played a significant role in the extent of permeate flux decline and biofilms that built up at 45 c had lower bacterial concentration but higher extracellular polymeric substances eps content as compared to biofilms that formed at 55 c and 65 c pore wetting and bacterial passage to the permeate side were initially observed but slowed down as operating time increased intact cells in biofilms dominated over the damaged cells at any tested condition emphasizing the high adaptivity of the red sea microbial communities to elevated feed temperatures a comparison of microbial abundance revealed a difference in bacterial distribution between the feed and biofilm samples a shift in the biofilm microbial community and colonization of the membrane surface with thermophilic bacteria with the feed temperature increase was observed the results of this study improve our understanding of biofouling propensity in md that utilizes temperature resilient feed waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation biofilm distribution temperature gradient intact cells thermophilic microbial communities data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction md a hybrid thermal membrane desalination technology is gaining increased attention for its ability to produce high quality freshwater from seawater brine owing to its several distinct advantages including diminutive dependence on the feed water salinity and very high salt rejection elcik et al 2020 however md systems are susceptible to biofilm formation which is caused by the undesirable attachment of microorganisms cell debris and organic matter to membrane surface and within its pores that gradually develops over process time leading to biofouling bogler and bar zeev 2018 goh et al 2013b in the initial stage of this process a conditioning film layer is formed by the attachment of dissolved organic compounds and colloids on the membrane surface followed by bacteria cell adherence bar zeev et al 2015 as a result a multilayered nanoporous structure comprising a complex of live and dead bacteria embedded in the eps matrix would be developed bar zeev et al 2012 the structure of biofilms that grow on a membrane surface in md process is typical for biofilms formed in non pressurized systems and is looser compared to biofilms that grow on reverse osmosis ro membranes operating under high applied pressures bogler et al 2017 zodrow et al 2014 biofouling presents a substantial challenge to sustainable md operations by introducing additional mass and temperature resistances that negatively impact vapor transport across the membrane chen et al 2021 goh et al 2013b krivorot et al 2011 one of the major adverse effects caused by biofouling development is pore wetting that compromises membrane s hydrophobicity due to the adsorption of amphiphilic biofilm constituents bogler and bar zeev 2018 goh et al 2013a biofouling and subsequent pore wetting impair permeate quality and could result in premature initiation of membrane restoration cycles given that md is a thermally driven separation process the microbial activity in md systems is primarily dictated by the feed water temperature that regulates the prevalence and evolution of bacterial communities at each operating condition bogler and bar zeev 2018 liu et al 2019a elevated feed temperature affects the extracellular enzymatic activity of bacteria khan et al 2019 thereby playing an essential role in regulating biofilm development on a membrane surface jiang et al 2020 suggested that high feed water temperature promotes the eps release by the damaged cells accelerating the formation of a conditioning film an important prerequisite of subsequent biofilm development while the effect of feed temperature on biofouling development in md has been explored the reported results were not conclusive and heavily depended on a feed water type and experimental conditions for example krivorot et al 2011 inferred that effect of the feed temperature is more significant than the effect of hydrodynamic conditions the authors suggested that maintaining feed temperature above 40 c would substantially limit biofilm growth and proposed temperature cycling with the intermittent temperature increase to 70 c to reduce biofilm occurrence similarly to this bogler et al 2017 suggested that high feed temperatures might restrict biofilm formation contrarily to this bogler and bar zeev 2018 observed severe pore wetting due to excessive eps production caused by thermophilic bacteria when the feed temperature was increased to 65 c furthermore given that the md process is accompanied by the temperature stratification inside the md module mustakeem et al 2021 we expect that temperature gradient could directly affect biofilm development along the feed water path previous studies that explored biofouling propensity of the md process were conducted by utilizing feed waters from moderate climatic conditions e g estuarine water from long island sound ny zodrow et al 2014 or lake and river waters from nanjing province in china chen et al 2021 liu et al 2020 however it is well known that biofouling of sea water ro swro plants in hot climatic conditions is accelerated due to high solar radiation and the presence of shallow coastal lagoons that serve as feed water intakes maddah and chogle 2017 saeed et al 2019 given the high relevance of the md process to seawater desalination in the middle east and other regions with warm coastal waters it is important to explore biofilm propensity and associated fouling issues caused by seawaters containing microbial communities with potentially higher tolerance to elevated temperature conditions microbiological safety of produced water is another crucial factor that needs to be considered before md is up scaled to commercial desalination operations unlike ro process that utilizes a non porous membrane thereby creating a physical barrier that prevents microorganisms from penetrating to permeate side the integrity of microporous md membranes could be compromised by pore wetting which is triggered by the biofilm attachment goh et al 2013a considering the high marine biodiversity bacterial cells and endospores with dimensions that are lower or compatible with md membrane pore sizes are likely to pass to permeate side and cause its contamination during biofouling salazar and sunagawa 2017 this study explores mechanisms and major factors that influence biofilm formation potential and its effect on process performance and permeate quality during dcmd of the red sea water a common feed water source of swro and thermal distillation plants in the middle east fortunato et al 2020 rahmawati et al 2012 in dcmd feed and coolant streams are in direct contact with the hydrophobic membrane and vapor that evaporates at the feed side is condensed into the coolant stream we investigated the combined spatial and temporal effects of biofilm distribution over the membrane surface including its structure morphology and microbial organic composition at different feed water temperatures common to the md process a range of different techniques including optical coherence tomography oct flow cytometry fcm three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d feem and 16s rrna gene sequencing were employed to explore biofilm proliferation and its composition on the membrane surface bacterial concentration of the feed and permeate streams was also monitored to assess how biofilm formation would affect permeate quality and pore wetting the biofilm development patterns observed with temperature resilient feed waters will improve our understanding of biofouling mechanisms in md and serve as a beneficial practical source for md translation from a lab scale to fully operational technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 md membrane a commercial hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane membrane solutions china with polypropylene support and nominal pore size of 0 22 µm porosity of 68 5 contact angle of 160o 3o and liquid entry pressure of 76 kpa was used in this study 2 2 feed water real red sea water was used as a feed source in all experiments and its physicochemical characteristics can be found elsewhere alpatova et al 2019 in order to proliferate seawater microbial communities 20 g of bactotm yeast extract becton dickinson were added to a 5 l of red sea water the solution was incubated in a shaking incubator vwr model 5000 at 70 rpm for 24 h at 30 c and then diluted with 15 l of fresh seawater to make up 20 l each dcmd experiment was conducted with a fresh batch of water to ensure process reproducibility 2 3 dcmd experimental protocol the dcmd system was operated in a countercurrent mode with respect to the feed and coolant

cole parmer model 75211 70 provided volumetric flow rates of 750 ml min and 500 ml min for the feed and coolant streams respectively the feed and coolant temperatures were maintained using recirculating baths julabo model f32 he the initial volumes of the feed and coolant were 20 l and 2 5 l respectively the feed inlet temperatures were set to 45 c 55 c or 65 c and the coolant temperature was set to 20 c the 10k thermistors omega were installed at the dcmc cell s outlets and inlets to measure the temperature difference and connected to a data logger keysight model 34970a conductivity values in the feed and coolant tanks were measured using portable conductivity meters wtw cond model 3310 permeate fluxes were measured at one hour intervals by electronic balance mettler toledo model ml3002 connected to a labview data acquisition system national instruments ph of the feed water was measured daily using a cyberscan 6000 ph meter and was stable at 8 1 0 5 for all experiments after each experiment the feed and coolant lines were disinfected by circulating 20 l of 10 sodium hypochlorite sigma aldrich at 750 ml min for two hours and then rinsed twice with milli q water millipore advantage a10 the duration of each dcmd experiment was five days each experiment was duplicated to ensure its reproducibility 2 4 biofilm characterization 2 4 1 oct imaging in situ spatial biofilm distribution was performed using a spectral domain oct method the oct instrument thorlabs ganymede was equipped with a 930 nm wavelength central light source and a refractive index of

to 4 0 mm 4 0 mm of membrane surface the 2d cross sectional oct scans were performed at three different locations along the feed channel at the inlet in the middle and at the outlet fig s2 the

information si 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of feed temperature on dcmd performance 3 1 1 effect of feed temperature on permeate flux the dcmd system was operated at three different feed temperatures as seen in fig 1 a biofouling imposed a negative effect on permeate flux which declined with the increase of dcmd time however the flux decline patterns observed at different feed temperatures significantly diverged from each other while permeate fluxes in the experiment conducted at a feed temperature of 45 c smoothly decreased over the entire dcmd course a 12 h offset between the dcmd start and the first sign of flux decline was observed at a feed temperature of 55 c this result can be explained by higher solute back diffusion from the membrane surface caused by temperature increase which delayed the development of a conditioning film bogler and bar zeev 2018 however with the increased operation time more foulants reach the membrane surface so permeate flux start declining faster when the feed temperature was raised to 65 c the increased vapor flux enhanced the transport and deposition of organics and microorganisms on the membrane surface thereby creating additional resistance to vapor passage across the membrane as a result permeate flux steeply dropped within the first 12 h of operation followed by its smoother decrease with the increase in operating time as dcmd evolved permeate fluxes approached a steady state after five days of operation the highest permeate flux drop 79 was observed at 65 c the permeate flux declines at 55 c and 45 c were lower comprising similar values of 71 5 and 71 8 respectively the differences between the inlet and outlet temperatures tfeed tin tout for the feed stream and between the outlet and inlet temperatures of the dcmd cell tcoolant tout tin for the coolant stream followed the permeate flux decline trend with the highest tfeed and tcoolant observed at the beginning of the dcmd process fig 2 as operational time increased both tfeed and tcoolant decreased and reached a plateau after two days of dcmd the decreases in tfeed and tcoolant were more evident for the feed water temperatures of 55 c and 65 c compared to that of 45 c it is also essential to notice that tfeed and tcoolant were different due to differences in feed and permeate flow rates and some heat loss occurring in the md system the observed trends suggested that feed temperature considerably affected permeate flux and greater permeate flux decline was observed at the highest feed temperature of 65 c at which biofouling became more intense 3 1 2 effect of feed temperature on biofilm development the analysis of a biofilm growth at different feed temperatures revealed the formation of thicker biofilms as feed temperature increased from 45 c to 65 c after five days of operation the biofilm thicknesses were 95 10 µm 130 20 µm and 250 10 µm for experiments conducted at 45 c 55 c and 65 c respectively fig 3 this substantial difference in fouling layer thicknesses suggests that factors like biofilm structure and composition may also confer the changes in dcmd performance furthermore calculations of the average membrane surface temperatures after five days of dcmd which were 43 3 0 1 c 53 1 0 2 c and 62 8 0 2 c for the inlet water temperatures of 45 c 55 c and 65 c respectively see eqs 1 4 in the si have not revealed a significant difference between the inlet and membrane surface temperatures at any tested condition 2 c the observed effect implies that the increase in biofilm thickness has not aggravated temperature polarization near the membrane surface concurrently given an exponential increase of the vapor pressure with the increase of the feed water temperature the same increment of temperature decline would cause a larger vapor depression and corresponding permeate flux drop at 65 c compared to lower feed temperatures the increase in biofilm thickness with increasing feed temperature is correlated with the changes in permeate flux when a larger permeate flux decline was observed at the highest feed temperature of 65 c 3 2 changes in feed and permeate quality over process time 3 2 1 changes in permeate conductivity changes in permeate conductivity were continuously monitored as this important parameter serves as an indicator of the pore wetting process as seen in fig 1b permeate conductivities at tested feed temperatures promptly surged during the 1st day of operation from an average value of 15 5 µs cm followed by a smoother increase in the subsequent days as a result conductivity increase after 1st day was substantially slowed down and after five days of operation permeate conductivities were 123 3 µs cm 128 3 µs cm and 140 7 µs cm for the feed temperatures of 45 c 55 c and 65 c respectively the shape of conductivity curves can be related to different stages of biofilm development jiang et al 2020 suggested that conditioning film formed on a membrane surface due to adsorption of organic compounds reduces its hydrophobicity this may cause partial pore wetting and promote liquid transport across the membrane as a result a sharp increase in permeate conductivity was observed as dcmd continued microorganisms would spread over the membrane surface thereby forming a mature biofilm that inhibited pore wetting furthermore as shown in fig 1b conductivity increase was sparsely affected by the feed temperature causing only a slight elevation of permeate conductivity which remained well below typical conductivities of swro permeate this could be attributed to a cake layer build up that screens membrane pores and hinders feed passage to permeate side furthermore the cake layer formed on the membrane surface could prevent the attachment of the hydrophilic eps film to interior pore walls which is an important prerequisite of biofilm induced pore wetting zodrow et al 2014 when comparing wetting propensities of md and md bioreactor mdbr processes goh et al 2013a observed that eps layers that exist on a membrane surface in mdbr substantially deterred pore wetting as compared to that of md process the authors suggested that the feed water constituents had a more pronounced effect on wetting proliferation as compared to biofilm eps components that predominated in mdbr this finding is consistent with our results when a more profound conductivity increase was observed at the beginning of dcmd compared to the late dcmd stage when matured biofilm was formed it could be concluded that the cake layer deferred partial pore wetting thereby limiting the increase in permeate conductivity 3 2 2 changes in bacterial cell concentration in the feed and permeate as seen in fig 4 different trends were observed with respect to changes in bacterial concentration in the feed and coolant streams over the dcmd time the initial cell concentration in the feed tank varied in the range of 3 1 108 cells ml to 1 2 109 cells ml but promptly dropped within the 1st day of operation to 5 9 108 cells ml 2 3 108 cells ml and 1 1 108 cells ml at feed temperatures of 45 c 55 c and 65 c respectively fig 4a c generally the annual ambient seawater temperatures near the location of seawater intake are well below 45 c as such a temperature increase during dcmd process would exert heat stress on the bacterial population causing a sharp decline in the number of intact cells in accordance with this observation the extent of the intact cells decline was less at a feed temperature of 45 c as compared to that observed at higher feed temperatures of 55 c and 65 c with the increase in dcmd time the microbes became acclimated to elevated feed water temperatures so that the concentration of intact cells in the feed tank started to increase until it reached a stationary phase after around four days of the dcmd process after five days of dcmd concentrations of intact cells at feed temperatures of 55 c and 65 c declined due to accelerated apoptosis while bacterial cells presented in the feed water at 45 c continued to thrive this result indicates that milder feed temperatures closer to optimal bacterial growth conditions promoted bacterial proliferation for longer operating times while the number of intact cells significantly varied over the dcmd course due to initial thermal stress and subsequent adaptation to elevated feed temperatures the number of damaged cells has not significantly changed and fluctuated in a range of 5 3 106 cells ml 10 107 cells ml our results indicate that heat stress and subsequent decline in feed water bacterial populations exerted a considerably lower impact on their proliferation in the feed tank due to higher adaptively of the red sea microbial communities to elevated temperatures as compared to previously reported md studies that were conducted by utilizing colder atlantic ocean waters that resulted in a drastic 2 fold decline of bacterial populations and significantly longer succession time zodrow et al 2014 as shown in fig 4d f a different trend was observed with respect to changes in permeate bacterial cell concentration in our study tap water with a total bacterial cell concentration in a range of 1 8 104 cells ml 6 5 104 cells ml was utilized in the coolant loop of the dcmd system the bacterial count of the coolant stream increased with the increase in operating time until the third day for the feed water temperature of 65 c or the fourth day for the feed water temperatures of 45 c and 55 c an increase in the bacterial concentration of the coolant water observed in our study suggests that bacterial species with sizes smaller than membrane pore sizes could be carried to permeate side with water droplets due to partial pore wetting at the beginning of dcmd process see more details in section 3 4 as seen in fig 4d f bacterial passage to permeate side was slowed down with the increase in operating time due to biofilm development which deferred water droplets from entering membrane pores given the lack of nutrients in the coolant water microbial activity in permeate tank would be inhibited as shown by a substantial decline in the intact cells concentration and increased number of damaged cells after five days of dcmd operations the total numbers of bacterial cells measured at different feed temperatures were compatible with the cells concentrations detected in different commercially available bottled waters 103 cells ml to 106 cells ml nadreen 2021 the observed results suggest that bacterial cell concentration in permeate tank remained limited and exhibited a decreasing trend by the end of dcmd operation 3 3 spatial biofilm distribution along the membrane surface 3 3 1 spatial biofilm thickness distribution spatial biofilm distribution on the membrane surface at the end of each dcmd experiment was evaluated by the 2d cross sectional oct scans taken at the inlet in the middle and at the outlet of the dcmd cell as shown in fig s3 after five days of operation biofilm coverage of the membrane surface followed a similar trend for all three feed temperatures with an increase in biofilm thickness along the feed water path consequently thicker biofilms were formed in the middle and outlet zones on the membrane surface table s1 several factors could be accounted for this phenomenon first the feed flow that enters membrane cell would gradually transition from the uniform to laminar profile as it moves along the feed channel thus near the inlet the drag force near the membrane surface would be relatively larger as compared to the rest of the element as such the relative deposition and subsequent attachment of microbes would increase with increasing the distance from the cell s inlet part the feed temperature could also affect the bacterial growth even though the temperature gradient along the channel length is substantially lower than the difference in the maximum 65 c and minimum 45 c feed temperatures employed in our study this effect became more apparent at higher feed temperatures when biofilm thickness in the middle outlet zones substantially increased our observations are consonant with krivorot et al 2011 who reported elevated biomass accumulation at the end of a hollow fiber md module during seawater desalination the biofilm growth was more significant in the middle outlet area of the membrane and aggravated with the increase in feed temperature 3 3 2 spatial bacterial and eps distribution the spatial distributions of microbial and eps contents on the membrane surface after five days of dcmd operation at different feed water temperatures were analyzed as seen in fig 5 a consistent with biofilm thickness increase on the membrane surface the total number of bacterial cells was always higher at the middle outlet biofilm locations compared to the inlet middle locations at any operating feed temperature the total bacterial cell count increased with increasing feed temperature from 45 c to 65 c for both inlet middle and middle outlet locations and the number of intact cells in biofilm was substantially larger than the number of damaged cells this indicates the high sustainability of the red sea bacterial populations to adverse environmental conditions and emphasize that bacterial activity in biofilm continued during dcmd process in temperature conditions that substantially deviated from the ambient seawater temperatures when analyzing the ratio of the intact to damaged cells at each feed water temperature a pronounced difference in the ratio of intact damaged cells was observed fig 5b the measurements showed that the number of intact cells increased by 40 from 7 9 108 8 2 107 cells cm2 to 1 1 109 1 1 108 cells cm2 and by 33 from 1 2 109 1 1 108 cells cm2 to 1 6 109 1 8 108 cells cm2 when the feed temperature increased from 45 c to 55 c for the inlet middle and middle outlet locations respectively however a further increase in the feed temperature from 55 c to 65 c has slowed down bacterial cells proliferation so that the concentration of intact cells remained almost unchanged 1 2 109 1 4 108 cells cm2 and 1 6 109 1 9 108 cells cm2 for the inlet middle and middle outlet locations respectively concurrently the accumulation of the damaged cells in biofilm was accelerated with the increase of the feed temperature from 45 c to 65 c causing a 530 from 1 0 108 2 0 107 cells cm2 to 6 4 108 1 0 108 cells cm2 and 443 from 1 6 108 2 0 107 cells cm2 to 8 4 108 1 4 108 cells cm2 increase in the damaged cells concentration for the inlet middle and middle outlet locations respectively as shown in feem contour plots fig 6 an increase in the feed temperature from 45 c to 65 c led to a substantial reduction in the abundance of major eps constituents while four peaks with fluorescence signals representing protein like tyrosine like fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were identified at the excitation emission ex em wavelengths of 250 280 380 nm peak i 220 250 330 380 peak ii nm 220 250 380 nm peak ⅲ and 280 380 nm peak iv respectively at the feed temperatures of 45 c and 55 c only the protein like peak peak i was identified in the feem spectra of biofilm that grew at 65 c we expect that humic and fulvic like compounds present on the membrane surface at 45 c and 55 c can aggravate membrane fouling by forming interconnecting networks between the carboxylic groups and ca2 ions li and elimelech 2004 lin et al 2015 that are abundant in seawater alpatova et al 2018 thereby expediting the formation of denser and more rigid biofilms at lower feed water temperatures a further increase in the feed temperature is likely to lessen adhesion forces between the humic matter and membrane surface similar to reduced interactions between the alginate molecules and the ro membrane surface at elevated feed temperatures binahmed et al 2021 accelerated degradation of humic substances at high feed temperatures has also been reported maddah and chogle 2017 as such these processes could promote the disappearance of fulvic acid like and humic acid like peaks from the feem spectra at 65 c the fluorescence intensity of protein like substances which form nonporous fouling layers with higher resistance to heat and mass transfer also decreased with increasing feed water temperature given that water diffusion a predominant mass transport mechanism through the eps layer is slowed down compared to that of the bulk feed biofilms with higher eps content would exert higher mass transfer resistance concurrently the presence of bacteria in the biofilm matrix increases its porosity as the void volume of a cake layer increases with the increase in particle size crittenden 2005 given that bacteria sizes are considerably larger than those of organic molecules we can suggest that biofilms with higher eps content but lower bacterial concentration that grew on md membrane at lower feed temperatures would form more compact fouling layers compared to looser biofilms with higher bacterial content but less eps concentration that developed at higher operating temperatures the 3d feem analysis of spatial eps distribution revealed a higher intensity of fluorescence peaks in the middle outlet part of the membrane cell compared to that of the inlet middle part at any feed water temperature fig 6 however the diversity of fluorescent peaks became less pronounced with increasing feed temperature in both monitored locations which is somewhat counterintuitive as one would expect an increase in biofilm eps concentration with feed temperature increase as a bacterial response to heat stress liu et al 2019b this can be explained by considering changes in microbial communities that populated biofilms at different feed water temperatures as discussed in the next section the observed results showed a good adaptivity of the biofilm microbial communities to increased feed temperatures that are accompanied by a reduced abundance of eps constituents at higher feed temperatures 3 4 microbial community analysis 16s rrna sequencing analysis was conducted to characterize microbial community distributions in biofilms and feed waters at different feed temperatures dna extraction and sequencing library preparation yielded between 42651 and 83179 dna read for each biofilm feed water sample after quality control and bioinformatic processing in addition the number of detected operational taxonomic units otus was analyzed and the microbial community diversity was assessed by calculating shannon and simpson indexes table s2 the rarefaction curves fig s4 demonstrated that the sequencing effort was comprehensive enough to cover the otus diversity in the samples we further constructed a heatmap to show the top 25 most abundant microbial genera found in all tested samples fig 7 the microbial communities in raw seawater feed and biofilms were compared by conducting a principal component analysis pca as seen in fig 8 the raw seawater community was positioned far away from the communities corresponding to feed waters and biofilm samples although pca revealed more resemblance in microbial communities of the feed waters and biofilms as compared to that of the raw seawater notably different clustering trends were observed for the feed and biofilm samples at different feed temperatures specifically the microbial communities of the biofilms grown at 45 c samples differed significantly from those grown at 65 c manova p 0 005 reflecting more pronounced shifts in microbial communities at elevated feed temperatures the most abundant genera of raw seawater were notably different from those of feed waters that served as dcmd feeds thus as seen in fig 7 the total percentage of top 25 clustered bacteria at genus level in raw seawater was 58 4 which is lower as compared to feed waters 96 and biofilms 94 this result is consistent with their higher shannon index and lower simpson index compared to raw seawater table s2 the pioneering bacteria in raw seawater comprised of a patescibacteria otu 12 17 9 sar ii clade ia 16 2 nitrosopumilus 8 3 and unclassified deltaproteobacteria otu 23 7 some characteristics of these phylotypes are provided in section 3 of si of relevance for the dcmd process are patescibacteria and sar ii common members of the red sea water thompson et al 2019 with small genomes and ultrasmall cell sizes nakai 2020 patin et al 2021 tian et al 2020 hence they could pass through the pores of a membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 22 µm during partial pore wetting at the beginning of dcmd collectively we identified 11 genera that accounted for 59 7 of all microbes in the feed waters that were identical at all temperatures fig 9 a the distribution analysis of bacteria at a genus level fig 9b showed a remarkable shift in microbial communities composition with the increase in the feed temperature pioneering bacteria observed in feed waters comprised of two pillar phyla proteobacteria and firmicutes vibrio a common representative of tropical coastal seawater asplund et al 2011 was the leading proteobacteria present at any feed water temperature with a relative abundance of 34 3 fig 9c implying that this microorganism was well acclimatized to elevated feed water temperatures marinobacter a genus of proteobacteria that optimally grow at 40 c duran 2010 had a higher relative abundance at 45 c compared to its diminishing occurrence at 55 c and 65 c at 55 c the feed water was markedly enriched with two thermophilic species aeribacillus 30 8 and geobacillus 19 with the optimal growth conditions of 55 c 60 c yasawong et al 2011 and 60 c noll 2001 respectively following its temperature optima for growth when the temperature increased to 65 c the relative abundance of geobacillus raised to 31 5 making it the second most abundant microbial type in the feed water a substantial presence of the extreme thermophile thermoaerobacter 8 6 an inhabitant of marine thermal vents wery et al 2002 was also recorded at 65 c fig 7 the presence of endospores of thermophilic bacteria in non thermophilic seawater could be due to their dispersal by ocean currents muller et al 2014 as we showed in this study and following previous reports hubert et al 2009 the high temperature induced the germination of endospores and the growth of these thermophiles a 17 core microbial species were present in biofilms at any feed temperature this corresponds to 74 7 of all microbial populations fig 10 a and indicates that most microbes found in biofilms were adjusted to high operating temperatures as shown in the circus plot fig 10b vibrio 27 49 5 was the most abundant biofilm bacteria at all three feed temperatures marinobacter 17 7 27 6 was the second most abundant species at 45 c and 55 c in both membrane locations but its relative presence substantially lowered 12 4 14 at 65 c in conditions when the feed temperature maximum deviated from its optimal growth range mesophilic otu 6 8 6 10 3 and fusibacter 11 7 14 2 were abundant in biofilm at 45 c but almost extincted at 55 c and 65 c an increase in the feed temperature was accompanied by colonization of membrane surface with thermophilic bacteria fig 10c thus caminicella 14 6 16 and aeribacillus 6 7 7 1 had higher relative abundances at 55 c and geobacillus 15 1 16 4 dominated at 65 c which is consistent with their optimal growth conditions the observed results are agreed with the results of the 3d feem analysis that has not revealed excessive eps production with the feed temperature increase this is likely a protective reaction to thermal stress madigan et al 2012 while no substantial variation in the spatial distribution of microbial communities was observed at 55 c and 65 c the distribution of the two most abundant microbes vibrio and marinobacter substantially deviated along the membrane surface at the lowest feed water temperature of 45 c when the middle outlet membrane area was characterized by elevated vibrio 42 4 and decreased marinobacter 17 7 abundances see fig 7 a comparison of microbial abundance revealed differences in bacterial distribution between the feed and biofilm samples as seen in fig 11 while vibrio and otu 6 had comparable abundance in both feed and biofilm samples geobacillus aeribacillus and amphritea dominated in the feed and marinobacter caminicella and fusibacter had a higher propensity towards biofilm some marinobacter species can grow as biofilms and produce eps including alginate phillips et al 2020 which aids in biofilm formation similarly the bacterium genus caminicella was also reported as prevailed biofilm forming organism stipanicev et al 2014b both detected species produce bioemulsifiers raddadi et al 2017 stipanicev et al 2014a which may induce their adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces handley and lloyd 2013 thereby contributing to biofouling development fusibacter was found in biofilm grown in a bioreactor that utilized oilfield produced water lusinier et al 2021 a higher abundance of vibrio in biofilms from this study could be ascribed to lower membrane surface temperature compared to that of the feed which creates more favorable growth conditions for this mesophilic specie the observed results suggested that the feed temperature had a profound effect on the diversity of microbial communities in both feed and biofilm promoting the proliferation of thermophilic bacteria at 55 c and 65 c 4 conclusions this study comprehensively assessed biofouling in the dcmd process fed with the red sea water a common feed water source to swro and thermal desalination plants in hot climatic conditions the main conclusions of this study are as follows a shift in bacterial diversity was observed with the increase in the feed temperature a number of thermophilic bacteria colonized the membrane surface demonstrating that thermophilic endospores from the surface of the red sea water germinate and grow during the dcmd process biofilm structure and composition played a significant role in the extent of permeate flux decline relatively more eps was observed at 45 c compared to 55 c and 65 c a strong increase in permeate conductivity and bacterial concentration was observed within the 1st day of dcmd process due to partial pore wetting followed by a slower increase due to cake layer build up that covered membrane pores and retarded their wetting the middle outlet membrane area experienced more biofouling due to the temperature gradient along the membrane length the vast majority of bacterial cells in biofilm remained intact 3d feem analysis of spatial eps distribution revealed a higher intensity of fluorescence peaks in the middle outlet membrane location compared to the inlet middle locations at any feed temperature the diversity of eps peaks decreased with increasing feed temperature and only protein like substances could be identified at 65 c application of nanocomposite superhydrophobic or janus membranes with enhanced anti fouling properties could limit biofilm growth on a membrane surface in

15564,biofouling is a hurdle of seawater desalination that increases water costs and energy consumption in membrane distillation md biofouling development is complicated due to the temperature effect that adversely affects microbial growth given the high relevance of md to regions with abundant warm seawater it is essential to explore the biofouling propensity of microbial communities with higher tolerance to elevated temperature conditions this study presents a comprehensive analysis of the spatial and temporal biofilm distribution and associated membrane fouling during direct contact md dcmd of the red sea water we found that structure and composition of the biofilm layer played a significant role in the extent of permeate flux decline and biofilms that built up at 45 c had lower bacterial concentration but higher extracellular polymeric substances eps content as compared to biofilms that formed at 55 c and 65 c pore wetting and bacterial passage to the permeate side were initially observed but slowed down as operating time increased intact cells in biofilms dominated over the damaged cells at any tested condition emphasizing the high adaptivity of the red sea microbial communities to elevated feed temperatures a comparison of microbial abundance revealed a difference in bacterial distribution between the feed and biofilm samples a shift in the biofilm microbial community and colonization of the membrane surface with thermophilic bacteria with the feed temperature increase was observed the results of this study improve our understanding of biofouling propensity in md that utilizes temperature resilient feed waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation biofilm distribution temperature gradient intact cells thermophilic microbial communities data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction md a hybrid thermal membrane desalination technology is gaining increased attention for its ability to produce high quality freshwater from seawater brine owing to its several distinct advantages including diminutive dependence on the feed water salinity and very high salt rejection elcik et al 2020 however md systems are susceptible to biofilm formation which is caused by the undesirable attachment of microorganisms cell debris and organic matter to membrane surface and within its pores that gradually develops over process time leading to biofouling bogler and bar zeev 2018 goh et al 2013b in the initial stage of this process a conditioning film layer is formed by the attachment of dissolved organic compounds and colloids on the membrane surface followed by bacteria cell adherence bar zeev et al 2015 as a result a multilayered nanoporous structure comprising a complex of live and dead bacteria embedded in the eps matrix would be developed bar zeev et al 2012 the structure of biofilms that grow on a membrane surface in md process is typical for biofilms formed in non pressurized systems and is looser compared to biofilms that grow on reverse osmosis ro membranes operating under high applied pressures bogler et al 2017 zodrow et al 2014 biofouling presents a substantial challenge to sustainable md operations by introducing additional mass and temperature resistances that negatively impact vapor transport across the membrane chen et al 2021 goh et al 2013b krivorot et al 2011 one of the major adverse effects caused by biofouling development is pore wetting that compromises membrane s hydrophobicity due to the adsorption of amphiphilic biofilm constituents bogler and bar zeev 2018 goh et al 2013a biofouling and subsequent pore wetting impair permeate quality and could result in premature initiation of membrane restoration cycles given that md is a thermally driven separation process the microbial activity in md systems is primarily dictated by the feed water temperature that regulates the prevalence and evolution of bacterial communities at each operating condition bogler and bar zeev 2018 liu et al 2019a elevated feed temperature affects the extracellular enzymatic activity of bacteria khan et al 2019 thereby playing an essential role in regulating biofilm development on a membrane surface jiang et al 2020 suggested that high feed water temperature promotes the eps release by the damaged cells accelerating the formation of a conditioning film an important prerequisite of subsequent biofilm development while the effect of feed temperature on biofouling development in md has been explored the reported results were not conclusive and heavily depended on a feed water type and experimental conditions for example krivorot et al 2011 inferred that effect of the feed temperature is more significant than the effect of hydrodynamic conditions the authors suggested that maintaining feed temperature above 40 c would substantially limit biofilm growth and proposed temperature cycling with the intermittent temperature increase to 70 c to reduce biofilm occurrence similarly to this bogler et al 2017 suggested that high feed temperatures might restrict biofilm formation contrarily to this bogler and bar zeev 2018 observed severe pore wetting due to excessive eps production caused by thermophilic bacteria when the feed temperature was increased to 65 c furthermore given that the md process is accompanied by the temperature stratification inside the md module mustakeem et al 2021 we expect that temperature gradient could directly affect biofilm development along the feed water path previous studies that explored biofouling propensity of the md process were conducted by utilizing feed waters from moderate climatic conditions e g estuarine water from long island sound ny zodrow et al 2014 or lake and river waters from nanjing province in china chen et al 2021 liu et al 2020 however it is well known that biofouling of sea water ro swro plants in hot climatic conditions is accelerated due to high solar radiation and the presence of shallow coastal lagoons that serve as feed water intakes maddah and chogle 2017 saeed et al 2019 given the high relevance of the md process to seawater desalination in the middle east and other regions with warm coastal waters it is important to explore biofilm propensity and associated fouling issues caused by seawaters containing microbial communities with potentially higher tolerance to elevated temperature conditions microbiological safety of produced water is another crucial factor that needs to be considered before md is up scaled to commercial desalination operations unlike ro process that utilizes a non porous membrane thereby creating a physical barrier that prevents microorganisms from penetrating to permeate side the integrity of microporous md membranes could be compromised by pore wetting which is triggered by the biofilm attachment goh et al 2013a considering the high marine biodiversity bacterial cells and endospores with dimensions that are lower or compatible with md membrane pore sizes are likely to pass to permeate side and cause its contamination during biofouling salazar and sunagawa 2017 this study explores mechanisms and major factors that influence biofilm formation potential and its effect on process performance and permeate quality during dcmd of the red sea water a common feed water source of swro and thermal distillation plants in the middle east fortunato et al 2020 rahmawati et al 2012 in dcmd feed and coolant streams are in direct contact with the hydrophobic membrane and vapor that evaporates at the feed side is condensed into the coolant stream we investigated the combined spatial and temporal effects of biofilm distribution over the membrane surface including its structure morphology and microbial organic composition at different feed water temperatures common to the md process a range of different techniques including optical coherence tomography oct flow cytometry fcm three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d feem and 16s rrna gene sequencing were employed to explore biofilm proliferation and its composition on the membrane surface bacterial concentration of the feed and permeate streams was also monitored to assess how biofilm formation would affect permeate quality and pore wetting the biofilm development patterns observed with temperature resilient feed waters will improve our understanding of biofouling mechanisms in md and serve as a beneficial practical source for md translation from a lab scale to fully operational

information si 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of feed temperature on dcmd performance 3 1 1 effect of feed temperature on permeate flux the dcmd system was operated at three different feed temperatures as seen in fig 1 a biofouling imposed a negative effect on permeate flux which declined with the increase of dcmd time however the flux decline patterns observed at different feed temperatures significantly diverged from each other while permeate fluxes in the experiment conducted at a feed temperature of 45 c smoothly decreased over the entire dcmd course a 12 h offset between the dcmd start and the first sign of flux decline was observed at a feed temperature of 55 c this result can be explained by higher solute back diffusion from the membrane surface caused by temperature increase which delayed the development of a conditioning film bogler and bar zeev 2018 however with the increased operation time more foulants reach the membrane surface so permeate flux start declining faster when the feed temperature was raised to 65 c the increased vapor flux enhanced the transport and deposition of organics and microorganisms on the membrane surface thereby creating additional resistance to vapor passage across the membrane as a result permeate flux steeply dropped within the first 12 h of operation followed by its smoother decrease with the increase in operating time as dcmd evolved permeate fluxes approached a steady state after five days of operation the highest permeate flux drop 79 was observed at 65 c the permeate flux declines at 55 c and 45 c were lower comprising similar values of 71 5 and 71 8 respectively the differences between the inlet and outlet temperatures tfeed tin tout for the feed stream and between the outlet and inlet temperatures of the dcmd cell tcoolant tout tin for the coolant stream followed the permeate flux decline trend with the highest tfeed and tcoolant observed at the beginning of the dcmd process fig 2 as operational time increased both tfeed and tcoolant decreased and reached a plateau after two days of dcmd the decreases in tfeed and tcoolant were more evident for the feed water temperatures of 55 c and 65 c compared to that of 45 c it is also essential to notice that tfeed and tcoolant were different due to differences in feed and permeate flow rates and some heat loss occurring in the md system the observed trends suggested that feed temperature considerably affected permeate flux and greater permeate flux decline was observed at the highest feed temperature of 65 c at which biofouling became more intense 3 1 2 effect of feed temperature on biofilm development the analysis of a biofilm growth at different feed temperatures revealed the formation of thicker biofilms as feed temperature increased from 45 c to 65 c after five days of operation the biofilm thicknesses were 95 10 µm 130 20 µm and 250 10 µm for experiments conducted at 45 c 55 c and 65 c respectively fig 3 this substantial difference in fouling layer thicknesses suggests that factors like biofilm structure and composition may also confer the changes in dcmd performance furthermore calculations of the average membrane surface temperatures after five days of dcmd which were 43 3 0 1 c 53 1 0 2 c and 62 8 0 2 c for the inlet water temperatures of 45 c 55 c and 65 c respectively see eqs 1 4 in the si have not revealed a significant difference between the inlet and membrane surface temperatures at any tested condition 2 c the observed effect implies that the increase in biofilm thickness has not aggravated temperature polarization near the membrane surface concurrently given an exponential increase of the vapor pressure with the increase of the feed water temperature the same increment of temperature decline would cause a larger vapor depression and corresponding permeate flux drop at 65 c compared to lower feed temperatures the increase in biofilm thickness with increasing feed temperature is correlated with the changes in permeate flux when a larger permeate flux decline was observed at the highest feed temperature of 65 c 3 2 changes in feed and permeate quality over process time 3 2 1 changes in permeate conductivity changes in permeate conductivity were continuously monitored as this important parameter serves as an indicator of the pore wetting process as seen in fig 1b permeate conductivities at tested feed temperatures promptly surged during the 1st day of operation from an average value of 15 5 µs cm followed by a smoother increase in the subsequent days as a result conductivity increase after 1st day was substantially slowed down and after five days of operation permeate conductivities were 123 3 µs cm 128 3 µs cm and 140 7 µs cm for the feed temperatures of 45 c 55 c and 65 c respectively the shape of conductivity curves can be related to different stages of biofilm development jiang et al 2020 suggested that conditioning film formed on a membrane surface due to adsorption of organic compounds reduces its hydrophobicity this may cause partial pore wetting and promote liquid transport across the membrane as a result a sharp increase in permeate conductivity was observed as dcmd continued microorganisms would spread over the membrane surface thereby forming a mature biofilm that inhibited pore wetting furthermore as shown in fig 1b conductivity increase was sparsely affected by the feed temperature causing only a slight elevation of permeate conductivity which remained well below typical conductivities of swro permeate this could be attributed to a cake layer build up that screens membrane pores and hinders feed passage to permeate side furthermore the cake layer formed on the membrane surface could prevent the attachment of the hydrophilic eps film to interior pore walls which is an important prerequisite of biofilm induced pore wetting zodrow et al 2014 when comparing wetting propensities of md and md bioreactor mdbr processes goh et al 2013a observed that eps layers that exist on a membrane surface in mdbr substantially deterred pore wetting as compared to that of md process the authors suggested that the feed water constituents had a more pronounced effect on wetting proliferation as compared to biofilm eps components that predominated in mdbr this finding is consistent with our results when a more profound conductivity increase was observed at the beginning of dcmd compared to the late dcmd stage when matured biofilm was formed it could be concluded that the cake layer deferred partial pore wetting thereby limiting the increase in permeate conductivity 3 2 2 changes in bacterial cell concentration in the feed and permeate as seen in fig 4 different trends were observed with respect to changes in bacterial concentration in the feed and coolant streams over the dcmd time the initial cell concentration in the feed tank varied in the range of 3 1 108 cells ml to 1 2 109 cells ml but promptly dropped within the 1st day of operation to 5 9 108 cells ml 2 3 108 cells ml and 1 1 108 cells ml at feed temperatures of 45 c 55 c and 65 c respectively fig 4a c generally the annual ambient seawater temperatures near the location of seawater intake are well below 45 c as such a temperature increase during dcmd process would exert heat stress on the bacterial population causing a sharp decline in the number of intact cells in accordance with this observation the extent of the intact cells decline was less at a feed temperature of 45 c as compared to that observed at higher feed temperatures of 55 c and 65 c with the increase in dcmd time the microbes became acclimated to elevated feed water temperatures so that the concentration of intact cells in the feed tank started to increase until it reached a stationary phase after around four days of the dcmd process after five days of dcmd concentrations of intact cells at feed temperatures of 55 c and 65 c declined due to accelerated apoptosis while bacterial cells presented in the feed water at 45 c continued to thrive this result indicates that milder feed temperatures closer to optimal bacterial growth conditions promoted bacterial proliferation for longer operating times while the number of intact cells significantly varied over the dcmd course due to initial thermal stress and subsequent adaptation to elevated feed temperatures the number of damaged cells has not significantly changed and fluctuated in a range of 5 3 106 cells ml 10 107 cells ml our results indicate that heat stress and subsequent decline in feed water bacterial populations exerted a considerably lower impact on their proliferation in the feed tank due to higher adaptively of the red sea microbial communities to elevated temperatures as compared to previously reported md studies that were conducted by utilizing colder atlantic ocean waters that resulted in a drastic 2 fold decline of bacterial populations and significantly longer succession time zodrow et al 2014 as shown in fig 4d f a different trend was observed with respect to changes in permeate bacterial cell concentration in our study tap water with a total bacterial cell concentration in a range of 1 8 104 cells ml 6 5 104 cells ml was utilized in the coolant loop of the dcmd system the bacterial count of the coolant stream increased with the increase in operating time until the third day for the feed water temperature of 65 c or the fourth day for the feed water temperatures of 45 c and 55 c an increase in the bacterial concentration of the coolant water observed in our study suggests that bacterial species with sizes smaller than membrane pore sizes could be carried to permeate side with water droplets due to partial pore wetting at the beginning of dcmd process see more details in section 3 4 as seen in fig 4d f bacterial passage to permeate side was slowed down with the increase in operating time due to biofilm development which deferred water droplets from entering membrane pores given the lack of nutrients in the coolant water microbial activity in permeate tank would be inhibited as shown by a substantial decline in the intact cells concentration and increased number of damaged cells after five days of dcmd operations the total numbers of bacterial cells measured at different feed temperatures were compatible with the cells concentrations detected in different commercially available bottled waters 103 cells ml to 106 cells ml nadreen 2021 the observed results suggest that bacterial cell concentration in permeate tank remained limited and exhibited a decreasing trend by the end of dcmd operation 3 3 spatial biofilm distribution along the membrane surface 3 3 1 spatial biofilm thickness distribution spatial biofilm distribution on the membrane surface at the end of each dcmd experiment was evaluated by the 2d cross sectional oct scans taken at the inlet in the middle and at the outlet of the dcmd cell as shown in fig s3 after five days of operation biofilm coverage of the membrane surface followed a similar trend for all three feed temperatures with an increase in biofilm thickness along the feed water path consequently thicker biofilms were formed in the middle and outlet zones on the membrane surface table s1 several factors could be accounted for this phenomenon first the feed flow that enters membrane cell would gradually transition from the uniform to laminar profile as it moves along the feed channel thus near the inlet the drag force near the membrane surface would be relatively larger as compared to the rest of the element as such the relative deposition and subsequent attachment of microbes would increase with increasing the distance from the cell s inlet part the feed temperature could also affect the bacterial growth even though the temperature gradient along the channel length is substantially lower than the difference in the maximum 65 c and minimum 45 c feed temperatures employed in our study this effect became more apparent at higher feed temperatures when biofilm thickness in the middle outlet zones substantially increased our observations are consonant with krivorot et al 2011 who reported elevated biomass accumulation at the end of a hollow fiber md module during seawater desalination the biofilm growth was more significant in the middle outlet area of the membrane and aggravated with the increase in feed temperature 3 3 2 spatial bacterial and eps distribution the spatial distributions of microbial and eps contents on the membrane surface after five days of dcmd operation at different feed water temperatures were analyzed as seen in fig 5 a consistent with biofilm thickness increase on the membrane surface the total number of bacterial cells was always higher at the middle outlet biofilm locations compared to the inlet middle locations at any operating feed temperature the total bacterial cell count increased with increasing feed temperature from 45 c to 65 c for both inlet middle and middle outlet locations and the number of intact cells in biofilm was substantially larger than the number of damaged cells this indicates the high sustainability of the red sea bacterial populations to adverse environmental conditions and emphasize that bacterial activity in biofilm continued during dcmd process in temperature conditions that substantially deviated from the ambient seawater temperatures when analyzing the ratio of the intact to damaged cells at each feed water temperature a pronounced difference in the ratio of intact damaged cells was observed fig 5b the measurements showed that the number of intact cells increased by 40 from 7 9 108 8 2 107 cells cm2 to 1 1 109 1 1 108 cells cm2 and by 33 from 1 2 109 1 1 108 cells cm2 to 1 6 109 1 8 108 cells cm2 when the feed temperature increased from 45 c to 55 c for the inlet middle and middle outlet locations respectively however a further increase in the feed temperature from 55 c to 65 c has slowed down bacterial cells proliferation so that the concentration of intact cells remained almost unchanged 1 2 109 1 4 108 cells cm2 and 1 6 109 1 9 108 cells cm2 for the inlet middle and middle outlet locations respectively concurrently the accumulation of the damaged cells in biofilm was accelerated with the increase of the feed temperature from 45 c to 65 c causing a 530 from 1 0 108 2 0 107 cells cm2 to 6 4 108 1 0 108 cells cm2 and 443 from 1 6 108 2 0 107 cells cm2 to 8 4 108 1 4 108 cells cm2 increase in the damaged cells concentration for the inlet middle and middle outlet locations respectively as shown in feem contour plots fig 6 an increase in the feed temperature from 45 c to 65 c led to a substantial reduction in the abundance of major eps constituents while four peaks with fluorescence signals representing protein like tyrosine like fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were identified at the excitation emission ex em wavelengths of 250 280 380 nm peak i 220 250 330 380 peak ii nm 220 250 380 nm peak ⅲ and 280 380 nm peak iv respectively at the feed temperatures of 45 c and 55 c only the protein like peak peak i was identified in the feem spectra of biofilm that grew at 65 c we expect that humic and fulvic like compounds present on the membrane surface at 45 c and 55 c can aggravate membrane fouling by forming interconnecting networks between the carboxylic groups and ca2 ions li and elimelech 2004 lin et al 2015 that are abundant in seawater alpatova et al 2018 thereby expediting the formation of denser and more rigid biofilms at lower feed water temperatures a further increase in the feed temperature is likely to lessen adhesion forces between the humic matter and membrane surface similar to reduced interactions between the alginate molecules and the ro membrane surface at elevated feed temperatures binahmed et al 2021 accelerated degradation of humic substances at high feed temperatures has also been reported maddah and chogle 2017 as such these processes could promote the disappearance of fulvic acid like and humic acid like peaks from the feem spectra at 65 c the fluorescence intensity of protein like substances which form nonporous fouling layers with higher resistance to heat and mass transfer also decreased with increasing feed water temperature given that water diffusion a predominant mass transport mechanism through the eps layer is slowed down compared to that of the bulk feed biofilms with higher eps content would exert higher mass transfer resistance concurrently the presence of bacteria in the biofilm matrix increases its porosity as the void volume of a cake layer increases with the increase in particle size crittenden 2005 given that bacteria sizes are considerably larger than those of organic molecules we can suggest that biofilms with higher eps content but lower bacterial concentration that grew on md membrane at lower feed temperatures would form more compact fouling layers compared to looser biofilms with higher bacterial content but less eps concentration that developed at higher operating temperatures the 3d feem analysis of spatial eps distribution revealed a higher intensity of fluorescence peaks in the middle outlet part of the membrane cell compared to that of the inlet middle part at any feed water temperature fig 6 however the diversity of fluorescent peaks became less pronounced with increasing feed temperature in both monitored locations which is somewhat counterintuitive as one would expect an increase in biofilm eps concentration with feed temperature increase as a bacterial response to heat stress liu et al 2019b this can be explained by considering changes in microbial communities that populated biofilms at different feed water temperatures as discussed in the next section the observed results showed a good adaptivity of the biofilm microbial communities to increased feed temperatures that are accompanied by a reduced abundance of eps constituents at higher feed temperatures 3 4 microbial community analysis 16s rrna sequencing analysis was conducted to characterize microbial community distributions in biofilms and feed waters at different feed temperatures dna extraction and sequencing library preparation yielded between 42651 and 83179 dna read for each biofilm feed water sample after quality control and bioinformatic processing in addition the number of detected operational taxonomic units otus was analyzed and the microbial community diversity was assessed by calculating shannon and simpson indexes table s2 the rarefaction curves fig s4 demonstrated that the sequencing effort was comprehensive enough to cover the otus diversity in the samples we further constructed a heatmap to show the top 25 most abundant microbial genera found in all tested samples fig 7 the microbial communities in raw seawater feed and biofilms were compared by conducting a principal component analysis pca as seen in fig 8 the raw seawater community was positioned far away from the communities corresponding to feed waters and biofilm samples although pca revealed more resemblance in microbial communities of the feed waters and biofilms as compared to that of the raw seawater notably different clustering trends were observed for the feed and biofilm samples at different feed temperatures specifically the microbial communities of the biofilms grown at 45 c samples differed significantly from those grown at 65 c manova p 0 005 reflecting more pronounced shifts in microbial communities at elevated feed temperatures the most abundant genera of raw seawater were notably different from those of feed waters that served as dcmd feeds thus as seen in fig 7 the total percentage of top 25 clustered bacteria at genus level in raw seawater was 58 4 which is lower as compared to feed waters 96 and biofilms 94 this result is consistent with their higher shannon index and lower simpson index compared to raw seawater table s2 the pioneering bacteria in raw seawater comprised of a patescibacteria otu 12 17 9 sar ii clade ia 16 2 nitrosopumilus 8 3 and unclassified deltaproteobacteria otu 23 7 some characteristics of these phylotypes are provided in section 3 of si of relevance for the dcmd process are patescibacteria and sar ii common members of the red sea water thompson et al 2019 with small genomes and ultrasmall cell sizes nakai 2020 patin et al 2021 tian et al 2020 hence they could pass through the pores of a membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 22 µm during partial pore wetting at the beginning of dcmd collectively we identified 11 genera that accounted for 59 7 of all microbes in the feed waters that were identical at all temperatures fig 9 a the distribution analysis of bacteria at a genus level fig 9b showed a remarkable shift in microbial communities composition with the increase in the feed temperature pioneering bacteria observed in feed waters comprised of two pillar phyla proteobacteria and firmicutes vibrio a common representative of tropical coastal seawater asplund et al 2011 was the leading proteobacteria present at any feed water temperature with a relative abundance of 34 3 fig 9c implying that this microorganism was well acclimatized to elevated feed water temperatures marinobacter a genus of proteobacteria that optimally grow at 40 c duran 2010 had a higher relative abundance at 45 c compared to its diminishing occurrence at 55 c and 65 c at 55 c the feed water was markedly enriched with two thermophilic species aeribacillus 30 8 and geobacillus 19 with the optimal growth conditions of 55 c 60 c yasawong et al 2011 and 60 c noll 2001 respectively following its temperature optima for growth when the temperature increased to 65 c the relative abundance of geobacillus raised to 31 5 making it the second most abundant microbial type in the feed water a substantial presence of the extreme thermophile thermoaerobacter 8 6 an inhabitant of marine thermal vents wery et al 2002 was also recorded at 65 c fig 7 the presence of endospores of thermophilic bacteria in non thermophilic seawater could be due to their dispersal by ocean currents muller et al 2014 as we showed in this study and following previous reports hubert et al 2009 the high temperature induced the germination of endospores and the growth of these thermophiles a 17 core microbial species were present in biofilms at any feed temperature this corresponds to 74 7 of all microbial populations fig 10 a and indicates that most microbes found in biofilms were adjusted to high operating temperatures as shown in the circus plot fig 10b vibrio 27 49 5 was the most abundant biofilm bacteria at all three feed temperatures marinobacter 17 7 27 6 was the second most abundant species at 45 c and 55 c in both membrane locations but its relative presence substantially lowered 12 4 14 at 65 c in conditions when the feed temperature maximum deviated from its optimal growth range mesophilic otu 6 8 6 10 3 and fusibacter 11 7 14 2 were abundant in biofilm at 45 c but almost extincted at 55 c and 65 c an increase in the feed temperature was accompanied by colonization of membrane surface with thermophilic bacteria fig 10c thus caminicella 14 6 16 and aeribacillus 6 7 7 1 had higher relative abundances at 55 c and geobacillus 15 1 16 4 dominated at 65 c which is consistent with their optimal growth conditions the observed results are agreed with the results of the 3d feem analysis that has not revealed excessive eps production with the feed temperature increase this is likely a protective reaction to thermal stress madigan et al 2012 while no substantial variation in the spatial distribution of microbial communities was observed at 55 c and 65 c the distribution of the two most abundant microbes vibrio and marinobacter substantially deviated along the membrane surface at the lowest feed water temperature of 45 c when the middle outlet membrane area was characterized by elevated vibrio 42 4 and decreased marinobacter 17 7 abundances see fig 7 a comparison of microbial abundance revealed differences in bacterial distribution between the feed and biofilm samples as seen in fig 11 while vibrio and otu 6 had comparable abundance in both feed and biofilm samples geobacillus aeribacillus and amphritea dominated in the feed and marinobacter caminicella and fusibacter had a higher propensity towards biofilm some marinobacter species can grow as biofilms and produce eps including alginate phillips et al 2020 which aids in biofilm formation similarly the bacterium genus caminicella was also reported as prevailed biofilm forming organism stipanicev et al 2014b both detected species produce bioemulsifiers raddadi et al 2017 stipanicev et al 2014a which may induce their adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces handley and lloyd 2013 thereby contributing to biofouling development fusibacter was found in biofilm grown in a bioreactor that utilized oilfield produced water lusinier et al 2021 a higher abundance of vibrio in biofilms from this study could be ascribed to lower membrane surface temperature compared to that of the feed which creates more favorable growth conditions for this mesophilic specie the observed results suggested that the feed temperature had a profound effect on the diversity of microbial communities in both feed and biofilm promoting the proliferation of thermophilic bacteria at 55 c and 65 c 4 conclusions this study comprehensively assessed biofouling in the dcmd process fed with the red sea water a common feed water source to swro and thermal desalination plants in hot climatic conditions the main conclusions of this study are as follows a shift in bacterial diversity was observed with the increase in the feed temperature a number of thermophilic bacteria colonized the membrane surface demonstrating that thermophilic endospores from the surface of the red sea water germinate and grow during the dcmd process biofilm structure and composition played a significant role in the extent of permeate flux decline relatively more eps was observed at 45 c compared to 55 c and 65 c a strong increase in permeate conductivity and bacterial concentration was observed within the 1st day of dcmd process due to partial pore wetting followed by a slower increase due to cake layer build up that covered membrane pores and retarded their wetting the middle outlet membrane area experienced more biofouling due to the temperature gradient along the membrane length the vast majority of bacterial cells in biofilm remained intact 3d feem analysis of spatial eps distribution revealed a higher intensity of fluorescence peaks in the middle outlet membrane location compared to the inlet middle locations at any feed temperature the diversity of eps peaks decreased with increasing feed temperature and only protein like substances could be identified at 65 c application of nanocomposite superhydrophobic or janus membranes with enhanced anti fouling properties could limit biofilm growth on a membrane surface in addition the long term studies utilizing seawater brines are desirable to explore the protracted effect of different membrane materials on biofilm development in md systems declaration of competing
