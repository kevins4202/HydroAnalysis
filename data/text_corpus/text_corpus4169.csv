20845,the prediction of ocean currents is essential for the path planning and control of autonomous underwater vehicles regional physics based forecast models provide valid predictions but are too computationally expensive for real time prediction necessary for auv navigation while vehicle sensors can measure the spatial evolution of currents temporal prediction remains an open problem as existing data driven models with real time capabilities have only been shown to work at locations where data have been used to develop the model we propose in this paper two predictive tools using deep learning techniques a long short term memory lstm recurrent neural network and a transformer to perform real time in situ prediction of ocean currents at any location a data set from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration is split in two distinct sets to train and test the models we show that the lstm and the transformer have an averaged normalized root mean squared error respectively of 0 10 and 0 11 over all test sites with a standard deviation respectively of 0 024 and 0 031 comparisons with harmonic method predictions at various locations in the territorial sea of the united states show that both models provide state of the art accuracy without having been trained with data from these sites keywords ocean currents prediction recurrent neural network attention mechanism auv navigation 1 introduction ocean currents prediction is critical for the safe and reliable navigation of unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs uses oceanographic predictions from numerical forecast models based on mass and hydrostatic momentum balance albarakati et al 2019 smith et al 2010 zeng et al 2020 such as the regional ocean model system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the navy coastal ocean model ncom martin 2000 and the global real time ocean forecast system rtofs global yang et al 2015 these predictive tools have computation time of 24 h and a resolution respectively of 3 3 7 and 9 3 km they are therefore not suited for trajectory re planning and control where the spatio temporal variations of the current must be computed on the vehicle s embedded system with relatively high frequency for precise navigation immas and alam 2019 in this situation the current speed vector has been estimated in real time using kalman filtering combined with the vehicle navigation sensors allotta et al 2017 or with acoustic positioning baccou et al 2001 these techniques however do not provide any information on the spatio temporal evolution of the ocean current the spatial evolution can be measured with an on board acoustic doppler current profiler adcp that provides an instantaneous current profile along one or multiple lines these continuous on board measurements of the ocean current have been used for auv navigation garau et al 2006 zeng et al 2015 but neglecting the temporal evolution leads to suboptimal trajectories that can turn out catastrophic the temporal prediction of ocean currents has historically been made with the harmonic method hm pawlowicz et al 2002 that uses sets of harmonic constituents pre computed at a finite number of near shore sites from current data acquired with adcps the predictions are therefore only valid where the data have been acquired which is obviously not suitable for auvs navigation machine learning techniques such as gaussian processes sarkar et al 2018 support vector regression guozhen et al 2017 kavousi fard and su 2017 or genetic algorithm remya et al 2012 have been proposed to reduce the amount of data necessary to train the predictive tools and to improve predictions accuracy other researchers have proposed the use of artificial neural networks using fully connected layers dauji et al 2015 or recurrent lstm layers bayindir 2019 with similar motivations spatiotemporal prediction of tidal currents in a region around sampled locations has been proposed using gaussian processes sarkar et al 2019 these models have been trained and tested with data coming from the same sites or regions providing no information on their generalization to other locations in the world where data have not been used during training a new predictive tool allowing real time in situ prediction of ocean currents at any location is therefore needed for auv navigation in this paper we propose a recurrent neural network rnn long short term memory lstm model hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and a transformer model vaswani et al 2017 to perform predictions of ocean currents speed and direction as described in section 2 these two methods have outperformed fully connected neural networks and other machine learning techniques in natural language processing nlp salehinejad et al 2017 al rfou et al 2019 that has many similarities with ocean currents prediction rnns have been the state of the art method in modelling time series data in the last decade however attention based methods and in particular the transformer have recently exceeded rnn performance in many nlp tasks al rfou et al 2019 we show in section 3 that these deep learning techniques can predict ocean currents at various locations with a state of the art accuracy and without having been trained with data from these locations 2 methodology 2 1 deep auto regressive networks our approach is inspired from the latest progress in nlp and particularly in sequence to sequence seq2seq models the latter have obtained great results on complex tasks involving time series data such as translation speech recognition video captioning etc these models are made of two parts an encoder and a decoder as shown in fig 1 a for machine translation on the encoder side the neural network collects information from embedded words and propagates the information forward the decoder starts with a special token indicating that the model should now predict output words as words of the output sentence are predicted additional information is propagated forward in the neural network until a special token is predicted signifying the end of the sentence it is straightforward to modify this model for time series and thus creating a deep auto regressive network vectors with numerical values now replace embedded words in both encoder and decoder the model is therefore able to predict time series values based on previous values as shown in fig 1b for the prediction of ocean currents we propose deep auto regressive networks that have inputs and outputs of similar length a network can thus be trained to use 24 h 1 week or 1 month of data to respectively predict the next 24 h 1 week or 1 month rnn lstm and transformer are special types of neural networks that are commonly used for seq2seq models loosely speaking a neural network is a matrix based algorithm to be used for approximating a process which is in the scope of this paper defined as a black box function that takes time series as input and output neural network emerged in recent years as a state of the art approach to data modelling thanks to its universal approximating ability through a sequence of matrix operations and nonlinear activations among its core components are its weights that act on and transform input into output the visualization of a neural network with multi dimensional input and scalar output is presented in fig 2 do and alam 2020 it is noticed that there is a component σ at each hidden node called activation function it plays an important role in adding nonlinearity to the model thereby enabling the model to approximate the nonlinear processes otherwise a sequence of linear matrix operations can be reduced to a single linear matrix operation and a neural network without activation is not able to simulate a nonlinear process initially all the weights are generated randomly simulating a random process that outputs random results no matter what input it takes after being trained on the collected data from a true process using the backpropagation algorithm the neural network has its weights converging to the state that can closely imitate the behavior of the true process the backpropagation algorithm involves a forward pass and a backward pass using the chain rule on the pre defined loss it then usually uses the stochastic gradient descent to update the weights with a small fraction of the loss gradient typically at the order o 10 3 of its the procedure is illustrated in fig 2 with forward pass and backpropagation 2 2 long short term memory rnn is a recurrent version of neural network in which the input components along with the hidden outputs are recurrently fed into the network its architecture is similar to that of neural network with a single set of weight and bias per layer but they differ in the ways they work fig 3 illustrates the structure of a typical rnn and its unfolding in operation let us consider a sequence of data x 1 x n first x 1 and the all zero hidden state h 0 are fed into the rnn to output the hidden state h 1 next x 2 and the hidden state h 1 are fed into the rnn to output the hidden state h 2 and so on until x n and the hidden state h n 1 to output h n which is also the final output y rnn is also trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent similar to a regular neural network lstm is a special type of rnn whose hidden layers have a more complicated architecture with several combinations of nonlinear activations on matrix operations specifically a lstm hidden layer has a cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate olah 2015 these three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell which in turn selectively memorizes the information throughout the past this feature makes lstm particularly suitable for modelling long sequence data such as texts signals time series because of its efficiency in solving similar problems lstm is attempted as an approach to modelling and predicting the ocean currents the proposed lstm model in this paper consists of two sequentially connected lstm networks each of two hidden layers serving as an encoder and a decoder as depicted in fig 4 this is a typical seq2seq model based on lstm the encoder first encodes the information in the past x 1 k storing the data patterns in the lstm cells the encoder output combined with the information query x k 1 k h are subsequently fed into the decoder to produce the future values in our problem x 1 k composes of time speed and direction of ocean currents while x k 1 k h includes only time as query for speed and direction 2 3 transformer the transformer is a neural network with an encoder decoder structure that is solely based on attention mechanisms vaswani et al 2017 originally developed for nlp both encoder and decoder use attention layers and fully connected feed forward layers as shown in fig 5 both layers include a residual connection and a normalization layer to improve the learning process the model uses self attention to encode information about other time steps when processing an input at a specific time the input representation therefore includes contextual information allowing the model to account for dependencies while the encoder self attention layer can access inputs at all time steps the decoder self attention can only access inputs up to the time step being processed to respect the auto regression finally the encoder decoder cross attention layer allows the decoder to focus on the most relevant inputs to carry out the predictions attention has been developed to improve the accuracy of the existing neural network models thanks to the extra information of correlation that is incorporated into the models let us consider the input data sequence x 1 x 2 x k for each input x i the self attention mechanism creates for all inputs x j a query vector q j a key vector k j and a value vector v j that are linear combinations of x j a correlation weight is then computed using the softmax function w i j softmax α q i t k j where α is a hyperparameter used to have more stable gradients the output of the self attention mechanism is then given for input x i by z i j w i j v j the same mechanism is used for cross attention with the difference that attention is computed between two different vectors as such the model will learn to up weight the significant values and to down weight the insignificant values by multiplying them with the large and small weights respectively finally attention is implemented in the practical form of multi headed attention the attention mechanisms with d 8 heads are used in parallel to enable the model to focus on different positions since the encoder and decoder are trainable the attention layers are trained consequently and converge to the optimal state in which the most correlated information is stored the correlation weights w i j of the cross attention layer are particularly interesting to understand what the model has learned as they show what part of the inputs the model attend to in order to carry out its prediction their visualization are presented in section 3 2 in this paper we propose to use a transformer encoder decoder structure modified to work for time series an embedding layer is used in the original transformer to map words into vectors for time series we replace this layer by a linear fully connected layer to transform input vectors into m dimensional vectors allard 2019 a similar fully connected layer is used at the decoder end to convert back predictions into physical quantities and the softmax loss is replaced by a l2 loss current speed and direction x 1 x 2 x k are used as input of the encoder and predicted current speed and direction x k 1 x k 2 x k h are the output of the decoder decoder input is first an empty time series with a start of prediction token in first position predictions are made step by step and are added to the decoder input to predict current speed and direction at the next time step using attention mechanisms to account for dependencies 2 4 data ocean current data at 831 sites were downloaded from the historic stations dataset on the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website noaa 2020 current speed and directions have been acquired by adcps that were either bottom mounted or shore mounted over measurement campaigns from 1 to 4 months on this dataset 222 stations have data length greater than 2 months sampling interval of the raw data are either 6 min or 10 min we estimated that this was the minimum amount of data necessary to train and test the transformer and the lstm and therefore set the maximum time horizon of the models to 1 month after training both models can predict ocean current for 1 month based on 1 month of data despite the limitation of the dataset to united states water it is expected that predictions will be valid worldwide as the physics of tidal currents remains the same regularization i e dropout for the transformer dropout and early stopping for the lstm enables the models to perform predictions despite measurement noises in the input data however missing data in the inputs are not handled by the models if the missing data gap is less than 1 h linear interpolation allows the models to process the input data to limit the length of the models we gathered daily data into one vector x i therefore the encoder takes as input 30 vectors x 1 x 30 each of which includes ocean current data for 1 day and the decoder outputs 30 vectors x 31 x 60 each corresponding to predictions for 1 day depending on the auv mission a shorter horizon time may also be more practical as less data is required to start the predictions the authors decided to present the predictions with the highest time horizon allowed by the database because shorter horizon models mechanically benefit from a higher quantity of data points leading to better predictive capabilities the performance of the models presented in this paper is therefore a lower bound for models with shorter horizons two data cleaning steps were applied to form the final dataset first we observed that currents at some sites had noisy changes of direction that may be due to local specificity or data acquisition error a typical example is shown in fig 6 we decided to remove these sites from our dataset as we did not have enough information to conclude on the validity of the data second we observed that missing data points in the raw time series coincided with a non physical variation of the ocean current speed as shown in fig 7 we observed a tidal pattern from may 20 2012 to august 6 2012 with clear semi diurnal diurnal and monthly variations and a sudden change of pattern around august 6 2012 as tides are generated by steady state periodic gravitational forces of the sun and the moon the authors believe that this is a consequence of a faulty sensor or of data acquisition errors corresponding sequences were therefore removed from the time series finally an interpolation was carried out to obtain a uniform sampling interval of 1 h this value was set to reduce the size of the models while capturing the important variation of the currents a dataset including 78 stations was finally selected 66 stations were used to train the model and 12 stations were used in a test set to show the ability of the models to predict ocean currents at various locations where no data have previously been used to train the models in addition to the aforementioned historic stations noaa is currently deploying adcps over 61 stations that actively collect the ocean current data at various sites in the territorial sea of the united states noaa 2020 these active stations are similar to the historic stations in most senses but actively working at the moment collecting and sending data in real time the time granule of data sampling is 6 min the sensors are deployed over every 5 8 months then recovered for a couple of hours for maintenance and checking purpose which causes some data gaps in addition there are several data gaps within any deployment time span that might probably be caused by the sensing inconsistency of the sensors due to their harsh working environment indeed we found it challenging to obtain any complete two month data in any active station we instead looked for the incomplete two month data with small data gaps and interpolated the missing data points the data cleansing was conducted in the same manner as that for the historic stations we completed the test set with 4 active stations to ensure that the models work consistently not only with historic data but also with data recently acquired without the need of re training the models besides predictions with harmonic method carried out by noaa are readily available providing a state of the art benchmark to evaluate the models accuracy 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation with measurements from historic stations we present in this section the validation of the models on the 12 historic stations 2 depths for each set aside in the test set as described in section 2 4 we used the adam optimization algorithm kingma and ba 2015 to train the transformer model for 10 epochs and the lstm model for 2 epochs with a constant learning rate of 10 3 and a batch size of 64 bottou 1991 1998 the models were built on the tensorflow platform supporting the implementation of neural network and their training was carried out on a gpu nvidia titan v with a memory of 12 gb after hyperparameter optimization we found that the best transformer architecture has a single layer of encoder and decoder as shown in fig 5 a model dimension m 128 and a fully connected feed forward network with a single layer of dimensionality 256 with relu activation function and a dropout of 0 5 on the other hand the best lstm model adopts a slightly different architecture with two lstm layers each of dimensionality 512 as demonstrated in fig 4 to analyze the performance of the models we computed the speed normalized root mean squared error nrmse defined as the speed rmse normalized by the maximum speed amplitude that allows to compare the prediction accuracy at sites with different current speed magnitude in addition we computed the direction mean absolute error mae to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the speed vector orientation while the rmse has been commonly used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of current speed no standard error has been defined to evaluate prediction accuracy of the current direction the mae represents well the error observed on temporal comparisons because it is proportional to the error at each time step and is therefore presented here both errors are computed on an identical sample for each site and depth with the lstm and the transformer and are shown in table 1 the lstm and transformer have a global averaged nrmse defined as the average of the nrmse for all sites respectively of 0 10 and 0 11 with a corresponding standard deviation respectively of 0 024 and 0 031 in addition the direction mae of the two models remains lower than 30 for all depths and sites as current direction follows a repeating pattern this error can be easily corrected using a heuristic technique the similar performance achieved by both models shows that the transformer s attention mechanism and the lstm s gating mechanism are able to adequately regulate the flow of information for ocean currents data processing to better understand the predicting capabilities of the transformer and of the lstm we show in fig 8 the speed and direction as a function of time as well as the speed fourier transform for station cab1401 at a depth of 35 ft station cab1401 is located at the harbor entrance of portland maine we chose this station to illustrate the performance of the models because station cab1401 has a speed nrmse at a depth of 35 ft close to the global averaged nrmse for both models as shown in table 1 and is therefore representative of the models accuracy speed predictions for station cab1401 match well with experimental measurements as shown in fig 8a the timing of the slack before flood slack before ebb maximum flood and ebb currents are well predicted as well as well as the alternating high and low tides but maximum flood and ebb current speed shows some slight discrepancies direction predictions shown in fig 8b match well with measurements and confirm that the timing of the currents variation is well captured we observe that the regularization of the models i e dropout for the transformer dropout and early stopping for the lstm prevents them from overfitting as they do not capture the excessively high spikes in the measured data that are probably due to data acquisition errors mueller et al 2007 we observe on the fourier transform of the current speed in fig 8c that ocean currents at station cab1401 are driven by long period constituents around 0 hour semi diurnal constituents at 30 hour as well as constituents generated by nonlinear mechanisms in shallow water at 60 hour the models are able to capture all the harmonic constituents up to 120 hour which correspond to the angular speed range covered by the 37 tidal harmonic constituents typically used in harmonic analysis parker 2007 3 2 visualization of attention in the transformer model the attention mechanism is the core component of the transformer model as discussed in section 2 3 the cross attention map defined as the correlation weights w i j between the predicted output sequence and the input sequence is shown in fig 9 this map indicates how much each output value attends to all of the input values fig 9a presents the weights of 4 out of 8 attention heads of the transformer model fig 9b shows the attention weights used to predict the future day 10 for all 8 heads on the 30 day input sequence in both figures each column is a set of weights that sums up to 1 in fig 9a each column indicates the attention of a future day on the x axis to the past days on the y axis day 0 is today day 1 is yesterday day 1 is tomorrow and so on as can be seen from the four heat maps a future day has a higher correlation coefficient with the days around 28 31 days before itself which is in fact the lunar monthly period it is interesting to note that some attention heads converged to an optimal point with a period close to 28 days corresponding to the period of a subset of lunar monthly harmonic constituents e g m 1 m 3 while others converged to an optimal point with a period close to 31 days corresponding to the period of an other subset of lunar monthly harmonic constituents e g l 2 similarly the attention mechanism also attends with a lower correlation to the days around 13 15 days before itself which corresponds to the harmonic constituents with a half monthly period e g o 1 o o 1 all 8 attention heads are shown in fig 9b for the prediction of future day 10 we can easily notice the monthly and half monthly periods i e day 10 attends back to around day 18 and day 4 respectively however we also observe some low correlation weights spread on different days e g in attention heads 4 and 7 making the full interpretation of the transformer more challenging this pattern could be explained by the need of the transformer model to attend all inputs data with low weights in order to carry out its predictions further research is needed to determine the role that these correlation weights have in the transformer predictions 3 3 comparison with harmonic method on measurements from active stations harmonic method is one of the most popular approaches to modelling time series data particularly to those whose visualization exposes some periodic pattern it is along with auto regressive integrated moving average arima models classified as of the classic methods as opposed to the modern ones using neural network yet it is still widely used today the essence of harmonic method is to find harmonic components that can be obtained by applying the fourier transform to the selected data windows and filtering out the harmonic components with small weights if the harmonic frequencies are identified beforehand the method is focused on determining their weights using for instance least squares regression and adjusting for the variations due to the non harmonic factors in modelling ocean currents noaa took the second approach as harmonic patterns of ocean currents can be identified with specific frequencies since they are governed by the sun and the moon noaa applied different procedures the choice of which is based on the volume of available data in order to determine the harmonic weights the final models were subsequently adjusted for variations such as de tiding the time series data it is essential to note that each time series data requires a model that is a set of harmonic constants thus the number of models is corresponding to the number of stations in the ocean current modelling problem which results in a huge workload specifically noaa used the historic stations data to build the separate models for the corresponding sites depending on the amount of collected data in the stations the models were built independently using different procedures the predictions using these models are called harmonic predictions as they are based directly on the harmonic models and these stations are called reference stations beside the harmonic predictions the subordinate predictions are made for the subordinate stations close to a reference station but without the collected data we are interested in the harmonic predictions as we want to compare our models performance to the harmonic method performance the speed predictions and nrmses by the lstm transformer and harmonic method are respectively shown in fig 10 and table 2 for the four active stations set aside in the test set as described in section 2 4 we observe in table 2 that the nrmses computed with the lstm and transformer predictions at the active stations have the same order of magnitude than these computed at the historic stations in table 1 except for station cb0701 this can be explained by the erratic variations of the ocean current speed at this site as shown in fig 10d that are not common in the historic stations dataset used to train the models the lstm and transformer are however able to better predict the ocean current speed at this site than the harmonic method as shown in table 2 actually the neural network based models have equivalent nrmse in 3 out of 4 active stations and a much lower nrmse in the fourth one which shows despite the limited number of comparisons that they provide state of art predictions as can be seen in fig 10 all the models capture well the periodic time points when the flood and ebb currents occur the harmonic method predictions however fail to match the peak values in the stations jx0302 and jx0701 due to the inflexibility of the method that is the harmonic method can identify well the current patterns but it is not adapting to the changes of current amplitudes due to its fixed harmonic constituents the neural network based methods on the other hand take into account the most recent information combined with the memorized patterns to produce the predictions that incorporate the details of long and short time thus the proposed methods are more adapting to the change of currents over time it is interesting to notice that the neural network based models perform better than the harmonic one in cb0701 and worse in hb0401 while the ocean current speed at the former station has a less regular pattern than at the latter the authors do not have solid explanation for this our conjecture is that the proposed models are more capable of capturing minor details in time series patterns are not deliberately selected beforehand when training the neural network based models instead the training procedure converges the network weights to embrace all major and minor patterns except the randomness in the harmonic method on the other hand the manual selection of harmonic periods may limit the number of patterns that can be generated by the model in terms of computational efficiency all three models take linear time o h where h is the prediction horizon because their time complexities are similar the running time per prediction is estimated instead as a metric to compare their computational efficiency the lstm and transformer models both have a running time of o 10 2 seconds per prediction on a normal personal computer while we don t have access to the noaa prediction system we built an equivalent harmonic model with the same number of harmonic components as that of noaa the alternative model has a running time of o 10 4 seconds per prediction on the same computer it was expected that the harmonic model would run faster than the deep learning models as it involves a small number of simple mathematical operations while the others handle matrix vector multiplications however a running time of o 10 2 seconds per prediction is short enough for the proposed models to be qualified for real time predictions 4 conclusions we developed deep auto regressive networks to predict ocean currents speed and direction at any location with a state of the art accuracy and without having been trained with data from this location a lstm recurrent neural network and a transformer using attention mechanisms have been modified to process ocean currents data and trained with a subset of the historic stations dataset from noaa both models are able to predict ocean currents for 1 month at any site in the territorial sea of the united states using one month of measured data as input they have similar performance and their accuracy is equivalent to the well known harmonic method the lstm is likely to be a better choice for future deployments because it is easier to train and more widely spread among the scientific and engineering community these models provide a significant improvement compared to the harmonic method where harmonic constituents need to be analyzed and harmonic constants computed for each site before predictions can be carried out notably these models allow the real time in situ prediction of ocean currents for auvs navigation auvs are expected to be widely deployed in the near future for seafloor mapping both models could for instance be used to support the seafloor mapping of the united states exclusive economic zone eez and of the alaskan coastline the extension of the models to other regions in the world remains to be evaluated both models have been trained to learn the principal ocean currents patterns and should therefore be able to provide to some extent predictions at any location in the world re training of the models on a dataset representative of the regional ocean currents distribution should however be considered to fully exploit the predictive power of the neural networks credit authorship contribution statement alexandre

20845,the prediction of ocean currents is essential for the path planning and control of autonomous underwater vehicles regional physics based forecast models provide valid predictions but are too computationally expensive for real time prediction necessary for auv navigation while vehicle sensors can measure the spatial evolution of currents temporal prediction remains an open problem as

mechanism auv navigation 1 introduction ocean currents prediction is critical for the safe and reliable navigation of unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs uses oceanographic predictions from numerical forecast models based on mass and hydrostatic momentum balance albarakati et al 2019 smith et al 2010 zeng et al 2020 such as the regional ocean model system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the navy coastal ocean model ncom martin 2000 and the global real time ocean forecast system rtofs global yang et al 2015 these predictive tools have computation time of 24 h and a resolution respectively of 3 3 7 and 9 3 km they are therefore not suited for trajectory re planning and control where the spatio temporal variations of the current must be computed on the vehicle s embedded system with relatively high frequency for precise navigation immas and alam 2019 in this situation the current speed vector has been estimated in real time using kalman filtering combined with the vehicle navigation sensors allotta et al 2017 or with acoustic positioning baccou et al 2001 these techniques however do not provide any information on the spatio

trajectories that can turn out catastrophic the temporal prediction of ocean currents has historically been made with the harmonic method hm pawlowicz et al 2002 that uses sets of harmonic constituents pre computed at a finite number of near shore sites from current data acquired with adcps the predictions are therefore only valid where the data have been acquired which is obviously not suitable for auvs navigation machine learning techniques such as gaussian processes sarkar et al 2018 support vector regression guozhen et al 2017 kavousi fard and su 2017 or genetic algorithm remya et al 2012 have been proposed to reduce the amount of data necessary to train the predictive tools and to improve predictions accuracy other researchers have proposed the use of artificial neural networks using fully connected layers dauji et al 2015 or recurrent lstm layers bayindir 2019 with similar motivations spatiotemporal prediction of tidal currents in a region around sampled locations has been proposed using gaussian processes sarkar et al 2019 these models have been trained and tested with data coming from the same sites or regions providing no information on their generalization to other locations in the world where data have not been used during training a new predictive tool allowing real time in situ prediction of ocean currents at any location is therefore needed for auv navigation in this paper we propose a recurrent neural network rnn long short term memory lstm model hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and a transformer model vaswani et al 2017 to perform predictions of ocean currents speed and direction as described in section 2 these two methods have outperformed fully connected neural networks and other machine learning techniques in natural language processing nlp salehinejad et al 2017 al rfou et al 2019 that has many similarities with ocean currents prediction rnns have been the state of the art method in modelling time series data in the last decade however attention based methods and in particular the transformer have recently exceeded rnn performance in many nlp tasks al rfou et al 2019 we show in section 3 that these deep learning techniques can predict ocean currents at various locations with a state of the art accuracy and without having been trained with data from these locations 2 methodology 2 1 deep auto regressive networks our approach is inspired from the latest progress in nlp and particularly in sequence to sequence seq2seq models the latter have obtained great results on complex tasks involving time series data such as translation speech recognition video captioning etc these models are made of two parts an encoder and a decoder as shown in fig 1 a for machine translation on the encoder side the neural network collects information from embedded words and propagates the information forward the decoder starts with a special token indicating that the model should now predict output words as words of the output sentence are predicted additional information is propagated forward in the neural network until a special token is predicted signifying the end of the sentence it is straightforward to modify this model for time series and thus creating a deep auto regressive network vectors with numerical values now replace embedded words in both encoder and decoder the model is therefore able to predict time series values based on previous values as shown in fig 1b for the prediction of ocean currents we propose deep auto regressive networks that have inputs and outputs of similar length a network can thus be trained to use 24 h 1 week or 1 month of data to respectively predict the next 24 h 1 week or 1 month rnn lstm and transformer are special types of neural networks that are commonly used for seq2seq models loosely speaking a neural network is a matrix based algorithm to be used for approximating a process which is in the scope of this paper defined as a black box function that takes time series as input and output neural network emerged in recent years as a state of the art approach to data modelling thanks to its universal approximating ability through a sequence of matrix operations and nonlinear activations among its core components are its weights that act on and transform input into output the visualization of a neural network with multi dimensional input and scalar output is presented in fig 2 do and alam 2020 it is noticed that there is a component σ at each hidden node called activation function it plays an important role in adding nonlinearity to the model thereby enabling the model to approximate the nonlinear processes otherwise a sequence of linear matrix operations can be reduced to a single linear matrix operation and a neural network without activation is not able to simulate a nonlinear process initially all the weights are generated randomly simulating a random process that outputs random results no matter what input it takes after being trained on the collected data from a true process using the backpropagation algorithm the neural network has its weights converging to the state that can closely imitate the behavior of the true process the backpropagation algorithm involves a forward pass and a backward pass using the chain rule on the pre defined loss it then usually uses the stochastic gradient descent to update the weights with a small fraction of the loss gradient typically at the order o 10 3 of its the procedure is illustrated in fig 2 with forward pass and backpropagation 2 2 long short term memory rnn is a recurrent version of neural network in which the input components along with the hidden outputs are recurrently fed into the network its architecture is similar to that of neural network with a single set of weight and bias per layer but they differ in the ways they work fig 3 illustrates the structure of a typical rnn and its unfolding in operation let us consider a sequence of data x 1 x n first x 1 and the all zero hidden state h 0 are fed into the rnn to output the hidden state h 1 next x 2 and the hidden state h 1 are fed into the rnn to output the hidden state h 2 and so on until x n and the hidden state h n 1 to output h n which is also the final output y rnn is also trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent similar to a regular neural network lstm is a special type of rnn whose hidden layers have a more complicated architecture with several combinations of nonlinear activations on matrix operations specifically a lstm hidden layer has a cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate olah 2015 these three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell which in turn selectively memorizes the information throughout the past this feature makes lstm particularly suitable for modelling long sequence data such as texts signals time series because of its efficiency in solving similar problems lstm is attempted as an approach to modelling and predicting the ocean currents the proposed lstm model in this paper consists of two sequentially connected lstm networks each of two hidden layers serving as an encoder and a decoder as depicted in fig 4 this is a typical seq2seq model based on lstm the encoder first encodes the information in the past x 1 k storing the data patterns in the lstm cells the encoder output combined with the information query x k 1 k h are subsequently fed into the decoder to produce the future values in our problem x 1 k composes of time speed and direction of ocean currents while x k 1 k h includes only time as query for speed and direction 2 3 transformer the transformer is a neural network with an encoder decoder structure that is solely based on attention mechanisms vaswani et al 2017 originally developed for nlp both encoder and decoder use attention layers and fully connected feed forward layers as shown in fig 5 both layers include a residual connection and a normalization layer to improve the learning process the model uses self attention to encode information about other time steps when processing an input at a specific time the input representation therefore includes contextual information allowing the model to account for dependencies while the encoder self attention layer can access inputs at all time steps the decoder self attention can only access inputs up to the time step being processed to respect the auto regression finally the encoder decoder cross attention layer allows the decoder to focus on the most relevant inputs to carry out the predictions attention has been developed to improve the accuracy of the existing neural network models thanks to the extra information of correlation that is incorporated into the models let us consider the input data sequence x 1 x 2 x k for each input x i the self attention mechanism creates for all inputs x j a query vector q j a key vector k j and a value vector v j that are linear combinations of x j a correlation weight is then computed using the softmax function w i j softmax α q i t k j where α is a hyperparameter used to have more stable gradients the output of the self attention mechanism is then given for input x i by z i j w i j v j the same mechanism is used for cross attention with the difference that attention is computed between two different vectors as such the model will learn to up weight the significant values and to down weight the insignificant values by multiplying them with the large and small weights respectively finally attention is implemented in the practical form of multi headed attention the attention mechanisms with d 8 heads are used in parallel to enable the model to focus on different positions since the encoder and decoder are trainable the attention layers are trained consequently and converge to the optimal state in which the most correlated information is stored the correlation weights w i j of the cross attention layer are particularly interesting to understand what the model has learned as they show what part of the inputs the model attend to in order to carry out its prediction their visualization are presented in section 3 2 in this paper we propose to use a transformer encoder decoder structure modified to work for time series an embedding layer is used in the original transformer to map words into vectors for time series we replace this layer by a linear fully connected layer to transform input vectors into m dimensional vectors allard 2019 a similar fully connected layer is used at the decoder end to convert back predictions into physical quantities and the softmax loss is replaced by a l2 loss current speed and direction x 1 x 2 x k are used as input of the encoder and predicted current speed and direction x k 1 x k 2 x k h are the output of the decoder decoder input is first an empty time series with a start of prediction token in first position predictions are made step by step and are added to the decoder input to predict current speed and direction at the next time step using attention mechanisms to account for dependencies 2 4 data ocean current data at 831 sites were downloaded from the historic stations dataset on the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website noaa 2020 current speed and directions have been acquired by adcps that were either bottom mounted or shore mounted over measurement campaigns from 1 to 4 months on this dataset 222 stations have data length greater than 2 months sampling interval of the raw data are either 6 min or 10 min we estimated that this was the minimum amount of data necessary to train and test the transformer and the lstm and therefore set the maximum time horizon of the models to 1 month after training both models can predict ocean current for 1 month based on 1 month of data despite the limitation of the dataset to united states water it is expected that predictions will be valid worldwide as the physics of tidal currents remains the same regularization i e dropout for the transformer dropout and early stopping for the lstm enables the models to perform predictions despite measurement noises in the input data however missing data in the inputs are not handled by the models if the missing data gap is less than 1 h linear interpolation allows the models to process the input data to limit the length of the models we gathered daily data into one vector x i therefore the encoder takes as input 30 vectors x 1 x 30 each of which includes ocean current data for 1 day and the decoder outputs 30 vectors x 31 x 60 each corresponding to predictions for 1 day depending on the auv mission a shorter horizon time may also be more practical as less data is required to start the predictions the authors decided to present the predictions with the highest time horizon allowed by the database because shorter horizon models mechanically benefit from a higher quantity of data points leading to better predictive capabilities the performance of the models presented in this paper is therefore a lower bound for models with shorter horizons two data cleaning steps were applied to form the final dataset first we observed that currents at some sites had noisy changes of direction that may be due to local specificity or data acquisition error a typical example is shown in fig 6 we decided to remove these sites from our dataset as we did not have enough information to conclude on the validity of the data second we observed that missing data points in the raw time series coincided with a non physical variation of the ocean current speed as shown in fig 7 we observed a tidal pattern from may 20 2012 to august 6 2012 with clear semi diurnal diurnal and monthly variations and a sudden change of pattern around august 6 2012 as tides are generated by steady state periodic gravitational forces of the sun and the moon the authors believe that this is a consequence of a faulty sensor or of data acquisition errors corresponding sequences were therefore removed from the time series finally an interpolation was carried out to obtain a uniform sampling interval of 1 h this value was set to reduce the size of the models while capturing the important variation of the currents a dataset including 78 stations was finally selected 66 stations were used to train the model and 12 stations were used in a test set to show the ability of the models to predict ocean currents at various locations where no data have previously been used to train the models in addition to the aforementioned historic stations noaa is currently deploying adcps over 61 stations that actively collect the ocean current data at various sites in the territorial sea of the united states noaa 2020 these active stations are similar to the historic stations in most senses but actively working at the moment collecting and sending data in real time the time granule of data sampling is 6 min the sensors are deployed over every 5 8 months then recovered for a couple of hours for maintenance and checking purpose which causes some data gaps in addition there are several data gaps within any deployment time span that might probably be caused by the sensing inconsistency of the sensors due to their harsh working environment indeed we found it challenging to obtain any complete two month data in any active station we instead looked for the incomplete two month data with small data gaps and interpolated the missing data points the data cleansing was conducted in the same manner as that for the historic stations we completed the test set with 4 active stations to ensure that the models work consistently not only with historic data but also with data recently acquired without the need of re training the models besides predictions with harmonic method carried out by noaa are readily available providing a state of the art benchmark to evaluate the models accuracy 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation with measurements from historic stations we present in this section the validation of the models on the 12 historic stations 2 depths for each set aside in the test set as described in section 2 4 we used the adam optimization algorithm kingma and ba 2015 to train the transformer model for 10 epochs and the lstm model for 2 epochs with a constant learning rate of 10 3 and a batch size of 64 bottou 1991 1998 the models were built on the tensorflow platform supporting the implementation of neural network and their training was carried out on a gpu nvidia titan v with a memory of 12 gb after hyperparameter optimization we found that the best transformer architecture has a single layer of encoder and decoder as shown in fig 5 a model dimension m 128 and a fully connected feed forward network with a single layer of dimensionality 256 with relu activation function and a dropout of 0 5 on the other hand the best lstm model adopts a slightly different architecture with two lstm layers each of dimensionality 512 as demonstrated in fig 4 to analyze the performance of the models we computed the speed normalized root mean squared error nrmse defined as the speed rmse normalized by the maximum speed amplitude that allows to compare the prediction accuracy at sites with different current speed magnitude in addition we computed the direction mean absolute error mae to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the speed vector orientation while the rmse has been commonly used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of current speed no standard error has been defined to evaluate prediction accuracy of the current direction the mae represents well the error observed on temporal comparisons because it is proportional to the error at each time step and is therefore presented here both errors are computed on an identical sample for each site and depth with the lstm and the transformer and are shown in table 1 the lstm and transformer have a global averaged nrmse defined as the average of the nrmse for all sites respectively of 0 10 and 0 11 with a corresponding standard deviation respectively of 0 024 and 0 031 in addition the direction mae of the two models remains lower than 30 for all depths and sites as current direction follows a repeating pattern this error can be easily corrected using a heuristic technique the similar performance achieved by both models shows that the transformer s attention mechanism and the lstm s gating mechanism are able to adequately regulate the flow of information for ocean currents data processing to better understand the predicting capabilities of the transformer and of the lstm we show in fig 8 the speed and direction as a function of time as well as the speed fourier transform for station cab1401 at a depth of 35 ft station cab1401 is located at the harbor entrance of portland maine we chose this station to illustrate the performance of the models because station cab1401 has a speed nrmse at a depth of 35 ft close to the global averaged nrmse for both models as shown in table 1 and is therefore representative of the models accuracy speed predictions for station cab1401 match well with experimental measurements as shown in fig 8a the timing of the slack before flood slack before ebb maximum flood and ebb currents are well predicted as well as well as the alternating high and low tides but maximum flood and ebb current speed shows some slight discrepancies direction predictions shown in fig 8b match well with measurements and confirm that the timing of the currents variation is well captured we observe that the regularization of the models i e dropout for the transformer dropout and early stopping for the lstm prevents them from overfitting as they do not capture the excessively high spikes in the measured data that are probably due to data acquisition errors mueller et al 2007 we observe on the fourier transform of the current speed in fig 8c that ocean currents at station cab1401 are driven by long period constituents around 0 hour semi diurnal constituents at 30 hour as well as constituents generated by nonlinear mechanisms in shallow water at 60 hour the models are able to capture all the harmonic constituents up to 120 hour which correspond to the angular speed range covered by the 37 tidal harmonic constituents typically used in harmonic analysis parker 2007 3 2 visualization of attention in the transformer model the attention mechanism is the core component of the transformer model as discussed in section 2 3 the cross attention map defined as the correlation weights w i j between the predicted output sequence and the input sequence is shown in fig 9 this map indicates how much each output value attends to all of the input values fig 9a presents the weights of 4 out of 8 attention heads of the transformer model fig 9b shows the attention weights used to predict the future day 10 for all 8 heads on the 30 day input sequence in both figures each column is a set of weights that sums up to 1 in fig 9a each column indicates the attention of a future day on the x axis to the past days on the y axis day 0 is today day 1 is yesterday day 1 is tomorrow and so on as can be seen from the four heat maps a future day has a higher correlation coefficient with the days around 28 31 days before itself which is in fact the lunar monthly period it is interesting to note that some attention heads converged to an optimal point with a period close to 28 days corresponding to the period of a subset of lunar monthly harmonic constituents e g m 1 m 3 while others converged to an optimal point with a period close to 31 days corresponding to the period of an other subset of lunar monthly harmonic constituents e g l 2 similarly the attention mechanism also attends with a lower correlation to the days around 13 15 days before itself which corresponds to the harmonic constituents with a half monthly period e g o 1 o o 1 all 8 attention heads are shown in fig 9b for the prediction of future day 10 we can easily notice the monthly and half monthly periods i e day 10 attends back to around day 18 and day 4 respectively however we also observe some low correlation weights spread on different days e g in attention heads 4 and 7 making the full interpretation of the transformer more challenging this pattern could be explained by the need of the transformer model to attend all inputs data with low weights in order to carry out its predictions further research is needed to determine the role that these correlation weights have in the transformer predictions 3 3 comparison with harmonic method on measurements from active stations harmonic method is one of the most popular approaches to modelling time series data particularly to those whose visualization exposes some periodic pattern it is along with auto regressive integrated moving average arima models classified as of the classic methods as opposed to the modern ones using neural network yet it is still widely used today the essence of harmonic method is to find harmonic components that can be obtained by applying the fourier transform to the selected data windows and filtering out the harmonic components with small weights if the harmonic frequencies are identified beforehand the method is focused on determining their weights using for instance least squares regression and adjusting for the variations due to the non harmonic factors in modelling ocean currents noaa took the second approach as harmonic patterns of ocean currents can be identified with specific frequencies since they are governed by the sun and the moon noaa applied different procedures the choice of which is based on the volume of available data in order to determine the harmonic weights the final models were subsequently adjusted for variations such as de tiding the time series data it is essential to note that each time series data requires a model that is a set of harmonic constants thus the number of models is corresponding to the number of stations in the ocean current modelling problem which results in a huge workload specifically noaa used the historic stations data to build the separate models for the corresponding sites depending on the amount of collected data in the stations the models were built independently using different procedures the predictions using these models are called harmonic predictions as they are based directly on the harmonic models and these stations are called reference stations beside the harmonic predictions the subordinate predictions are made for the subordinate stations close to a reference station but without the collected data we are interested in the harmonic predictions as we want to compare our models performance to the harmonic method performance the speed predictions and nrmses by the lstm transformer and harmonic method are respectively shown in fig 10 and table 2 for the four active stations set aside in the test set as described in section 2 4 we observe in table 2 that the nrmses computed with the lstm and transformer predictions at the active stations have the same order of magnitude than these computed at the historic stations in table 1 except for station cb0701 this can be explained by the erratic variations of the ocean current speed at this site as shown in fig 10d that are not common in the historic stations dataset used to train the models the lstm and transformer are however able to better predict the ocean current speed at this site than the harmonic method as shown in table 2 actually the neural network based models have equivalent nrmse in 3 out of 4 active stations and a much lower nrmse in the fourth one which shows despite the limited number of comparisons that they provide state of art predictions as can be seen in fig 10 all the models capture well the periodic time points when the flood and ebb currents occur the harmonic method predictions however fail to match the peak values in the stations jx0302 and jx0701 due to the inflexibility of the method that is the harmonic method can identify well the current patterns but it is not adapting to the changes of current amplitudes due to its fixed harmonic constituents the neural network based methods on the other hand take into account the most recent information combined with the memorized patterns to produce the predictions that incorporate the details of long and short time thus the proposed methods are more adapting to the change of currents over time it is interesting to notice that the neural network based models perform better than the harmonic one in cb0701 and worse in hb0401 while the ocean current speed at the former station has a less regular pattern than at the latter the authors do not have solid explanation for this our conjecture is that the proposed models are more capable of capturing minor details in time series patterns are not deliberately selected beforehand when training the neural network based models instead the training procedure converges the network weights to embrace all major and minor patterns except the randomness in the harmonic method on the other hand the manual selection of harmonic periods may limit the number of patterns that can be generated by the model in terms of computational efficiency all three models take linear time o h where h is the prediction horizon because their time complexities are similar the running time per prediction is estimated instead as a metric to compare their computational efficiency the lstm and transformer models both have a running time of o 10 2 seconds per prediction on a normal personal computer while we don t have access to the noaa prediction system we built an equivalent harmonic model with the same number of harmonic components as that of noaa the alternative model has a running time of o 10 4 seconds per prediction on the same computer it was expected that the harmonic model would run faster than the deep learning models as it involves a small number of simple mathematical operations while the others handle matrix vector multiplications however a running time of o 10 2 seconds per prediction is short enough for the proposed models to be qualified for real time predictions 4 conclusions we developed deep auto regressive networks to predict ocean currents speed and direction at any location with a state of the art accuracy and without having been trained with data from this location a lstm recurrent neural network and a transformer using attention mechanisms have been modified to process ocean currents data and trained with a subset of the historic stations dataset from noaa both models are able to predict ocean currents for 1 month at any site in the territorial sea of the united states using one month of measured data as input they have similar performance and their accuracy is equivalent to the well known harmonic method the lstm is likely to be a better choice for future deployments because it is easier to train and more widely spread among the scientific and engineering community these models provide a significant improvement compared to the harmonic method where harmonic constituents need to be analyzed and harmonic constants computed for each site before predictions can be carried out notably these models allow the real time in situ prediction of ocean currents for auvs navigation auvs are expected to be widely deployed in the near future for seafloor mapping both models could for instance be used to support the seafloor mapping of the united states exclusive economic zone eez and of the alaskan coastline the extension of the models to other regions in the world remains to be evaluated both models have been trained to learn the principal ocean currents patterns and should therefore be able to provide to some extent predictions at any location in the world re training of the models on a dataset representative of the regional ocean currents distribution should however be considered to fully exploit the predictive power of the neural networks credit authorship contribution statement alexandre

20846,the interaction of oblique water waves with a land fixed oscillating water column owc type wave energy converter is examined two dimensional linear wave theory is used to formulate the mathematical problem the matched eigenfunction expansion method eem using dual series relations and the boundary element method bem with quadratic elements are utilized to solve the associated boundary value problem bvp the novelty of the present work lies on addressing the influence of oblique water waves on the owc efficiency and the use of dual series relations to solve this type of bvp variations of the hydrodynamic efficiency with the wave angle of incidence and with the chamber length and front barrier draft to water depth ratios are discussed both analytical and numerical results were found to be in good agreement findings revealed that by increasing the angle of incidence a broader hydrodynamic efficiency band and a higher wave frequency at which resonance occurs are both obtained this aspect may offer benefits to wave power extraction in real sea conditions for fixed owc devices finally cases published in the specialized literature were recovered and very good agreement was achieved keywords oscillating water column oblique waves eigenfunction expansion method boundary element method hydrodynamic efficiency 1 introduction in order to attenuate the effect of global warming and meet the electricity demands of the rapidly increasing world population a prompt conversion from fossil fuel energy systems to renewable energy technologies is required in this sense wave energy has been suggested as a potential renewable source to provide most of the world electricity needs in the short term izquierdo et al 2019 a wide variety of technologies have been proposed over the past few decades among which the owc device has been proven to be one of the most promising systems for ocean wave energy harvesting the owc device is a unique system among wave energy converters wecs since it only consists of two main parts a partially submerged collecting chamber and a power take off pto mechanism which is located above sea level and thus evades direct exposure to the seawater it also possess a simple working principle where due to the wave action the water column inside the collecting chamber vertically oscillates driving the confined air volume back and forth through a turbine coupled to a generator falcão and henriques 2016 however despite its simplicity one of the greatest issues of this kind of wec is the economical aspect lin et al 2015 for the sake of encouraging the development of owc technology its installation into a breakwater has been extensively investigated in the last few decades vicinanza et al 2019 this integration provides several benefits with an owc power plant integrated into a breakwater energy extraction becomes more cost effective since installation and maintenance costs are shared the operation of the power plant becomes easier and the utilization of mooring systems and underwater electric cables is avoided additionally due to the energy absorption into the owc chamber both the hydraulic performance of the breakwater to coastal protection by reducing the wave reflection and the disturbance in the navigation of vessels at harbor entrances are improved taking into account these aspects integrated owc breakwater systems for wave power conversion can turn into a reliable wave energy technology with the potential to become commercially successful shortly for this purpose further research should be carried out to attain a better understanding of the relationship among owc structural design the control strategy of the pto mechanism wave climate and hydraulic performance and thus to demonstrate the economic potential of owc breakwater systems by achieving competitive costs and high reliability in the specialized literature most studies on owc systems focus on their interaction considering that waves propagate normally towards the device evans and porter 1995 morris thomas et al 2006 şentürk and ozdamar 2012 rezanejad et al 2013 koley and trivedi 2020 table 1 however in real sea conditions water waves direction is not always perpendicular with respect to the owc chamber transverse axis jin et al 2012 for instance this is the case of the mutriku wave energy plant mwep where the water waves direction is mainly oblique with respect to the integrated owc breakwater system in this particular case the breakwater that houses the owc power plant is oriented to the north northeast and follows a boomerang shaped design which makes the chambers to face the mostly north western incoming sea waves at a varying angle and to interact with different waves due to changes in the nearby bathymetry ibarra berastegi et al 2018 the total pressure generated at the chambers is therefore relatively different and a distinct incoming airflow on each of the 14 working wells turbines is thus generated as a consequence even though the structural design is the same among the chambers the electricity generated by the turbines varies thus motivated by the aforementioned points this work investigates the influence of the wave angle of incidence on the hydrodynamic performance of an integrated owc breakwater system previous studies have investigated the influence of the owc structural characteristics on its hydrodynamic performance with the aid of analytical experimental and numerical techniques wang et al 2002 morris thomas et al 2006 martins rivas and mei 2009 şentürk and ozdamar 2012 rezanejad et al 2013 ning et al 2015 john ashlin et al 2016 ning et al 2016b zheng et al 2019b a 2020 koley and trivedi 2020 belibassakis et al 2020 medina rodríguez et al 2020 by using a numerical approach the hydrodynamic performance of an owc device with arbitrary topography near the shoreline was analyzed by 45 in their work the authors showed that a modification in water depth at the shoreline has a significant effect on the owc hydrodynamic performance 30 experimental studied the effect of front wall geometry on the owc hydrodynamic efficiency and concluded that the peak values of the hydrodynamic efficiency are not significantly influenced by the front barrier geometry 26 developed a theoretical model for a vertical owc installed on a straight and cliff like coast the authors found that the shore reflection roughly doubles the energy absorption while the considered pto produces a higher efficiency over a broad frequency band by using the eem and a galerkin approximation the hydrodynamic efficiency of an owc with a gap in its fully submerged front wall was analyzed by 40 the authors showed that by selecting the appropriate geometrical parameters it is possible to obtain improvements on the owc hydrodynamic efficiency the impact of stepped bottom topography on the efficiency of a nearshore owc device was analyzed by 36 in their work it was found that significant effects on the owc hydrodynamic performance occur when a stepped bottom profile outside of the chamber is considered 31 carried out a time domain analysis of the performance of a fixed owc device based on a higher order bem in a 2d fully nonlinear numerical wave flume the authors investigated the influence of the bottom slope on the hydrodynamic efficiency and concluded that the chamber geometric configuration has a significant effect on the hydrodynamic performance 17 experimentally investigated the influence of the bottom profile configuration on the owc hydrodynamic performance by testing four different bottom profiles flat circular curved and sloped in a wave flume the authors found that the circular curved bottom profile inside the chamber was more effective for wave energy conversion 33 investigated the effects of the incident wave amplitude and the geometric parameters on the hydrodynamic efficiency of a fixed owc the authors reported that an increase in the bottom slope can increase the optimal hydrodynamic efficiency while the incident wave amplitude and the bottom slope have a minor effect on the resonant frequency an analysis of the three dimensional effects affecting the u owc performance was developed by 25 the authors showed that 3d effects are significant when the device width is smaller than 20 m resulting in an improvement in power output per unit width 49 carried out a theoretical model to study the performance of a circular cylindrical owc along a vertical coast breakwater considering the thickness of the chamber wall it was found that the angle of incidence and the thickness of the chamber wall both affect the wave power captured by the owc 48 employed the eem to develop a theoretical model for the evaluation of the hydrodynamic performance of multiple circular cylinder owcs located along a vertical straight coast the authors found that the hydrodynamic performance of the owc devices was enhanced significantly for a certain range of wave conditions due to the constructive wave interference from the owcs array and the coast 50 analyzed the influence of the entrance radius of the owc chamber and the wall thickness of the tubular structure they showed that a thinner chamber wall thickness results in a higher wave power extraction in terms of a broader bandwidth of efficiency curves 20 employed a coupled eem bem to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of an owc device located on an undulated seabed and concluded that the owc structural configuration and bottom profile play a significant role in the hydrodynamic efficiency 3 employed a 2d bem model for analyzing the owc s response in general bathymetry regions and found that the bottom slope and curvature can be relevant to the owc performance by using the bem the effects of the front wall thickness and the bottom profile of an owc device on its efficiency were analyzed by 28 the authors showed that by increasing the thickness of the front barrier the bandwidth on the efficiency curves is significantly reduced the eem to obtain dual series relations that are then solved by applying the least square method has been successfully employed to analyze the scattering and radiation of water waves by segmented breakwaters or vertical barriers dalrymple and martin 1990 losada et al 1992 abul azm 1996 lee and chwang 2000 sahoo et al 2000 choudhary and martha 2016 2017 the latter method was developed by 19 to solve dual series relations and its convergence was approached theoretically by 13 by using variational methods and the eem 7 determined the reflection and transmission coefficients due to the interaction of water waves with a long linear array of offshore breakwaters 24 analyzed the propagation of oblique incident waves through a rigid vertical thin barrier in water of uniform finite depth they matched the horizontal components of the velocity at the right and left sides of the thin barrier and at the gap to obtain the corresponding dual series relations 1 investigated the wave reflection and dynamic displacement of a submerged flexible breakwater and showed that the proposed submerged breakwaters are generally less effective in reflecting waves than the surface piercing breakwaters the scattering and radiation of surface waves by several types of permeable vertical porous barriers in finite water depth were studied by 21 38 studied the wave trapping by vertical porous barriers and the wave generation by vertical porous wavemakers in front of the end wall of a semi infinitely long channel with the help of a perturbation analysis the scattering of water waves by bottom undulation in the presence of different kinds of thin vertical barriers was solved by 5 the objective of this paper is to extend the work done by 10 on the owc water wave interaction by considering oblique incidental waves this is in order to analyze its influence on the efficiency bandwidth and thus provide further possibilities to improve the performance and design of integrated owc breakwater systems in various sea states to the authors knowledge both theoretical and numerical studies for analyzing the interaction of oblique water waves with a 2d integrated owc breakwater system have not been examined in the past the fundamental hypothesis of the present work is that the angle of incidence has a significant influence on the hydrodynamic efficiency band as important as the length of the chamber and front barrier s draft therefore this work examines the two dimensional hydrodynamic interaction of oblique water waves with an owc device under the potential flow approach linear wave theory is employed and the viscous effects and the nonlinear air compressibility are neglected two different mathematical techniques are presented to solve the associated bvp the first one is the well known semi analytic matched eem which leads to dual series relations to obtain the correct matching conditions at the front barrier these relations are solved by a least squares technique to find the amplitudes of the propagating and evanescent wave modes both upwave and down wave the second one is the bem which is a numerical technique based on an integral equation formulation the bem with a second order discretization will be employed in this work and is used to compare the results with the ones found from the semi analytic method the main objectives of this work lie a on the analysis of the bandwidth modification on the efficiency curves due to oblique incident waves interacting with an owc device and b the reduction on the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency due to the trapped air column inside the chamber analytical and numerical calculations for the hydrodynamic efficiency are presented for a range of different parameters furthermore analytical and numerical outcomes for particular cases are compared with previous results obtained by 10 2 problem formulation the cartesian coordinate system was chosen with the x y plane on the mean position of the free surface and the z axis pointing upwards the origin of the coordinate system is situated on the undisturbed free surface and the left rigid vertical wall the owc consists of this left rigid wall located at x 0 and complemented by a vertical surface piercing barrier at x b with a draft h a as shown in fig 1 the 2 dimensional case is considered with the owc being infinitely long and parallel to the incoming wave crest the domain considered was separated into two regions region 1 0 x b h z 0 and region 2 b x h z 0 the front wall is denoted by l b x z x b h a z 0 the gap between the immersed tip of the front barrier and the sea bottom is given by l g x z x b h z h a the left rigid wall by s w x z x 0 h z 0 the free surface inside chamber by s i x z 0 x b z 0 the external free surface by s f x z b x z 0 and the flat bottom by s b x z 0 x z h the fluid was assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and the wave motion was considered to be represented adequately by the linearized wave theory disregarding surface tension effects the wave incidence angle θ is defined by the angle between x axis and the direction of wave propagation by assuming an irrotational flow we define a simple harmonic in time velocity potential φ x z t re ϕ x z e i ω t i κ y where re denotes the real part of a complex expression ω is the angular frequency κ k sin θ k is the wavenumber of the plane progressive wave and t is the time the spatial velocity potential ϕ then satisfies the helmholtz equation 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 κ 2 ϕ 0 along with the no flow boundary condition on the solid boundaries such as the bottom the front barrier and the left rigid vertical wall described by 2 ϕ n 0 for x z s b l b and s w together with the continuity of pressure and horizontal velocity across the vertical plane separating the fluid regions 3 ϕ ϕ and ϕ x ϕ x on x b h z h a a pressure distribution p t over the internal free surface is imposed and after considering simple harmonic motions for the pressure and the free surface p t η t re p ζ e i ω t the internal and external linearized free surface boundary conditions are 4 ϕ z k ϕ i ω p ρ g on z 0 0 x b 0 on z 0 b x respectively with k ω 2 g ρ being the seawater density and g the gravitational constant the potential is then decomposed into a scattered and a radiated potential as in 10 as follows 5 ϕ x z ϕ s i ω p ρ g ϕ r where the ϕ s is the solution of the scattering of an incident wave coming from x in the absence of an imposed pressure on the internal free surface satisfying eqs 1 4 with p 0 while ϕ r represents the solution of the radiation problem due to an oscillating pressure distribution imposed on the internal free surface in the absence of incoming waves and satisfies eqs 1 4 with eq 4 replaced by 6 ϕ r z k ϕ r 1 on z 0 0 x b additionally for the diffraction and radiation problems the sommerfeld radiation condition is applied at the right end of the domain as follows 7 ϕ d r x i k cos θ ϕ d r 0 as x with ϕ d being the diffracted potential that together with the incident potential ϕ i composed the scattered potential ϕ s while k is the wavenumber and real root of the wave dispersion relation given by 8 ω 2 g k tanh k h similar to the velocity potential the time harmonic induced volume flux across the internal free surface q t re q e i ω t is decomposed into scattering and radiation volume fluxes q s and q r respectively across s i as follows 9 q s i ϕ z d x q s i ω p ρ g q r and since the continuity of volume flux should be ensured across the internal free surface and the gap below the barrier tip we obtain 10 q s r s i ϕ s r z d x l g ϕ s r x d z furthermore the radiation volume flux q r is decomposed into real and imaginary parts as follows 11 i ω p ρ g q r b i a p z p with z b i a being a complex admittance while the real coefficients a and b are related to the added mass and the radiation damping coefficients in a rigid body system respectively evans and porter 1995 these coefficients are then called the radiation susceptance and the radiation conductance parameters evans and porter 1995 described by 12a a ω ρ g re q r 12b b ω ρ g im q r respectively with im denoting the imaginary part of a complex expression now by assuming a linear relationship between the volume flux through the turbine and the pressure drop across it evans 1982 we have 13 q λ i ϱ p where λ is a real control parameter associated with the linear turbine damping induced to the airflow air compressibility is modeled assuming a linearized isentropic relationship with the trapped air within the chamber being an ideal gas and where the compression expansion process is adiabatic and reversible thus the quantity ϱ ω v 0 γ p a represents the compressibility of the trapped air with v 0 being the air volume γ the specific heat ratio of air equal to 1 4 and p a the atmospheric air pressure rezanejad et al 2017 after combining eqs 9 11 and 13 the imposed internal pressure yields 14 p q s λ z i ϱ by averaging over one wave period the total rate of work done by the pressure forces inside the owc q t p t it gives 15 w 1 2 re p

exists the maximum work results 17 w m a x q s 2 8 b when p q s 2 b with λ z i ϱ for maximum power combining eqs 14 and 16 gives 18 w q s 2 8 b 1 λ z i ϱ λ z i ϱ 2 to optimize the power conversion efficiency the optimum value of λ must be determined this value is obtained by applying zero value to the derivative for the squared right term inside the brackets of eq 18 with respect to λ şentürk and ozdamar 2012 yielding 19 λ o p t z i ϱ b 2 a ϱ 2 1 2 and substituting the above expression into eq 18 gives 20 w o p t q s 2 8 b 1 λ o p t b λ o p t b with a b and λ being function of the angular frequency ω hence the expression for the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is of the form 21 η m a x w o p t w m a x 2 b λ o p t b with η m a x in the range of 0 to 1 in the ideal case of η m a x 1 it indicates that the owc device has effectively captured all of the incident wave energy the internal free surface is excited in a piston type resonant mode and the pto damping optimization is satisfied michele et al 2019 such condition will remain if the rate of energy extraction equates to the rate of radiation damping while the state of resonance in the internal free surface is preserved which requires that the radiated waves superpose and cancel the incident and scattered waves morris thomas et al 2006 following 10 we now define the non dimensionalized quantities μ and ν as follows 22a μ ρ g ω b a 22b ν ρ g ω b b which represent the radiation susceptance and radiation conductance coefficients respectively the radiation conductance coefficient ν represents the energy transfer into the system while the radiation susceptance coefficient μ the energy that remains un captured rezanejad et al 2013 finally after substituting the above coefficients into eq 21 the hydrodynamic efficiency η m a x gives 23 η m a x 2 1 μ ν ρ g ω b ϱ ν 2 1 2 1 this last expression is independent of the incident wave power and only depends on the radiated volume flux q r now by neglecting the effect of the air compressibility i e ϱ 0 it gives rise to the expression previously reported by 10 24 η m a x 2 1 μ ν 2 1 2 1 3 solution method 3 1 matched eigenfunction expansion method in this subsection the

with r 1 since due to the owc structure all the incident wave energy is reflected evans and porter 1995 application of the second matching condition eq 3 at x b with the velocity potentials described by eqs 25a and 25b together with the boundary condition at the barrier eq 2 applied to both velocity potentials adding their corresponding results and exploiting the orthonormality of the

squares can be employed dalrymple and martin 1990 here the method of minimal squares is implemented which requires 36 h 0 f z 2 d z to be minimum minimizing the above with respect to the a n r leads to the following expression 37 h 0 f f z a n r d z 0 for m 0 where f is the complex conjugate of f this condition of minimum integral can also expanded as 38 h h a f f z a n r d z h a 0 f f z a n r d

a n r simultaneously a complex n e m 1 n e m 1 system of equations for the determination of the unknowns is then obtained finally a similar solution procedure as described above can be used for the scattering problem 3 2 boundary element method 3 2 1 boundary integral equation in this subsection our focus is the bem to solve the associated bvp in the frequency domain the boundary integral equation for the representation of the helmholtz expression eq 1 is given by 41 α p ϕ p γ ϕ q ψ p q n q d γ q γ ψ p q ϕ q n q d γ q with ϕ being the unknown velocity potential ϕ n is the derivative of the potential relative to normal unit vector on the boundary γ p x z and q ξ ˆ η ˆ are respectively the source and field points inside the domain ω d γ is the length of an infinitesimal piece of γ ψ and ψ n represent respectively the fundamental solution of helmholtz equation and its normal derivative at point q of the boundary and the parameter α ϑ 2 π with ϑ being the angle in radians between points p and q katsikadelis 2002 the fundamental solution of helmholtz equation is 42 ψ k 0 k r sin θ 2 π where k 0 being the zeroth order modified bessel function of the second kind and r x ξ ˆ 2 z η ˆ 2 is the distance between the source p and the arbitrary point q this expression satisfies eq 1 and it could also have been written in terms of hankel functions brebbia and dominguez 1992 for the case of normal incidence the spatial velocity potential ϕ satisfies the laplace equation 43 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 whose fundamental solution is given by 44 ψ 1 2 π ln r 3 2 2 discretization of the boundary integral equation by subdividing the boundary of the computational domain into n e boundary elements eq 41 can then be discretized as 45 α i ϕ i j 1 n e γ ϕ ψ n d γ j 1 n e γ ψ ϕ n d γ with i indicating the boundary node while j the boundary element in the above expression the values of ϕ and ϕ n are assumed to have a three noded quadratic variation on each element for this purpose these variables are written in terms of interpolation functions φ ˆ 1 2 3 as a function of a homogeneous coordinate ξ thus 46a ϕ ξ φ ˆ 1 ϕ 1 φ ˆ 2 ϕ 2 φ ˆ 3 ϕ 3 46b ϕ ξ n φ ˆ 1 ϕ 1 n φ ˆ 2 ϕ 2 n φ ˆ 3 ϕ 3 n whilst the variation of the x and z coordinates in terms of ξ is given by 47a x φ ˆ 1 x 1 φ ˆ 2 x 2 φ ˆ 3 x 3 47b z φ ˆ 1 z 1 φ ˆ 2 z 2 φ ˆ 3 z 3 and the interpolation functions are of the form 48 φ ˆ 1 1 2 ξ ξ 1 φ ˆ 2 1 2 1 ξ 1 ξ φ ˆ 3 1 2 ξ 1 ξ with ξ varying from 1 to 1 and where the superscript indicates the number of the node after using eqs 46a and 46b the integrals from eq 45 can be written as 49 γ j ϕ ψ n d γ γ j φ ˆ 1 ψ n d γ γ j φ ˆ 2 ψ n d γ γ j φ ˆ 3 ψ n d γ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 and 50 γ j ψ ϕ n d γ γ j φ ˆ 1 ψ d γ γ j φ ˆ 2 ψ d γ γ j φ ˆ 3 ψ d γ ϕ 1 n ϕ 2 n ϕ 3 n to compute the above integrals the calculation of the jacobian is required since they are a function of γ while the interpolation functions are ξ dependent thus we have 51 d γ d x d ξ 2 d z d ξ 2 d ξ j d ξ where the jacobian j can now be inserted into eqs 49 50 hence the discretized boundary integral expression eq 45 can be written as 52 α i ϕ i j 1 n e h 1 i j h 2 i j h 3 i j ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 j j 1 n e g 1 i j g 2 i

gaussian quadrature rule details of the above theory can be found in 8 we now define the arrangement for fluxes and potentials on each element as in 8 fluxes hold a unique nodal value on every element so the possibility of having different values between adjoining elements is considered while velocity potentials always hold a unique value in the connection between two adjoining elements hence fluxes are arranged in a 3 n e array while velocity potentials in an n array where n is the number of nodes equal to 2 n e for closed boundaries this leads to the following representation of eq 52 as 54 α i ϕ i h ˆ i 1 h ˆ i n ϕ 1 ϕ n j g i 1 g i n e ϕ n 1 ϕ n 2 ϕ n 3 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 2 ϕ n 3 n e j where the coefficients h ˆ i j are equal to the h 1 term of a j element plus the h 3 term of the j 1 element for odd nodes while for central nodes the coefficients h ˆ i j are equal to the h 2 term of the corresponding j element the coefficients g i j are 1 3 matrices defined by g 1 i j g 2 i j g 3 i j then eq 54 can be simplified as 55 h φ g φ n with h and g being square n n and rectangular n 3 n e matrixes respectively while φ and φ n are vectors with dimensions n 1 and 3 n e 1 respectively 3 2 3 matching of the subdomains the two region domain with a common boundary on the gap below the front barrier is shown in fig 2a following 36 the method of subdomains is used to match the regions and to avoid numerical instabilities associated with the considered thin front wall of the owc device thus aiming to match the regions the continuity of velocity potential and flux at the common interface should be made katsikadelis 2002 becker 1992 for this purpose the nodes in the common interface γ 12 of regions 1 and 2 are assumed to be in perfect contact fig 2b these continuity velocity potential and flux conditions are 56a φ 12 1 φ 12 2 56b φ n 12 1 φ n 12 2 respectively then boundary conditions defined by eqs 2 4 6 and 7 are inserted into eq 52 and the known variables are shifted to the right hand side while the unknowns to the left hand side thus the following matrix is obtained 57 a x b where a is a square matrix of dimensions n n x is a n 1 vector containing the unknown values of the velocity potential or fluxes on the boundaries and the common interface and b is a known vector of dimension n 1 dominguez 1993 4 convergence study before performing the numerical calculations a convergence analysis for both eem and bem was carried out first in table 2 the results obtained by the matched eem for the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency η m a x radiation susceptance μ and radiation conductance ν for different values of the non dimensional frequency k h 0 5 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 are given the choice of the number of evanescent modes n e m must be done carefully as small values for n e m lead to truncation errors especially when large incidence wave angles are considered from table 2 it is observed that around 50 60 evanescent modes are enough to ensure convergence of the analytical results within three decimal places thus in the present calculations n e m in a range between 50 60 is employed then in table 3 the results of η m a x μ and ν for the same k h values are given for different number of nodes n in this case around 528 nodes 264 quadratic elements ensure enough convergence of the numerical results within three decimal places therefore 528 nodes are selected to discretize the bvp 5 validation to validate the analytical and numerical methods described here the numerical results for the limiting case of 10 were used in figs 3a and 3b in the case of b h 1 0 for h a h 0 125 0 5 and h a h 0 5 for b h 0 25 0 5 respectively the hydrodynamic efficiency results obtained by the present formulations were compared with the corresponding results of 10 for an owc device with a horizontal topography and normal wave propagation the black dots in figs 3 depict the results of 10 whereas the blue dashed line represents the results calculated by the eem and the black dashed line the results obtained by the bem it can be seen that in both figures the results are in good agreement 6 results and discussion in this section numerical results based on previously discussed eem and bem are presented the effects of the incidence wave angle the chamber configuration and the linearized air compressibility on the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency are commented in the case of the bem to minimize the effect of local disturbances at the far field boundary a distance of 4 times the water depth h between the front barrier and the far field boundary was considered in both formulations the water depth was 7 90 m as in 28 with a wave period t bounded by 2 50 t 30 s 6 1 effect of the angle of incidence the analytical and numerical results of the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency η m a x versus the non dimensional frequency k h for different angles of incidence θ 1 5 3 0 4 5 6 0 and 7 5 are shown in figs 4a c in these figures it is observed that the greater the angle of incidence θ the smaller the incoming wave period at which the owc resonates it is also observed that with an increase in θ the bandwidth of the efficiency curves is increased this aspect of the efficiency curves may be beneficial when selecting the location of an integrated owc breakwater system in practice an owc device with a range of frequency bandwidth coincident with the most predominant wave period and direction of a particular location can make better use of the available wave energy on the other hand it is observed that in general the analytical and numerical results are in good agreement especially for small frequencies and when a short wave angle of incidence is considered the variations of the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency versus the angle of incidence θ in the range of 0 θ 9 0 for different values of k h 0 625 1 25 and 2 50 are shown in figs 5a c it is observed that for small frequencies η m a x drops as θ tends to 90 while for large values of k h the curves first increase up to a peak and then drop furthermore as expected the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency becomes zero when θ 9 0 due to the null excitation of the inside water column by the parallel incident waves the analytical results of η m a x versus the non dimensional frequency k h and the angle of incidence θ are shown in figs 6a f in these figures the previous results from figs 4 and 5 are also shown with their corresponding curves and labels first in figs 6a b two zones with high values of the hydrodynamic efficiency are observed the first one with a boomerang shaped is due to large motions in the internal water column that occur when the fluid is excited by the incident wave into a resonant piston like motion evans and porter 1995 this red big zone of peak hydrodynamic efficiency may provide valuable information for the efficient harnessing of wave energy of owc devices since as previously mentioned an integrated owc breakwater system can be designed to coincide with the prevailing wave climate of a particular location and thus to optimize the use of the available wave energy resource on the other hand the second red zone located on the left corner for relatively small angles of incidence 0 θ 4 0 is due to the excitation into an antisymmetric sloshing mode on the internal free surface produced by the incident wave frequency in this situation the sloshing frequencies occur at values of the dimensionless wavenumber k b n π with n being the sloshing mode for this case it is observed that this peak in η m a x due to the first sloshing frequency occurs close to k h π then in figs 6c d for h a h 0 25 with b h 0 5 and figs 6e f for h a h 0 5 with b h 0 75 a single red zone of high maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is observed in comparison with the one observed in figs 6a b these two red areas are smaller this is because a higher front wall draft to water depth ratios h a h were considered and a smaller gap leads to a narrower range of frequency bandwidth as it reduces the energy transfer near the free surface due to wave motion 6 2 effect of the chamber configuration figs 7a c and e plot the results of η m a x versus the non dimensional frequency k h for various wall to front barrier spacing ratios b h 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 8 similar to the case when normal wave incidence is considered evans and porter 1995 in these plots it is observed that for a longer chamber relative to the water depth the frequency at which resonance occurs is smaller this is because with an increase in the owc chamber length the water particle motions inside the chamber during one period of motion also increase thus decreasing the value of the non dimensional frequency k h at which resonance occurs as previously reported by 10 and 36 large heaving motions inside the chamber occur when the internal water column is excited by the incident wave into a resonant piston type motion for normal incidence the natural frequency of these large oscillations can be reasonably estimated for small values of b h so the water contained inside the chamber can be regarded as a solid body by using a simple hydrostatic approach it results that the expected resonance occurs at k h h h a these resonances are supposed to occur at k h 8 k h 4 and k h 2 for figs 7a c and e respectively on the other hand figs 7b d and f show the results of η m a x versus the non dimensional frequency k h for different submergence ratios h a h 0 125 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 similar to the case when b h increases when the front wall draft to water depth ratio h a h increases it allows a larger fluid motion inside the chamber and the vertical distance a water fluid particle must travel during a period of oscillation increases therefore the frequency at which resonance occurs is smaller 6 3 influence of the trapped air inside the owc chamber the analytical and numerical results for the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency versus k h for different air column height to chamber length ratio h c b 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 are shown in fig 8a for the calculation of the trapped air volume v 0 the chamber width was kept fixed during the calculations and based on the physical dimensions of a single chamber of the mwep medina rodríguez et al 2020 a value of 1 5 times b was considered in fig 8a it is found that as h c b increases the overall hydrodynamic efficiency decreases in other words as air compressibility accounted for by the isentropic model is taken into account less energy from the waves is absorbed this can also be clearly inferred from eq 23 where it is seen that as the air volume inside the chamber increases the optimum damping induced to the airflow by the linear turbine also increases and hence η m a x decreases since air compressibility in the owc chamber is known to greatly affect the power output of full sized devices it must be addressed in all the preliminary stages of owc system design falcão and henriques 2019 the effect of air compressibility is known to increase with chamber height above the water free surface so it should not be neglected in full scale devices with chamber heights of several meters sarmento and falcão 1985 since significant errors in determining the device performance may result lópez et al 2020 however as explained by 39 it should be pointed out that due to viscous losses in the flow through the turbine air compression and expansion are more complicated and likely to deviate considerably from an isentropic process as considered in this work on the other hand in fig 8b the hydrodynamic efficiency versus k h for different values of the wave angle of incidence θ 1 5 3 0 4 5 6 0 and 7 5 with h c b 1 0 is shown as in fig 4a it is observed that the efficiency band increases when θ increases with a positive sloped trend for very high angles additionally under the influence of linear air compressibility numerical and analytical results in fig 8b show that the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency peak value decreases when less oblique water waves interact with the owc chamber finally fig 8c shows the analytical results for the variation of the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency as a function of the angle of incidence θ and the non dimensional frequency k h together with the curves from fig 8b for h c b 1 0 compared with fig 6a in fig 8c it is easier to observe the damping effect of the linearized air compressibility on the efficiency since the peaks on η m a x are significantly reduced when the phenomena of resonance due to the excitation of the owc and sloshing occur as mentioned before a theoretical value of η m a x 1 means that the owc device successfully captures all the incident wave energy however this is not achievable in practice since dissipative energy processes such as the generation of radiated waves by the oscillatory water motion inside the chamber the scattering of waves produced by the water waves owc device interaction viscous dampings among others occur ning et al 2015 in this sense investigations such as those carried out by 31 33 46 47 have satisfactorily accounted for the energy losses due to vortex shedding and flow separation which occurs near the front wall by introducing an artificial viscous damping term into the dynamic free surface boundary condition inside the owc chamber 7 conclusions the effects on the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency due to the wave angle of incidence and the chamber configuration of an owc device were analyzed the matched eem using dual series relations and the bem with three noded quadratic elements were employed to solve the associated bvp comparisons were performed between these two methods and an optimal agreement was achieved especially for relatively small angles of incidence apart from its simplicity the use of the least squares technique for solving the dual series relations demonstrates to be an efficient method for the calculation of the hydrodynamic efficiency of an owc device when a thin front wall is considered however the choice of evanescent modes in the eem must be done carefully as a small number of them may lead to truncation errors when large angles of incidence at high frequencies are considered furthermore the theoretical cases addressed by 10 for a thin front wall in the case of normal wave incidence were satisfactorily recovered by both analytical and numerical formulations analytical and numerical calculations for the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency were then obtained and analyzed for different physical configurations the results revealed that by increasing the wave angle of incidence the bandwidth of the efficiency curves and the wave frequency at which resonance occurs both increase this can be an important characteristic for the wave energy extraction since in a real scenario owc devices receive incoming waves at varying angle as expected it was observed that for water wave propagation parallel with respect to the owc chamber the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is zero due to the null excitation of the internal water column by the parallel incident waves furthermore it was observed a significant area of high hydrodynamic efficiency that provides the possibility of a more efficient wave energy extraction depending on the diverse incoming wave directions and frequencies of a particular site the effect of the air volume inside the chamber was analyzed by modifying the trapped air volume and it was found that the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is reduced when the air volume increases for oblique waves when the owc chamber length water depth ratio b h is decreased the wave period of maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is shorter a similar trend to that reported by 10 for normal wave incidence regarding the effect of the front wall draft the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency bandwidth significantly increases when the front wall draft to water depth ratio h a h decreases additionally special consideration should be given to the fact that a thin front barrier was considered in this work in practice thin front barriers cannot provide protection to owc systems since they are continuously subjected to high loads due to direct wave action especially during severe storm events and times of high water levels viviano et al 2016 pawitan et al 2019 viviano et al 2019 pawitan et al 2020 medina lopez et al 2015 this paper is only an analytical and numerical investigation on the owc hydrodynamic performance based on linear wave theory further theoretical investigations and experimental campaigns that include other geometrical aspects energy losses through viscous dissipation non linearities on the air compressibility and the turbine damping should be carried out in the future finally it is hoped that the results of this work may encourage the further study of the owc technology and provide valuable information for efficient wave energy harnessing credit authorship

20846,the interaction of oblique water waves with a land fixed oscillating water column owc type wave energy converter is examined two dimensional linear wave theory is used to formulate the mathematical problem the matched eigenfunction expansion method eem using dual series relations and the boundary element method bem with quadratic elements are utilized to solve the associated boundary value problem bvp the novelty of the present work lies on addressing the influence of oblique water waves on the owc efficiency and the use of dual series relations to solve this type of bvp variations of the hydrodynamic efficiency with the wave angle of incidence and with the chamber length and front barrier draft to water depth ratios are discussed both analytical and numerical results were found to be in good agreement findings revealed that by increasing the angle of incidence a broader hydrodynamic efficiency band and a higher wave frequency at which resonance occurs are both obtained this aspect may offer benefits to wave power extraction in real sea conditions for fixed owc devices finally cases published in the specialized literature were recovered and very good agreement was achieved keywords oscillating water column oblique waves eigenfunction expansion method boundary element method hydrodynamic efficiency 1 introduction in order to attenuate the effect of global warming and meet the electricity demands of the rapidly increasing world population a prompt conversion from fossil fuel energy systems to renewable energy technologies is required in this sense wave energy has been suggested as a potential renewable source to provide most of the world electricity needs in the short term izquierdo et al 2019 a wide variety of technologies have been proposed over the past few decades among which the owc device has been proven to be one of the most promising systems for ocean wave energy harvesting the owc device is a unique system among wave energy converters wecs since it only consists of two main parts a partially submerged collecting chamber and a power take off pto mechanism which is located above sea level and thus evades direct exposure to the seawater it also possess a simple working principle where due to the wave action the water column inside the collecting chamber vertically oscillates driving the confined air volume back and forth through a turbine coupled to a generator falcão and henriques 2016 however despite its simplicity one of the greatest issues of this kind of wec is the economical aspect lin et al 2015 for the sake of encouraging the development of owc technology its installation into a breakwater has been extensively investigated in the last few decades vicinanza et al 2019 this integration provides several benefits with an owc power plant integrated into a breakwater energy extraction becomes more cost effective since installation and maintenance costs are shared the operation of the power plant becomes easier and the utilization of mooring systems and underwater electric cables is avoided additionally due to the energy absorption into the owc chamber both the hydraulic performance of the breakwater to coastal protection by reducing the wave reflection and the disturbance in the navigation of vessels at harbor entrances are improved taking into account these aspects integrated owc breakwater systems for wave power conversion can turn into a reliable wave energy technology with the potential to become commercially successful shortly for this purpose further research should be carried out to attain a better understanding of the relationship among owc structural design the control strategy of the pto mechanism wave climate and hydraulic performance and thus to demonstrate the economic potential of owc breakwater systems by achieving competitive costs and high reliability in the specialized literature most studies on owc systems focus on their interaction considering that waves propagate normally towards the device evans and porter 1995 morris thomas et al 2006 şentürk and ozdamar 2012 rezanejad et al 2013 koley and trivedi 2020 table 1 however in real sea conditions water waves direction is not always perpendicular with respect to the owc chamber transverse axis jin et al 2012 for instance this is the case of the mutriku wave energy plant mwep where the water waves direction is mainly oblique with respect to the integrated owc breakwater system in this particular case the breakwater that houses the owc power plant is oriented to the north northeast and follows a boomerang shaped design which makes the chambers to face the mostly north western incoming sea waves at a varying angle and to interact with different waves due to changes in the nearby bathymetry ibarra berastegi et al 2018 the total pressure generated at the chambers is therefore relatively different and a distinct incoming airflow on each of the 14 working wells turbines is thus generated as a consequence even though the structural design is the same among the chambers the electricity generated by the turbines varies thus motivated by the aforementioned points this work investigates the influence of the wave angle of incidence on the hydrodynamic performance of an integrated owc breakwater system previous studies have investigated the influence of the owc structural characteristics on its hydrodynamic performance with the aid of analytical experimental and numerical techniques wang et al 2002 morris thomas et al 2006 martins rivas and mei 2009 şentürk and ozdamar 2012 rezanejad et al 2013 ning et al 2015 john ashlin et al 2016 ning et al 2016b zheng et al 2019b a 2020 koley and trivedi 2020 belibassakis et al 2020 medina rodríguez et al 2020 by using a numerical approach the hydrodynamic performance of an owc device with arbitrary topography near the shoreline was analyzed by 45 in their work the authors showed that a modification in water depth at the shoreline has a significant effect on the owc hydrodynamic performance 30 experimental studied the effect of front wall geometry on the owc hydrodynamic efficiency and concluded that the peak values of the hydrodynamic efficiency are not significantly influenced by the front barrier geometry 26 developed a theoretical model for a vertical owc installed on a straight and cliff like coast the authors found that the shore reflection roughly doubles the energy absorption while the considered pto produces a higher efficiency over a broad frequency band by using the eem and a galerkin approximation the hydrodynamic efficiency of an owc with a gap in its fully submerged front wall was analyzed by 40 the authors showed that by selecting the appropriate geometrical parameters it is possible to obtain improvements on the owc hydrodynamic efficiency the impact of stepped bottom topography on the efficiency of a nearshore owc device was analyzed by 36 in their work it was found that significant effects on the owc hydrodynamic performance occur when a stepped bottom profile outside of the chamber is considered 31 carried out a time domain analysis of the performance of a fixed owc device based on a higher order bem in a 2d fully nonlinear numerical wave flume the authors investigated the influence of the bottom slope on the hydrodynamic efficiency and concluded that the chamber geometric configuration has a significant effect on the hydrodynamic performance 17 experimentally investigated the influence of the bottom profile configuration on the owc hydrodynamic performance by testing four different bottom profiles flat circular curved and sloped in a wave flume the authors found that the circular curved bottom profile inside the chamber was more effective for wave energy conversion 33 investigated the effects of the incident wave amplitude and the geometric parameters on the hydrodynamic efficiency of a fixed owc the authors reported that an increase in the bottom slope can increase the optimal hydrodynamic efficiency while the incident wave amplitude and the bottom slope have a minor effect on the resonant frequency an analysis of the three dimensional effects affecting the u owc performance was developed by 25 the authors showed that 3d effects are significant when the device width is smaller than 20 m resulting in an improvement in power output per unit width 49 carried out a theoretical model to study the performance of a circular cylindrical owc along a vertical coast breakwater considering the thickness of the chamber wall it was found that the angle of incidence and the thickness of the chamber wall both affect the wave power captured by the owc 48 employed the eem to develop a theoretical model for the evaluation of the hydrodynamic performance of multiple circular cylinder owcs located along a vertical straight coast the authors found that the hydrodynamic performance of the owc devices was enhanced significantly for a certain range of wave conditions due to the constructive wave interference from the owcs array and the coast 50 analyzed the influence of the entrance radius of the owc chamber and the wall thickness of the tubular structure they showed that a thinner chamber wall thickness results in a higher wave power extraction in terms of a broader bandwidth of efficiency curves 20 employed a coupled eem bem to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of an owc device located on an undulated seabed and concluded that the owc structural configuration and bottom profile play a significant role in the hydrodynamic efficiency 3 employed a 2d bem model for analyzing the owc s response in general bathymetry regions and found that the bottom slope and curvature can be relevant to the owc performance by using the bem the effects of the front wall thickness and the bottom profile of an owc device on its efficiency were analyzed by 28 the authors showed that by increasing the thickness of the front barrier the bandwidth on the efficiency curves is significantly reduced the eem to obtain dual series relations that are then solved by applying the least square method has been successfully employed to analyze the scattering and radiation of water waves by segmented breakwaters or vertical barriers dalrymple and martin 1990 losada et al 1992 abul azm 1996 lee and chwang 2000 sahoo et al 2000 choudhary and martha 2016 2017 the latter method was developed by 19 to solve dual series relations and its convergence was approached theoretically by 13 by using variational methods and the eem 7 determined the reflection and transmission coefficients due to the interaction of water waves with a long linear array of offshore breakwaters 24 analyzed the propagation of oblique incident waves through a rigid vertical thin barrier in water of uniform finite depth they matched the horizontal components of the velocity at the right and left sides of the thin barrier and at the gap to obtain the corresponding dual series relations 1 investigated the wave reflection and dynamic displacement of a submerged flexible breakwater and showed that the proposed submerged breakwaters are generally less effective in reflecting waves than the surface piercing breakwaters the scattering and radiation of surface waves by several types of permeable vertical porous barriers in finite water depth were studied by 21 38 studied the wave trapping by vertical porous barriers and the wave generation by vertical porous wavemakers in front of the end wall of a semi infinitely long channel with the help of a perturbation analysis the scattering of water waves by bottom undulation in the presence of different kinds of thin vertical barriers was solved by 5 the objective of this paper is to extend the work done by 10 on the owc water wave interaction by considering oblique incidental waves this is in order to analyze its influence on the efficiency bandwidth and thus provide further possibilities to improve the performance and design of integrated owc breakwater systems in various sea states to the authors knowledge both theoretical and numerical studies for analyzing the interaction of oblique water waves with a 2d integrated owc breakwater system have not been examined in the past the fundamental hypothesis of the present work is that the angle of incidence has a significant influence on the hydrodynamic efficiency band as important as the length of the chamber and front barrier s draft therefore this work examines the two dimensional hydrodynamic interaction of oblique water waves with an owc device under the potential flow approach linear wave theory is employed and the viscous effects and the nonlinear air compressibility are neglected two different mathematical techniques are presented to solve the associated bvp the first one is the well known semi analytic matched eem which leads to dual series relations to obtain the correct matching conditions at the front barrier these relations are solved by a least squares technique to find the amplitudes of the propagating and evanescent wave modes both upwave and down wave the second one is the bem which is a numerical technique based on an integral equation formulation the bem with a second order discretization will be employed in this work and is used to compare the results with the ones found from the semi analytic method the main objectives of this work lie a on the analysis of the bandwidth modification on the efficiency curves due to oblique incident waves interacting with an owc device and b the reduction on the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency due to the trapped air column inside the chamber analytical and numerical calculations for the hydrodynamic efficiency are presented for a range of different parameters furthermore analytical and numerical outcomes for particular cases are compared with previous results obtained by 10 2 problem formulation the cartesian coordinate system was chosen with the x y plane on the mean position of the free surface and the z axis pointing upwards the origin of the coordinate system is situated on the undisturbed free surface and the left rigid vertical wall the owc consists of this left rigid wall located at x 0 and complemented by a vertical surface piercing barrier at x b with a draft h a as shown in fig 1 the 2 dimensional case is considered with the owc being infinitely long and parallel to the incoming wave crest the domain considered was separated into two regions region 1 0 x b h z 0 and region 2 b x h z 0 the front wall is denoted by l b x z x b h a z 0 the gap between the immersed tip of the front barrier and the sea bottom is given by l g x z x b h z h a the left rigid wall by s w x z x 0 h z 0 the free surface inside chamber by s i x z 0 x b z 0 the external free surface by s f x z b x z 0 and the flat bottom by s b x z 0 x z h the fluid was assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and the wave motion was considered to be represented adequately by the linearized wave theory disregarding surface tension effects the wave incidence angle θ is defined by the angle between x axis and the direction of wave propagation by assuming an irrotational flow we define a simple harmonic in time velocity potential φ x z t re ϕ x z e i ω t i κ y where re denotes the real part of a complex expression ω is the angular frequency κ k sin θ k is the wavenumber of the plane progressive wave and t is the time the spatial velocity potential ϕ then satisfies the helmholtz equation 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 κ 2 ϕ 0 along with the no flow boundary condition on the solid boundaries such as the bottom the front barrier and the left rigid vertical wall described by 2 ϕ n 0 for x z s b l b and s w together with the continuity of pressure and horizontal velocity across the vertical plane separating the fluid regions 3 ϕ ϕ and ϕ x ϕ x on x b h z h a a pressure distribution p t over the internal free surface is imposed and after considering simple harmonic motions for the pressure and the free surface p t η t re p ζ e i ω t the internal and external linearized free surface boundary conditions are 4 ϕ z k ϕ i ω p ρ g on z 0 0 x b 0 on z 0 b x respectively with k ω 2 g ρ being the seawater density and g the gravitational constant the potential is then decomposed into a scattered and a radiated potential as in 10 as follows 5 ϕ x z ϕ s i ω p ρ g ϕ r where the ϕ s is the solution of the scattering of an incident wave coming from x in the absence of an imposed pressure on the internal free surface satisfying eqs 1 4 with p 0 while ϕ r represents the solution of the radiation problem due to an oscillating pressure distribution imposed on the internal free surface in the absence of incoming waves and satisfies eqs 1 4 with eq 4 replaced by 6 ϕ r z k ϕ r 1 on z 0 0 x b additionally for the diffraction and radiation problems the sommerfeld radiation condition is applied at the right end of the domain as follows 7 ϕ d r x i k cos θ ϕ d r 0 as x with ϕ d being the diffracted potential that together with the incident potential ϕ i composed the scattered potential ϕ s while k is the wavenumber and real root of the wave dispersion relation given by 8 ω 2 g k tanh k h similar to the velocity potential the time harmonic induced volume flux across the internal free surface q t re q e i ω t is decomposed into scattering and radiation volume fluxes q s and q r respectively across s i as follows 9 q s i ϕ z d x q s i ω p ρ g q r and since the continuity of volume flux should be ensured across the internal free surface and the gap below the barrier tip we obtain 10 q s r s i ϕ s r z d x l g ϕ s r x d z furthermore the radiation volume flux q r is decomposed into real and imaginary parts as follows 11 i ω p ρ g q r b i a p z p with z b i a being a complex admittance while the real coefficients a and b are related to the added mass and the radiation damping coefficients in a rigid body system respectively evans and porter 1995 these coefficients are then called the radiation susceptance and the radiation conductance parameters evans and porter 1995 described by 12a a ω ρ g re q r 12b b ω ρ g im q r respectively with im denoting the imaginary part of a complex expression now by assuming a linear relationship between the volume flux through the turbine and the pressure drop across it evans 1982 we have 13 q λ i ϱ p where λ is a real control parameter associated with the linear turbine damping induced to the airflow air compressibility is modeled assuming a linearized isentropic relationship with the trapped air within the chamber being an ideal gas and where the compression expansion process is adiabatic and reversible thus the quantity ϱ ω v 0 γ p a represents the compressibility of the trapped air with v 0 being the air volume γ the specific heat ratio of air equal to 1 4 and p a the atmospheric air pressure rezanejad et al 2017 after combining eqs 9 11 and 13 the imposed internal pressure yields 14 p q s λ z i ϱ by averaging over one wave period the total rate of work done by the pressure forces inside the owc q t p t it gives 15 w 1 2 re p

exists the maximum work results 17 w m a x q s 2 8 b when p q s 2 b with λ z i ϱ for maximum power combining eqs 14 and 16 gives 18 w q s 2 8 b 1 λ z i ϱ λ z i ϱ 2 to optimize the power conversion efficiency the optimum value of λ must be determined this value is obtained by applying zero value to the derivative for the squared right term inside the brackets of eq 18 with respect to λ şentürk and ozdamar 2012 yielding 19 λ o p t z i ϱ b 2 a ϱ 2 1 2 and substituting the above expression into eq 18 gives 20 w o p t q s 2 8 b 1 λ o p t b λ o p t b with a b and λ being function of the angular frequency ω hence the expression for the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is of the form 21 η m a x w o p t w m a x 2 b λ o p t b with η m a x in the range of 0 to 1 in the ideal case of η m a x 1 it indicates that the owc device has effectively captured all of the incident wave energy the internal free surface is excited in a piston type resonant mode and the pto damping optimization is satisfied michele et al 2019 such condition will remain if the rate of energy extraction equates to the rate of radiation damping while the state of resonance in the internal free surface is preserved which requires that the radiated waves superpose and cancel the incident and scattered waves morris thomas et al 2006 following 10 we now define the non dimensionalized quantities μ and ν as follows 22a μ ρ g ω b a 22b ν ρ g ω b b which represent the radiation susceptance and radiation conductance coefficients respectively the radiation conductance coefficient ν represents the energy transfer into the system while the radiation susceptance coefficient μ the energy that remains un captured rezanejad et al 2013 finally after substituting the above coefficients into eq 21 the hydrodynamic efficiency η m a x gives 23 η m a x 2 1 μ ν ρ g ω b ϱ ν 2 1 2 1 this last expression is independent of the incident wave power and only depends on the radiated volume flux q r now by neglecting the effect of the air compressibility i e ϱ 0 it gives rise to the expression previously reported by 10 24 η m a x 2 1 μ ν 2 1 2 1 3 solution method 3 1 matched eigenfunction expansion method in this subsection the

a n r simultaneously a complex n e m 1 n e m 1 system of equations for the determination of the unknowns is then obtained finally a similar solution procedure as described above can be used for the scattering problem 3 2 boundary element method 3 2 1 boundary integral equation in this subsection our focus is the bem to solve the associated bvp in the frequency domain the boundary integral equation for the representation of the helmholtz expression eq 1 is given by 41 α p ϕ p γ ϕ q ψ p q n q d γ q γ ψ p q ϕ q n q d γ q with ϕ being the unknown velocity potential ϕ n is the derivative of the potential relative to normal unit vector on the boundary γ p x z and q ξ ˆ η ˆ are respectively the source and field points inside the domain ω d γ is the length of an infinitesimal piece of γ ψ and ψ n represent respectively the fundamental solution of helmholtz equation and its normal derivative at point q of the boundary and the parameter α ϑ 2 π with ϑ being the angle in radians between points p and q katsikadelis 2002 the fundamental solution of helmholtz equation is 42 ψ k 0 k r sin θ 2 π where k 0 being the zeroth order modified bessel function of the second kind and r x ξ ˆ 2 z η ˆ 2 is the distance between the source p and the arbitrary point q this expression satisfies eq 1 and it could also have been written in terms of hankel functions brebbia and dominguez 1992 for the case of normal incidence the spatial velocity potential ϕ satisfies the laplace equation 43 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 whose fundamental solution is given by 44 ψ 1 2 π ln r 3 2 2 discretization of the boundary integral equation by subdividing the boundary of the computational domain into n e boundary elements eq 41 can then be discretized as 45 α i ϕ i j 1 n e γ ϕ ψ n d γ j 1 n e γ ψ ϕ n d γ with i indicating the boundary node while j the boundary element in the above expression the values of ϕ and ϕ n are assumed to have a three noded quadratic variation on each element for this purpose these variables are written in terms of interpolation functions φ ˆ 1 2 3 as a function of a homogeneous coordinate ξ thus 46a ϕ ξ φ ˆ 1 ϕ 1 φ ˆ 2 ϕ 2 φ ˆ 3 ϕ 3 46b ϕ ξ n φ ˆ 1 ϕ 1 n φ ˆ 2 ϕ 2 n φ ˆ 3 ϕ 3 n whilst the variation of the x and z coordinates in terms of ξ is given by 47a x φ ˆ 1 x 1 φ ˆ 2 x 2 φ ˆ 3 x 3 47b z φ ˆ 1 z 1 φ ˆ 2 z 2 φ ˆ 3 z 3 and the interpolation functions are of the form 48 φ ˆ 1 1 2 ξ ξ 1 φ ˆ 2 1 2 1 ξ 1 ξ φ ˆ 3 1 2 ξ 1 ξ with ξ varying from 1 to 1 and where the superscript indicates the number of the node after using eqs 46a and 46b the integrals from eq 45 can be written as 49 γ j ϕ ψ n d γ γ j φ ˆ 1 ψ n d γ γ j φ ˆ 2 ψ n d γ γ j φ ˆ 3 ψ n d γ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 and 50 γ j ψ ϕ n d γ γ j φ ˆ 1 ψ d γ γ j φ ˆ 2 ψ d γ γ j φ ˆ 3 ψ d γ ϕ 1 n ϕ 2 n ϕ 3 n to compute the above integrals the calculation of the jacobian is required since they are a function of γ while the interpolation functions are ξ dependent thus we have 51 d γ d x d ξ 2 d z d ξ 2 d ξ j d ξ where the jacobian j can now be inserted into eqs 49 50 hence the discretized boundary integral expression eq 45 can be written as 52 α i ϕ i j 1 n e h 1 i j h 2 i j h 3 i j ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 j j 1 n e g 1 i j g 2 i j g 3 i j ϕ n 1 ϕ n 2 ϕ n 3 j with 53a h k i j 1 1 φ ˆ k ξ ψ n j d ξ 53b g k i j 1 1 φ ˆ k ξ ψ j d ξ where k 1 2 and 3 whilst the integrals h k i j and g k i j are computed by applying a 10 point gaussian quadrature rule details of the above theory can be found in 8 we now define the arrangement for fluxes and potentials on each element as in 8 fluxes hold a unique nodal value on every element so the possibility of having different values between adjoining elements is considered while velocity potentials always hold a unique value in the connection between two adjoining elements hence fluxes are arranged in a 3 n e array while velocity potentials in an n array where n is the number of nodes equal to 2 n e for closed boundaries this leads to the following representation of eq 52 as 54 α i ϕ i h ˆ i 1 h ˆ i n ϕ 1 ϕ n j g i 1 g i n e ϕ n 1 ϕ n 2 ϕ n 3 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 2 ϕ n 3 n e j where the coefficients h ˆ i j are equal to the h 1 term of a j element plus the h 3 term of the j 1 element for odd nodes while for central nodes the coefficients h ˆ i j are equal to the h 2 term of the corresponding j element the coefficients g i j are 1 3 matrices defined by g 1 i j g 2 i j g 3 i j then eq 54 can be simplified as 55 h φ g φ n with h and g being square n n and rectangular n 3 n e matrixes respectively while φ and φ n are vectors with dimensions n 1 and 3 n e 1 respectively 3 2 3 matching of the subdomains the two region domain with a common boundary on the gap below the front barrier is shown in fig 2a following 36 the method of subdomains is used to match the regions and to avoid numerical instabilities associated with the considered thin front wall of the owc device thus aiming to match the regions the continuity of velocity potential and flux at the common interface should be made katsikadelis 2002 becker 1992 for this purpose the nodes in the common interface γ 12 of regions 1 and 2 are assumed to be in perfect contact fig 2b these continuity velocity potential and flux conditions are 56a φ 12 1 φ 12 2 56b φ n 12 1 φ n 12 2 respectively then boundary conditions defined by eqs 2 4 6 and 7 are inserted into eq 52 and the known variables are shifted to the right hand side while the unknowns to the left hand side thus the following matrix is obtained 57 a x b where a is a square matrix of dimensions n n x is a n 1 vector containing the unknown values of the velocity potential or fluxes on the boundaries and the common interface and b is a known vector of dimension n 1 dominguez 1993 4 convergence study before performing the numerical calculations a convergence analysis for both eem and bem was carried out first in table 2 the results obtained by the matched eem for the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency η m a x radiation susceptance μ and radiation conductance ν for different values of the non dimensional frequency k h 0 5 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 are given the choice of the number of evanescent modes n e m must be done carefully as small values for n e m lead to truncation errors especially when large incidence wave angles are considered from table 2 it is observed that around 50 60 evanescent modes are enough to ensure convergence of the analytical results within three decimal places thus in the present calculations n e m in a range between 50 60 is employed then in table 3 the results of η m a x μ and ν for the same k h values are given for different number of nodes n in this case around 528 nodes 264 quadratic elements ensure enough convergence of the numerical results within three decimal places therefore 528 nodes are selected to discretize the bvp 5 validation to validate the analytical and numerical methods described here the numerical results for the limiting case of 10 were used in figs 3a and 3b in the case of b h 1 0 for h a h 0 125 0 5 and h a h 0 5 for b h 0 25 0 5 respectively the hydrodynamic efficiency results obtained by the present formulations were compared with the corresponding results of 10 for an owc device with a horizontal topography and normal wave propagation the black dots in figs 3 depict the results of 10 whereas the blue dashed line represents the results calculated by the eem and the black dashed line the results obtained by the bem it can be seen that in both figures the results are in good agreement 6 results and discussion in this section numerical results based on previously discussed eem and bem are presented the effects of the incidence wave angle the chamber configuration and the linearized air compressibility on the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency are commented in the case of the bem to minimize the effect of local disturbances at the far field boundary a distance of 4 times the water depth h between the front barrier and the far field boundary was considered in both formulations the water depth was 7 90 m as in 28 with a wave period t bounded by 2 50 t 30 s 6 1 effect of the angle of incidence the analytical and numerical results of the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency η m a x versus the non dimensional frequency k h for different angles of incidence θ 1 5 3 0 4 5 6 0 and 7 5 are shown in figs 4a c in these figures it is observed that the greater the angle of incidence θ the smaller the incoming wave period at which the owc resonates it is also observed that with an increase in θ the bandwidth of the efficiency curves is increased this aspect of the efficiency curves may be beneficial when selecting the location of an integrated owc breakwater system in practice an owc device with a range of frequency bandwidth coincident with the most predominant wave period and direction of a particular location can make better use of the available wave energy on the other hand it is observed that in general the analytical and numerical results are in good agreement especially for small frequencies and when a short wave angle of incidence is considered the variations of the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency versus the angle of incidence θ in the range of 0 θ 9 0 for different values of k h 0 625 1 25 and 2 50 are shown in figs 5a c it is observed that for small frequencies η m a x drops as θ tends to 90 while for large values of k h the curves first increase up to a peak and then drop furthermore as expected the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency becomes zero when θ 9 0 due to the null excitation of the inside water column by the parallel incident waves the analytical results of η m a x versus the non dimensional frequency k h and the angle of incidence θ are shown in figs 6a f in these figures the previous results from figs 4 and 5 are also shown with their corresponding curves and labels first in figs 6a b two zones with high values of the hydrodynamic efficiency are observed the first one with a boomerang shaped is due to large motions in the internal water column that occur when the fluid is excited by the incident wave into a resonant piston like motion evans and porter 1995 this red big zone of peak hydrodynamic efficiency may provide valuable information for the efficient harnessing of wave energy of owc devices since as previously mentioned an integrated owc breakwater system can be designed to coincide with the prevailing wave climate of a particular location and thus to optimize the use of the available wave energy resource on the other hand the second red zone located on the left corner for relatively small angles of incidence 0 θ 4 0 is due to the excitation into an antisymmetric sloshing mode on the internal free surface produced by the incident wave frequency in this situation the sloshing frequencies occur at values of the dimensionless wavenumber k b n π with n being the sloshing mode for this case it is observed that this peak in η m a x due to the first sloshing frequency occurs close to k h π then in figs 6c d for h a h 0 25 with b h 0 5 and figs 6e f for h a h 0 5 with b h 0 75 a single red zone of high maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is observed in comparison with the one observed in figs 6a b these two red areas are smaller this is because a higher front wall draft to water depth ratios h a h were considered and a smaller gap leads to a narrower range of frequency bandwidth as it reduces the energy transfer near the free surface due to wave motion 6 2 effect of the chamber configuration figs 7a c and e plot the results of η m a x versus the non dimensional frequency k h for various wall to front barrier spacing ratios b h 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 8 similar to the case when normal wave incidence is considered evans and porter 1995 in these plots it is observed that for a longer chamber relative to the water depth the frequency at which resonance occurs is smaller this is because with an increase in the owc chamber length the water particle motions inside the chamber during one period of motion also increase thus decreasing the value of the non dimensional frequency k h at which resonance occurs as previously reported by 10 and 36 large heaving motions inside the chamber occur when the internal water column is excited by the incident wave into a resonant piston type motion for normal incidence the natural frequency of these large oscillations can be reasonably estimated for small values of b h so the water contained inside the chamber can be regarded as a solid body by using a simple hydrostatic approach it results that the expected resonance occurs at k h h h a these resonances are supposed to occur at k h 8 k h 4 and k h 2 for figs 7a c and e respectively on the other hand figs 7b d and f show the results of η m a x versus the non dimensional frequency k h for different submergence ratios h a h 0 125 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 similar to the case when b h increases when the front wall draft to water depth ratio h a h increases it allows a larger fluid motion inside the chamber and the vertical distance a water fluid particle must travel during a period of oscillation increases therefore the frequency at which resonance occurs is smaller 6 3 influence of the trapped air inside the owc chamber the analytical and numerical results for the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency versus k h for different air column height to chamber length ratio h c b 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 are shown in fig 8a for the calculation of the trapped air volume v 0 the chamber width was kept fixed during the calculations and based on the physical dimensions of a single chamber of the mwep medina rodríguez et al 2020 a value of 1 5 times b was considered in fig 8a it is found that as h c b increases the overall hydrodynamic efficiency decreases in other words as air compressibility accounted for by the isentropic model is taken into account less energy from the waves is absorbed this can also be clearly inferred from eq 23 where it is seen that as the air volume inside the chamber increases the optimum damping induced to the airflow by the linear turbine also increases and hence η m a x decreases since air compressibility in the owc chamber is known to greatly affect the power output of full sized devices it must be addressed in all the preliminary stages of owc system design falcão and henriques 2019 the effect of air compressibility is known to increase with chamber height above the water free surface so it should not be neglected in full scale devices with chamber heights of several meters sarmento and falcão 1985 since significant errors in determining the device performance may result lópez et al 2020 however as explained by 39 it should be pointed out that due to viscous losses in the flow through the turbine air compression and expansion are more complicated and likely to deviate considerably from an isentropic process as considered in this work on the other hand in fig 8b the hydrodynamic efficiency versus k h for different values of the wave angle of incidence θ 1 5 3 0 4 5 6 0 and 7 5 with h c b 1 0 is shown as in fig 4a it is observed that the efficiency band increases when θ increases with a positive sloped trend for very high angles additionally under the influence of linear air compressibility numerical and analytical results in fig 8b show that the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency peak value decreases when less oblique water waves interact with the owc chamber finally fig 8c shows the analytical results for the variation of the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency as a function of the angle of incidence θ and the non dimensional frequency k h together with the curves from fig 8b for h c b 1 0 compared with fig 6a in fig 8c it is easier to observe the damping effect of the linearized air compressibility on the efficiency since the peaks on η m a x are significantly reduced when the phenomena of resonance due to the excitation of the owc and sloshing occur as mentioned before a theoretical value of η m a x 1 means that the owc device successfully captures all the incident wave energy however this is not achievable in practice since dissipative energy processes such as the generation of radiated waves by the oscillatory water motion inside the chamber the scattering of waves produced by the water waves owc device interaction viscous dampings among others occur ning et al 2015 in this sense investigations such as those carried out by 31 33 46 47 have satisfactorily accounted for the energy losses due to vortex shedding and flow separation which occurs near the front wall by introducing an artificial viscous damping term into the dynamic free surface boundary condition inside the owc chamber 7 conclusions the effects on the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency due to the wave angle of incidence and the chamber configuration of an owc device were analyzed the matched eem using dual series relations and the bem with three noded quadratic elements were employed to solve the associated bvp comparisons were performed between these two methods and an optimal agreement was achieved especially for relatively small angles of incidence apart from its simplicity the use of the least squares technique for solving the dual series relations demonstrates to be an efficient method for the calculation of the hydrodynamic efficiency of an owc device when a thin front wall is considered however the choice of evanescent modes in the eem must be done carefully as a small number of them may lead to truncation errors when large angles of incidence at high frequencies are considered furthermore the theoretical cases addressed by 10 for a thin front wall in the case of normal wave incidence were satisfactorily recovered by both analytical and numerical formulations analytical and numerical calculations for the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency were then obtained and analyzed for different physical configurations the results revealed that by increasing the wave angle of incidence the bandwidth of the efficiency curves and the wave frequency at which resonance occurs both increase this can be an important characteristic for the wave energy extraction since in a real scenario owc devices receive incoming waves at varying angle as expected it was observed that for water wave propagation parallel with respect to the owc chamber the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is zero due to the null excitation of the internal water column by the parallel incident waves furthermore it was observed a significant area of high hydrodynamic efficiency that provides the possibility of a more efficient wave energy extraction depending on the diverse incoming wave directions and frequencies of a particular site the effect of the air volume inside the chamber was analyzed by modifying the trapped air volume and it was found that the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is reduced when the air volume increases for oblique waves when the owc chamber length water depth ratio b h is decreased the wave period of maximum hydrodynamic efficiency is shorter a similar trend to that reported by 10 for normal wave incidence regarding the effect of the front wall draft the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency bandwidth significantly increases when the front wall draft to water depth ratio h a h decreases additionally special consideration should be given to the fact that a thin front barrier was considered in this work in practice thin front barriers cannot provide protection to owc systems since they are continuously subjected to high loads due to direct wave action especially during severe storm events and times of high water levels viviano et al 2016 pawitan et al 2019 viviano et al 2019 pawitan et al 2020 medina lopez et al 2015 this paper is only an analytical and numerical investigation on the owc hydrodynamic performance based on linear wave theory further theoretical investigations and experimental campaigns that include other geometrical aspects energy losses through viscous dissipation non linearities on the air compressibility and the turbine damping should be carried out in the future finally it is hoped that the results of this work may encourage the further study of the owc technology and provide valuable information for efficient wave energy harnessing credit authorship

estimate the energy period t e using a relation t e c t p when the frequency wave spectrum is not available this approach however introduces uncertainties in t e estimation for irregular waves in the present study a regression model for defining the coefficient c is developed to minimize the uncertainty in t e estimation using buoy wave measurements and wavewatch iii hindcast for coastal waters of

defined in the theoretical technical and practical resources department of energy doe 2015 the theoretical resource provides an estimate of the amount of energy present in the natural environment and this quantity is usually estimated by using numerical models the technical resource is estimated as the amount of the theoretical resource that can be technically captured by using a specified technology the practical resource is the portion of the technical resource further constrained by environmental social and economic filters national research council 2013 given significant developments in wave energy converters researches on wave energy resource assessments are being advanced based on different estimates of the theoretical technical and practical energy resources one of the essential challenges of wave energy assessments is to estimate accurately the theoretical wave power which can be computed using a frequency wave spectrum at a given sea state although wave spectrum data and wave parameters at a global scale e g hersbach et al 2020 are currently available these data are derived from a coarse spatial resolution 0 5 deg x 0 5 deg and cannot be used even for a reconnaissance level the highest level wave characterization and assessment iec 2015 which requires high resolution wave models with spatial resolutions less than 5 km note that feasibility and design level wave characterization and assessment require higher resolution wave models with spatial resolutions less than 500m and 50m respectively iec 2015 although national and regional scale wave models internally compute the wave spectrum only bulk or partitioned bulk wave parameters e g significant wave height peak period direction are generally provided at each grid location in order to reduce storage requirements us army corps of engineers 2008 the wave spectra for wave energy resource assessments and characterizations are not broadly available in many coastal regions over the world in the absence of the wave spectrum the wave power per unit crest width transmitted by irregular waves has been approximated using the significant wave height and energy period the bulk parameters computed from the wave models often consist of significant wave height and either peak period or mean period while the energy period is rarely specified and usually estimated from parametric spectrum models e g pierson moskowitz spectrum jonswap using the significant wave height and peak period when the wave spectrum is not available iec 2014 mathews 1972 in most previous research the energy period t e has been estimated using the following relation derived from the parametric spectrum models cornett 2008 gonçalves et al 2014 gunn and stock williams 2012 hagerman 2001 mestres and jebbad 2016 pastor and liu 2016 sierra et al 2014 yaakob et al 2016 as 1 t e c t p where c is a coefficient between t e and t p note that typical spectral functions describing the frequency spectrum of the ocean surface waves converge into a general form of a mathematical spectrum chakrabarti 1987 and result in the relation shown in eq 1 for example the energy period calculation from the pierson moskowitz spectrum and a standard jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 3 3 results in c 0 86 and c 0 90 respectively gunn and stock williams 2012 used the pierson moskowitz spectrum and assumed c 0 86 in quantifying global wave energy resources the wave energy assessment in southern new england hagerman 2001 and south china sea yaakob et al 2016 assumed c 1 0 numerous previous studies adopted a more conservative assumption of c 0 9 cornett 2008 gonçalves et al 2014 mestres and jebbad 2016 pastor and liu 2015 2016 sierra et al 2014 for united states us wave energy resource assessments the electric power research institute epri used a modified gamma spectrum with two variables relating to a spectral width parameter and spectral peakedness parameter jacobson et al 2011 pastor and liu 2016 some studies used c 0 86 for wind seas and c 1 0 for swell to consider different sea states in wave energy resource assessments ahn et al 2019 2020a 2020b ahn and neary 2020 neary et al 2018 however using a particular parametric spectrum model in t e estimation introduces uncertainties because ocean surface waves often consist of multiple frequency peaks that vary in time and space stansberg 2002 because irregular waves generally include local wind seas and swells which are distributed over various frequency bands the selection of a parametric spectrum model representing non stationary sea states is not so simple even if the most appropriate spectrum model to fit particular sea states is selected the energy period estimation using the parametirc spectrum models may be limited to the particular time and location based on the relation between the peak period and the energy period the present study proposes a methodology to estimate the coefficient c that minimize the uncertainty in the energy period estimations by introducing a regression model from wave measurements at 41 buoy stations and 30 year wavewatch iii wwiii ver 5 08 hindcast at 1 560 sites along the us coastal waters this region is selected as the case study region as it is surrounded by various wave climates e g the pacific ocean gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the present study defines mean coefficients between the energy period and peak period of the wind sea and swell as well as total sea for the us coastal waters in section 2 backgrounds of the energy period and parametric spectrum models are provided the methodology describing data sources and the regression model is presented in section 3 in section 4 the coefficients calculated from the model data are compared to those of buoy measurements and a period of record por dependency of the results is examined finally spatial trends in the wind sea swell and total sea coefficients are examined by investigating frequency distributions of dominant wave systems reaching different coastal regions 2 theoretical backgrounds the wave power j in kilowatts per unit wave crest length can be approximated in terms of the significant wave height h s and group velocity c g when the wave spectrum is not available by assuming that all of the variances is propagated at c g associated with the energy period t e iec 2015 as 2 j ρ g 16 h s 2 c g t e h 3 c g π k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 t e 4 ω 2 2 π t e 2 g k t a n h k h where g is the acceleration of gravity ρ is the sea water density 1 025 kg m3 k is the wave number h is the water depth and ω is the angular frequency in deep water the wave power can be asymptotically approximated as ρ g 2 h s 2 t e 64 π where the effect of finite depth is ignored in shallow water this approximation leads the significant error because shallow water c g is determined by depth t e is defined in terms of spectral moments which is computed using frequency variance density s f as 5 t e m 1 m 0 0 s f f 1 d f 0 s f d f where m 1 and m 0 are the spectral moments of negative first and zeroth orders the significant wave height derived from the wave spectrum is described as h s 4 m 0 a typical approach to estimate t e in the absence of s f is to assume s f using idealized parametric spectrum models 2 1 parametric spectrum models the parametric spectrum models for ocean surface waves can be expressed in terms of h s peak frequency f p and spectral shape factors the pierson moskowitz is one of the simplest spectra for fully developed local wind seas with unlimited fetch and duration pierson and moskowitz 1964 the pierson moskowitz spectrum in terms of h s and f p can be expressed as 6 s f 5 h s 2 16 f p 4 f 5 e 1 25 f p f 4 several spectral functions similar to the pierson moskowitz spectrum in terms of statistical frequency parameters e g bretschnierder bretachneider 1969 1959 issc international ship structures congress 1964 ittc mathews 1972 are not presented herein because the forms of these spectral functions are identical given f p and h s chakrabarti 1987 the jonswap spectrum takes into account the growth of waves over a limited fetch by modifying the pierson moskowitz spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 goda 1979 derived an alternative function for the jonswap spectrum in terms of f p and h s as 7 s f α h s 2 f p 4 f 5 e 1 25 f p f 4 γ f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 where γ is a peak enhancement factor σ is spectral shape parameter 0 07 for f f p and 0 09 for f f p and α is a constant depending on wind speed and fetch the parameter γ typically varies from 1 to 7 and the value of 3 3 produces an average spectrum for specified wind speed and fetch ochi 1978 note that the jonswap spectrum with α 5 16 and γ 1 is identical to the pierson moskowitz spectrum the gaussian spectrum is based on the normal probability density function and is defined as 8 s f h s 2 16 σ 2 π e f f p 2 2 σ 2 where σ is a standard deviation the gaussian spectrum is symmetric with

taking advantage of the model hindcast and buoy measurements the model driven coefficients at 1 560 sites that encompass the us coastal waters with a sufficient period of record are corrected by the

the frequency directional wave spectrum is divided into partitions representing energy from sub peaks within the spectrum hanson and jensen 2004 for the regression analysis 1 560 locations along the us coastal waters are selected where the wwiii complete wave spectra bulk parameters and spectral partitioned bulk parameters are available every 3 hourly hindcast data spanning thirty years from 1980 to 2009 are used the ndbc buoy records provide hourly frequency spectra and bulk wave parameters basic information on the buoys is summarized in table 1 detailed information on the buoy data can be found in the following reference national data buoy center 2009 the geographical distribution of data points used in the present study is shown in fig 1 ahn et al 2019 extensively validated the hindcast with wave measurements at 26 buoy sites using a methodology recommended by the international electrotechnical commission iec ts 62600 101 iec 2015 where the hindcast generally satisfied the iec minimum validation requirements the validation showed good agreements in the energy period with 3 systematic under bias on average which satisfied the iec standard requirement 10 maximum acceptable systematic error the geographical distribution of the 30 year averaged energy period along the us coastal waters is described in appendix a 3 2 regression model the wwiii frequency spectra and partitioned bulk parameters are used to estimate the coefficients for wind sea and swell separately as an irregular wave field is described using the wave spectrum and spectral partitioning divides their energy into distinct subsets that represent individual wave systems a general linear model is set up based on the partitioned bulk parameters as 9 y c w i n d x w i n d c s w e l l x s w e l l e where y is a dependent variable x w i n d and x s w e l l are independent variables and e is a residual t e at the 1 560 regression sites spanning thirty years are calculated from the frequency spectra using eq 5 and constructed as the dependent variable y the definition of t e described in eq 1 allows eq 9 to be rewritten as 10 0 s f f 1 d f 0 s f d f c w i n d n w i n d m 0 n t p n c s w e l l n s w e l l m 0 n t p n m 0 n e where n is a partition index m 0 n is the zeroth order partitioned spectral moment calculated as h m 0 n 2 16 and t p n is the partition peak period wind seas are identified using a wave age criterion such that partition peaks fall within a bounded region all remaining partitions are considered as swells hanson and jensen 2004 the regression model has extremely narrow confidence intervals because the model has 87 664 elements which correspond to every 3 hourly data spanning thirty years scatter plots of m 0 and m 1 for two buoy stations west and east coast with a t e line visualizing the degree of the confidence shown in appendix b although many statistical inference procedures for linear regression often require an intercept to be included the definition of t e allows the intercept to be excluded and is referred to as regression through the origin rto eisenhauer 2003 to estimate the total sea coefficient c non partitioned wave bulk parameters of the wwiii hindcast and ndbc buoy measurements are used and eq 10 is modified as 11 0 s f f 1 d f 0 s f d f c t p e where t p is the peak period of the total sea 3 3 linear correction of modeled coefficients because the model hindcasts often have a systemic bias the model driven coefficients need to be corrected by the measurement driven coefficients to improve agreements with real values a simple linear correction for wave climates proposed by stephens and gorman 2006 is applied and the model driven coefficients are scaled by a correction scaling constant average relative bias s among the buoy stations as 12 s 1 n i 1 n w w i i i c i b u o y c i w w i i i c i where i is a site index c i is the total sea coefficient estimated using eq 11 and n is the number of buoy stations the correction scaling constants s for five different coastal waters alaska west hawaii gulf of mexico and east are separately calculated and the coefficients c w i n d c s w e l l and c estimated from the wwiii hindcast data are scaled by s to provide accurate coefficient values that encompass the us coastal waters 4 results and discussions the linear regressions described in section 3 2 are performed at 1 560 wwiii sites to define the coefficients between the peak period and energy period for wind sea c w i n d swell c s w e l l and total sea c in addition c is also estimated using the buoy measurements from 41 ndbc stations to compare and correct the model driven coefficients to demonstrate the validity of these coefficients t e is estimated using the corrected wwiii c and coefficients typically used in previous studies 0 86 pierson moskowitz and 0 9 jonswap and compared to t e calculated from the buoy s frequency spectra finally the geographic distributions and spatial trends of the corrected c w i n d c s w e l l and c are examined by investigating frequency distributions of dominant wave systems reaching different coastal waters 4 1 linear correction of modeled coefficients the total sea coefficient c estimated from eq 11 using both buoy measurements and wwiii hindcasts are listed in table 1 uncorrected and corrected c estimated from wwiii hindcast with the limited periods of buoy record are given for each station with relative bias in parentheses to investigate a dependency of the period of record por to the full 30 year record c estimated from different pors are also shown in table 1 with the exception of c at a few west coast buoys the wwiii coefficients are generally lower than those estimated from the buoy measurements the regional averaged absolute bias b is relatively small for the west coast 1 9 and hawaiian coast 2 7 moderate for the alaska coast 3 6 and gulf of mexico coast 3 6 and large for the east coast 5 2 this systematic under bias can be compensated by applying regional linear correction scaling constants s eq 12 to improve the accuracy of the modeled coefficients the regional scaling constants ranging from 1 01 to 1 05 are applied to correct modeled coefficients c w i n d c s w e l l and c for the 1 560 wwiii sites the agreement between the corrected wwiii c and measurement driven c is significantly improved with the regional averaged absolute bias reduced to less than 1 the spatial and regional trends of the coefficients are described in section 4 2 the modeled c with different pors 5 10 20 30 year show consistent values at each of the stations which means that the uncertainty from the por dependency of the results is negligible and the relation between the peak period and energy period along the us coastal waters can be considered stationary these stationary relations support the validity of the approach and results derived from the present study note that the water depth dependency of the results is not observed the spatial trends in the coefficient shown in table 1 are mainly caused by frequency distributions of regional dominant wave systems to validate t e estimation method developed in the present study its agreements with t e calculated from the actual buoy frequency spectrum are compared to those of the previous parametric spectrum models in fig 2 the nrmses of t e estimations from the pierson moskowitz spectrum t e 0 86 t p the circles in fig 2 are generally small compared to those for the jonswap spectrum γ 3 3 t e 0 9 t p the squares in fig 2 because the total sea often consists of multiple wave systems this result does not indicate that the pierson moskowitz spectrum fits the sea state better than the jonswap spectrum as expected from table 1 where the corrected wwiii c are well below 0 86 pierson moskowitz except for the gulf of mexico coast the nrmses of the new approach y axis are significantly reduced from those of the previous approach t e 0 86 t p the nrmses are reduced by approximately 10 at the alaska coast 8 at the west coast 12 at the hawaiian coast 2 at the gulf of mexico coast and 4 at the east coast fig 2 a comparing the results from wwiii c without the correction and parametric spectrum models support that this improvement mainly comes from the regression approach 4 2 coefficients for wind sea and swell the geographical distribution of the corrected wwiii coefficients between the peak period and energy period for wind sea c w i n d and swell c s w e l l at 1 560 sites are shown in figs 3 and 4 overall the coefficients of the wind sea fig 3 are generally smaller than those of the swell fig 4 because the coefficient tends to increase towards unity with narrowing spectral width the spectral property of the swell system has a relatively peaky and narrow shape compared to that of the wind sea semedo et al 2011 investigated energy density of global wind sea and swell using the 45 year european centre for medium range weather forecasts re analysis era 40 and showed the energy portion of the swell part over the frequency spectrum is generally higher than the wind sea part for the us coastal waters the coefficients of the wind sea range from 0 84 to 0 9 which are generally higher than the pierson moskowitz spectrum 0 86 and lower than jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 3 3 0 9 the swell coefficients range from 0 92 to 0 98 which are lower than the gaussian spectrum 1 0 the spatial trends in the wind sea coefficients shown in fig 3 are controlled by local wind speeds and fetch length local wind speeds at the northern coast of the bering sea and northern atlantic coast are relatively strong compared to the other coasts craig m risien 2011 risien and chelton 2008 leading to the peaky and narrow wind sea spectrum fréchot 2008 and large wind sea coefficients for these regions 0 87 c w i n d 0 90 the spatial trends in the wind speeds near the us east coast derive a spatial variation of the wind sea coefficients where the coefficients tend to decrease with decreasing latitude and wind speeds the pacific ocean coasts us west coast and hawaiian coast have small wind sea coefficients 0 84 c w i n d 0 86 compared to the atlantic ocean coast 0 88 c w i n d 0 90 although the local winds near the aleutian trench and the gulf of alaska are strong they tend to blow from lands where the wind sea is hardly developed resulting in moderate wind sea coefficients for these regions 0 86 c w i n d 0 88 because wind sea in the offshore coast at the eastern gulf of mexico and the florida shelf propagates against the strong loop current ahn 2019 it has a relatively narrow and peaky frequency spectrum guedes soares and de pablo 2006 rusu and guedes soares 2011 and large wind sea coefficients 0 88 c w i n d 0 90 compared to other regions in the gulf of mexico coast the spatial trends in the swell coefficients shown in fig 4 are controlled by frequency distributions of regional dominant swell systems for the alaska coastal waters the bering sea has relatively small swell coefficients 0 94 c s w e l l 0 96 compared to the pacific ocean coastal waters 0 96 c s w e l l 0 98 while the swell near the pacific ocean side coasts is mainly dominated by 11 13 s westerly swell the swell near the bering sea consists of 8 10 s polar easterly swell as well as the westerly swell ahn 2019 where the shorter period band contains significant energy for this region leading to relatively small coefficients although waters at the us west coast are also dominated by the westerly swell short period swells 8 10 s generated by the north pacific high pressure system and aleutian low pressure system shift a center of the energy to the shorter period band ahn and neary 2021 risien and chelton 2008 yang et al 2020 resulting in the small coefficients 0 92 c s w e l l 0 94 for this region the southern california and hawaiian coast show relatively large coefficients 0 94 c s w e l l 0 96 because swell generated by south pacific storms 14 16 s from australia and new zealand vitousek and fletcher 2008 reaches these regions and weights the energy to the longer period band in the gulf of mexico coast c s w e l l generally ranges from 0 94 to 0 96 where the central coast has relatively large coefficients 0 96 c s w e l l 0 98 because this region is exposed to long period storm swells 12 14 s generated at the atlantic basin ahn 2019 resulting in a narrow and peaky swell spectrum for this region the swell for the us east coast consists of nor easter swell 9 11 s trade wind swell 8 10 s in southern coasts and bermuda high pressure swell 8 10 s in northern coast where the peak period is generally found in the shorter period swell leading to the relatively large 0 96 c s w e l l 0 98 for this region compared to the other coastal waters 4 3 coefficients for total sea the geographical distribution of the corrected wwiii coefficients between the peak period and energy period for the total sea c is shown in fig 5 while the coefficients for the wind sea and swell are generally determined by the spectral shape of each wave system the coefficients of the total sea are controlled by the peak period spreads of different wave systems sea states consisting of wave systems having a similar peak period or sea states predominated by a particular dominant wave system would have a relatively large coefficient compared to sea states consisting of multiple frequency peaks with similar energy contributions the total sea coefficients range from 0 79 to 0 85 for the us coastal waters because waves at the arctic alaska and gulf of mexico coasts generally consist of the unimodal wind wave the total sea coefficients are relatively large 0 83 c 0 85 for these regions compared to the other coastal waters for the alaska coast below the artic area the total sea coefficients tend to increase with decreasing latitude ranging from 0 79 to 0 85 where waters exposed more to the pacific ocean are predominated by the strong westerly swell and have the large coefficients as the westerly swell propagates towards the shoreline at the us west coast the swell period decreases and the peak period spread between the westerly swell and wind waves narrows resulting in the relatively large coefficients 0 81 c 0 83 for the nearshore coast compared to the offshore coast for this region 0 79 c 0 81 three wave systems dominate waters near the hawaiian coast trade wind swell 8 10 s north pacific swell 13 15 s and southern swell 14 16 s ahn 2019 because the short period trade wind swell frequently contains the largest energy among these wave systems for waters along the northern side the total sea coefficients are relatively large for this region 0 81 c 0 83 compared to the waters along the southern side where the long period southern swell contains the largest energy 0 79 c 0 81 ahn 2019 unlike the west coast the offshore waters at the east coast show relatively large coefficients 0 83 c 0 85 compared to the nearshore waters 0 79 c 0 81 because the offshore waters are more exposed to the nor easter swell that propagates in alongshore direction leading to a relatively peaky frequency spectrum 5 conclusions in the present study a regression model was developed to define mean relations between the peak period and energy period of the ocean surface waves t e c t p using the buoy measurements and 30 year wwiii hindcast for us coastal waters the coefficients between the peak period and energy period for wind sea swell and total sea were defined the spatial trends in the coefficients were described by investigating the frequency distributions of the dominant wave systems reaching different coastal regions as a summary of this study regional averaged coefficients of the different sea states were recommended for the energy period estimation for the us coastal waters in table 2 the wind sea coefficients range from 0 84 to 0 9 where the waters at the west coast and hawaiian coast have relatively small values with c w i n d 0 85 compared to c w i n d 0 87 0 88 for the other coastal waters the swell coefficients range from 0 92 to 0 98 where the waters at the alaska coast and east coast have relatively large values with c s w e l l 0 96 0 97 compared to c s w e l l 0 93 0 95 for the other coastal waters the total sea coefficients range from 0 79 to 0 85 where the waters at the gulf of mexico have relatively large values with c 0 85 compared to c 0 81 0 82 for the other coastal waters using the coefficients defined in this study for estimating the energy period rather than just using a coefficient derived from existing parametric spectrum models can reduce the uncertainty in the energy period estimation and the wave assessments when the frequency spectrum is not available this improvement is significant because wave spectra from high resolution wave models required for wave energy resource assessments and characterizations are not broadly available in many coastal regions over the world this improvement also augments studies of wave energy converter technologies and designs which need to resonate at the energy period of incident waves although the results represent the mean relations over the 30 year period the results show stationary trends where the coefficients are consistent with different periods of record e g 5 10 and 20 year similar investigations by using these techniques can be conducted for other coastal regions however the wave hindcast used in this study is generated entirely from deep and intermediate wave conditions with relatively coarse spatial resolution future investigations will extend this work with higher resolution model hindcasts for

present study a regression model for defining the coefficient c is developed to minimize the uncertainty in t e estimation using buoy wave measurements and wavewatch iii hindcast for coastal waters of

defined in the theoretical technical and practical resources department of energy doe 2015 the theoretical resource provides an estimate of the amount of energy present in the natural environment and this quantity is usually estimated by using numerical models the technical resource is estimated as the amount of the theoretical resource that can be technically captured by using a specified technology the practical resource is the portion of the technical resource further constrained by environmental social and economic filters national research council 2013 given significant developments in wave energy converters researches on wave energy resource assessments are being advanced based on different estimates of the theoretical technical and practical energy resources one of the essential challenges of wave energy assessments is to estimate accurately the theoretical wave power which can be computed using a frequency wave spectrum at a given sea state although wave spectrum data and wave parameters at a global scale e g hersbach et al 2020 are currently available these data are derived from a coarse spatial resolution 0 5 deg x 0 5 deg and cannot be used even for a reconnaissance level the highest level wave characterization and assessment iec 2015 which requires high resolution wave models with spatial resolutions less than 5 km note that feasibility and design level wave characterization and assessment require higher resolution wave models with spatial resolutions less than 500m and 50m respectively iec 2015 although national and regional scale wave models internally compute the wave spectrum only bulk or partitioned bulk wave parameters e g significant wave height peak period direction are generally provided at each grid location in order to reduce storage requirements us army corps of engineers 2008 the wave spectra for wave energy resource assessments and characterizations are not broadly available in many coastal regions over the world in the absence of the wave spectrum the wave power per unit crest width transmitted by irregular waves has been approximated using the significant wave height and energy period the bulk parameters computed from the wave models often consist of significant wave height and either peak period or mean period while the energy period is rarely specified and usually estimated from parametric spectrum models e g pierson moskowitz spectrum jonswap using the significant wave height and peak period when the wave spectrum is not available iec 2014 mathews 1972 in most previous research the energy period t e has been estimated using the following relation derived from the parametric spectrum models cornett 2008 gonçalves et al 2014 gunn and stock williams 2012 hagerman 2001 mestres and jebbad 2016 pastor and liu 2016 sierra et al 2014 yaakob et al 2016 as 1 t e c t p where c is a coefficient between t e and t p note that typical spectral functions describing the frequency spectrum of the ocean surface waves converge into a general form of a mathematical spectrum chakrabarti 1987 and result in the relation shown in eq 1 for example the energy period calculation from the pierson moskowitz spectrum and a standard jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 3 3 results in c 0 86 and c 0 90 respectively gunn and stock williams 2012 used the pierson moskowitz spectrum and assumed c 0 86 in quantifying global wave energy resources the wave energy assessment in southern new england hagerman 2001 and south china sea yaakob et al 2016 assumed c 1 0 numerous previous studies adopted a more conservative assumption of c 0 9 cornett 2008 gonçalves et al 2014 mestres and jebbad 2016 pastor and liu 2015 2016 sierra et al 2014 for united states us wave energy resource assessments the electric power research institute epri used a modified gamma spectrum with two variables relating to a spectral width parameter and spectral peakedness parameter jacobson et al 2011 pastor and liu 2016 some studies used c 0 86 for wind seas and c 1 0 for swell to consider different sea states in wave energy resource assessments ahn et al 2019 2020a 2020b ahn and neary 2020 neary et al 2018 however using a particular parametric spectrum model in t e estimation introduces uncertainties because ocean surface waves often consist of multiple frequency peaks that vary in time and space stansberg 2002 because irregular waves generally include local wind seas and swells which are distributed over various frequency bands the selection of a parametric spectrum model representing non stationary sea states is not so simple even if the most appropriate spectrum model to fit particular sea states is selected the energy period estimation using the parametirc spectrum models may be limited to the particular time and location based on the relation between the peak period and the energy period the present study proposes a methodology to estimate the coefficient c that minimize the uncertainty in the energy period estimations by introducing a regression model from wave measurements at 41 buoy stations and 30 year wavewatch iii wwiii ver 5 08 hindcast at 1 560 sites along the us coastal waters this region is selected as the case study region as it is surrounded by various wave climates e g the pacific ocean gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the present study defines mean coefficients between the energy period and peak period of the wind sea and swell as well as total sea for the us coastal waters in section 2 backgrounds of the energy period and parametric spectrum models are provided the methodology describing data sources and the regression model is presented in section 3 in section 4 the coefficients calculated from the model data are compared to those of buoy measurements and a period of record por dependency of the results is examined finally spatial trends in the wind sea swell and total sea coefficients are examined by investigating frequency distributions of dominant wave systems reaching different coastal regions 2 theoretical backgrounds the wave power j in kilowatts per unit wave crest length can be approximated in terms of the significant wave height h s and group velocity c g when the wave spectrum is not available by assuming that all of the variances is propagated at c g associated with the energy period t e iec 2015 as 2 j ρ g 16 h s 2 c g t e h 3 c g π k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 t e 4 ω 2 2 π t e 2 g k t a n h k h where g is the acceleration of gravity ρ is the sea water density 1 025 kg m3 k is the wave number h is the water depth and ω is the angular frequency in deep water the wave power can be asymptotically approximated as ρ g 2 h s 2 t e 64 π where the effect of finite depth is ignored in shallow water this approximation leads the significant error because shallow water c g is determined by depth t e is defined in terms of spectral moments which is computed using frequency variance density s f as 5 t e m 1 m 0 0 s f f 1 d f 0 s f d f where m 1 and m 0 are the spectral moments of negative first and zeroth orders the significant wave height derived from the wave spectrum is described as h s 4 m 0 a typical approach to estimate t e in the absence of s f is to assume s f using idealized parametric spectrum models 2 1 parametric spectrum models the parametric spectrum models for ocean surface waves can be expressed in terms of h s peak frequency f p and spectral shape factors the pierson moskowitz is one of the simplest spectra for fully developed local wind seas with unlimited fetch and duration pierson and moskowitz 1964 the pierson moskowitz spectrum in terms of h s and f p can be expressed as 6 s f 5 h s 2 16 f p 4 f 5 e 1 25 f p f 4 several spectral functions similar to the pierson moskowitz spectrum in terms of statistical frequency parameters e g bretschnierder bretachneider 1969 1959 issc international ship structures congress 1964 ittc mathews 1972 are not presented herein because the forms of these spectral functions are identical given f p and h s chakrabarti 1987 the jonswap spectrum takes into account the growth of waves over a limited fetch by modifying the pierson moskowitz spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 goda 1979 derived an alternative function for the jonswap spectrum in terms of f p and h s as 7 s f α h s 2 f p 4 f 5 e 1 25 f p f 4 γ f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 where γ is a peak enhancement factor σ is spectral shape parameter 0 07 for f f p and 0 09 for f f p and α is a constant depending on wind speed and fetch the parameter γ typically varies from 1 to 7 and the value of 3 3 produces an average spectrum for specified wind speed and fetch ochi 1978 note that the jonswap spectrum with α 5 16 and γ 1 is identical to the pierson moskowitz spectrum the gaussian spectrum is based on the normal probability density function and is defined as 8 s f h s 2 16 σ 2 π e f f p 2 2 σ 2 where σ is a standard deviation the gaussian spectrum is symmetric with similar tails on both sides and thus often applied to represent a swell spectrum holthuijsen 2007 lucas and soares 2015 inserting the parametric spectra e g pierson moskowitz spectrum a standard jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 3 3 and gaussian swell spectrum with a limited spectral width into t e definition eq 5 results in c 0 86 c 0 9 and c 1 0 respectively 3 data source

the frequency directional wave spectrum is divided into partitions representing energy from sub peaks within the spectrum hanson and jensen 2004 for the regression analysis 1 560 locations along the us coastal waters are selected where the wwiii complete wave spectra bulk parameters and spectral partitioned bulk parameters are available every 3 hourly hindcast data spanning thirty years from 1980 to 2009 are used the ndbc buoy records provide hourly frequency spectra and bulk wave parameters basic information on the buoys is summarized in table 1 detailed information on the buoy data can be found in the following reference national data buoy center 2009 the geographical distribution of data points used in the present study is shown in fig 1 ahn et al 2019 extensively validated the hindcast with wave measurements at 26 buoy sites using a methodology recommended by the international electrotechnical commission iec ts 62600 101 iec 2015 where the hindcast generally satisfied the iec minimum validation requirements the validation showed good agreements in the energy period with 3 systematic under bias on average which satisfied the iec standard requirement 10 maximum acceptable systematic error the geographical distribution of the 30 year averaged energy period along the us coastal waters is described in appendix a 3 2 regression model the wwiii frequency spectra and partitioned bulk parameters are used to estimate the coefficients for wind sea and swell separately as an irregular wave field is described using the wave spectrum and spectral partitioning divides their energy into distinct subsets that represent individual wave systems a general linear model is set up based on the partitioned bulk parameters as 9 y c w i n d x w i n d c s w e l l x s w e l l e where y is a dependent variable x w i n d and x s w e l l are independent variables and e is a residual t e at the 1 560 regression sites spanning thirty years are calculated from the frequency spectra using eq 5 and constructed as the dependent variable y the definition of t e described in eq 1 allows eq 9 to be rewritten as 10 0 s f f 1 d f 0 s f d f c w i n d n w i n d m 0 n t p

seas are identified using a wave age criterion such that partition peaks fall within a bounded region all remaining partitions are considered as swells hanson and jensen 2004 the regression model has extremely narrow confidence intervals because the model has 87 664 elements which correspond to every 3 hourly data spanning thirty years scatter plots of m 0 and m 1 for two buoy stations west and east coast with a t e line visualizing the degree of the confidence shown in appendix b although many statistical inference procedures for linear regression often require an intercept to be included the definition of t e allows the intercept to be excluded and is referred to as regression through the origin rto eisenhauer 2003 to estimate the total sea coefficient c non partitioned wave bulk parameters of the wwiii hindcast and ndbc buoy measurements are used and eq 10 is modified as 11 0 s f f 1 d f 0 s f d f c t p e where t p is the peak period of the total sea 3 3 linear correction of modeled coefficients because the model hindcasts often have a systemic bias the model driven coefficients need to be corrected by the measurement driven coefficients to improve agreements with real values a simple linear correction for wave climates proposed by stephens and gorman 2006 is applied and the model driven coefficients are scaled by a correction scaling constant average relative bias s among the buoy stations as 12 s 1 n i 1 n w w i i i c i b u o y c i w w i i i c i where i is a site index c i is the total sea coefficient estimated using eq 11 and n is the number of buoy stations the correction scaling constants s for five different coastal waters alaska west hawaii gulf of mexico and east are separately calculated and the coefficients c w i n d c s w e l l and c estimated from the wwiii hindcast data are scaled by s to provide accurate coefficient values that encompass the us coastal waters 4 results and discussions the linear regressions described in section 3 2 are performed at 1 560 wwiii sites to define the coefficients between the peak period and energy period for wind sea c w i n d swell c s w e l l and total sea c in addition c is also estimated using the buoy measurements from 41 ndbc stations to compare and correct the model driven coefficients to demonstrate the validity of these coefficients t e is estimated using the corrected wwiii c and coefficients typically used in previous studies 0 86 pierson moskowitz and 0 9 jonswap and compared to t e calculated from the buoy s frequency spectra finally the geographic distributions and spatial trends of the corrected c w i n d c s w e l l and c are examined by investigating frequency distributions of dominant wave systems reaching different coastal waters 4 1 linear correction of modeled coefficients the total sea coefficient c estimated from eq 11 using both buoy measurements and wwiii hindcasts are listed in table 1 uncorrected and corrected c estimated from wwiii hindcast with the limited periods of buoy record are given for each station with relative bias in parentheses to investigate a dependency of the period of record por to the full 30 year record c estimated from different pors are also shown in table 1 with the exception of c at a few west coast buoys the wwiii coefficients are generally lower than those estimated from the buoy measurements the regional averaged absolute bias b is relatively small for the west coast 1 9 and hawaiian coast 2 7 moderate for the alaska coast 3 6 and gulf of mexico coast 3 6 and large for the east coast 5 2 this systematic under bias can be compensated by applying regional linear correction scaling constants s eq 12 to improve the accuracy of the modeled coefficients the regional scaling constants ranging from 1 01 to 1 05 are applied to correct modeled coefficients c w i n d c s w e l l and c for the 1 560 wwiii sites the agreement between the corrected wwiii c and measurement driven c is significantly improved with the regional averaged absolute bias reduced to less than 1 the spatial and regional trends of the coefficients are described in section 4 2 the modeled c with different pors 5 10 20 30 year show consistent values at each of the stations which means that the uncertainty from the por dependency of the results is negligible and the relation between the peak period and energy period along the us coastal waters can be considered stationary these stationary relations support the validity of the approach and results derived from the present study note that the water depth dependency of the results is not observed the spatial trends in the coefficient shown in table 1 are mainly caused by frequency distributions of regional dominant wave systems to validate t e estimation method developed in the present study its agreements with t e calculated from the actual buoy frequency spectrum are compared to those of the previous parametric spectrum models in fig 2 the nrmses of t e estimations from the pierson moskowitz spectrum t e 0 86 t p the circles in fig 2 are generally small compared to those for the jonswap spectrum γ 3 3 t e 0 9 t p the squares in fig 2 because the total sea often consists of multiple wave systems this result does not indicate that the pierson moskowitz spectrum fits the sea state better than the jonswap spectrum as expected from table 1 where the corrected wwiii c are well below 0 86 pierson moskowitz except for the gulf of mexico coast the nrmses of the new approach y axis are significantly reduced from those of the previous approach t e 0 86 t p the nrmses are reduced by approximately 10 at the alaska coast 8 at the west coast 12 at the hawaiian coast 2 at the gulf of mexico coast and 4 at the east coast fig 2 a comparing the results from wwiii c without the correction and parametric spectrum models support that this improvement mainly comes from the regression approach 4 2 coefficients for wind sea and swell the geographical distribution of the corrected wwiii coefficients between the peak period and energy period for wind sea c w i n d and swell c s w e l l at 1 560 sites are shown in figs 3 and 4 overall the coefficients of the wind sea fig 3 are generally smaller than those of the swell fig 4 because the coefficient tends to increase towards unity with narrowing spectral width the spectral property of the swell system has a relatively peaky and narrow shape compared to that of the wind sea semedo et al 2011 investigated energy density of global wind sea and swell using the 45 year european centre for medium range weather forecasts re analysis era 40 and showed the energy portion of the swell part over the frequency spectrum is generally higher than the wind sea part for the us coastal waters the coefficients of the wind sea range from 0 84 to 0 9 which are generally higher than the pierson moskowitz spectrum 0 86 and lower than jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor of 3 3 0 9 the swell coefficients range from 0 92 to 0 98 which are lower than the gaussian spectrum 1 0 the spatial trends in the wind sea coefficients shown in fig 3 are controlled by local wind speeds and fetch length local wind speeds at the northern coast of the bering sea and northern atlantic coast are relatively strong compared to the other coasts craig m risien 2011 risien and chelton 2008 leading to the peaky and narrow wind sea spectrum fréchot 2008 and large wind sea coefficients for these regions 0 87 c w i n d 0 90 the spatial trends in the wind speeds near the us east coast derive a spatial variation of the wind sea coefficients where the coefficients tend to decrease with decreasing latitude and wind speeds the pacific ocean coasts us west coast and hawaiian coast have small wind sea coefficients 0 84 c w i n d 0 86 compared to the atlantic ocean coast 0 88 c w i n d 0 90 although the local winds near the aleutian trench and the gulf of alaska are strong they tend to blow from lands where the wind sea is hardly developed resulting in moderate wind sea coefficients for these regions 0 86 c w i n d 0 88 because wind sea in the offshore coast at the eastern gulf of mexico and the florida shelf propagates against the strong loop current ahn 2019 it has a relatively narrow and peaky frequency spectrum guedes soares and de pablo 2006 rusu and guedes soares 2011 and large wind sea coefficients 0 88 c w i n d 0 90 compared to other regions in the gulf of mexico coast the spatial trends in the swell coefficients shown in fig 4 are controlled by frequency distributions of regional dominant swell systems for the alaska coastal waters the bering sea has relatively small swell coefficients 0 94 c s w e l l 0 96 compared to the pacific ocean coastal waters 0 96 c s w e l l 0 98 while the swell near the pacific ocean side coasts is mainly dominated by 11 13 s westerly swell the swell near the bering sea consists of 8 10 s polar easterly swell as well as the westerly swell ahn 2019 where the shorter period band contains significant energy for this region leading to relatively small coefficients although waters at the us west coast are also dominated by the westerly swell short period swells 8 10 s generated by the north pacific high pressure system and aleutian low pressure system shift a center of the energy to the shorter period band ahn and neary 2021 risien and chelton 2008 yang et al 2020 resulting in the small coefficients 0 92 c s w e l l 0 94 for this region the southern california and hawaiian coast show relatively large coefficients 0 94 c s w e l l 0 96 because swell generated by south pacific storms 14 16 s from australia and new zealand vitousek and fletcher 2008 reaches these regions and weights the energy to the longer period band in the gulf of mexico coast c s w e l l generally ranges from 0 94 to 0 96 where the central coast has relatively large coefficients 0 96 c s w e l l 0 98 because this region is exposed to long period storm swells 12 14 s generated at the atlantic basin ahn 2019 resulting in a narrow and peaky swell spectrum for this region the swell for the us east coast consists of nor easter swell 9 11 s trade wind swell 8 10 s in southern coasts and bermuda high pressure swell 8 10 s in northern coast where the peak period is generally found in the shorter period swell leading to the relatively large 0 96 c s w e l l 0 98 for this region compared to the other coastal waters 4 3 coefficients for total sea the geographical distribution of the corrected wwiii coefficients between the peak period and energy period for the total sea c is shown in fig 5 while the coefficients for the wind sea and swell are generally determined by the spectral shape of each wave system the coefficients of the total sea are controlled by the peak period spreads of different wave systems sea states consisting of wave systems having a similar peak period or sea states predominated by a particular dominant wave system would have a relatively large coefficient compared to sea states consisting of multiple frequency peaks with similar energy contributions the total sea coefficients range from 0 79 to 0 85 for the us coastal waters because waves at the arctic alaska and gulf of mexico coasts generally consist of the unimodal wind wave the total sea coefficients are relatively large 0 83 c 0 85 for these regions compared to the other coastal waters for the alaska coast below the artic area the total sea coefficients tend to increase with decreasing latitude ranging from 0 79 to 0 85 where waters exposed more to the pacific ocean are predominated by the strong westerly swell and have the large coefficients as the westerly swell propagates towards the shoreline at the us west coast the swell period decreases and the peak period spread between the westerly swell and wind waves narrows resulting in the relatively large coefficients 0 81 c 0 83 for the nearshore coast compared to the offshore coast for this region 0 79 c 0 81 three wave systems dominate waters near the hawaiian coast trade wind swell 8 10 s north pacific swell 13 15 s and southern swell 14 16 s ahn 2019 because the short period trade wind swell frequently contains the largest energy among these wave systems for waters along the northern side the total sea coefficients are relatively large for this region 0 81 c 0 83 compared to the waters along the southern side where the long period southern swell contains the largest energy 0 79 c 0 81 ahn 2019 unlike the west coast the offshore waters at the east coast show relatively large coefficients 0 83 c 0 85 compared to the nearshore waters 0 79 c 0 81 because the offshore waters are more exposed to the nor easter swell that propagates in alongshore direction leading to a relatively peaky frequency spectrum 5 conclusions in the present study a regression model was developed to define mean relations between the peak period and energy period of the ocean surface waves t e c t p using the buoy measurements and 30 year wwiii hindcast for us coastal waters the coefficients between the peak period and energy period for wind sea swell and total sea were defined the spatial trends in the coefficients were described by investigating the frequency distributions of the dominant wave systems reaching different coastal regions as a summary of this study regional averaged coefficients of the different sea states were recommended for the energy period estimation for the us coastal waters in table 2 the wind sea coefficients range from 0 84 to 0 9 where the waters at the west coast and hawaiian coast have relatively small values with c w i n d 0 85 compared to c w i n d 0 87 0 88 for the other coastal waters the swell coefficients range from 0 92 to 0 98 where the waters at the alaska coast and east coast have relatively large values with c s w e l l 0 96 0 97 compared to c s w e l l 0 93 0 95 for the other coastal waters the total sea coefficients range from 0 79 to 0 85 where the waters at the gulf of mexico have relatively large values with c 0 85 compared to c 0 81 0 82 for the other coastal waters using the coefficients defined in this study for estimating the energy period rather than just using a coefficient derived from existing parametric spectrum models can reduce the uncertainty in the energy period estimation and the wave assessments when the frequency spectrum is not available this improvement is significant because wave spectra from high resolution wave models required for wave energy resource assessments and characterizations are not broadly available in many coastal regions over the world this improvement also augments studies of wave energy converter technologies and designs which need to resonate at the energy period of incident waves although the results represent the mean relations over the 30 year period the results show stationary trends where the coefficients are consistent with different periods of record e g 5 10 and 20 year similar investigations by using these techniques can be conducted for other coastal regions however the wave hindcast used in this study is generated entirely from deep and intermediate wave conditions with relatively coarse spatial resolution future investigations will extend this work with higher resolution model hindcasts for

20848,the sea of marmara is a typical example of enclosed seas and an inland sea bounded by land masses in four directions and it links the black sea and the mediterranean via the bosphorus and the dardanelles straits moreover the sea of marmara has strategic importance with possessing marine structures such as various types of terminals cruise terminals and marinas and also providing a strong economic contribution with tourism revenue this situation brings the necessity of determining the design wind and wave parameters properly the wind and wave characteristics and their variabilities were evaluated covering the last 40 years 1979 2018 by using two well known wind fields i e ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr wave parameters were generated from the calibrated and validated swan model with era interim wind data the spatial and temporal variability of the long term averages and long term trends of the wind and wave characteristics were investigated and also extreme wave conditions were evaluated in detail this study shows that the modeling of waves in enclosed seas is more challenging compared to open seas due to several affecting factors such as land which affect the wave fields and need high spatial resolution the results indicate that orography and islands largely affect the wind and wave climate in the sea of marmara the northern side of the sea of marmara is characterized by stronger wind and wave climate compared to the southern side the annual mean values of wave height have decreasing tendencies while the annual maxima tend to increase in most parts of the sea of marmara the dominant wind and wave directions are observed to be in the northeast and southwest sector and their magnitudes are controlled by the orographic features over the marmara region keywords swan long term wind climate spatiotemporal wave variation wave modeling in the enclosed sea era interim cfsr the sea of marmara 1 introduction wave climate assessment onea and rusu 2017 cuttler et al 2020 and extreme wave assessment xu et al 2016 shao et al 2018 require long term wind and wave data swain 1997 reported that reliable information on wave climate and extreme wave statistics requires wind and wave measurements of at least 10 30 years wave characteristics such as wave height wave period and wave direction can be reached with available instruments including in situ measurements and remotely sensed recordings however the measured wave data is generally available for short periods because in situ measurements of wave parameters are difficult expensive and time consuming therefore calibrated third generation wave models are widely used to obtain long term wave parameters the modeling of waves in enclosed seas is more challenging compared to open seas due to several affecting factors such as the presence of land and associated orography and extended areas of shallow waters while the former land and orography largely affect the evolution of the local wave fields the latter shallow waters adds complexities by requiring small grids with a high spatial resolution to resolve the details of the bottom effects as they become the dominant factors in wave transformation cavaleri et al 2018 the fact that these regions may be bounded by land masses in up to their four directions by the limited depth and by large scale current patterns affects the air sea interface and consequently the local winds and wave conditions cavaleri et al 2018 the sea of marmara an inland sea bounded by land masses in four directions links the black sea and the mediterranean via the bosphorus and the dardanelles straits there are very few studies carried out about the wind and wave climate assessments in the sea of marmara despite its strategic importance of connecting europe and asia in the wind and wave atlas covering all the turkish coasts ozhan and abdalla 1999 investigated the wind and wave climate of the sea of marmara for 68 reference points using the ecmwf the european center for medium range weather forecasts wind fields tsms turkish state meteorological service s synoptic maps and a third generation wave model wam wave model which is developed by the wave model development and implementation group wamdi group 1988 the spatial resolution was 0 12 0 09 approximately 10 km 10 km respectively in longitude and latitude however they performed the calibration and verification of their model with wave measurements at locations outside the sea of marmara yuksel et al 2011 presented a detailed wind and wave climate study for all the turkish coasts using 13 years long ecmwf wind fields and the mike 21 s w wave model which is a spectral wave model fm for applications involving the assessment of wave climates in offshore and coastal areas although they calibrated their wave model using wave buoy measurements within the sea of marmara the duration of the measurements was only two months they indicated that ozhan and abdalla 1999 s results overestimate the wave parameters over the sea of marmara kutupoğlu et al 2018 used two different wind fields i e the era interim winds from the ecmwf and the cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis winds from the noaa ncep national oceanic and atmospheric administration national centers for environmental prediction to investigate their qualities on the swan model simulating waves nearshore model which is a third generation numerical wave model they calibrated the numerical model by using buoy measurement for the year 2013 and validated the model with measurements at the same buoy location for the years 2014 2015 and 2016 based on a sensitivity analysis performed to find the optimal numerical settings and wind source at the buoy location they found that the cfsr wind data is a slightly better wind data source than the era interim wind data for wave modeling in the sea of marmara however their evaluation was made for a limited duration and they do not describe the long term wind and wave climate over the entire sea of marmara therefore there is a need to conduct a comprehensive study on the spatial and temporal variability of the wind and wave climate in the sea of marmara this study aims to fill this gap by providing extensive data on long term assessments of the wind and wave characteristics and their variabilities covering the last 40 years 1979 2018 wind climate was evaluated by using two well known wind fields i e ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr and the results obtained from these two sources were compared wave parameters were generated from the swan model with the era interim wind data using the validated swan model the spatial and temporal variability of the long term averages and long term trends of the wave characteristics were investigated and also extreme wave conditions were evaluated in detail long term wind and wave climate and trends at some selected locations with noteworthy features were analyzed in detail 2 study area the sea of marmara is an inland sea partly separating the asiatic and european parts of turkey it has always had strategic importance because it is the major waterway linking the black sea and the aegean sea a part of the mediterranean sea via the bosphorus and the dardanelles straits respectively fig 1 the region spans between 26 e 30 e longitudes and 40 n 41 5 n latitudes despite its small area i e 11 350 km2 the mean depth of the inland sea is 494 m the maximum depth is reaching 1370 m and the water volume is around 3378 km3 the bosphorus strait has an important role in world trade for centuries that makes this area one of the world s busiest maritime gateways the sea of marmara hosts the main container ports of turkey various types of terminals cruise terminals and marinas providing an important contribution to turkey s economy by means of industrial and tourism revenue therefore the sea of marmara has a critical importance for the safe and economic design of any port structures in it this situation brings the necessity of determining the design wave parameters properly which are the key and essential input parameters for the design of marine structures and the design wave parameters should be specified by statistical analysis with considering a sufficient amount of data the bathymetric feature of the sea of marmara can be defined as a semi enclosed basin it is approximately 250 km long and 70 km wide its depth varies from shallow gently sloping shelf along its southern boundary and steepens near its northern edge with three deep depressions in the interior chiggiato et al 2012 fig 2 the bathymetric data of the sea of marmara was obtained from the turkish naval forces office of navigation hydrology and oceanography onho and downscaled to the 0 005 0 005 mesh grid which includes 800 and 300 grid points in the x and y directions respectively fig 2 chiggiato et al 2012 briefly summarized the seasonal meteorological conditions of the sea of marmara region and claimed that the atmospheric circulation is mainly controlled by the meteorological conditions of the mediterranean aegean and black sea regions they stated that significant cyclogenesis occurs especially in winter over the mediterranean sea region and depressions generally move eastward in the eastern mediterranean sea some disturbances are indicated to move along a baroclinic corridor produced by thermal anomalies over the aegean and black seas with an axis oriented south west north east therefore directly impacting the sea of marmara region while some other disturbances dissipate on the western anatolian coastal area and other cyclones continue crossing turkey eventually reaching the easternmost part of the black sea it is underlined that prevailing winds are northeasterlies and secondary winds are southwesterlies during the passages of cyclones in the cold season on the other hand northeasterly winds are dominant in summer with a significantly decreasing number of cyclones passing over the region 3 materials and methods in this study for the wind climate assessments the ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr wind fields were considered since the accuracy of a wave model estimation highly depends on the quality of the wind fields the ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr wind fields which are the two widely used data were evaluated and compared before using in wave modeling both datasets provide the wind velocity components of reanalysis data at 10 m above the sea surface for the 40 year period covering the time between 1979 and 2018 the era interim is a well known global wind source with a 6 hr temporal resolution four analysis fields per day at 00 06 12 and 18 utc and can be downloaded from the ecmwf data center originally the era interim data is available as a gridded dataset at an approximately spatial resolution of 0 7 0 7 from the native t255 spectral grid the spatial resolution used in this study 0 25 0 25 is the output of the reanalysis model interpolated to the selected resolution the cfsr wind fields in version 1 1979 2010 and version 2 2011 present are available with different resolutions ranging from 0 205 0 205 to 2 5 2 5 to ensure consistency between two versions of cfsr wind fields the spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 which is the finest spatial resolution provided in both versions is selected in this study cfsr wind fields provide wind data with a 1 h temporal resolution since previous studies e g stopa and cheung 2014 kirezci et al 2020 suggest that the era interim wind field has overall better homogeneity through time which makes it more reliable for the modeling of long term processes the long term wave assessments were obtained from the swan model forced by the era interim wind data the swan model was calibrated and validated by wave measurements in the sea of marmara then the long term averages and trends were examined in the sea of marmara with the wave parameters obtained from the calibrated swan model for the period of 1979 2018 4 wind climate in this study the long term assessments in the wind and wave characteristics and their variabilities covering the last 40 years 1979 2018 have been done the capability of two different wind fields was evaluated and compared to predict the wind climate in the sea of marmara the quality of the two reanalysis wind data i e era interim and cfsr was tested by comparing them with the wind measurements made between 2015 and 2018 at yesilkoy and biga measurement stations the yesilkoy wind measurement station is located in the atatürk airport near the north coast of the sea of marmara at the coordinates 40 9819 n and 28 8208 e the biga station is located at the southwest coast of the sea of marmara sea at the coordinates 40 4088 n and 27 0600 e fig 1 fig 3 shows the time series of the era interim and cfsr data compared to measurement data at 10 m height for both stations both the era interim and cfsr data have similar trends with the measured wind data the average values of wind speed are 4 09 4 57 and 4 60 m s whereas the maximum values of wind speed are 12 07 14 03 and 14 38 m s for the yesilkoy cfsr and era interim wind data respectively the average values of wind speed are 3 57 3 90 and 2 96 m s and the maximum values are 14 92 14 16 and 14 00 m s for the biga cfsr and era interim wind data respectively it can be seen from table 1 and fig 3 a and b that the cfsr data predicts higher wind speeds than both the era interim reanalysis wind data and the measurement wind data at yesilkoy station the era interim reanalysis wind data has shown a better agreement with the measured wind data at the biga station than the cfsr wind data fig 3c and d for both the measurements and reanalysis data mean wind speeds at the south coast are lower than the north coast mean wind speeds measured at yesikoy are almost 20 greater than those at biga the error statistics of both reanalysis wind data and 1 hr sustained wind speed measurements data between 2015 and 2018 are presented in table 1 in order to evaluate quantitatively the quality of the reanalysis wind data bias correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and scatter index si which is rmse normalized by the mean measured value were calculated both the era interim and cfsr reanalysis data estimate measured wind data with a good degree of accuracy i e the large correlation coefficients and low errors the scatter plots comparing the measured and modeled wind speeds of both reanalysis data are given in fig 4 the concordance of comparisons for wind speeds was found to be satisfactorily good for both the era interim and cfsr data indicating that both the era interim and cfsr data can be used to evaluate the long term trends in the sea of marmara fig 5 represents the time averaged wind speed v and the coefficient of variation cv which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean wind speed for the 40 year data over the sea of marmara based on both the era interim fig 5a and c and cfsr data fig 5b and d the general patterns in both data sets agree with each other with slightly larger wind speeds in the cfsr wind data vm 3 70 m s than in the era interim data vm 3 62 m s fig 5 panels a and b shows that the dominant wind directions are mostly oriented northeast to southwest for both datasets the southern sea of marmara is exposed to lower wind speeds due to the wind shadowing by small and large islands and mountains in the southern part of the marmara basin such as samanli ida mountains and the 2543 m high mount uludag these islands and mountains constitute a topographic barrier and create a sheltered region for winds in the southern part of the marmara sea the variability of wind speed is greater at the central and western parts of the basin which is more obvious for the cfsr dataset fig 5c and d figs 6a and 7 a represent the seasonal behavior of wind speeds and directions over the sea of marmara during the 40 year period analyzed in each season the average wind speed maintains the highest values in the northern sea of marmara and decreases toward the south figs 6a and 7a the wind generally blows from northeast to the southeast in all seasons the winter season is characterized by strong southerly winds which can be seen from seasonal wind characteristics in this section the variability of wind characteristics represented by the coefficient of variation seems to be inversely related to wind speed i e the regions with strong winds show less variability figs 6b and 7b the regions with high cv values correspond to the western regions of the sea of marmara especially during winter figs 6b 1 and 7b 1 in winter strong wind conditions with comparatively low variability in the north part indicate that this region may be a proper candidate for wind energy harvesting as stable low cv winds blow over the eastern side of the bosphorus both the era interim and cfsr wind data represent similar general features for wind characteristics with slightly greater wind speeds and variability for the cfsr data the findings related to the seasonal variation of wind characteristics are also consistent with the previous studies e g chiggiato et al 2012 variation in wind characteristics from the western to the eastern sides of the sea of marmara was examined in more detail at local points that are chosen to represent different wind features five reference points were selected to estimate some special elements of the long term wind characteristics in detail in the western central and eastern regions of the sea of marmara which are denoted as p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 respectively in fig 1 features of the locations of these points are summarized in table 2 the directional behavior of the wind within the 40 year period analyzed at these five locations can be seen in fig 8 wind roses were generated in 16 directional and 6 wind speed magnitude bands based on both the ecmwf era interim fig 8a and ncep cfsr wind data fig 8b the dominant wind direction is northeast while the secondary dominant direction is southeast over the sea of marmara for all points fig 8 the era interim and cfsr data largely agree with each other in terms of dominant wind directions seasonal wind roses for selected locations are assessed to investigate the directional properties of wind speed in different seasons figure a 1 in winter the dominant winds blow from the northeast and north northeast and the secondary wind direction is south southwest figure a 1a and b the primary and secondary prevailing wind directions in the spring season are similar to those observed in winter with a lower frequency of occurrence of the winds from the secondary wind direction of the southwest figure a 1c and d in the summer season the winds blowing from the northeasterly directions are significantly dominant figure a 1e and f in autumn the prevailing wind direction is northeast and southwesterly winds appear to be the secondary wind direction figure a 1 the dominant wind direction is the northeasterly sector for all seasons based on the era interim and cfsr wind data the seasonal wind roses obtained from the two wind sources at the five selected locations are in good agreement figure a 1 5 wave modeling 5 1 description of the swan simulating waves nearshore model in this study the swan cycle iii version 41 20 model booij et al 1999 was run in the sea of marmara swan a third generation fully spectral model solves the wave action balance equation with sources and sinks on the spectrum for the evolution of wave growth swan team 2017 the wave action density n x y t σ θ is a function of space x and y time t frequency σ and propagation direction θ the evolution of the action density is governed by the spectral action

in this study with some additional details related to the swan model are presented in table 3 in order to overcome the appreciably inferior performance of wave models in enclosed seas particularly if affected by local orography such as the sea of marmara the suggested solution is obviously using high resolution limited area modeling cavaleri et al 2018 accordingly the swan computational domain considered for performing model simulations comprises the entire basin of the sea of marmara spanning between 26 e 30 e longitudes and 40 n 41 5 n latitudes and has the resolution in the geographical space 0 005 0 005 in both longitude and latitude in the geographical space in fig 2 the computational grid was chosen to coincide with the bathymetric grid and include 800 grid points in the x direction and 300 grid points in the y direction the points are equally spaced with 0 005 the frequency range was defined between 0 04 and 1 0 hz on a logarithmic scale the modeling period is 1979 2018 with a calculation time step of 30 min and an output time step of 1 hr the spatial resolution of output data was taken as 0 01 0 01 in both longitude and latitude to optimize the hard disk storage 5 2 evaluation of the swan model performance against measurements to evaluate the performance of the swan model the modeled significant wave heights were compared with buoy measurements silivri and ambarli measurement stations are located at 40 9742 n 28 2487 and 40 95 n 28 68 e respectively the water depth is 70 m at silivri and 17 m at ambarli stations the location of the two stations is shown in fig 1 the wave model was calibrated and then validated using the buoy measurements the calibration process was carried out with the measured significant wave heights at silivri station for the year 2017 which was selected randomly the calibrated swan model was validated against measurements at the silivri station for the years 2013 2014 2015 2016 2018 and ambarli station for the year 2003 the calibration process was performed to determine the best model settings i e the best fit between the modeled and measured significant wave heights once the optimal numerical mesh dimensions were determined and various calibration tests were performed to determine the physical model parameters such as the bottom friction depth induced wave breaking and nonlinear wave wave interactions and the value of the tunable parameter of cds whitecapping dissipation the physical model parameters are given in table 3 several statistical error measures such as bias rmse si and r were used to evaluate the results quantitatively from the calibration results the best model setting the lowest bias rmse and si the greatest r i e the best estimate of wave parameters was assigned as the calibrated swan settings to determine the best agreement between the swan model hindcasts and measured significant wave heights the tunable whitecapping parameter of cds 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were considered the scatter plots for measured and modeled significant wave heights at silivri station for the year 2017 are given in fig 9 and the statistical results are summarized in table 4 fig 9 shows that the swan model slightly underestimates and overestimates the significant wave heights for cds 1 5 and cds 0 5 respectively according to both fig 9 and table 4 the optimal value of the tunable parameter cds was found to be 1 0 the time histories of the measured and modeled significant wave heights at the silivri station for the year 2017 are presented in fig 10 the calibration process showed that the most effective calibration parameter is the whitecapping dissipation cds these results agreed with kutupoğlu et al 2018 the swan model results with the whitecapping parameter cds 1 0 were validated with the measured significant wave heights at silivri and ambarli stations the validation was conducted at the silivri station for the years 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2018 and at the ambarli station for the year 2003 the validated swan model results were evaluated by using the statistical parameters bias rmse si and r summarized in table 5 fig 11 shows the scatter plots of the modeled and measured wave parameters at silivri and ambarli stations the time histories of measured and modeled significant wave parameters at silivri station for the years 2013 2014 2015 2016 2018 and ambarli station for the year 2003 are evaluated and presented in fig 12 in general the validation results showed that the modeled significant wave heights are in good agreement with the measured significant wave heights at silivri and ambarli stations table 5 the good agreement between modeled and measured mean wave periods at the ambarli station indicates that the model is capable of reproducing well the wave period figs 11c and 12b unfortunately wave period information was not available at the silivri station kutupoğlu et al 2018 the long term assessment of wave climate using the hindcasted data obtained from the calibrated swan model is investigated in the next section 6 wave climate the required wave parameters for the long term analysis of wave climate were obtained from the swan model results forced by the era interim wind data the long term assessments of the wave characteristics e g significant wave height hm0 mean wave period tm storm duration t and wave steepness sm0 based on mean wave period were evaluated over the entire sea of marmara 6 1 long term averages the 40 year average of wave characteristics over the sea of marmara is presented in fig 13 the mean and maximum significant wave heights over the sea of marmara have a similar spatial distribution fig 13a and b the values of the maximum significant wave height 0 06 m hm0 max 2 50 m are apparently up to around six times greater than the mean significant wave heights 0 01 m hm0 mean 0 40 m over the sea of marmara fig 13a and b the greatest wave height values are found to be in the central and northern sides of the sea of marmara for both the maximum and mean significant wave heights the long term wave direction analysis shows that the waves coming from the northeast are dominant in the sea of marmara fig 13a which follows a similar pattern with the wind directions over the sea of marmara fig 5a and b and 14 a the mean wave periods follow a similar spatial distribution with wave heights larger mean wave period values are detected in the central part of the sea of marmara fig 13c the 40 year averaged mean wave periods range between 0 87 s and 1 81 s over the entire basin wave steepness is one of the essential parameters for the design of coastal structures as it controls the breaking of waves and defines the severity of the sea condition therefore the spatial distribution of wave steepness is investigated over the sea of marmara especially the northern and northeastern parts possess greater wave steepness values fig 13d the wave steepness ranges from 0 005 to 0 058 in general the northern side of the sea of marmara possesses greater significant wave heights since the wind speed is greater in the northern part longer wave periods appear in the central part the decreasing speed of the northerly winds toward the south fig 5a and b due to being sheltered by the high mountains and islands in the south of the basin precludes the growing waves in the southern side of the sea of marmara because of these geographical factors the northern part of the sea of marmara is characterized by a more energetic wave climate compared to the other parts of the basin 6 2 long term variability and trends 6 2 1 long term variability the long term variability of wave characteristics is evaluated by using a coefficient of variation cv which determines the amount of variability relative to the mean i e the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean fig 14 shows that the cv values in the coastal regions of the sea of marmara are relatively higher than those in the rest of the sea especially the cv values are higher in the eastern and south coasts for the significant wave height fig 14a the variability of wave steepness is observed to be compatible with the results of the variability of the significant wave height and mean wave period which focuses mostly around the south and eastern edge of the coasts fig 14c long term trend analysis is presented in the next section to determine whether these long term variabilities indicate increasing or decreasing trends 6 2 2 long term trends in this study the long term trends were calculated using the linear regression using the line of best fit as y ax b where x is the explanatory variable and y is the dependent variable the slope of the line is a and b is the intercept the value of y when x 0 the method of least squares is the most common method for fitting a regression line this method calculates the line of best fit for the considered data by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations from each data point to the line islek et al 2020a b figs 15 and 16 were produced based on the best fit slopes of the yearly wave characteristics derived from the whole time series for the entire sea of marmara the mean change of the wave characteristics in the 40 year period is calculated by multiplying the best fit slope by 40 the parameters δhm0 mean δhm0 max δtm mean and δsm mean refer to the long term variation in 40 years of the yearly averaged significant wave height maximum significant wave height mean wave period and mean wave steepness respectively the long term trends of the significant wave height and mean wave period over the sea of marmara follow a similar pattern fig 15 as follows decreasing trends prevail throughout the sea of marmara for both mean significant wave height 6 and mean wave period 3 5 only in very limited areas near the coastline of the northern sea of marmara has increasing trends in the significant wave height and mean wave period with the values of 6 and 1 84 respectively fig 15a and c in contrary to mean wave parameters the intensity of the extreme events i e maximum significant wave height have a general increasing tendency throughout the sea of marmara except in the eastern part of the basin increasing trends are determined in the southern side of the sea of marmara with the value of 13 for the maximum significant wave height there is a decreasing trend in the eastern side of the sea of marmara for the maximum significant wave height 8 fig 15b except in the western part of the sea values range from about 3 to 0 5 the sea of marmara has a general downward trend with a value of 1 5 in terms of wave steepness fig 15d 6 2 3 local analyses detailed long term analyses were carried out for five reference points defined in section 4 representing different wind and wave features fig 1 and table 2 the reasons for the selection of these points were explained in the assessments of the wind climate section 4 as for the wave climate p1 is characterized by moderate significant wave height shorter wave period and lower variability p2 is characterized by larger significant wave height and mean wave period with low variability the significant wave height is moderate and the wave period is long at p3 with moderate variability p4 is represented by low significant wave heights with moderate mean wave periods and moderate variabilities significant wave height is lower at p5 with moderate mean wave periods and higher variabilities as seen in figs 13 figure 14 and fig 15 the annual mean values of significant wave height hm0 mean mean wave period tm mean wave steepness sm0 mean and the annual maximum values of significant wave height hm0 max at five selected reference points were evaluated for 40 years over the sea of marmara fig 16 fig 16 shows that the mean significant wave heights mean wave steepnesses and mean wave periods tend to decrease however the maximum mean significant wave heights tend to increase at p2 p3 and p5 there are decreasing trends for both the mean significant wave height and the maximum significant wave height at p1 the lowest changes in mean wave height among the locations analyzed are determined at p4 which is located at the southwestern part of the sea of marmara characterized with lower significant wave heights compared to other parts of the sea the values of trends at the five selected reference points are presented in table 6 wave roses to determine the directional behavior in the 40 year period at the five selected reference points are presented in fig 17 wave roses were generated in 16 directional and 6 wave height magnitude bands based on the swan model results for all reference points the dominant wave directions are northeasterly sectors e g ne at p1 nne at p2 nne at p3 ne at p4 and ene at p5 the dominant wave direction on the eastern part of the sea shifts from northeast towards the easterly direction e g p1 and p5 are located at the eastern part of the sea and the dominant wave directions are ne and ene respectively southwesterly directions may also be important seasonally see section 6 3 for details the eastern part of the basin p5 is also subjected to waves coming from the east direction fig 17e figs 8 and 1717 indicate that wind and wave directions follow a similar pattern directional and non directional nondir probability of exceedance within the 40 year period analyzed at five selected reference points is given in fig 18 waves coming from the north northeast have the highest probability of occurrence at p2 and p3 fig 18b and c northeast north northeast and south southwest have the highest probability at p1 fig 18a northeast has apparent probability at p4 fig 18d the highest probability of occurrence at p5 appears to be east and east northeast fig 18e 6 3 seasonal wave climate seasonal wave roses were examined at five selected reference points to determine seasonal directional behavior and seasonal dominant wave directions based on the 40 year wave data 1979 2018 obtained from the calibrated swan model forced with the era interim wind data figure a 2 in the winter season both northeasterly and southwesterly directions are dominating the wave climate at p1 and p2 especially at p1 the larger waves come from the south southwest in winter at p3 and p4 which are located in the western part of the basin the dominant wave directions are north northeast and northeast respectively southwesterly sectors are the secondary wave directions at these regions in winter in the eastern part of the basin p5 the wave climate is calmer compared to the other regions analyzed with easterly waves dominating the wave climate figure a 2a the secondary wave directions in winter southwesterly sector begin to appear more prominently in the spring season except for p3 where waves from north northeast are still dominant in spring figure a 2 b both in summer and autumn waves from north easterly sectors start dominating the wave climate with more energetic waves in autumn while the most prominent wave directions in the summer and autumn seasons are northeast and north northeast at p1 p4 the dominant wave direction at p5 is east northeast similar to the other seasons figure a 2c and d seasonal wave roses based on the validated swan model forced with the era interim data are determined to have similar patterns with the seasonal wind roses based on the era interim and cfrs wind data at all selected locations 6 4 storm analysis and extreme value distributions the possibility of stormy wave conditions in an enclosed sea or a lake is expected to be much lower than in the ocean which is valid for the most extreme ocean storms however it should be noted that distances of several hundred kilometers are sufficient to build a severe storm cavaleri et al 2018 currently many types of structures are designed for different purposes in coastal and offshore regions the force of storm waves usually inﬂuences the life span of these structures compelling engineers to design structures to withstand these destructive waves therefore the estimation of extreme waves is important for the design of coastal structures however prior to the phase of designing the probability of storm waves during the life of structures should be projected the probable wave height is estimated based on the return period of storms and the employed method is generally known as extreme value analysis fundamentally extreme value analysis aims to specify the probabilities of exceedance and non exceedance of wave heights and non exceedance probabilities are known as return periods far and abd wahab 2016 a 5 10 exceedance significant wave height is commonly adopted in scientiﬁc studies to deﬁne storm events angnuureng et al 2017 dorsch et al 2008 rangel buitrago et al 2011 splinter et al 2014 castelle et al 2015 for each selected point in this study the significant wave heights corresponding to 1 5 50 exceedance levels together with the maximum values are shown in fig 19 and table 7 as seen in table 7 extremes are more intense in the north and northeast of the basin p1 and p2 than in the southern part due to geographic formation which is compatible with the wind climate of the sea of marmara while the upper percentile wave heights at p2 are greater than those at p1 the greatest maximum significant wave height occurs similarly at p1 and p2 it is observed for all points that the wave heights corresponding to an exceeding probability of 5 are lower than 1 0 m table 7 which is quite low to represent the storm conditions in this study the storm wave condition is represented using the definitions given in the beaufort wind scale the threshold wind speed value for storm initiation can be taken as 10 m s based on the beaufort wind force scale the appearance of this condition at sea is defined as wave height exceeds 2 0 m which corresponds to a fresh breeze therefore in this study the significant wave height greater than 2 m is taken as the threshold value for storm initiation the number of hours during which the wave height exceeds this threshold value in a year is considered as storm duration similar to the significant wave height distribution yearly storm duration in the northern part of the sea of marmara up to 8 h per year is found to be greater than the other parts of the basin fig 20 large northeasterly waves with long storm durations in the northeastern and central parts of the sea of marmara indicate that these regions have strong severe and powerful wave conditions the storm durations in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the sea of marmara decrease to 0 hr and 2 hr respectively damage in coastal structures occurs when the wave forces exceed the design wave conditions the design wave height is determined by fitting annual maxima to the extreme value distribution in this study the weibull distribution which has the following cumulative distribution function expression for a random variable x is used 3 f x 1 exp x μ β α where μ is the location parameter β is the scale parameter and α is the shape parameter design wave levels of coastal structures are determined based on the return period of waves which is selected depending on the functional classification of structures according to the performance based design method for example normal port structures of economic and social significance using crane operations are generally designed for the return period of 100 years the design level for special structures such as the marine structures hosting nuclear power plants is the upper limit of the 70 confidence interval for the return period of 100 years yuksel et al 2020 goda 2010 fig 21 shows annual return periods of significant wave height based on the weibull distribution at the selected locations fig 1 including 70 confidence intervals dashed lines based on these graphs the design wave heights for the 100 year return period are found as 2 7 m 2 7 m 2 2 m 1 9 m and 2 2 m for p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 respectively although the 100 year wave heights are comparable at p1 and p2 the steeper slope of the distribution at p1 indicates that for lower return periods the corresponding wave heights are much smaller than those at p2 it is noteworthy that the design wave heights for the 100 year return period are smaller than the maximum wave heights of the 40 year wave hindcasting in the northern sea of marmara extreme value theory provides a statistical description of the maxima of a stationary process which assumes no change in the frequency of extremes over time the stationary method is constrained to the available historical data and therefore has limited application to longer periods rueda et al 2016 for example if the distribution of data in an interval exhibits a long tail extreme values in this interval may influence the t year return value for very large values of t mackay and jonathan 2020 the climate may be subjected to variations at different temporal scales that affect the frequency and intensity of climatic and hydrological extremes violating the assumption of stationarity mentaschi et al 2016 as observed in our data see the values of hm0 max in the year 2015 in figs 16 b 1 b 2 and b 3 therefore the wave climate in the northern part of the sea of marmara shows changes at time scales shorter than the design return period of many coastal structures previous studies that made similar observations in different regions in the world e g suh et al 2012 linked this behavior to the impact of global climate change in such cases statistical methods that account for the non stationary behavior of the climate system are needed although a general theory on non stationary extreme value analysis has not yet been formulated there are studies describing methodologies for the estimation of time varying extreme value distributions on non stationary time series based on a pragmatic approach that enhances the standard extreme value theory utilizing further statistical techniques mentaschi et al 2016 7 conclusion in this study long term assessments of wind and wave characteristics in the sea of marmara between the years 1979 2018 were performed wind data was provided from the ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr databases and wave data was generated from the calibrated swan model forced with the era interim data the era interim and cfsr wind data were evaluated and compared with the measured wind data in the north of the basin the era interim wind data showed a slightly better agreement with measurements the accuracy of the calibrated swan model results was validated by the measured wave parameters at two stations the long term assessments of wind characteristics obtained from the era interim and cfsr wind data for the 40 years 1979 2018 over the sea of marmara are as follows especially the northern part and central regions of the sea of marmara are exposed to greater wind speeds for both datasets the 40 year average values and seasonal wind climate analyses show that the dominant winds blow from the northeast and the secondary effective wind direction is south west for both the era interim and cfsr wind data the southern sea of marmara is exposed to lower wind speeds blowing from northerly direction due to wind shadowing by islands and mountains in the southern part of the marmara basin in general wind speeds of cfsr data are slightly greater than those of the era interim data the long term wave results obtained from the calibrated and validated swan model forced with the era interim data run for 40 years 1979 2018 over the sea of marmara are as follows the 40 year averages of wave characteristics indicate that the northern side of the sea of marmara is exposed to higher waves according to the long term variability of the mean wave characteristics the northwestern part of the sea of marmara possesses lower variability the long term trend results show that the mean values of significant wave height and mean wave period have decreasing tendencies while the maximum values of significant wave height have increasing tendencies in most parts of the sea of marmara a general downward trend was obtained for wave steepness except for the western part of the sea of marmara the dominant wave direction in the sea of marmara is north northeast in the eastern part it shifts slightly eastward and prevailing wave directions become northeast and east northeast while both northeasterly and southwesterly directions are dominating the wave climate the larger waves come from the south southwest in the northern part of the sea of marmara observed in the winter season extremes are more intense in the north and northeast of the sea of marmara than the southern part due to the orographic formation of the marmara basin for future work it is suggested to use the most recent reanalysis wind data e g era5 with a higher spatial resolution for better representation of the coastline the diurnal cycle of wind and wave characteristics over the black sea should be addressed in future investigations

20848,the sea of marmara is a typical example of enclosed seas and an inland sea bounded by land masses in four directions and it links the black sea and the mediterranean via the bosphorus and the dardanelles straits moreover the sea of marmara has strategic importance with possessing marine structures such as various types of terminals cruise terminals and marinas and also providing a strong economic contribution with tourism revenue this situation brings the necessity of determining the design wind and wave parameters properly the wind and wave characteristics and their variabilities were evaluated covering the last 40 years 1979 2018 by using two well known wind fields i e ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr wave parameters were generated from the calibrated and validated swan model with era interim wind data the spatial and temporal variability of the long term averages and long term trends of the wind and wave characteristics were investigated and also extreme wave conditions were evaluated in detail this study shows that the modeling of waves in enclosed seas is more challenging compared to open seas due to several affecting factors such as land which affect the wave fields and need high spatial resolution the results indicate that orography and islands largely affect the wind and wave climate in the sea of marmara the northern side of the sea of marmara is characterized by stronger wind and wave climate compared to the southern side the annual mean values of wave height have decreasing tendencies while the annual maxima tend to increase in most parts of the sea of marmara the dominant wind and wave directions are observed to be in the northeast and southwest sector and their magnitudes are controlled by the orographic features over the marmara region keywords swan long term wind climate spatiotemporal wave variation wave modeling in the enclosed sea era interim cfsr the sea of marmara 1 introduction wave climate assessment onea and rusu 2017 cuttler et al 2020 and extreme wave assessment xu et al 2016 shao et al 2018 require long term wind and wave data swain 1997 reported that reliable information on wave climate and extreme wave statistics requires wind and wave measurements of at least 10 30 years wave characteristics such as wave height wave period and wave direction can be reached with available instruments including in situ measurements and remotely sensed recordings however the measured wave data is generally available for short periods because in situ measurements of wave parameters are difficult expensive and time consuming therefore calibrated third generation wave models are widely used to obtain long term wave parameters the modeling of waves in enclosed seas is more challenging compared to open seas due to several affecting factors such as the presence of land and associated orography and extended areas of shallow waters while the former land and orography largely affect the evolution of the local wave fields the latter shallow waters adds complexities by requiring small grids with a high spatial resolution to resolve the details of the bottom effects as they become the dominant factors in wave transformation cavaleri et al 2018 the fact that these regions may be bounded by land masses in up to their four directions by the limited depth and by large scale current patterns affects the air sea interface and consequently the local winds and wave conditions cavaleri et al 2018 the sea of marmara an inland sea bounded by land masses in four directions links the black sea and the mediterranean via the bosphorus and the dardanelles straits there are very few studies carried out about the wind and wave climate assessments in the sea of marmara despite its strategic importance of connecting europe and asia in the wind and wave atlas covering all the turkish coasts ozhan and abdalla 1999 investigated the wind and wave climate of the sea of marmara for 68 reference points using the ecmwf the european center for medium range weather forecasts wind fields tsms turkish state meteorological service s synoptic maps and a third generation wave model wam wave model which is developed by the wave model development and implementation group wamdi group 1988 the spatial resolution was 0 12 0 09 approximately 10 km 10 km respectively in longitude and latitude however they performed the calibration and verification of their model with wave measurements at locations outside the sea of marmara yuksel et al 2011 presented a detailed wind and wave climate study for all the turkish coasts using 13 years long ecmwf wind fields and the mike 21 s w wave model which is a spectral wave model fm for applications involving the assessment of wave climates in offshore and coastal areas although they calibrated their wave model using wave buoy measurements within the sea of marmara the duration of the measurements was only two months they indicated that ozhan and abdalla 1999 s results overestimate the wave parameters over the sea of marmara kutupoğlu et al 2018 used two different wind fields i e the era interim winds from the ecmwf and the cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis winds from the noaa ncep national oceanic and atmospheric administration national centers for environmental prediction to investigate their qualities on the swan model simulating waves nearshore model which is a third generation numerical wave model they calibrated the numerical model by using buoy measurement for the year 2013 and validated the model with measurements at the same buoy location for the years 2014 2015 and 2016 based on a sensitivity analysis performed to find the optimal numerical settings and wind source at the buoy location they found that the cfsr wind data is a slightly better wind data source than the era interim wind data for wave modeling in the sea of marmara however their evaluation was made for a limited duration and they do not describe the long term wind and wave climate over the entire sea of marmara therefore there is a need to conduct a comprehensive study on the spatial and temporal variability of the wind and wave climate in the sea of marmara this study aims to fill this gap by providing extensive data on long term assessments of the wind and wave characteristics and their variabilities covering the last 40 years 1979 2018 wind climate was evaluated by using two well known wind fields i e ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr and the results obtained from these two sources were compared wave parameters were generated from the swan model with the era interim wind data using the validated swan model the spatial and temporal variability of the long term averages and long term trends of the wave characteristics were investigated and also extreme wave conditions were evaluated in detail long term wind and wave climate and trends at some selected locations with noteworthy features were analyzed in detail 2 study area the sea of marmara is an inland sea partly separating the asiatic and european parts of turkey it has always had strategic importance because it is the major waterway linking the black sea and the aegean sea a part of the mediterranean sea via the bosphorus and the dardanelles straits respectively fig 1 the region spans between 26 e 30 e longitudes and 40 n 41 5 n latitudes despite its small area i e 11 350 km2 the mean depth of the inland sea is 494 m the maximum depth is reaching 1370 m and the water volume is around 3378 km3 the bosphorus strait has an important role in world trade for centuries that makes this area one of the world s busiest maritime gateways the sea of marmara hosts the main container ports of turkey various types of terminals cruise terminals and marinas providing an important contribution to turkey s economy by means of industrial and tourism revenue therefore the sea of marmara has a critical importance for the safe and economic design of any port structures in it this situation brings the necessity of determining the design wave parameters properly which are the key and essential input parameters for the design of marine structures and the design wave parameters should be specified by statistical analysis with considering a sufficient amount of data the bathymetric feature of the sea of marmara can be defined as a semi enclosed basin it is approximately 250 km long and 70 km wide its depth varies from shallow gently sloping shelf along its southern boundary and steepens near its northern edge with three deep depressions in the interior chiggiato et al 2012 fig 2 the bathymetric data of the sea of marmara was obtained from the turkish naval forces office of navigation hydrology and oceanography onho and downscaled to the 0 005 0 005 mesh grid which includes 800 and 300 grid points in the x and y directions respectively fig 2 chiggiato et al 2012 briefly summarized the seasonal meteorological conditions of the sea of marmara region and claimed that the atmospheric circulation is mainly controlled by the meteorological conditions of the mediterranean aegean and black sea regions they stated that significant cyclogenesis occurs especially in winter over the mediterranean sea region and depressions generally move eastward in the eastern mediterranean sea some disturbances are indicated to move along a baroclinic corridor produced by thermal anomalies over the aegean and black seas with an axis oriented south west north east therefore directly impacting the sea of marmara region while some other disturbances dissipate on the western anatolian coastal area and other cyclones continue crossing turkey eventually reaching the easternmost part of the black sea it is underlined that prevailing winds are northeasterlies and secondary winds are southwesterlies during the passages of cyclones in the cold season on the other hand northeasterly winds are dominant in summer with a significantly decreasing number of cyclones passing over the region 3 materials and methods in this study for the wind climate assessments the ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr wind fields were considered since the accuracy of a wave model estimation highly depends on the quality of the wind fields the ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr wind fields which are the two widely used data were evaluated and compared before using in wave modeling both datasets provide the wind velocity components of reanalysis data at 10 m above the sea surface for the 40 year period covering the time between 1979 and 2018 the era interim is a well known global wind source with a 6 hr temporal resolution four analysis fields per day at 00 06 12 and 18 utc and can be downloaded from the ecmwf data center originally the era interim data is available as a gridded dataset at an approximately spatial resolution of 0 7 0 7 from the native t255 spectral grid the spatial resolution used in this study 0 25 0 25 is the output of the reanalysis model interpolated to the selected resolution the cfsr wind fields in version 1 1979 2010 and version 2 2011 present are available with different resolutions ranging from 0 205 0 205 to 2 5 2 5 to ensure consistency between two versions of cfsr wind fields the spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 which is the finest spatial resolution provided in both versions is selected in this study cfsr wind fields provide wind data with a 1 h temporal resolution since previous studies e g stopa and cheung 2014 kirezci et al 2020 suggest that the era interim wind field has overall better homogeneity through time which makes it more reliable for the modeling of long term processes the long term wave assessments were obtained from the swan model forced by the era interim wind data the swan model was calibrated and validated by wave measurements in the sea of marmara then the long term averages and trends were examined in the sea of marmara with the wave parameters obtained from the calibrated swan model for the period of 1979 2018 4 wind climate in this study the long term assessments in the wind and wave characteristics and their variabilities covering the last 40 years 1979 2018 have been done the capability of two different wind fields was evaluated and compared to predict the wind climate in the sea of marmara the quality of the two reanalysis wind data i e era interim and cfsr was tested by comparing them with the wind measurements made between 2015 and 2018 at yesilkoy and biga measurement stations the yesilkoy wind measurement station is located in the atatürk airport near the north coast of the sea of marmara at the coordinates 40 9819 n and 28 8208 e the biga station is located at the southwest coast of the sea of marmara sea at the coordinates 40 4088 n and 27 0600 e fig 1 fig 3 shows the time series of the era interim and cfsr data compared to measurement data at 10 m height for both stations both the era interim and cfsr data have similar trends with the measured wind data the average values of wind speed are 4 09 4 57 and 4 60 m s whereas the maximum values of wind speed are 12 07 14 03 and 14 38 m s for the yesilkoy cfsr and era interim wind data respectively the average values of wind speed are 3 57 3 90 and 2 96 m s and the maximum values are 14 92 14 16 and 14 00 m s for the biga cfsr and era interim wind data respectively it can be seen from table 1 and fig 3 a and b that the cfsr data predicts higher wind speeds than both the era interim reanalysis wind data and the measurement wind data at yesilkoy station the era interim reanalysis wind data has shown a better agreement with the measured wind data at the biga station than the cfsr wind data fig 3c and d for both the measurements and reanalysis data mean wind speeds at the south coast are lower than the north coast mean wind speeds measured at yesikoy are almost 20 greater than those at biga the error statistics of both reanalysis wind data and 1 hr sustained wind speed measurements data between 2015 and 2018 are presented in table 1 in order to evaluate quantitatively the quality of the reanalysis wind data bias correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and scatter index si which is rmse normalized by the mean measured value were calculated both the era interim and cfsr reanalysis data estimate measured wind data with a good degree of accuracy i e the large correlation coefficients and low errors the scatter plots comparing the measured and modeled wind speeds of both reanalysis data are given in fig 4 the concordance of comparisons for wind speeds was found to be satisfactorily good for both the era interim and cfsr data indicating that both the era interim and cfsr data can be used to evaluate the long term trends in the sea of marmara fig 5 represents the time averaged wind speed v and the coefficient of variation cv which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean wind speed for the 40 year data over the sea of marmara based on both the era interim fig 5a and c and cfsr data fig 5b and d the general patterns in both data sets agree with each other with slightly larger wind speeds in the cfsr wind data vm 3 70 m s than in the era interim data vm 3 62 m s fig 5 panels a and b shows that the dominant wind directions are mostly oriented northeast to southwest for both datasets the southern sea of marmara is exposed to lower wind speeds due to the wind shadowing by small and large islands and mountains in the southern part of the marmara basin such as samanli ida mountains and the 2543 m high mount uludag these islands and mountains constitute a topographic barrier and create a sheltered region for winds in the southern part of the marmara sea the variability of wind speed is greater at the central and western parts of the basin which is more obvious for the cfsr dataset fig 5c and d figs 6a and 7 a represent the seasonal behavior of wind speeds and directions over the sea of marmara during the 40 year period analyzed in each season the average wind speed maintains the highest values in the northern sea of marmara and decreases toward the south figs 6a and 7a the wind generally blows from northeast to the southeast in all seasons the winter season is characterized by strong southerly winds which can be seen from seasonal wind characteristics in this section the variability of wind characteristics represented by the coefficient of variation seems to be inversely related to wind speed i e the regions with strong winds show less variability figs 6b and 7b the regions with high cv values correspond to the western regions of the sea of marmara especially during winter figs 6b 1 and 7b 1 in winter strong wind conditions with comparatively low variability in the north part indicate that this region may be a proper candidate for wind energy harvesting as stable low cv winds blow over the eastern side of the bosphorus both the era interim and cfsr wind data represent similar general features for wind characteristics with slightly greater wind speeds and variability for the cfsr data the findings related to the seasonal variation of wind characteristics are also consistent with the previous studies e g chiggiato et al 2012 variation in wind characteristics from the western to the eastern sides of the sea of marmara was examined in more detail at local points that are chosen to represent different wind features five reference points were selected to estimate some special elements of the long term wind characteristics in detail in the western central and eastern regions of the sea of marmara which are denoted as p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 respectively in fig 1 features of the locations of these points are summarized in table 2 the directional behavior of the wind within the 40 year period analyzed at these five locations can be seen in fig 8 wind roses were generated in 16 directional and 6 wind speed magnitude bands based on both the ecmwf era interim fig 8a and ncep cfsr wind data fig 8b the dominant wind direction is northeast while the secondary dominant direction is southeast over the sea of marmara for all points fig 8 the era interim and cfsr data largely agree with each other in terms of dominant wind directions seasonal wind roses for selected locations are assessed to investigate the directional properties of wind speed in different seasons figure a 1 in winter the dominant winds blow from the northeast and north northeast and the secondary wind direction is south southwest figure a 1a and b the primary and secondary prevailing wind directions in the spring season are similar to those observed in winter with a lower frequency of occurrence of the winds from the secondary wind direction of the southwest figure a 1c and d in the summer season the winds blowing from the northeasterly directions are significantly dominant figure a 1e and f in autumn the prevailing wind direction is northeast and southwesterly winds appear to be the secondary wind direction figure a 1 the dominant wind direction is the northeasterly sector for all seasons based on the era interim and cfsr wind data the seasonal wind roses obtained from the two wind sources at the five selected locations are in good agreement figure a 1 5 wave modeling 5 1 description of the swan simulating waves nearshore model in this study the swan cycle iii version 41 20 model booij et al 1999 was run in the sea of marmara swan a third generation fully spectral model solves the wave action balance equation with sources and sinks on the spectrum for the evolution of wave growth swan team 2017 the wave action density n x y t σ θ is a function of space x and y time t frequency σ and propagation direction θ the evolution of the action density is governed by the spectral action

in this study with some additional details related to the swan model are presented in table 3 in order to overcome the appreciably inferior performance of wave models in enclosed seas particularly if affected by local orography such as the sea of marmara the suggested solution is obviously using high resolution limited area modeling cavaleri et al 2018 accordingly the swan computational domain considered for performing model simulations comprises the entire basin of the sea of marmara spanning between 26 e 30 e longitudes and 40 n 41 5 n latitudes and has the resolution in the geographical space 0 005 0 005 in both longitude and latitude in the geographical space in fig 2 the computational grid was chosen to coincide with the bathymetric grid and include 800 grid points in the x direction and 300 grid points in the y direction the points are equally spaced with 0 005 the frequency range was defined between 0 04 and 1 0 hz on a logarithmic scale the modeling period is 1979 2018 with a calculation time step of 30 min and an output time step of 1 hr the spatial resolution of output data was taken as 0 01 0 01 in both longitude and latitude to optimize the hard disk storage 5 2 evaluation of the swan model performance against measurements to evaluate the performance of the swan model the modeled significant wave heights were compared with buoy measurements silivri and ambarli measurement stations are located at 40 9742 n 28 2487 and 40 95 n 28 68 e respectively the water depth is 70 m at silivri and 17 m at ambarli stations the location of the two stations is shown in fig 1 the wave model was calibrated and then validated using the buoy measurements the calibration process was carried out with the measured significant wave heights at silivri station for the year 2017 which was selected randomly the calibrated swan model was validated against measurements at the silivri station for the years 2013 2014 2015 2016 2018 and ambarli station for the year 2003 the calibration process was performed to determine the best model settings i e the best fit between the modeled and measured significant wave heights once the optimal numerical mesh dimensions were determined and various calibration tests were performed to determine the physical model parameters such as the bottom friction depth induced wave breaking and nonlinear wave wave interactions and the value of the tunable parameter of cds whitecapping dissipation the physical model parameters are given in table 3 several statistical error measures such as bias rmse si and r were used to evaluate the results quantitatively from the calibration results the best model setting the lowest bias rmse and si the greatest r i e the best estimate of wave parameters was assigned as the calibrated swan settings to determine the best agreement between the swan model hindcasts and measured significant wave heights the tunable whitecapping parameter of cds 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 were considered the scatter plots for measured and modeled significant wave heights at silivri station for the year 2017 are given in fig 9 and the statistical results are summarized in table 4 fig 9 shows that the swan model slightly underestimates and overestimates the significant wave heights for cds 1 5 and cds 0 5 respectively according to both fig 9 and table 4 the optimal value of the tunable parameter cds was found to be 1 0 the time histories of the measured and modeled significant wave heights at the silivri station for the year 2017 are presented in fig 10 the calibration process showed that the most effective calibration parameter is the whitecapping dissipation cds these results agreed with kutupoğlu et al 2018 the swan model results with the whitecapping parameter cds 1 0 were validated with the measured significant wave heights at silivri and ambarli stations the validation was conducted at the silivri station for the years 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2018 and at the ambarli station for the year 2003 the validated swan model results were evaluated by using the statistical parameters bias rmse si and r summarized in table 5 fig 11 shows the scatter plots of the modeled and measured wave parameters at silivri and ambarli stations the time histories of measured and modeled significant wave parameters at silivri station for the years 2013 2014 2015 2016 2018 and ambarli station for the year 2003 are evaluated and presented in fig 12 in general the validation results showed that the modeled significant wave heights are in good agreement with the measured significant wave heights at silivri and ambarli stations table 5 the good agreement between modeled and measured mean wave periods at the ambarli station indicates that the model is capable of reproducing well the wave period figs 11c and 12b unfortunately wave period information was not available at the silivri station kutupoğlu et al 2018 the long term assessment of wave climate using the hindcasted data obtained from the calibrated swan model is investigated in the next section 6 wave climate the required wave parameters for the long term analysis of wave climate were obtained from the swan model results forced by the era interim wind data the long term assessments of the wave characteristics e g significant wave height hm0 mean wave period tm storm duration t and wave steepness sm0 based on mean wave period were evaluated over the entire sea of marmara 6 1 long term averages the 40 year average of wave characteristics over the sea of marmara is presented in fig 13 the mean and maximum significant wave heights over the sea of marmara have a similar spatial distribution fig 13a and b the values of the maximum significant wave height 0 06 m hm0 max 2 50 m are apparently up to around six times greater than the mean significant wave heights 0 01 m hm0 mean 0 40 m over the sea of marmara fig 13a and b the greatest wave height values are found to be in the central and northern sides of the sea of marmara for both the maximum and mean significant wave heights the long term wave direction analysis shows that the waves coming from the northeast are dominant in the sea of marmara fig 13a which follows a similar pattern with the wind directions over the sea of marmara fig 5a and b and 14 a the mean wave periods follow a similar spatial distribution with wave heights larger mean wave period values are detected in the central part of the sea of marmara fig 13c the 40 year averaged mean wave periods range between 0 87 s and 1 81 s over the entire basin wave steepness is one of the essential parameters for the design of coastal structures as it controls the breaking of waves and defines the severity of the sea condition therefore the spatial distribution of wave steepness is investigated over the sea of marmara especially the northern and northeastern parts possess greater wave steepness values fig 13d the wave steepness ranges from 0 005 to 0 058 in general the northern side of the sea of marmara possesses greater significant wave heights since the wind speed is greater in the northern part longer wave periods appear in the central part the decreasing speed of the northerly winds toward the south fig 5a and b due to being sheltered by the high mountains and islands in the south of the basin precludes the growing waves in the southern side of the sea of marmara because of these geographical factors the northern part of the sea of marmara is characterized by a more energetic wave climate compared to the other parts of the basin 6 2 long term variability and trends 6 2 1 long term variability the long term variability of wave characteristics is evaluated by using a coefficient of variation cv which determines the amount of variability relative to the mean i e the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean fig 14 shows that the cv values in the coastal regions of the sea of marmara are relatively higher than those in the rest of the sea especially the cv values are higher in the eastern and south coasts for the significant wave height fig 14a the variability of wave steepness is observed to be compatible with the results of the variability of the significant wave height and mean wave period which focuses mostly around the south and eastern edge of the coasts fig 14c long term trend analysis is presented in the next section to determine whether these long term variabilities indicate increasing or decreasing trends 6 2 2 long term trends in this study the long term trends were calculated using the linear regression using the line of best fit as y ax b where x is the explanatory variable and y is the dependent variable the slope of the line is a and b is the intercept the value of y when x 0 the method of least squares is the most common method for fitting a regression line this method calculates the line of best fit for the considered data by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations from each data point to the line islek et al 2020a b figs 15 and 16 were produced based on the best fit slopes of the yearly wave characteristics derived from the whole time series for the entire sea of marmara the mean change of the wave characteristics in the 40 year period is calculated by multiplying the best fit slope by 40 the parameters δhm0 mean δhm0 max δtm mean and δsm mean refer to the long term variation in 40 years of the yearly averaged significant wave height maximum significant wave height mean wave period and mean wave steepness respectively the long term trends of the significant wave height and mean wave period over the sea of marmara follow a similar pattern fig 15 as follows decreasing trends prevail throughout the sea of marmara for both mean significant wave height 6 and mean wave period 3 5 only in very limited areas near the coastline of the northern sea of marmara has increasing trends in the significant wave height and mean wave period with the values of 6 and 1 84 respectively fig 15a and c in contrary to mean wave parameters the intensity of the extreme events i e maximum significant wave height have a general increasing tendency throughout the sea of marmara except in the eastern part of the basin increasing trends are determined in the southern side of the sea of marmara with the value of 13 for the maximum significant wave height there is a decreasing trend in the eastern side of the sea of marmara for the maximum significant wave height 8 fig 15b except in the western part of the sea values range from about 3 to 0 5 the sea of marmara has a general downward trend with a value of 1 5 in terms of wave steepness fig 15d 6 2 3 local analyses detailed long term analyses were carried out for five reference points defined in section 4 representing different wind and wave features fig 1 and table 2 the reasons for the selection of these points were explained in the assessments of the wind climate section 4 as for the wave climate p1 is characterized by moderate significant wave height shorter wave period and lower variability p2 is characterized by larger significant wave height and mean wave period with low variability the significant wave height is moderate and the wave period is long at p3 with moderate variability p4 is represented by low significant wave heights with moderate mean wave periods and moderate variabilities significant wave height is lower at p5 with moderate mean wave periods and higher variabilities as seen in figs 13 figure 14 and fig 15 the annual mean values of significant wave height hm0 mean mean wave period tm mean wave steepness sm0 mean and the annual maximum values of significant wave height hm0 max at five selected reference points were evaluated for 40 years over the sea of marmara fig 16 fig 16 shows that the mean significant wave heights mean wave steepnesses and mean wave periods tend to decrease however the maximum mean significant wave heights tend to increase at p2 p3 and p5 there are decreasing trends for both the mean significant wave height and the maximum significant wave height at p1 the lowest changes in mean wave height among the locations analyzed are determined at p4 which is located at the southwestern part of the sea of marmara characterized with lower significant wave heights compared to other parts of the sea the values of trends at the five selected reference points are presented in table 6 wave roses to determine the directional behavior in the 40 year period at the five selected reference points are presented in fig 17 wave roses were generated in 16 directional and 6 wave height magnitude bands based on the swan model results for all reference points the dominant wave directions are northeasterly sectors e g ne at p1 nne at p2 nne at p3 ne at p4 and ene at p5 the dominant wave direction on the eastern part of the sea shifts from northeast towards the easterly direction e g p1 and p5 are located at the eastern part of the sea and the dominant wave directions are ne and ene respectively southwesterly directions may also be important seasonally see section 6 3 for details the eastern part of the basin p5 is also subjected to waves coming from the east direction fig 17e figs 8 and 1717 indicate that wind and wave directions follow a similar pattern directional and non directional nondir probability of exceedance within the 40 year period analyzed at five selected reference points is given in fig 18 waves coming from the north northeast have the highest probability of occurrence at p2 and p3 fig 18b and c northeast north northeast and south southwest have the highest probability at p1 fig 18a northeast has apparent probability at p4 fig 18d the highest probability of occurrence at p5 appears to be east and east northeast fig 18e 6 3 seasonal wave climate seasonal wave roses were examined at five selected reference points to determine seasonal directional behavior and seasonal dominant wave directions based on the 40 year wave data 1979 2018 obtained from the calibrated swan model forced with the era interim wind data figure a 2 in the winter season both northeasterly and southwesterly directions are dominating the wave climate at p1 and p2 especially at p1 the larger waves come from the south southwest in winter at p3 and p4 which are located in the western part of the basin the dominant wave directions are north northeast and northeast respectively southwesterly sectors are the secondary wave directions at these regions in winter in the eastern part of the basin p5 the wave climate is calmer compared to the other regions analyzed with easterly waves dominating the wave climate figure a 2a the secondary wave directions in winter southwesterly sector begin to appear more prominently in the spring season except for p3 where waves from north northeast are still dominant in spring figure a 2 b both in summer and autumn waves from north easterly sectors start dominating the wave climate with more energetic waves in autumn while the most prominent wave directions in the summer and autumn seasons are northeast and north northeast at p1 p4 the dominant wave direction at p5 is east northeast similar to the other seasons figure a 2c and d seasonal wave roses based on the validated swan model forced with the era interim data are determined to have similar patterns with the seasonal wind roses based on the era interim and cfrs wind data at all selected locations 6 4 storm analysis and extreme value distributions the possibility of stormy wave conditions in an enclosed sea or a lake is expected to be much lower than in the ocean which is valid for the most extreme ocean storms however it should be noted that distances of several hundred kilometers are sufficient to build a severe storm cavaleri et al 2018 currently many types of structures are designed for different purposes in coastal and offshore regions the force of storm waves usually inﬂuences the life span of these structures compelling engineers to design structures to withstand these destructive waves therefore the estimation of extreme waves is important for the design of coastal structures however prior to the phase of designing the probability of storm waves during the life of structures should be projected the probable wave height is estimated based on the return period of storms and the employed method is generally known as extreme value analysis fundamentally extreme value analysis aims to specify the probabilities of exceedance and non exceedance of wave heights and non exceedance probabilities are known as return periods far and abd wahab 2016 a 5 10 exceedance significant wave height is commonly adopted in scientiﬁc studies to deﬁne storm events angnuureng et al 2017 dorsch et al 2008 rangel buitrago et al 2011 splinter et al 2014 castelle et al 2015 for each selected point in this study the significant wave heights corresponding to 1 5 50 exceedance levels together with the maximum values are shown in fig 19 and table 7 as seen in table 7 extremes are more intense in the north and northeast of the basin p1 and p2 than in the southern part due to geographic formation which is compatible with the wind climate of the sea of marmara while the upper percentile wave heights at p2 are greater than those at p1 the greatest maximum significant wave height occurs similarly at p1 and p2 it is observed for all points that the wave heights corresponding to an exceeding probability of 5 are lower than 1 0 m table 7 which is quite low to represent the storm conditions in this study the storm wave condition is represented using the definitions given in the beaufort wind scale the threshold wind speed value for storm initiation can be taken as 10 m s based on the beaufort wind force scale the appearance of this condition at sea is defined as wave height exceeds 2 0 m which corresponds to a fresh breeze therefore in this study the significant wave height greater than 2 m is taken as the threshold value for storm initiation the number of hours during which the wave height exceeds this threshold value in a year is considered as storm duration similar to the significant wave height distribution yearly storm duration in the northern part of the sea of marmara up to 8 h per year is found to be greater than the other parts of the basin fig 20 large northeasterly waves with long storm durations in the northeastern and central parts of the sea of marmara indicate that these regions have strong severe and powerful wave conditions the storm durations in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the sea of marmara decrease to 0 hr and 2 hr respectively damage in coastal structures occurs when the wave forces exceed the design wave conditions the design wave height is determined by fitting annual maxima to the extreme value distribution in this study the weibull distribution which has the following cumulative distribution function expression for a random variable x is used 3 f x 1 exp x μ β α where μ is the location parameter β is the scale parameter and α is the shape parameter design wave levels of coastal structures are determined based on the return period of waves which is selected depending on the functional classification of structures according to the performance based design method for example normal port structures of economic and social significance using crane operations are generally designed for the return period of 100 years the design level for special structures such as the marine structures hosting nuclear power plants is the upper limit of the 70 confidence interval for the return period of 100 years yuksel et al 2020 goda 2010 fig 21 shows annual return periods of significant wave height based on the weibull distribution at the selected locations fig 1 including 70 confidence intervals dashed lines based on these graphs the design wave heights for the 100 year return period are found as 2 7 m 2 7 m 2 2 m 1 9 m and 2 2 m for p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 respectively although the 100 year wave heights are comparable at p1 and p2 the steeper slope of the distribution at p1 indicates that for lower return periods the corresponding wave heights are much smaller than those at p2 it is noteworthy that the design wave heights for the 100 year return period are smaller than the maximum wave heights of the 40 year wave hindcasting in the northern sea of marmara extreme value theory provides a statistical description of the maxima of a stationary process which assumes no change in the frequency of extremes over time the stationary method is constrained to the available historical data and therefore has limited application to longer periods rueda et al 2016 for example if the distribution of data in an interval exhibits a long tail extreme values in this interval may influence the t year return value for very large values of t mackay and jonathan 2020 the climate may be subjected to variations at different temporal scales that affect the frequency and intensity of climatic and hydrological extremes violating the assumption of stationarity mentaschi et al 2016 as observed in our data see the values of hm0 max in the year 2015 in figs 16 b 1 b 2 and b 3 therefore the wave climate in the northern part of the sea of marmara shows changes at time scales shorter than the design return period of many coastal structures previous studies that made similar observations in different regions in the world e g suh et al 2012 linked this behavior to the impact of global climate change in such cases statistical methods that account for the non stationary behavior of the climate system are needed although a general theory on non stationary extreme value analysis has not yet been formulated there are studies describing methodologies for the estimation of time varying extreme value distributions on non stationary time series based on a pragmatic approach that enhances the standard extreme value theory utilizing further statistical techniques mentaschi et al 2016 7 conclusion in this study long term assessments of wind and wave characteristics in the sea of marmara between the years 1979 2018 were performed wind data was provided from the ecmwf era interim and ncep cfsr databases and wave data was generated from the calibrated swan model forced with the era interim data the era interim and cfsr wind data were evaluated and compared with the measured wind data in the north of the basin the era interim wind data showed a slightly better agreement with measurements the accuracy of the calibrated swan model results was validated by the measured wave parameters at two stations the long term assessments of wind characteristics obtained from the era interim and cfsr wind data for the 40 years 1979 2018 over the sea of marmara are as follows especially the northern part and central regions of the sea of marmara are exposed to greater wind speeds for both datasets the 40 year average values and seasonal wind climate analyses show that the dominant winds blow from the northeast and the secondary effective wind direction is south west for both the era interim and cfsr wind data the southern sea of marmara is exposed to lower wind speeds blowing from northerly direction due to wind shadowing by islands and mountains in the southern part of the marmara basin in general wind speeds of cfsr data are slightly greater than those of the era interim data the long term wave results obtained from the calibrated and validated swan model forced with the era interim data run for 40 years 1979 2018 over the sea of marmara are as follows the 40 year averages of wave characteristics indicate that the northern side of the sea of marmara is exposed to higher waves according to the long term variability of the mean wave characteristics the northwestern part of the sea of marmara possesses lower variability the long term trend results show that the mean values of significant wave height and mean wave period have decreasing tendencies while the maximum values of significant wave height have increasing tendencies in most parts of the sea of marmara a general downward trend was obtained for wave steepness except for the western part of the sea of marmara the dominant wave direction in the sea of marmara is north northeast in the eastern part it shifts slightly eastward and prevailing wave directions become northeast and east northeast while both northeasterly and southwesterly directions are dominating the wave climate the larger waves come from the south southwest in the northern part of the sea of marmara observed in the winter season extremes are more intense in the north and northeast of the sea of marmara than the southern part due to the orographic formation of the marmara basin for future work it is suggested to use the most recent reanalysis wind data e g era5 with a higher spatial resolution for better representation of the coastline the diurnal cycle of wind and wave characteristics over the black sea should be addressed in future investigations

20849,during the installation of marine flexible pipelines components such as flexible risers umbilicals and cables subject to wave motion and ship yaw can cause torque on such pipelines in addition marine flexible pipelines are subjected to low tension at the touch down zone tdz which could result in the torsion instability phenomenon of flexible pipeline in the tdz thus forming a loop moreover when the tension on a marine flexible pipeline increases the radius of the loop decreases and kinks can form which could result in damage or fracture of the flexible pipeline affecting its normal operation in this study the formation mechanism of a flexible pipeline loop is thoroughly analyzed considering the end torsion tension and environmental loads the bending failure response surface function of the flexible pipeline is constructed considering the randomness of design parameters e g elastic modulus diameter and density and the probability of torsional instability of flexible pipeline is analyzed using both the first order second moment and monte carlo simulation methods both of which could give almost the same level of accuracy while the first order second moment method is computationally less expensive keywords flexible pipeline torsion instability reliability finite element analysis 1 introduction as a conveying channel a marine flexible pipeline is an important part of connecting a floating production platform and an underwater production system it has less bending stiffness and high axial stiffness meeting the requirement of axial tensile strength and resistance to bending deformation with large curvature resisting the external load by bending deformation a flexible pipeline can relieve the stress level at the top and bottom and is suitable for the harsh marine environment of the deep sea during the installation of marine flexible pipelines the touch down zone tdz is subjected to low tension and wave motion and ship yaw have a high torque effect on them which results in the torsion instability phenomenon of flexible pipelines in the tdz forming a loop when the tension on the marine flexible pipeline increases the radius of the loop decreases and kinks are formed resulting in damage or fracture of the flexible pipeline which affects its normal operation see fig 1 some scholars have studied the instability of flexible pipelines from the perspectives of theoretical analysis finite element analysis and experimental verification zajac 1962 and rosenthal 1975 attempted to solve the torsion problem using the elastic theory treating the cable as a planar elastic ring and analyzed the critical load and end displacement of the ring cable liu 1975 conducted theoretical analysis on the multi conductor cable model compared the theoretical analysis results with the experimental results and derived the greenhill formula which can predict the critical torque caused by the loop under static conditions ross 1977 proved that a stable loop can be formed in the cable when the tension is equal to half of the tensile load predicted by liu 1975 that the loop diameter of the instability analysis is uncertain and that the balanced loop formed in the cable is determined by the mechanical properties torsion and tension of the cable knapp 1979 studied spiral armored cables ignoring the reduction of spiral diameter due to contact between spirals assuming that the material of the spiral and core unit is distributed uniformly isotropically and with compression thus considering the tensile and torsional loads the spiral armored cable stiffness matrix is deduced yabuta 1984 analyzed the formation of the loop of spiral cables and deduced the greenhill formula it was found that when the radius of the loop was reduced in proportion to the diameter of the cable the kink was formed this result was verified by the data obtained from an experiment with sheathing optical fiber from the perspective of theoretical analysis yabuta 1982 studied a cable forming a loop under torque and upon forming a kink it was subjected to the effect of tension yabuta also carried out experiments with sheathing optical fiber to study the reopening of the cable neto and mattos 2013 took an umbilical as a research object considering the environmental loads such as self weight hydrostatic pressure platform motion wave and current ignored the self contact phenomenon and studied the formation of loops under the action of different torque loading rates neto and martins 2013 studied the instability of cable structures under different degrees of friction considering the bending load and torsional coupling as well as the nonlinear unilateral constraint between the cable and seabed opgard 2017 built a model of an umbilical with two different parameters and studied the torsion deformation of the umbilical and the critical torque under different installation environmental conditions by taking static load dynamic load platform movement and soil properties into consideration yan 2018 analyzed the strength failure of umbilical cable under dangerous working conditions considering the randomness of geometry and material properties the reliability analysis results show that the randomness of the geometry and material properties parameters has an important influence on the safety of umbilical cable in this paper the loop and kink formation are analyzed by simulation with orcaflex software which considers the wave and current movement and the torsional moment bending moment tension and rotation angle when the loop is formed are discussed moreover the bending failure response surface function of the flexible pipeline is constructed considering the randomness of design parameters e g elastic modulus diameter and density and the reliability of flexible pipeline is innovatively analyzed using both the first order second moment and monte carlo simulation methods 2 numerical model of the flexible pipeline the coordinate system and geometric position of the flexible pipeline are shown in fig 2 a flexible steel pipeline with an external diameter of 16 inches is used for overall torsion analysis and its specific structural and material parameters are given in table 1 neto 2014 as the floating production storage and offloading fpso platform moves periodically with waves the torque of pipelines cannot be fixed so it is difficult to study the effect of torque on the loop forming therefore the top of the pipeline is fixed to the fpso platform and the load is applied at the bottom of the flexible pipeline the streamline segment lies flat on the seabed the seabed friction and stiffness are shown in table 2 api 2008 the velocity of the current decreases with increasing sea depth the variation of current velocity with sea depth is shown in fig 3 in the research of neto et al 2013 it is concluded that if the torque loading is applied slowly at the pipeline the results are independent of the loading time and it is assumed that the torque load is applied from 0 to 120 s moreover the torque load varies with time linearly or nonlinearly dependent on the pipeline or the rotation of the fpso platform the more realistic condition would be nonlinear however in this work only the critical torque load when the loop forms is discussed so it is assumed that torque increase linearly with time neto and mattos 2013 natalia et al 2008 and the maximum torque is 10 000 kn m as shown in fig 4 in the work reported in this paper orcaflex software is used to establish a flexible pipeline in the form of free catenary layout and the overall dynamic response is analyzed by considering the boundary conditions and loads of flexible pipeline 3 dynamic analysis of the flexible pipeline the installation process of the flexible pipeline is dynamically simulated by orcaflex and torque is applied smoothly and linearly at the end of the pipeline as the torque is continuously applied the flexible pipeline undergoes bending deformation and begins to slip on the seabed at time t 105 s when the bending deformation reaches its maximum value the flexible pipeline will form a loop at the tdz as shown in fig 5 the torque is 8756 knm when the loop forms at t 105 s for the critical torque of beam instability under tension and torque in 1883 greenhill first derived an expression of spatial instability of beam structures under torsion and axial forces greenhill 1883 it is assumed that the material is linearly elastic the cross section is uniform and no deformation occurs the greenhill formulation is expressed as follows 1 m t 4 t e i where m t is the critical torque of beam instability t the subjected tension and i the moment of inertia of the beam the critical torque is 15 233 knm using the greenhill formulation as the end tension is 523 n at t 105 s the critical torque calculated by the greenhill expression is approximately 2 times the results calculated by orcaflex the difference between the numerical and analytical results might be explained by two points the first is that the greenhill criterion is derived assuming an elastic straight beam with infinite length so the elastic bending stiffness is utilized in the equation not considering the non linear behavior of the cable similar results can be found in the references neto and martins 2013 the other reason is that the wave current loads and friction between the flexible pipeline and seabed are considered in oraflex it is known from fig 4 that the maximum curvature happens in the tdz and the relation between the curvature with time in the tdz of the flexible pipeline is shown in fig 6 when the torque is continuously applied to the end the curvature is continuously increased and at t 105 s the curvature reaches a peak which indicates that the loop has formed when the end torque continues to be applied the curvature will experience a process of first decreasing and then increasing the curvature reaches a second peak at t 116 s which indicates that the loop forms again after the first loop fig 7 shows the bending moment m of flexible pipeline at different times in dynamic analysis the bending moment reaches large values at the top and tdz during the interval 858 41 m 1155 60 m mostly the bending moment at tdz is larger than that at the top point but it is also sometimes smaller than the result at the top point for example at t 58 s when there is no loop fig 7 the curve at t 105 s shows the bending moment m when a loop is forming and it reaches a maximum value of 13 000 knm at the tdz which means that the flexible pipeline has a large bending deformation when a loop forms that the loop absorbs torsion distortion in the loop formation process and that the process is actually the torsion strain energy transforming into bending strain energy fig 8 shows the bending moment in time domain at the 1018 m point where the pipeline first hits the sea floor after the maximum bending moment occurs at t 105 s it decreases sharply and reaches the second peak value at t 116 s so the loop forms again which can be seen in fig 6 fig 9 shows that the end tension changes with time and the tension reaches its largest value at approximately t 105 s and 116 s when the loop forms indicating that instability occurs fig 10 shows that the tension decreases along the length of pipeline and the tension is almost near zero around the tdz however when the loop is forming at t 105 s the tension at the tdz reaches its largest value and the tension direction is opposite both sides of the tdz 4 reliability analysis of flexible pipeline 4 1 analysis of bending radius of flexible pipeline torsion loop under different tensions fig 11 shows the variation of loop radius along the length of flexible pipeline under the action of end torque and different degrees of tension the figure also shows that the minimum bending radius appears in the tdz area and it decreases with increasing tension under different degrees of tension the minimum bending radius appears at different positions in the length of the flexible pipeline as the tension increases the position gradually moves to the right because the flexible pipeline slides on the seabed under the action of tension fig 12 shows the minimum bending radius of the flexible pipeline under different degrees of tension as can be seen from fig 11 the minimum bending radius of the flexible pipeline loop decreases with increasing tension and the rate at which the radius decreases increases with increasing tension the largest amount of tension subjected at the end of the flexible pipeline is 400 kn and the minimum bending radius is 6 52 m which is larger than the allowed minimum bending radius of the flexible pipeline in table 1 however if parameter randomness is considered the radius has the possibility to reach or become even smaller than the minimum radius and the flexible pipeline could incur damage or fail the reliability of the flexible pipeline is therefore analyzed in this paper 4 2 bending failure criterion of flexible pipeline from the above analysis it is known that the flexible pipeline could form a loop during operation and that it has large bending deformation in this paper the bending failure criteria of flexible pipelines are defined from the perspective of the minimum bending radius 2 r r m b r where r is the minimum radius of the loop and r m b r the allowed minimum bending radius for the flexible pipeline it is considered that when the bending radius of the loop is smaller than the minimum bending radius allowed by the normal operation of the flexible pipeline the flexible pipeline will fail therefore the function of the bending failure can be defined as follows 3 z g r r m b r r r m b r however due to human or environmental reasons in the process of design manufacturing installation and operation of flexible marine pipelines many uncertain factors are involved for example pipeline diameter wall thickness and environmental loads such as waves currents and floating platform movements these uncertainties have a great impact on the safe and reliable operation of flexible pipelines in this study the limiting sea conditions with a recurrence period of 100 years are used for analysis and only the random parameters of geometry and material properties are considered to analyze the torsion reliability of flexible pipeline 4 3 bending failure response surface function of the flexible pipeline in the reliability analysis of flexible pipeline bending failure the outside diameter size d and material performance parameters of flexible pipeline such as density ρ and elastic modulus e are all random variables the parameters are shown in table 5 and they are obtained from the orient cable company all the external loads are the same as in the preceding sections according to the results of the regression analysis shown in table 6 the three dimensional surface diagram of the influence of any two variables among the outside diameter size density and elastic modulus of the flexible pipeline on the bending radius can be obtained as shown in figs 13 15 fig 13 shows the effects of pipeline diameter and density on bending radius when the density is fixed the bending radius of the pipeline first increases and then decreases with increasing diameter similarly when the diameter of the pipeline is fixed the bending radius of the pipe also first decreases and then increases with increasing density fig 14 shows the effects of pipeline diameter and elastic modulus on bending radius when the elastic modulus is fixed the bending radius of the pipeline first increases and then decreases when the diameter is fixed the bending radius of the pipeline increases with increasing elastic modulus fig 15 shows the effects of elastic modulus and density on bending radius when the elastic modulus is fixed the bending radius of the pipeline first decreases and then increases when the density of the pipeline is fixed the bending radius of the pipeline increases with increasing elastic modulus from figs 13 15 it can be seen that the relationships between bending radius and diameter density and elastic modulus are not simple linear or power functions however the bending radius increases with increasing elastic modulus in general and it is because the increase of the elastic modulus will cause the increase of pipeline stiffness that the deformation will be inhibited however there is no definite increase or decrease of bending radius with diameter or density in the case of fixed elastic modulus the bending radius changes in a complex surface with the two variables that the bending radius is sensitive to diameter density and elastic modulus can be validated by the three aforementioned figures combined with the bending failure model the bending failure response surface function of the flexible pipeline is obtained 5 z 1066 119 5467 987 d 0 003 ρ 0 514 e 0 018 d ρ 1 250 d e 6 060 10 6 ρ e 6862 452 d 2 1 969 10 7 ρ 2 4 674 10 5 e 2 r m b r fig 16 shows the calibration chart of the response surface function from which it can be seen that the bending radius of sample points obtained by orcaflex calculation deviates from the bending radius value predicted by the response surface function in a small range and the maximum relative error value is 4 14 indicating that the response surface function has a good fitting effect 4 4 reliability calculation and comparison verification based on eq 5 constructed by the response surface method the first order second order moment method and monte carlo method with 1 000 000 sampling analyses are adopted to calculate the probability and reliability index of the bending failure the first order second order moment method is a method used to solve structural reliability using a mathematical model and it uses the mean and standard deviation to expand the designed function by linear taylor series expansion it is assumed that the random variables are independent of each other in the calculation only the first order moment i e mean value and second order moment i e standard deviation of each random variable are used and only the constant term and first order term in the taylor series expansion at the mean point or checking point are considered choi 2014 the monte carlo method which is also known as the stochastic simulation method does not need to consider the nonlinearity and the complexity of the response surface function surface and it can solve reliability problems intuitively accurately and efficiently during the structural reliability analysis using the monte carlo method the distribution type of random variables will be determined first and then the mathematical models are constructed and simulation experiments are carried out finally the reliability distribution mean value and standard deviation of the function are solved from the perspective of probability statistics the results of the two methods are shown in table 7 fig 17 shows the frequency distribution histogram of the function simulated by the monte carlo method and the shaded area is the probability of torsion failure of the flexible pipeline by comparing the results calculated by the first order second order moment and monte carlo methods the relative errors of the reliability index and reliability are 3 31 and 0 04 respectively and the relative error is small it could be concluded that the two methods could give almost the same level of accuracy while the first order second moment method is computationally lesser expensive yan 2018 performed a reliability analysis of a steel tube umbilical cable cross section using both the first order second order moment and monte carlo methods and the reliability was 0 9971 and 0 9970 respectively the relative error between the two methods is 0 01 while it is 0 02 in this paper it could be said that the reliability results in this paper have good consistency with those of yan 2018 as can be seen from table 1 under the action of waves currents torque and tension subjected on the end torsion instability occurs during marine flexible pipeline operation and a loop will form the reliability is 0 9986 and the reliability index is 2 99 based on the dynamic analysis with limiting sea conditions which is smaller than 4 2 gb 50153 2008 2008 the requirement for the engineering structure and some measures should be taken to improve the reliability during flexible pipeline operation although the minimum bending radius is larger than the allowed minimum bending radius criterion when the loop forms the reliability could not satisfy the requirement when the randomness of design parameters material properties parameters and pipeline geometric parameters is considered which is often ignored during the design of a pipeline thus reliability analysis is important for marine structures with high reliability requirements 5 conclusions during installation flexible pipelines are subjected to torque and tension which could cause loops at the tdz in this paper the mechanical parameters of flexible pipeline are analyzed when the loop is formed and based on response surface construction theory a flexible pipeline failure criterion is constructed in addition the failure reliability is calculated the conclusions drawn from the results are the following 1 the loop in the pipeline forms when it is subjected to torsion the tension is the lowest at the point of loop along the flexible pipeline and the bending moment is the largest at the point of loop which means that the processes are actually the loop absorbing torsion distortion in the formation process and the torsion strain energy transforming into bending strain energy 2 the pipeline radius decreases with increasing tension and the pipeline could incur failure because the minimum radius is smaller than the critical radius if parameter randomness is considered the bending failure function of the flexible pipeline is obtained based on response surface construction theory 3 the reliability of flexible pipeline is calculated based on the first order second order moment and monte carlo methods and both methods could give almost the same level of accuracy while the first order second moment method is computationally less expensive the reliability index is smaller than that required and several measures should be taken to improve reliability during flexible pipeline operation although the design results of flexible pipeline based on the traditional deterministic method meet the design requirements pipeline failure could occur because of parameter randomness therefore it is necessary to carry out reliability analysis for

streamline segment lies flat on the seabed the seabed friction and stiffness are shown in table 2 api 2008 the velocity of the current decreases with increasing sea depth the variation of current velocity with sea depth is shown in fig 3 in the research of neto et al 2013 it is concluded that if the torque loading is applied slowly at the pipeline the results are independent of the loading

expressed as follows 1 m t 4 t e i where m t is the critical torque of beam instability t the subjected tension and i the moment of inertia of the beam the critical torque is 15 233 knm using the greenhill formulation as the end tension is 523 n at t 105 s the critical torque calculated by the greenhill expression is approximately 2 times the results calculated by orcaflex the difference

under different degrees of tension the minimum bending radius appears at different positions in the length of the flexible pipeline as the tension increases the position gradually moves to the right because the flexible pipeline slides on the seabed under the action of tension fig 12 shows the minimum bending radius of the flexible pipeline under different degrees of tension as can be seen from fig 11 the minimum bending radius of the flexible pipeline loop decreases with increasing tension and the rate at which the radius decreases increases with increasing tension the largest amount of tension subjected at the end of the flexible pipeline is 400 kn and the minimum bending radius is 6 52 m which is larger than the allowed minimum bending radius of the flexible pipeline in table 1 however if parameter randomness is considered the radius has the possibility to reach or become even smaller than the minimum radius and the flexible pipeline could incur damage or fail the reliability of the flexible pipeline is therefore analyzed in this paper 4 2 bending failure criterion of flexible pipeline from the above analysis it is known that the flexible pipeline could form a

diameter of the pipeline is fixed the bending radius of the pipe also first decreases and then increases with increasing density fig 14 shows the effects of pipeline diameter and elastic modulus on bending radius when the elastic modulus is fixed the bending radius of the pipeline first increases and then decreases when the diameter is fixed the bending radius of the pipeline increases with increasing elastic modulus fig 15 shows the effects of elastic modulus and density on bending radius when the elastic modulus is fixed the bending radius of the pipeline first decreases and then increases when the density of the pipeline is fixed the bending radius of the pipeline increases with increasing elastic modulus from figs 13 15 it can be seen that the relationships between bending radius and diameter density and elastic modulus are not simple linear or power functions however the bending radius increases with increasing elastic modulus in general and it is because the increase of the elastic modulus will cause the increase of pipeline stiffness that the deformation will be inhibited however there is no definite increase or decrease of bending radius with diameter or density in the case of fixed elastic modulus the bending radius changes in a complex surface with the two variables that the bending radius is sensitive to diameter density and elastic modulus can be validated by the three aforementioned figures combined with the bending failure model the bending failure response surface function of the flexible pipeline is obtained 5 z 1066 119 5467 987 d 0 003 ρ

bending radius of sample points obtained by orcaflex calculation deviates from the bending radius value predicted by the response surface function in a small range and the maximum relative error value is 4 14 indicating that the response surface function has a good fitting effect 4 4 reliability calculation and comparison verification based on eq 5 constructed by the response surface method the first order second order moment method and monte carlo method with 1 000 000 sampling analyses are adopted to calculate the probability and reliability index of the bending failure the first order second order moment method is a method used to solve structural reliability using a mathematical model and it uses the mean and standard deviation to expand the designed function by linear taylor series expansion it is assumed that the random variables are independent of each other in the calculation only the first order moment i e mean value and second order moment i e standard deviation of each random variable are used and only the constant term and first order term in the taylor series expansion at the mean point or checking point are considered choi 2014 the monte carlo method which is also known as the stochastic simulation method does not need to consider the nonlinearity and the complexity of the response surface function surface and it can solve reliability problems intuitively accurately and efficiently during the structural reliability analysis using the monte carlo method the distribution type of random variables will be determined first and then the mathematical models are constructed and simulation experiments are carried out finally the reliability distribution mean value and standard deviation of the function are solved from the perspective of probability statistics the results of the two methods are shown in table 7 fig 17 shows the frequency distribution histogram of the function simulated by the monte carlo method and the shaded area is the probability of torsion failure of the flexible pipeline by comparing the results calculated by the first order second order moment and monte carlo methods the relative errors of the reliability index and reliability are 3 31 and 0 04 respectively and the relative error is small it could be concluded that the two methods could give almost the same level of accuracy while the first order second moment method is computationally lesser expensive yan 2018 performed a reliability analysis of a steel tube umbilical cable cross section using both the first order second order moment and monte carlo methods and the reliability was 0 9971 and 0 9970 respectively the relative error between the two methods is 0 01 while it is 0 02 in this paper it could be said that the reliability results in this paper have good consistency with those of yan 2018 as can be seen from table 1 under the action of waves currents torque and tension subjected on the end torsion instability occurs during marine flexible pipeline operation and a loop will form the reliability is 0 9986 and the reliability index is 2 99 based on the dynamic analysis with limiting sea conditions which is smaller than 4 2 gb 50153 2008 2008 the requirement for the engineering structure and some measures should be taken to improve the reliability during flexible pipeline operation although the minimum bending radius is larger than the allowed minimum bending radius criterion when the loop forms the reliability could not satisfy the requirement when the randomness of design parameters material properties parameters and pipeline geometric parameters is considered which is often ignored during the design of a pipeline thus reliability analysis is important for marine structures with high reliability requirements 5 conclusions during installation flexible pipelines are subjected to torque and tension which could cause loops at the tdz in this paper the mechanical parameters of flexible pipeline are analyzed when the loop is formed and based on response surface construction theory a flexible pipeline failure criterion is constructed in addition the failure reliability is calculated the conclusions drawn from the results are the following 1 the loop in the pipeline forms when it is subjected to torsion the tension is the lowest at the point of loop along the flexible pipeline and the bending moment is the largest at the point of loop which means that the processes are actually the loop absorbing torsion distortion in the formation process and the torsion strain energy transforming into bending strain energy 2 the pipeline radius decreases with increasing tension and the pipeline could incur failure because the minimum radius is smaller than the critical radius if parameter randomness is considered the bending failure function of the flexible pipeline is obtained based on response surface construction theory 3 the reliability of flexible pipeline is calculated based on the first order second order moment and monte carlo methods and both methods could give almost the same level of accuracy while the first order second moment method is computationally less expensive the reliability index is smaller than that required and several measures should be taken to improve reliability during flexible pipeline operation although the design results of flexible pipeline based on the traditional deterministic method meet the design requirements pipeline failure could occur because of parameter randomness therefore it is necessary to carry out reliability analysis for
