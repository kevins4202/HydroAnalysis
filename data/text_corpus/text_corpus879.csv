4395,combining horizontal drilling together with hydraulic fracturing greatly improves the economic viability of exploiting a tight reservoir while the stress sensitive effect raises the significant difficulty to accurately evaluate its well performance in this paper a semi analytical model is proposed to evaluate transient pressure behaviour of a multi fractured horizontal well mfhw in a naturally fractured reservoir with an arbitrary boundary and different fracture networks under stress sensitive effect more specifically the boundary element method coupled with the pedrosa s transform formulation is used to obtain accurate solutions of the nonlinear equations incorporated with stress sensitive effect in an arbitrary shaped reservoir with single zone or two zone matrix subsystems meanwhile the laplace transform finite difference method can be utilized to semi analytically deal with the nonlinear fracture subsystems consisting of primary secondary and natural fractures by dividing complex fracture networks into small fracture segments the convergence skin effect is then introduced to represent the radial flow pattern in hydraulic fractures near a horizontal wellbore not only can the effects of stress sensitivity in the matrix and different fracture subsystems be respectively examined but also the corresponding pressure responses together with pressure derivative curves are obtained such coupled theoretical formulations have been verified and then extended for field applications the semi analytical solution is found to be more accurate and reasonable than the solution with the uniform permeability modulus while the stress sensitivity has a dominant impact on the intermediate and late time flow periods the convergence skin effect can be aggravated in the late time period by considering the inherent stress sensitivity in a hydraulic fracture especially at low fracture conductivity based on the sensitivity analysis associated with different networks the initial fracture conductivity in primary and secondary fractures imposes a great impact on the early stage bilinear flow and fluid feed regimes while the initial fracture conductivity in natural fractures makes a difference to the transient pressure response in the transition flow regime as the minimum fracture conductivity in the primary fractures decreases such an influence becomes more dominant during the late time flow period however the minimum fracture conductivity in secondary and natural fractures has an inappreciable effect on the flow regime in the late time flow period the effect of boundary shape becomes more obvious on the type curves especially for a relatively small reservoir compared with the size of a horizontal well intercepted by multiple hydraulic fractures for a reservoir with two zone systems the smaller the mobility ratio in the two zones is the earlier the boundary dominated flow in the outer zone will commence not only does this study facilitate understanding the respective contribution of stress sensitivity and convergence skin effect on the well production but also the newly proposed models can be applied to optimally

performance of horizontal wells with multiple fractures in an unconventional reservoir heidari sureshjani and clarkson 2015 wei et al 2019 jiang et al 2020a liu et al 2020 not only can hydraulic fracturing generate high conductivity flow paths to greatly improve the seepage capacity and oil production but also induce complex and interconnected fracture networks with arbitrary boundaries resulting in more complex flow behaviour chen et al 2017 wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020a numerous attempts have been previously made to evaluate transient pressure behaviour on the basis of simplified fracture networks e g bi wing fracture reservoir geometries e g regular reservoir boundaries wang 2014 wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019a 2019b and multi well pads meng et al 2020 due to the fact that the stress sensitive and the convergence skin effects have not been taken into account these mathematical models are limited in extensive applications physically not only can the influence of stress sensitivity lead to an extremely quick decline of production and pressure in an unconventional reservoir but also it makes more difficult to forecast the performance of horizontal wells intercepted by multistage hydraulic fractures lee et al 2010 teklu et al 2018 jiang et al 2020a 2020b also the extra pressure drop resulted from radial flow near a horizontal well should not be regarded as a constant where stress sensitive effect is considered to consider stress sensitivity on well performance a permeability modulus is introduced to represent its effect within fractures assuming that its impact on the matrix is neglected zhao and du 2019 such an assumption may not be physically correct under certain conditions therefore it is a challenging task to evaluate the performance of a multi fractured horizontal well mfhw in an unconventional reservoir with an arbitrary boundary and different fracture networks with consideration of stress sensitive effect numerous efforts have been made to describe transient behaviour in a naturally fractured reservoir under stress sensitive effect by applying dual porosity models warren and root 1963 chen et al 2008 zhao and du 2019 asadi et al 2020 and or assuming regular boundary shapes xu et al 2015 jiang et al 2019a 2019b for the former the dual porosity model cannot be applied to accurately describe flow behaviour in an unconventional reservoir because of its oversimplification wei et al 2019 while it is suitable for a few specific cases of vertical wells rasoulzadeh and kuchuk 2019 as for the latter an irregularly stimulated reservoir volume srv is usually generated because of the interconnection of the complex fracture networks and natural fractures activated by fracturing operations which has been further confirmed by microseismic events fisher et al 2002 wang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 wu et al 2019 physically transient pressure behaviour is mainly dominated by the boundary effect in the late time period jia et al 2017b thus such simplifications may lead to incorrect solutions under certain conditions zhao et al 2016 in this work a reservoir with two zone systems is applied to consider the difference on the properties i e permeability of an unstimulated reservoir volume usrv and a srv with an arbitrarily shaped interface recently the boundary element method bem which is based on the fundamental i e free space green s function has been widely applied to simulate flow behaviour in a reservoir with arbitrarily shaped boundaries idorenyin and shirif 2017 2018 jia et al 2017b to be more specific the boundary integral equation can be applied to estimate the properties of reservoir boundaries by discretizing boundaries into small elements and then obtain the accurate solutions inside the domain meanwhile the bem has been found to be effective in reducing the computational expenses for an irregularly shaped reservoir compared with the traditional finite difference element methods since only the boundary is divided into small elements without discretizing the domain kikani and horne 1992 wang and zhang 2009 as for complex fracture networks inside the domain the laplace transform finite difference method ltfdm has been incorporated in the bem to describe flow behaviour in hydraulic fractures with arbitrary geometries and conductivity distributions jia et al 2017a 2017b as for a reservoir with an irregular shape and complex fracture networks the traditional solution methods e g the finite fourier cosine transform method would find their limitations to deal with such a geometric constraint zhao and du 2019 by using the bem and ltfdm in our study the newly developed theoretical models can be used to deal with a reservoir with an arbitrary boundary and more complex fracture networks e g the opening fissure fracture network offn and fractal like fracture network flfn while the ltfdm allows us to incorporate the actual natural fractures induced in the srv within which mobility ratio is introduced to indirectly represent the influence of the relatively small natural fractures in most cases the traditional bi wing fracture network bwfn is commonly utilized to evaluate the performance of hydraulically fractured vertical wells zhang and yang 2014 and horizontal wells idorenyin and shirif 2018 wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019a 2019b in practice other fracture networks see fig 1 may be generated due to stress anisotropy such as the offn and flfn chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2021 to have a successful hydraulic fracturing operation propping agents are mainly pumped into primary fractures to prevent the conductivity from decreasing according to an increase in the net effective stress during production luo et al 2018 therefore the conductivity of primary fractures mainly depends on the characteristic of proppants while that of secondary fractures relies on the characteristics of both proppants and rock due to the fact that the secondary fractures are partially filled with proppants zhou et al 2019 for natural fractures the conductivity depends on the reservoir properties e g pore shape size and distribution since natural fractures located in relatively remote places cannot connect with the primary fractures cho et al 2013 teklu et al 2018 therefore the primary secondary and natural fractures should have different permeability moduli minimum fracture conductivities and initial fracture conductivities because of their different characteristics lee et al 2010 luo et al 2018 in addition the non uniform fracture geometry induced by the hydraulic fracturing operations imposes a great impact on the fracture conductivity jiang et al 2020c so far no attempts have been made to consider simultaneously initial fracture conductivities minimum fracture conductivities and permeability moduli for different subsystems e g primary fractures secondary fractures and natural fractures the matrix in different fracture networks e g bwfn offn and flfn in this paper a semi analytical model combining the bem and the ltfdm has been proposed and verified to examine stress sensitive effect on the transient pressure behaviour of an mfhw well in an unconventional reservoir with different fracture networks and arbitrarily shaped boundaries more specifically the bem is employed to depict the transient fluid flow inside the matrix domain and the ltfdm is utilized to describe the flow behaviour in different hydraulic fracture networks to take the convergence skin effect into account fluid flow in primary fractures is divided into darcy linear flow and darcy radial flow while the nonlinear equation in the laplace domain is solved with an iteration method and then its solution in the real space is determined by employing the stehfest algorithm the new model has been validated with data collected from the literature and then extended its application to a field case by taking different characteristics i e initial fracture conductivities minimum fracture conductivities and permeability moduli of primary fractures secondary fractures natural fractures and matrix into account not only can such newly developed models be used to describe transient pressure behaviour of an mfhw in a tight formation with an arbitrary boundary and different fracture networks but also effects of stress sensitivity and convergence skin are considered simultaneously to improve the accuracy of evaluating well performance the paper is presented and organized as follows first the general mathematical models are presented on the basis of the bem and ltfdm secondly the pedrosa s transform formulation is incorporated into the model to eliminate the strong nonlinearity thirdly the solutions obtained by the iteration method are analyzed and compared and finally conclusions and discussions are presented 2 mathematical formulations as illustrated in fig 2 a a horizontal well intercepted by multistage fractures is considered in an unconventional reservoir with box shaped boundaries and discrete natural fractures as a base model which is then extended to a reservoir with two zone systems i e srv and usrv see fig 2 b the following assumptions are briefly described as 1 the reservoir is homogenous and isotropic with constant initial pressure and thickness while the two zone system is assigned with different permeabilities arbitrarily shaped interface and boundaries 2 hydraulic fractures hfs are the only pathway to connect the matrix and the horizontal wellbore 3 the darcy radial flow is assumed to occur from the nearest fracture segment to the wellbore see fig 3 and the flow rate in the radial flow region of different fractures is assumed to be same 4 the drainage radius in the radial flow zone can be assumed as one half of the formation thickness when the horizontal well is located in the middle of payzone mukherjee and economides 1991 5 the wellbore storage effect is neglected 6 the fractures consist of three forms i e primary secondary and natural fractures and they have different initial conductivities minimum conductivities and stress sensitive coefficients also the fracture networks include three patterns i e bwfn offn and flfn and 7 the horizontal well production is constant in this work the superparametric bem which assumes that the boundary properties i e pressure or flux are constant along each element is applied to obtain accurate pressure responses with a certain amount of boundary elements idorenyin and shirif 2018 the fluid flowing in the primary fractures consists of darcy radial flow see fig 3 purple arrows from the nearest segment to the wellbore and darcy linear flow see fig 3 blue arrows in the other segments there is only darcy linear flow in the second and natural fractures in discretized fractures all segments with equal length can be considered as a surface source with a uniform flow flux which is different from that in other fracture elements 2 1 governing equations 2 1 1 matrix subsystem according to the relationship between permeability and pressure drop during the production process the permeability modulus is incorporated into the governing equation to describe pressure behaviour in the matrix subsystem under stress sensitive effect then the diffusion equation is expressed as 1 k mi μ e γ m p i p m 2 p m x 2 2 p m y 2 γ m p m x 2 γ m p m y 2 1 h i 1 n f q fi v i δ u v i ϕ m c tm p m t where kmi is initial matrix permeability t is real time μ is fluid viscosity γ m is permeability modulus in the matrix ϕ m is matrix porosity c tm is matrix compressibility p m is matrix pressure p i is initial pressure q fi is the production rate from matrix to the i th segment in the fractures n f is the number of segments of the entire fracture networks v i is any point on the surface of the i th segment in the fracture network u is any point in the domain h is the formation thickness and δ is the dirac delta function which is defined as 2 δ u v i 0 u v i u v i which satisfies the following constraint 3 ω f u δ u v i d ω f v i the initial and boundary conditions can be described as 4a p m x y t 0 p i 4b p m n γ 0 closed boundary with the nondimensionalized variables defined in appendix a the nondimensionalized form of eq 1 can be obtained as 5 e γ md p md 2 p md x d 2 2 p md y d 2 γ md p md x d 2 γ md p md y d 2 2 π i 1 n f q fdi v di δ u d v di p md t d and the initial and boundary conditions 6a p md x d y d t d 0 0 6b p md n γ 0 closed boundary it is difficult to obtain the analytical solution for the aforementioned governing equation eq 5 inside the matrix domain due to the strong nonlinearity derived from the influence of stress sensitivity therefore the pedrosa s transform formulation is applied to linearize the diffusion equations by replacing pressure with a new dimensionless variable ξ md in the matrix pedrosa 1986 i e 7 p md 1 γ md ln 1 γ md ξ md the parameter perturbation in γ md can be defined in the form of the power series 8 ξ md ξ m d 0 γ md ξ m d 1 γ md 2 ξ m d 2 2 9 1 1 γ md ξ md 1 γ md ξ m d 1 γ md 2 ξ m d 2 2 given that the value of γ md in the matrix subsystem is usually very small the term γ md ξ md lies between zero and unity and thus a zero order term is able to meet the practical accuracy requirement at a reasonable range of pressure drop wang 2014 therefore eq 5 is transformed into the following forms of the pedrosa s transformed variable 10 2 ξ m d 0 x d 2 2 ξ m d 0 y d 2 2 π i 1 n f q fdi v di δ u d v di ξ m d 0 t d and the initial and boundary conditions 11a ξ m d 0 x d y d t d 0 0 11b ξ m d 0 n γ 0 closed boundary for a homogenous reservoir the bem formulation in the laplace space can be employed to obtain the pressure differential at any point in the matrix subsystem for a well posed problem the boundary conditions i e pressure or flux need to be determined in advance therefore the reservoir boundary is discretized into small segments in the positive direction i e counter clockwise direction to calculate the unknown boundary data and the solution of boundary integral equation in a naturally fractured reservoir with an arbitrary boundary can be written as 12 θ 2 π ξ m d 0 r dk s 1 2 π j 1 n b γ j g u dj r dk s ξ m d 0 u dj s n ξ m d 0 u dj s g u dj r dk s n d γ i 1 n f q fd v di g v di r dk s where r dk is the midpoint in the k th

total number of boundary elements and θ is the internal angle between the two neighboring discrete elements i e θ 2 π if r dk is inside the domain θ π if r dk is a point on the boundary element the

of the second kind with a zero order eqs 12 and 13 can be converted into matrix form as 15a a ξ b ξ c q o 15b a 1 ξ b 1 ξ c 1 q ξ fd where 16a a g 11 g 12 g 1 n b g 21 g 22 g 2 n b g n b 1 g n b 2 g n

1999 chen et al 2008 wang 2014 wu et al 2019 to describe the pressure response in the stress sensitive fracture subsystem zhang et al 2014 according to the experimental measurements it is observed that the minimum fracture conductivity tends to be a nonzero definite value following the decrease of the net pore pressure weaver et al 2010 the nonzero definite value mainly depends on the type and concentration of proppants in the primary fractures luo et al 2018 while the minimum conductivity in secondary and natural fractures partially and fully relies on the reservoir properties 17 c f p t c

fracture patterns c f p t min is minimum conductivity in different fracture patterns and γ f p t is permeability modulus in different fracture patterns pt p i s c n a refers to the primary fractures secondary fractures and natural fractures respectively the governing equation in the linear flow zone within the stress sensitive fracture subsystem is given as 18 l τ f p t p f l μ q fi k f w f h ϕ f μ c tf k f p f t where k f is the fracture permeability w f is the fracture width l is the distance along the fracture direction q fi is the flux form matrix to the i th fracture segment ϕ f is the porosity in fractures c tf is the fracture compressibility and τ f is a function which can be define as follows 19 τ f p t k f p t min k fi p t 1 k f p t min k fi p t exp γ f p t p i p f and the initial and boundary conditions 20a p f x y t 0 p i 20b p f l l t i p 0 20c τ f p i p f l l r l μ q b k f w f h where the term l r l represents the interface between the radial and linear flow zones in the primary fractures the total pressure drop within a primary fracture consists of a linear portion and a radial portion see fig 3 the governing equation in the radial flow zone of the primary fracture subsystem with consideration of the impact of stress sensitivity is expressed as 21 p rl p w b μ q 2 π k f w f τ f r n f ln h 2 r w where r w is the wellbore radius p rl is the pressure at the interface between radial flow zone and linear flow zone p w is wellbore pressure n f is the number of primary fractures and τ f r is the coefficient in the radial flow zone the dimensionless form for the governing eq 18 in the linear flow zone can be rewritten as follows 22 l d τ fd p t p fd l d π q fdi c fd 1 c η d p fd t d and the initial and boundary conditions 23a p fd x d y d t d 0 0 23b

exp γ m p fd 27 τ fd p t b c fd p t min c fdi p t exp γ m p fd 1 c fd p t min c fdi p t exp γ fd p t γ md p fd applying the pedrosa s substitution method to replace dimensionless pressure in the fractures the pedrosa s equation can be defined as follows 28 p fd 1 γ md ln 1 γ md ξ fd therefore eqs 22 and 25 as well as boundary conditions eqs 23 in the laplace space can be written as follows 29a l d τ fd p t b ξ fd l d π q fdi c fd s c η d ξ fd 29b ξ wd ξ rld h d c fd τ fd r b n f s ln h d 2 r wd and the initial and boundary conditions 30a ξ fd l d l d t i p 0 30b τ f d pt b ξ f d l d l d r l 2 π c fd s on the basis of the pressure continuity condition the pressure and flux at the interface should be continuous between the matrix and the fractures the equation can then be described as 31 p fd x d y d s p md x d y d s subsequently the pedrosa s substitution method is applied to obtain solution in the laplace domain eq 31 becomes 32 ξ fd x d y d s ξ md x d y d s in this work the ltfdm is applied to describe transient pressure behaviour in the fracture subsystem the governing equation is required to discretize space in the laplace domain instead of the time discretization in the real space by eliminating the time discretization the ltfdm has its advantages to significantly maintain the convergence and stability in terms of computing expenses compared with traditional governing equation in real space moridis et al 1994 then for the several scenarios consisting of different fractured segments the fluid equations in fracture subsystem can be transformed to the finite difference form on the basis of the star delta transformation in the case of the fracture segment joined to another segment at one side see fig 4 a the finite difference equation is derived as 33 t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i 1 i t d i i 1 α di ξ fdi t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 β di q fdi 0 the second scenario of the fracture segment near the crack tip is illustrated in fig 4 b and the equation is given as 34 t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i i 1 α di ξ fdi β di q fdi 0 for the fracture segment adjacent to the radial flow zone see fig 4 c 35 λ di ξ rld λ di t d i i 1 α di ξ fdi t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 β di q fdi 0 where 36a t d i 1 i λ di 1 λ di λ di 1 λ di 36b λ di 2 c fdi p t τ fd p t b δ l d pt 36c α di s c fdi p t δ l d p t c η d i 36d β di π δ l d p t where δ l d p t is the dimensionless length of a segment for different fracture patterns for the case of a complex fracture network more than two fractures are connected with each other see fig 4d and 4e which increases the complexity of the solution the star delta transformation has been found as an efficient way to treat fluid flow in the situation by removing the intermediate intersection associated with the other involved fracture segments king 1989 jia et al 2017a 2017b it is reasonable to ignore the impact of the intersection in the flowing model since its volume is relatively small compared with that of a fracture segment four interconnected fracture segments in fig 4 e are taken as an example the transmissibility of the i th and j th segments is defined as follows 37 t di j λ di λ dj k 1 4 λ dk fig 4 d demonstrates the scenario of three interconnected fracture segments the flow equation is given as the following form after the application of the star delta transformation 38 t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i i 1 t d i i 1 t d i i 2 α di ξ fdi t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i 2 i ξ fdi 2 β di q fdi 0 similarly take four interconnected fracture segments as an example shown in fig 4e the governing equation changes to the following form after adopting the star delta transformation method 39 t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i i 1 t d i i 1 t d i i 2 t d i i 3 α di ξ fdi t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i 2 i ξ fdi 2 t d i 3 i ξ fdi 3 β di q fdi 0 therefore a closed linear system is employed to depict the fluid flow within the discrete fracture system a hydraulic fracture stage is taken as example to show the result of discretization in fig 5 the closed linear system can be converted in the form of matrix which correlates dimensionless pressure and flow flux within the fracture network 40 a 2 ξ fd b 2 ξ r l d c 2 q o where ξ fd ξ f d 1 ξ f d 2 ξ fd n f o is a zero vector containing n f elements a 2 is n f n f vector which elements resulted from the finite difference form of governing equations mentioned previously b 2 is an n f 1 vector which the elements for fracture segments connected to the interface of radial flow zone are nonzero and c 2 is a n f n f diagonal matrix taking the prescribed production rate requirement into account the constraint condition can be defined as follows 41 i r l λ di ξ fdi ξ rld 2 π s where the term i r l represents i th segment adjacent to the radial flow zone in the primary fractures its matrix form can be expressed as follows 42 b 2 t ξ fd d ξ r l d e where b 2 t is the transposed matrix of b 2 d is a vector containing an element equals i r l λ di and e is a vector with an element equals 2 π s 2 1 3 coupled solutions for the matrix and fracture models according to the constraint equation the system of nonlinear equations can then be converted into the matrix expression i e 43 a b c o o a 1 b

time step and repeat steps 2 7 until maximum test time has been reached the final solution ξ wd in the real time domain can be determined by using the stehfest numerical inversion stehfest 1970 by applying the pedrosa s substitution method eq 28 we can then determine the bottomhole transient pressure of the horizontal well with a stress sensitive fracture network i e 45 p wd 1 γ nfd ln 1 γ md ξ

wellbore storage in the laplace domain due to time and space constraints 3 model validation 3 1 without convergence and boundary effects to validate the newly developed models the double logarithmic type curves of a horizontal well with three symmetrical fractures i e bwfn in an infinite reservoir under stress sensitive effect is compared with results reported in the literature jiang et al 2019a the main parameters are c fdi 100 γ f 2 00 and c fd min c fdi 0 100 in order to ignore the convergence effect the thickness is assumed to approximate to the diameter of wellbore as seen from fig 7 a there exists an excellent agreement between the results obtained from the new models in this work and the solutions from the predictive model provided by jiang et al 2019a through the long time period confirming the reliability of the proposed model in this work 3 2 with convergence and boundary effects the transient solutions of a horizontal well with two stage hfs in a stress sensitive reservoir

solutions in this work show a good agreement in comparison with the results from the numerical simulator confirming the reliability of the newly proposed method in addition to dealing with the strong nonlinearity not only can the newly predictive model be used to obtain accurate and consistent solutions for a naturally fractured reservoir with an arbitrary boundary but also it takes both the stress sensitive effect and convergence skin contribution into account 4 results and discussion 4 1 transient flow behaviour as shown in fig 8 the double logarithmic type curves for a horizontal well with two stage hfs in a reservoir with natural fractures and a box shaped boundary are determined three different fracture networks i e bwfn offn and flfn together with only one natural fracture network are considered in this work the basic parameters are c fdi p t 30 x de y de 50 and h d 0 10 as can be seen seven flow regimes are identified i e 1 bilinear flow in this period the pressure mainly decreases in the domain of primary and secondary fractures and surrounding matrix which is identified via a one quarter slope on the pressure derivative curve cinco ley et al 1978 2 fluid feed in this period most of the fluid flows though the secondary fractures which is discerned from a slight increase of pressure derivative curve between the bilinear and linear flow regimes chen et al 2017 3 linear flow it is identified via a one half slope on the type curve in this period the fluid flows perpendicularly into the primary and secondary fractures resulting in the propagation of the pressure drop in the matrix domain idorenyin and shirif 2017 4 early radial flow for the bwfn the existence of this flow regime on the type curve mainly depends on the fracture spacing and length raghavan et al 1997 while the interference between fractures i e offn and flfn occurs earlier due to the impact of secondary fractures 5 compound linear flow in this period the interference between the fractures becomes more obvious which can be observed by parallel straight lines on the pressure derivative curves wang 2014 6 transition flow in this period the pressure wave reaches natural fractures and fluid starts to flow into natural fractures which is identified by a similar phenomenon i e dip on the pressure derivative curve compared with the typical dual porosity model the period of this flow regime mainly depends on the distribution of natural fractures and the size of dip on the type curve is determined with the properties e g size and number of the discrete natural fractures jiang et al 2020a 7 pseudoradial flow during the period the pressure derivative response will be marked as a constant value in the late time period it can be identified by a unity slope on the pressure derivative curve because of the boundary effect jia et al 2017b the smaller the reservoir boundary is the earlier the pseudoradial flow will commence wei et al 2019 4 2 comparison with uniform permeability modulus numerous attempts have been made to define the uniform permeability modulus to describe the inherent stress sensitivity in a fractured reservoir based on the pedrosa s substitution method wang 2014 wu et al 2019 the proposed model is utilized to determine transient response of a horizontal well with one stage fracture i e bwfn in an unconventional reservoir in comparison with the uniform permeability modulus the basic parameters in the new model are c fdi p t 30 γ p i 3 00 γ n a 2 00 γ md 0 02 and h d 0 10 as can be seen in fig 9 there is a slight difference on the double logarithmic type curves in the early time period due to the slight pressure loss derived from the decrease of the permeability in the stress sensitive primary fractures for the intermediate time period it is found that a suitable value assigned for the permeability modulus i e γ d 0 10 is able to obtain consistent pressure derivative curve as we can see with an increase of the permeability modulus the double logarithmic curves shift upward gradually in the late time flow period based on the characteristics of the matrix and fractures therefore the semi analytical method should be regarded as a reasonable and accurate approach to evaluate the transient pressure behaviour during the entire flow regimes 4 3 sensitivity analysis the stress sensitive effect is determined with the dimensionless permeability moduli i e γ fd p i γ fd s c and γ fd n a in the fracture subsystems while the dimensionless permeability modulus is assumed to be a constant value i e γ md 0 025 in the stress sensitive matrix subsystem in addition the effects of initial fracture conductivity minimum fracture conductivity convergence skin on the double logarithmic type curves are analyzed and discussed in this work 4 3 1 permeability modulus the minimum fracture conductivities and initial fracture conductivities are assumed as constant i e c fd p i m i n c fdi p i 0 100 c fd s c m i n c fdi s c 0 050 c fd n a m i n c fdi n a 0 010 and c fdi p t 30 for the fracture subsystem the other parameters are γ md 0 025 and h d 0 10 1 primary fractures fig 10 displays the effect of different permeability moduli in the primary fractures on the transient pressure curves for a horizontal well in a box shaped reservoir as can be seen the permeability modulus in the primary fractures mainly affects the intermediate time period for the example with bwfn offn and flfn similar results about the stress sensitive effect have been documented elsewhere wei et al 2019 this is because the pressure loss resulted from the stress sensitive effect is smaller in the early flow time due to smaller changes in the pore throat structure liu et al 2018 2020 and fracture conductivity tends to reach its minimum when the pressure drop is larger than its threshold value during the late time flow time 2 secondary fractures fig 11 demonstrates the influence of different permeability moduli in secondary fractures on the theoretical type curves it is observed that the influence of stress sensitivity can be negligible for the examples with offn and flfn since the secondary fracture volume is relatively small and fluid flows into primary fractures during the early time period i e fluid feed regime when the pressure loss resulted from the stress sensitive effect is small 3 natural fractures the flfn is taken as an example to detect the impact of stress sensitivity on the pressure and its derivative curves in fig 12 since the natural fractures impose no impact on the early and intermediate time periods as can be seen the permeability modulus in the primary fractures has an obvious impact on both transition and pseudoradial flow regimes the dimensionless pressure drop can be more obviously increased as the permeability modulus in the natural fractures increases in addition for the example with a large permeability modulus i e γ f n a 3 00 there are two dips on the derivative pressure curve the former dip is attributed to the effect that the fluid in the matrix starts to flow into the natural fractures and the latter one is resulted from the combined effect of boundary and stress sensitivity 4 3 2 initial fracture conductivity a number of research efforts have been made to examine the influence of initial conductivity in the primary fractures on the theoretical type curves for a vertical horizontal well under the stress sensitive effect zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019a and thus the impact of initial fracture conductivity in the secondary fractures and natural fractures is mainly investigated in this work the permeability moduli and minimum fracture conductivities are assumed as constant i e γ f p t 1 00 c fd p i m i n c fdi p i 0 100 c fd s c m i n c fdi s c 0 050 and c fd n a m i n c fdi n a 0 010 in the fracture subsystem the other parameters are γ md 0 025 and h d 0 10 1 secondary fractures fig 13 presents the double logarithmic type curves of a horizontal well with different initial conductivities in the secondary fractures as can be seen the initial fracture conductivity tends to affect the fluid feed regime for the flfn case for the offn case the initial conductivity in the secondary fractures imposes a weaker effect on the early time flow period compared with the initial conductivity in the primary fractures the smaller the initial fracture conductivities in the secondary fractures the larger derivation on the theoretical types in the early time flow period 2 natural fractures fig 14 exhibits the impact of initial conductivity in the natural fractures on the theoretical type curves take the flfn case as an example it is found that the initial conductivity in the natural fractures has a significant impact on the transition flow regime with a decrease of the initial conductivity in natural fractures the pressure derivative curves manifest as a shallower dip during the transition flow regime because of the slow change in the pressure drop for fractures with a small initial conductivity 4 3 3 minimum fracture conductivity in this section it is found that the minimum fracture conductivity has a similar influence on the type curves for the different fracture networks and thus one of them i e flfn is taken as an example the initial fracture conductivities and permeability moduli are assumed as constant i e γ f p t 1 00 and c fdi p t 30 for the fracture subsystem the other parameters are γ md 0 025 and h d 0 10 1 primary fractures fig 15 demonstrates the influence of minimum conductivity in the primary fractures it is found that the minimum fracture conductivity primarily affects the late time flow period since the conductivity in the fractures tends to reach its minimum when the pressure drop is larger than its threshold value as the loss of fracture conductivity is smaller for a higher minimum fracture conductivity the smaller the minimum fracture conductivities in the primary fractures the more obvious upwarping of the derivative curves during this flow period 2 secondary natural fractures as illustrated in fig 15b and 15c there is a negligible impact on the double logarithmic type curves in an unconventional reservoir this is because the conductivity in the secondary natural fractures needs much more time to reach its minimum value at the threshold pressure drop 4 3 4 convergence skin effect fig 16 demonstrates the convergence skin effect derived from the different reservoir thicknesses i e h d 0 10 0 15 and 2 r wd in a naturally fractured reservoir the other dimensionless parameters are γ f p t 1 00 c fd p i m i n c fdi p i 0 100 c fd s c m i n c fdi s c 0 050 c fd n a m i n c fdi n a 0 010 and c fdi p t 30 it can be seen that the convergence skin effect imposes an obvious influence on the early time flow period with an increase in formation thicknesses the deviation of curves is increased in the early time flow period due to an extra pressure drop derived from the radial flow near the wellbore in addition the convergence skin effect can be exaggerated during the late time period with the stress sensitive effect zhang and yang 2021 and the initial fracture conductivity in the primary fractures see fig 17 this is because the extra pressure drop becomes larger in the late time flow period as the threshold fracture conductivity decreases 4 4 effect of mobility ratio in practice a reservoir with an mfhw can be divided into two regions usrv and srv see fig 2 b in addition the interface between the two regions is found to be irregular on the basis of the microseismic responses fisher et al 2002 wang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 wu et al 2019 since it is difficult to use the discrete natural fractures to distinguish the flow capacities between the usrv and srv especially for the usrv with numerous microfractures the mobility ratio m for the oil phase in two regions i e srv and usrv is incorporated in the model to interpret the transient behaviour of a horizontal well with a complex fracture network the pressure and production rate are equal at the interface and their dimensionless forms are given as 47a p md out p md in 47b p md n out m p md n in where m is mobility ratio of the two zones which is defined as 47c m k μ in k μ out one of the different fracture networks i e bwfn is taken as an example since the effect of mobility ratio imposes an effect on the late time flow period fig 18 displays the influence of different mobility ratios i e m 1 5 and 25 on the transient pressure response of a horizontal well with one stage hydraulic fracture between the two zone systems the other dimensionless parameters are c fdi p t 30 γ p i 3 00 γ n a 2 00 c fd p i m i n c fdi p i 0 100 c fd n a m i n c fdi n a 0 010 and h d 0 10 as can be seen the duration of the pseudoradial flow regime in the inner zone is reduced as the mobility ratio increases indicating a higher flow capacity in the inner zone in addition the smaller the mobility ratio in the two zones the earlier the boundary dominated flow in the outer zone will start such a phenomenon is observed as a deviation on the curves during the late time flow period indicating that the flow capacity in the outer zone is smaller compared with that in the inner zone 4 5 field case a transient pressure test collected from the literature berumen and tiab 1997 is used to interpret transient pressure behaviour in a stress sensitive reservoir on the basis of the restriction of database the field case might not be appropriate while the model is assumed to satisfy the validation by simplifying some conditions i e convergence effect and fracture network the relevant parameters in the matrix and fractures are tabulated in table 2 it is difficult to obtain a well matched result by implementing the type curve matching method as can be seen in fig 19 comparison of results from the newly developed model with the field case shows a good agreement for the entire flow period confirming the reliability of the model developed in this work at field scale it is found that the pressure derivative curve with stress sensitive effect manifests as a straight line with a slope of 0 30 as for the case without stress sensitive effect the derivative curve is found to be identified via a straight line with a constant slope of 0 25 it is worthwhile noting that the theoretical type curves with consideration of stress sensitive effect are more accurate compared with actual field data reported in the literature based on the proposed model in this study the dimensionless matching results i e γ fd 0 64 γ md 0 08 and c fdi 1 5 are obtained with consideration of the stress sensitive effect 5 summary and conclusions by combining the boundary element method bem and the laplace transform finite difference method ltfdm a new model has been proposed to predict the transient pressure behaviour of a horizontal well intercepted by multiple hydraulic fractures based on three patterns in a reservoir with an arbitrary boundary and natural fractures not only can the bem and the ltfdm be utilized to describe the transient fluid flow inside matrix and fractures domains respectively but also they are flexible to deal with arbitrarily shaped boundaries and any fracture networks moreover the results from the newly predictive model show an excellent agreement with the field measurements by taking stress sensitive effect inside the matrix and fractures domains into account in this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 as for an mfhw in a tight formation its transient pressure response can be classified as seven flow regimes i e bilinear flow fluid feed linear flow early radial flow compound linear flow transition flow and pseudoradial flow 2 the theoretical type curve for the entire flow period is characterized with different permeability moduli based on the properties of matrix and fractures indicating that the uniform permeability is only suitable for a reservoir with the constant stress sensitivity 3 the convergence skin effect mainly affects the early time flow period while it starts to emerge in the late time period with a decrease in both minimum fracture conductivity and initial fracture conductivity 4 the initial fracture conductivities in the secondary and natural fractures impose a significant influence on the early time flow period and the transition flow regime 5 the minimum fracture conductivity in the primary fracture tends to shift upward on the type curves in the late time period with respect to the minimum fracture conductivity in the secondary and natural fractures there is an inappreciable impact on the entire flow period and 6 as for a two zone system the mobility ratio is introduced to differentiate the flow capacity contrast between the srv and usrv which is illustrated with the deviation of pressure derivative curve in the late time period this work incorporates the effects of stress sensitivity and the convergence skin into flow equations to improve the prediction accuracy which are commonly neglected in the traditional models in addition the bem and the ltfdm allow us to accurately and efficiently evaluate transient pressure behavior in a reservoir with an arbitrarily shaped boundary and complex fracture networks due to the fact that the bem is restricted to a homogenous model it can only be applied to obtain the solution of an equation which can be appropriately linearized in this study the

4395,combining horizontal drilling together with hydraulic fracturing greatly improves the economic viability of exploiting a tight reservoir while the stress sensitive effect raises the significant difficulty to accurately evaluate its well performance in this paper a semi analytical model is proposed to evaluate transient pressure behaviour of a multi fractured horizontal well mfhw in a naturally fractured reservoir with an arbitrary boundary and different fracture networks under stress sensitive effect more specifically the boundary element method coupled with the pedrosa s transform formulation is used to obtain accurate solutions of the nonlinear equations incorporated with stress sensitive effect in an arbitrary shaped reservoir with single zone or two zone matrix subsystems meanwhile the laplace transform finite difference method can be utilized to semi analytically deal with the nonlinear fracture subsystems consisting of primary secondary and natural fractures by dividing complex fracture networks into small fracture segments the convergence skin effect is then introduced to represent the radial flow pattern in hydraulic fractures near a horizontal wellbore not only can the effects of stress sensitivity in the matrix and different fracture subsystems be respectively examined but also the corresponding pressure responses together with pressure derivative curves are obtained such coupled theoretical formulations have been verified and then extended for field applications the semi analytical solution is found to be more accurate and reasonable than the solution with the uniform permeability modulus while the stress sensitivity has a dominant impact on the intermediate and late time flow periods the convergence skin effect can be aggravated in the late time period by considering the inherent stress sensitivity in a hydraulic fracture especially at low fracture conductivity based on the sensitivity analysis associated with different networks the initial fracture conductivity in primary and secondary fractures imposes a great impact on the early stage bilinear flow and fluid feed regimes while the initial fracture conductivity in natural fractures makes a difference to the transient pressure response in the transition flow regime as the minimum fracture conductivity in the primary fractures decreases such an influence becomes more dominant during the late time flow period however the minimum fracture conductivity in secondary and natural fractures has an inappreciable effect on the flow regime in the late time flow period the effect of boundary shape becomes more obvious on the type curves especially for a relatively small reservoir compared with the size of a horizontal well intercepted by multiple hydraulic fractures for a reservoir with two zone systems the smaller the mobility ratio in the two zones is the earlier the boundary dominated flow in the outer zone will commence not only does this study facilitate understanding the respective contribution of stress sensitivity and convergence skin effect on the well production but also the newly proposed models can be applied to optimally

performance of horizontal wells with multiple fractures in an unconventional reservoir heidari sureshjani and clarkson 2015 wei et al 2019 jiang et al 2020a liu et al 2020 not only can hydraulic fracturing generate high conductivity flow paths to greatly improve the seepage capacity and oil production but also induce complex and interconnected fracture networks with arbitrary boundaries resulting in more complex flow behaviour chen et al 2017 wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020a numerous attempts have been previously made to evaluate transient pressure behaviour on the basis of simplified fracture networks e g bi wing fracture reservoir geometries e g regular reservoir boundaries wang 2014 wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019a 2019b and multi well pads meng et al 2020 due to the fact that the stress sensitive and the convergence skin effects have not been taken into account these mathematical models are limited in extensive applications physically not only can the influence of stress sensitivity lead to an extremely quick decline of production and pressure in an unconventional reservoir but also it makes more difficult to forecast the performance of horizontal wells intercepted by multistage hydraulic fractures lee et al 2010 teklu et al 2018 jiang et al 2020a 2020b also the extra pressure drop resulted from radial flow near a horizontal well should not be regarded as a constant where stress sensitive effect is considered to consider stress sensitivity on well performance a permeability modulus is introduced to represent its effect within fractures assuming that its impact on the matrix is neglected zhao and du 2019 such an assumption may not be physically correct under certain conditions therefore it is a challenging task to evaluate the performance of a multi fractured horizontal well mfhw in an unconventional reservoir with an arbitrary boundary and different fracture networks with consideration of stress sensitive effect numerous efforts have been made to describe transient behaviour in a naturally fractured reservoir under stress sensitive effect by applying dual porosity models warren and root 1963 chen et al 2008 zhao and du 2019 asadi et al 2020 and or assuming regular boundary shapes xu et al 2015 jiang et al 2019a 2019b for the former the dual porosity model cannot be applied to accurately describe flow behaviour in an unconventional reservoir because of its oversimplification wei et al 2019 while it is suitable for a few specific cases of vertical wells rasoulzadeh and kuchuk 2019 as for the latter an irregularly stimulated reservoir volume srv is usually generated because of the interconnection of the complex fracture networks and natural fractures activated by fracturing operations which has been further confirmed by microseismic events fisher et al 2002 wang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 wu et al 2019 physically transient pressure behaviour is mainly dominated by the boundary effect in the late time period jia et al 2017b thus such simplifications may lead to incorrect solutions under certain conditions zhao et al 2016 in this work a reservoir with two zone systems is applied to consider the difference on the properties i e permeability of an unstimulated reservoir volume usrv and a srv with an arbitrarily shaped interface recently the boundary element method bem which is based on the fundamental i e free space green s function has been widely applied to simulate flow behaviour in a reservoir with arbitrarily shaped boundaries idorenyin and shirif 2017 2018 jia et al 2017b to be more specific the boundary integral equation can be applied to estimate the properties of reservoir boundaries by discretizing boundaries into small elements and then obtain the accurate solutions inside the domain meanwhile the bem has been found to be effective in reducing the computational expenses for an irregularly shaped reservoir compared with the traditional finite difference element methods since only the boundary is divided into small elements without discretizing the domain kikani and horne 1992 wang and zhang 2009 as for complex fracture networks inside the domain the laplace transform finite difference method ltfdm has been incorporated in the bem to describe flow behaviour in hydraulic fractures with arbitrary geometries and conductivity distributions jia et al 2017a 2017b as for a reservoir with an irregular shape and complex fracture networks the traditional solution methods e g the finite fourier cosine transform method would find their limitations to deal with such a geometric constraint zhao and du 2019 by using the bem and ltfdm in our study the newly developed theoretical models can be used to deal with a reservoir with an arbitrary boundary and more complex fracture networks e g the opening fissure fracture network offn and fractal like fracture network flfn while the ltfdm allows us to incorporate the actual natural fractures induced in the srv within which mobility ratio is introduced to indirectly represent the influence of the relatively small natural fractures in most cases the traditional bi wing fracture network bwfn is commonly utilized to evaluate the performance of hydraulically fractured vertical wells zhang and yang 2014 and horizontal wells idorenyin and shirif 2018 wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019a 2019b in practice other fracture networks see fig 1 may be generated due to stress anisotropy such as the offn and flfn chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2021 to have a successful hydraulic fracturing operation propping agents are mainly pumped into primary fractures to prevent the conductivity from decreasing according to an increase in the net effective stress during production luo et al 2018 therefore the conductivity of primary fractures mainly depends on the characteristic of proppants while that of secondary fractures relies on the characteristics of both proppants and rock due to the fact that the secondary fractures are partially filled with proppants zhou et al 2019 for natural fractures the conductivity depends on the reservoir properties e g pore shape size and distribution since natural fractures located in relatively remote places cannot connect with the primary fractures cho et al 2013 teklu et al 2018 therefore the primary secondary and natural fractures should have different permeability moduli minimum fracture conductivities and initial fracture conductivities because of their different characteristics lee et al 2010 luo et al 2018 in addition the non uniform fracture geometry induced by the hydraulic fracturing operations imposes a great impact on the fracture conductivity jiang et al 2020c so far no attempts have been made to consider simultaneously initial fracture conductivities minimum fracture conductivities and permeability moduli for different subsystems e g primary fractures secondary fractures and natural fractures the matrix in different fracture networks e g bwfn offn and flfn in this paper a semi analytical model combining the bem and the ltfdm has been proposed and verified to examine stress sensitive effect on the transient pressure behaviour of an mfhw well in an unconventional reservoir with different fracture networks and arbitrarily shaped boundaries more specifically the bem is employed to depict the transient fluid flow inside the matrix domain and the ltfdm is utilized to describe the flow behaviour in different hydraulic fracture networks to take the convergence skin effect into account fluid flow in primary fractures is divided into darcy linear flow and darcy radial flow while the nonlinear equation in the laplace domain is solved with an iteration method and then its solution in the real space is determined by employing the stehfest algorithm the new model has been validated with data collected from the literature and then extended its application to a field case by taking different characteristics i e initial fracture conductivities minimum fracture conductivities and permeability moduli of primary fractures secondary fractures natural fractures and matrix into account not only can such newly developed models be used to describe transient pressure behaviour of an mfhw in a tight formation with an arbitrary boundary and different fracture networks but also effects of stress sensitivity and convergence skin are considered simultaneously to improve the accuracy of evaluating well performance the paper is presented and organized as follows first the general mathematical models are presented on the basis of the bem and ltfdm secondly the pedrosa s transform formulation is incorporated into the model to eliminate the strong nonlinearity thirdly the solutions obtained by the iteration method are analyzed and compared and finally conclusions and discussions are presented 2 mathematical formulations as illustrated in fig 2 a a horizontal well intercepted by multistage fractures is considered in an unconventional reservoir with box shaped boundaries and discrete natural fractures as a base model which is then extended to a reservoir with two zone systems i e srv and usrv see fig 2 b the following assumptions are briefly described as 1 the reservoir is homogenous and isotropic with constant initial pressure and thickness while the two zone system is assigned with different permeabilities arbitrarily shaped interface and boundaries 2 hydraulic fractures hfs are the only pathway to connect the matrix and the horizontal wellbore 3 the darcy radial flow is assumed to occur from the nearest fracture segment to the wellbore see fig 3 and the flow rate in the radial flow region of different fractures is assumed to be same 4 the drainage radius in the radial flow zone can be assumed as one half of the formation thickness when the horizontal well is located in the middle of payzone mukherjee and economides 1991 5 the wellbore storage effect is neglected 6 the fractures consist of three forms i e primary secondary and natural fractures and they have different initial conductivities minimum conductivities and stress sensitive coefficients also the fracture networks include three patterns i e bwfn offn and flfn and 7 the horizontal well production is constant in this work the superparametric bem which assumes that the boundary properties i e pressure or flux are constant along each element is applied to obtain accurate pressure responses with a certain amount of boundary elements idorenyin and shirif 2018 the fluid flowing in the primary fractures consists of darcy radial flow see fig 3 purple arrows from the nearest segment to the wellbore and darcy linear flow see fig 3 blue arrows in the other segments there is only darcy linear flow in the second and natural fractures in discretized fractures all segments with equal length can be considered as a surface source with a uniform flow flux which is different from that in other fracture elements 2 1 governing equations 2 1 1 matrix subsystem according to the relationship between permeability and pressure drop during the production process the permeability modulus is incorporated into the governing equation to describe pressure behaviour in the matrix subsystem under stress sensitive effect then the diffusion equation is expressed as 1 k mi μ e γ m p i p m 2 p m x 2 2 p m y 2 γ m p m x 2 γ m p m y 2 1 h i 1 n f q fi v i δ u v i ϕ m c tm p m t where kmi is initial matrix permeability t is real time μ is fluid viscosity γ m is permeability modulus in the matrix ϕ m is matrix porosity c tm is matrix compressibility p m is matrix pressure p i is initial pressure q fi is the production rate from matrix to the i th segment in the fractures n f is the number of segments of the entire fracture networks v i is any point on the surface of the i th segment in the fracture network u is any point in the domain h is the formation thickness and δ is the dirac delta function which is defined as 2 δ u v i 0 u v i u v i which satisfies the following constraint 3 ω f u δ u v i d ω f v i the initial and boundary conditions can be described as 4a p m x y t 0 p i 4b p m n γ 0 closed boundary with the nondimensionalized variables defined in appendix a the nondimensionalized form of eq 1 can be obtained as 5 e γ md p md 2 p md x d 2 2 p md y d 2 γ md p md x d 2 γ md p md y d 2 2 π i 1 n f q fdi v di δ u d v di p md t d and the initial and boundary conditions 6a p md x d y d t d 0 0 6b p md n γ 0 closed boundary it is difficult to obtain the analytical solution for the aforementioned governing equation eq 5 inside the matrix domain due to the strong nonlinearity derived from the influence of stress sensitivity therefore the pedrosa s transform formulation is applied to linearize the diffusion equations by replacing pressure with a new dimensionless variable ξ md in the matrix pedrosa 1986 i e 7 p md 1 γ md ln 1 γ md ξ md the parameter perturbation in γ md can be defined in the form of the power series 8 ξ md ξ m d 0 γ md ξ m d 1 γ md 2 ξ m d 2 2 9 1 1 γ md ξ md 1 γ md ξ m d 1 γ md 2 ξ m d 2 2 given that the value of γ md in the matrix subsystem is usually very small the term γ md ξ md lies between zero and unity and thus a zero order term is able to meet the practical accuracy requirement at a reasonable range of pressure drop wang 2014 therefore eq 5 is transformed into the following forms of the pedrosa s transformed variable 10 2 ξ m d 0 x d 2 2 ξ m d 0 y d 2 2 π i 1 n f q fdi v di δ u d v di ξ m d 0 t d and the initial and boundary conditions

the matrix subsystem for a well posed problem the boundary conditions i e pressure or flux need to be determined in advance therefore the reservoir boundary is discretized into small segments in the positive direction i e counter clockwise direction to calculate the unknown boundary data and the solution of boundary integral equation in a naturally fractured reservoir with an arbitrary boundary

1999 chen et al 2008 wang 2014 wu et al 2019 to describe the pressure response in the stress sensitive fracture subsystem zhang et al 2014 according to the experimental measurements it is observed that the minimum fracture conductivity tends to be a nonzero definite value following the decrease of the net pore pressure weaver et al 2010 the nonzero definite value mainly depends on the type and concentration of proppants in the primary fractures luo et al 2018 while the minimum conductivity in secondary and natural fractures partially and fully relies on the reservoir properties 17 c f p t c

fracture patterns c f p t min is minimum conductivity in different fracture patterns and γ f p t is permeability modulus in different fracture patterns pt p i s c n a refers to the primary fractures secondary fractures and natural fractures respectively the governing equation in the linear flow zone within the stress sensitive fracture subsystem is given as 18 l τ f p t p f l μ q fi k f w f h ϕ f μ c tf k f p f t where k f is the fracture permeability w f is the fracture width l is the distance along the fracture direction q fi is the flux form matrix to the i th fracture segment ϕ f is the

initial and boundary conditions 20a p f x y t 0 p i 20b p f l l t i p 0 20c τ f p i p f l l r l μ q b k f w f h where the term l r l represents the interface between the radial and linear flow zones in the primary fractures the total pressure drop within a primary fracture consists of a linear portion and a radial portion see fig 3 the governing equation in the radial flow zone of the primary fracture subsystem with consideration of the impact of stress sensitivity is expressed as 21 p rl p w b μ q 2 π k f w f τ f r n f ln h 2 r w where r w is the wellbore radius p rl is the pressure at the interface between radial flow zone and linear flow zone p w is wellbore pressure n f is the number of primary fractures and τ f r is the coefficient in the radial flow zone the dimensionless form for the governing eq 18 in the linear flow zone can be rewritten as follows 22 l d τ fd p t p fd l d π q fdi c fd 1 c η d p fd t d and the initial and boundary conditions 23a p fd x d y d t d 0 0 23b

fractures the pedrosa s equation can be defined as follows 28 p fd 1 γ md ln 1 γ md ξ fd therefore eqs 22 and 25 as well as boundary conditions eqs 23 in the laplace space can be written as follows 29a l d τ fd p t b ξ fd l d π q fdi c fd s c η d ξ fd 29b ξ wd ξ rld h d c fd τ fd r b n f s ln h d 2 r wd and the initial and boundary conditions 30a ξ fd l d l d t i p 0 30b τ f d pt b ξ f d l d l d r l 2 π c fd s on the basis of the pressure continuity condition the pressure and flux at the interface should be continuous between the matrix and the fractures the equation can then be described as 31 p fd x d y d s p md x d y d s subsequently the pedrosa s substitution method is applied to obtain solution in the laplace domain eq 31 becomes 32 ξ fd x d y d s ξ md x d y d s in this work the ltfdm is applied to describe transient pressure behaviour in the fracture subsystem the governing equation is required to discretize space in the laplace domain instead of the time discretization in the real space by eliminating the time discretization the ltfdm has its advantages to significantly maintain the convergence and stability in terms of computing expenses compared with traditional governing equation in real space moridis et al 1994 then for the several scenarios consisting of different fractured segments the fluid equations in fracture subsystem can be transformed to the finite difference form on the basis of the star delta transformation in the case of the fracture segment joined to another segment at one side see fig 4 a the finite difference equation is derived as 33 t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i 1 i t d i i 1 α di ξ fdi t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 β di q fdi 0 the second scenario of the fracture segment near the crack tip is illustrated in fig 4 b and the equation is given as 34 t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i i 1 α di ξ fdi β di q fdi 0 for the fracture segment adjacent to the radial flow zone see fig 4 c 35 λ di ξ rld λ di t d i i 1 α di ξ fdi t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 β di q fdi 0 where 36a t d i 1 i λ di 1 λ di λ di 1 λ di 36b λ di 2 c fdi p t τ fd p t b δ l d pt 36c α di s c fdi p t δ l d p t c η d i 36d β di π δ l d p t where δ l d p t is the dimensionless length of a segment for different fracture patterns for the case of a complex fracture network more than two fractures are connected with each other see fig 4d and 4e which increases the complexity of the solution the star delta transformation has been found as an efficient way to treat fluid flow in the situation by removing the intermediate intersection associated with the other involved fracture segments king 1989 jia et al 2017a 2017b it is reasonable to ignore the impact of the intersection in the flowing model since its volume is relatively small compared with that of a fracture segment four interconnected fracture segments in fig 4 e are taken as an example the transmissibility of the i th and j th segments is defined as follows 37 t di j λ di λ dj k 1 4 λ dk fig 4 d demonstrates the scenario of three interconnected fracture segments the flow equation is given as the following form after the application of the star delta transformation 38 t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i i 1 t d i i 1 t d i i 2 α di ξ fdi t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i 2 i ξ fdi 2 β di q fdi 0 similarly take four interconnected fracture segments as an example shown in fig 4e the governing equation changes to the following form after adopting the star delta transformation method 39 t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i i 1 t d i i 1 t d i i 2 t d i i 3 α di ξ fdi t d i 1 i ξ fdi 1 t d i 2 i ξ fdi 2 t d i 3 i ξ fdi 3 β di q fdi 0 therefore a closed linear system is employed to depict the fluid flow within the discrete fracture system a hydraulic fracture stage is taken as example to show the result of discretization in fig 5 the closed linear system can be converted in the form of matrix which correlates dimensionless pressure and flow flux within the fracture network 40 a 2 ξ fd b 2 ξ r l d c 2 q o where ξ fd ξ f d 1 ξ f d 2 ξ fd n f o is a zero vector containing n f elements a 2 is n f n f vector which elements resulted from the finite difference form of governing equations mentioned previously b 2 is an n f 1 vector which the elements for fracture segments connected to the interface of radial flow zone are nonzero and c 2 is a n f n f diagonal matrix taking the prescribed production rate requirement into account the constraint condition can be defined as follows 41 i r l λ di ξ fdi ξ rld 2 π s where the term i r l represents i th segment adjacent to the radial flow zone in the primary fractures its matrix form can be expressed as follows 42 b 2 t ξ fd d ξ r l d e where b 2 t is the transposed matrix of b 2 d is a vector containing an element equals i r l λ di and e is a vector with an element equals 2 π s 2 1 3 coupled solutions for the matrix and fracture models according to the constraint equation the system of nonlinear equations can then be converted into the matrix expression i e 43 a b c o o a 1 b

τ fd r b n f s ln h d 2 r wd an iterative method is utilized to improve the accuracy of the solution for the nonlinear equation matrix the detailed flowchart is illustrated in fig 6 and the steps are listed as follows 1 assign initial values for the nonlinear parameters τ fd p t b and τ fd r b 2 on the basis of the governing equations in the matrix eqs 12 and 13 and the finite difference form of flow equations in the linear flow zone eqs 33 39 obtain the nonlinear equation system 3 calculate the unknown vector q and ξ rld 4 compute the dimensionless pressure ξ fd for each fracture segment in the linear flow zone 5 compute the average dimensionless pressure of radial flow zones in real time domain on the basis of governing equation i e eq 44 6 update the nonlinear parameter τ fd p t b and τ fd r b by using eq 32 and compare it with the assigned initial values 7 terminate the iteration if i 1 n f τ fdibnew τ fdib ε ε 10 5 τ fd r b n e w τ fd r b ε ε 10 5 otherwise use the calculated τ fd p t b and τ fd r b as the next calculation and return to step 2 until the prespecified convergence ε has achieved then obtain the final solution ξ wd in the laplace domain 8 continue to the next time step and repeat steps 2 7 until maximum test time has been reached the final solution ξ wd in the real time domain can be determined by using the stehfest numerical inversion stehfest 1970 by applying the pedrosa s substitution method eq 28 we can then determine the bottomhole transient pressure of the horizontal well with a stress sensitive fracture network i e 45 p wd 1 γ nfd ln 1 γ md ξ wd for the wellbore storage effect the duhamel s theorem can be applied to incorporate wellbore storage coefficient and skin factor into transient pressure response and the equation solution can be defined as eq 46 more details can be found elsewhere cao et al 2019 he et al 2020 the discussion of wellbore storage is out of scope of this work 46 ξ wd ξ wd s d h sl 1 c d s d h s l c d s 2 ξ wd where s d is skin factor c d is wellbore storage coefficient l is the length of horizontal wellbore ξ wd and ξ wd represent the dimensionless wellbore pressure with and without skin effect and wellbore storage in the laplace domain due to time and space constraints 3 model validation 3 1 without convergence and boundary effects to validate the newly developed models the double logarithmic type curves of a horizontal well with three symmetrical fractures i e bwfn in an infinite reservoir under stress sensitive effect is compared with results reported in the literature jiang et al 2019a the main parameters are c fdi 100 γ f 2 00 and c fd min c fdi 0 100 in order to ignore the convergence effect the thickness is assumed to approximate to the diameter of wellbore as seen from fig 7 a there exists an excellent agreement between the results obtained from the new models in this work and the solutions from the predictive model provided by jiang et al 2019a through the long time period confirming the reliability of the proposed model in this work 3 2 with convergence and boundary effects the transient solutions of a horizontal well with two stage hfs in a stress sensitive reservoir with convergence and boundary effect are verified by comparing with a commercial numerical simulator kappa v5 20 the physical parameters are tabulated in table 1 as illustrated in fig 7 b the solutions in this work show a good agreement in comparison with the results from the numerical simulator confirming the reliability of the newly proposed method in addition to dealing with the strong nonlinearity not only can the newly predictive model be used to obtain accurate and consistent solutions for a naturally fractured reservoir with an arbitrary boundary but also it takes both the stress sensitive effect and convergence skin contribution into account 4 results and discussion 4 1 transient flow behaviour as shown in fig 8 the double logarithmic type curves for a horizontal well with two stage hfs in a reservoir with natural fractures and a box shaped boundary are determined three different fracture networks i e bwfn offn and flfn together with only one natural fracture network are considered in this work the basic parameters are c fdi p t 30 x de y de 50 and h d 0 10 as can be seen seven flow regimes are identified i e 1 bilinear flow in this period the pressure mainly decreases in the domain of primary and secondary fractures and surrounding matrix which is identified via a one quarter slope on the pressure derivative curve cinco ley et al 1978 2 fluid feed in this period most of the fluid flows though the secondary fractures which is discerned from a slight increase of pressure derivative curve between the bilinear and linear flow regimes chen et al 2017 3 linear flow it is identified via a one half slope on the type curve in this period the fluid flows perpendicularly into the primary and secondary fractures resulting in the propagation of the pressure drop in the matrix domain idorenyin and shirif 2017 4 early radial flow for the bwfn the existence of this flow regime on the type curve mainly depends on the fracture spacing and length raghavan et al 1997 while the interference between fractures i e offn and flfn occurs earlier due to the impact of secondary fractures 5 compound linear flow in this period the interference between the fractures becomes more obvious which can be observed by parallel straight lines on the pressure derivative curves wang 2014 6 transition flow in this period the pressure wave reaches natural fractures and fluid starts to flow into natural fractures which is identified by a similar phenomenon i e dip on the pressure derivative curve compared with the typical dual porosity model the period of this flow regime mainly depends on the distribution of natural fractures and the size of dip on the type curve is determined with the properties e g size and number of the discrete natural fractures jiang et al 2020a 7 pseudoradial flow during the period the pressure derivative response will be marked as a constant value in the late time period it can be identified by a unity slope on the pressure derivative curve because of the boundary effect jia et al 2017b the smaller the reservoir boundary is the earlier the pseudoradial flow will commence wei et al 2019 4 2 comparison with uniform permeability modulus numerous attempts have been made to define the uniform permeability modulus to describe the inherent stress sensitivity in a fractured reservoir based on the pedrosa s substitution method wang 2014 wu et al 2019 the proposed model is utilized to determine transient response of a horizontal well with one stage fracture i e bwfn in an unconventional reservoir in comparison with the uniform permeability modulus the basic parameters in the new model are c fdi p t 30 γ p i 3 00 γ n a 2 00 γ md 0 02 and h d 0 10 as can be seen in fig 9 there is a slight difference on the double logarithmic type curves in the early time period due to the slight pressure loss derived from the decrease of the permeability in the stress sensitive primary fractures for the intermediate time period it is found that a suitable value assigned for the permeability modulus i e γ d 0 10 is able to obtain consistent pressure derivative curve as we can see with an increase of the permeability modulus the double logarithmic curves shift upward gradually in the late time flow period based on the characteristics of the matrix and fractures therefore the semi analytical method should be regarded as a reasonable and accurate approach to evaluate the transient pressure behaviour during the entire flow regimes 4 3 sensitivity analysis the stress sensitive effect is determined with the dimensionless permeability moduli i e γ fd p i γ fd s c and γ fd n a in the fracture subsystems while the dimensionless permeability modulus is assumed to be a constant value i e γ md 0 025 in the stress sensitive matrix subsystem in addition the effects of initial fracture conductivity minimum fracture conductivity convergence skin on the double logarithmic type curves are analyzed and discussed in this work 4 3 1 permeability modulus the minimum fracture conductivities and initial fracture conductivities are assumed as constant i e c fd p i m i n c fdi p i 0 100 c fd s c m i n c fdi s c 0 050 c fd n a m i n c fdi n a 0 010 and c fdi p t 30 for the fracture subsystem the other parameters are γ md 0 025 and h d 0 10 1 primary fractures fig 10 displays the effect of different permeability moduli in the primary fractures on the transient pressure curves for a horizontal well in a box shaped reservoir as can be seen the permeability modulus in the primary fractures mainly affects the intermediate time period for the example with bwfn offn and flfn similar results about the stress sensitive effect have been documented elsewhere wei et al 2019 this is because the pressure loss resulted from the stress sensitive effect is smaller in the early flow time due to smaller changes in the pore throat structure liu et al 2018 2020 and fracture conductivity tends to reach its minimum when the pressure drop is larger than its threshold value during the late time flow time 2 secondary fractures fig 11 demonstrates the influence of different permeability moduli in secondary fractures on the theoretical type curves it is observed that the influence of stress sensitivity can be negligible for the examples with offn and flfn since the secondary fracture volume is relatively small and fluid flows into primary fractures during the early time period i e fluid feed regime when the pressure loss resulted from the stress sensitive effect is small 3 natural fractures the flfn is taken as an example to detect the impact of stress sensitivity on the pressure and its derivative curves in fig 12 since the natural fractures impose no impact on the early and intermediate time periods as can be seen the permeability modulus in the primary fractures has an obvious impact on both transition and pseudoradial flow regimes the dimensionless pressure drop can be more obviously increased as the permeability modulus in the natural fractures increases in addition for the example with a large permeability modulus i e γ f n a 3 00 there are two dips on the derivative pressure curve the former dip is attributed to the effect that the fluid in the matrix starts to flow into the natural fractures and the latter one is resulted from the combined effect of boundary and stress sensitivity 4 3 2 initial fracture conductivity a number of research efforts have been made to examine the influence of initial conductivity in the primary fractures on the theoretical type curves for a vertical horizontal well under the stress sensitive effect zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019a and thus the impact of initial fracture conductivity in the secondary fractures and natural fractures is mainly investigated in this work the permeability moduli and minimum fracture conductivities are assumed as constant i e γ f p t 1 00 c fd p i m i n c fdi p i 0 100 c fd s c m i n c fdi s c 0 050 and c fd n a m i n c fdi n a 0 010 in the fracture subsystem the other parameters are γ md 0 025 and h d 0 10 1 secondary fractures fig 13 presents the double logarithmic type curves of a horizontal well with different initial conductivities in the secondary fractures as can be seen the initial fracture conductivity tends to affect the fluid feed regime for the flfn case for the offn case the initial conductivity in the secondary fractures imposes a weaker effect on the early time flow period compared with the initial conductivity in the primary fractures the smaller the initial fracture conductivities in the secondary fractures the larger derivation on the theoretical types in the early time flow period 2 natural fractures fig 14 exhibits the impact of initial conductivity in the natural fractures on the theoretical type curves take the flfn case as an example it is found that the initial conductivity in the natural fractures has a significant impact on the transition flow regime with a decrease of the initial conductivity in natural fractures the pressure derivative curves manifest as a shallower dip during the transition flow regime because of the slow change in the pressure drop for fractures with a small initial conductivity 4 3 3 minimum fracture conductivity in this section it is found that the minimum fracture conductivity has a similar influence on the type curves for the different fracture networks and thus one of them i e flfn is taken as an example the initial fracture conductivities and permeability moduli are assumed as constant i e γ f p t 1 00 and c fdi p t 30 for the fracture subsystem the other parameters are γ md 0 025 and h d 0 10 1 primary fractures fig 15 demonstrates the influence of minimum conductivity in the primary fractures it is found that the minimum fracture conductivity primarily affects the late time flow period since the conductivity in the fractures tends to reach its minimum when the pressure drop is larger than its threshold value as the loss of fracture conductivity is smaller for a higher minimum fracture conductivity the smaller the minimum fracture conductivities in the primary fractures the more obvious upwarping of the derivative curves during this flow period 2 secondary natural fractures as illustrated in fig 15b and 15c there is a negligible impact on the double logarithmic type curves in an unconventional reservoir this is because the conductivity in the secondary natural fractures needs much more time to reach its minimum value at the threshold pressure drop 4 3 4 convergence skin effect fig 16 demonstrates the convergence skin effect derived from the different reservoir thicknesses i e h d 0 10 0 15 and 2 r wd in a naturally fractured reservoir the other dimensionless parameters are γ f p t 1 00 c fd p i m i n c fdi p i 0 100 c fd s c m i n c fdi s c 0 050 c fd n a m i n c fdi n a 0 010 and c fdi p t 30 it can be seen that the convergence skin effect imposes an obvious influence on the early time flow period with an increase in formation thicknesses the deviation of curves is increased in the early time flow period due to an extra pressure drop derived from the radial flow near the wellbore in addition the convergence skin effect can be exaggerated during the late time period with the stress sensitive effect zhang and yang 2021 and the initial fracture conductivity in the primary fractures see fig 17 this is because the extra pressure drop becomes larger in the late time flow period as the threshold fracture conductivity decreases 4 4 effect of mobility ratio in practice a reservoir with an mfhw can be divided into two regions usrv and srv see fig 2 b in addition the interface between the two regions is found to be irregular on the basis of the microseismic responses fisher et al 2002 wang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 wu et al 2019 since it is difficult to use the discrete natural fractures to distinguish the flow capacities between the usrv and srv especially for the usrv with numerous microfractures the mobility ratio m for the oil phase in two regions i e srv and usrv is incorporated in the model to interpret the transient behaviour of a horizontal well with a complex fracture network the pressure and production rate are equal at the interface and their dimensionless forms are given as 47a p md out p md in 47b p md n out m p md n in where m is mobility ratio of the two zones which is defined as 47c m k μ in k μ out one of the different fracture networks i e bwfn is taken as an example since the effect of mobility ratio imposes an effect on the late time flow period fig 18 displays the influence of different mobility ratios i e m 1 5 and 25 on the transient pressure response of a horizontal well with one stage hydraulic fracture between the two zone systems the other dimensionless parameters are c fdi p t 30 γ p i 3 00 γ n a 2 00 c fd p i m i n c fdi p i 0 100 c fd n a m i n c fdi n a 0 010 and h d 0 10 as can be seen the duration of the pseudoradial flow regime in the inner zone is reduced as the mobility ratio increases indicating a higher flow capacity in the inner zone in addition the smaller the mobility ratio in the two zones the earlier the boundary dominated flow in the outer zone will start such a phenomenon is observed as a deviation on the curves during the late time flow period indicating that the flow capacity in the outer zone is smaller compared with that in the inner zone 4 5 field case a transient pressure test collected from the literature berumen and tiab 1997 is used to interpret transient pressure behaviour in a stress sensitive reservoir on the basis of the restriction of database the field case might not be appropriate while the model is assumed to satisfy the validation by simplifying some conditions i e convergence effect and fracture network the relevant parameters in the matrix and fractures are tabulated in table 2 it is difficult to obtain a well matched result by implementing the type curve matching method as can be seen in fig 19 comparison of results from the newly developed model with the field case shows a good agreement for the entire flow period confirming the reliability of the model developed in this work at field scale it is found that the pressure derivative curve with stress sensitive effect manifests as a straight line with a slope of 0 30 as for the case without stress sensitive effect the derivative curve is found to be identified via a straight line with a constant slope of 0 25 it is worthwhile noting that the theoretical type curves with consideration of stress sensitive effect are more accurate compared with actual field data reported in the literature based on the proposed model in this study the dimensionless matching results i e γ fd 0 64 γ md 0 08 and c fdi 1 5 are obtained with consideration of the stress sensitive effect 5 summary and conclusions by combining the boundary element method bem and the laplace transform finite difference method ltfdm a new model has been proposed to predict the transient pressure behaviour of a horizontal well intercepted by multiple hydraulic fractures based on three patterns in a reservoir with an arbitrary boundary and natural fractures not only can the bem and the ltfdm be utilized to describe the transient fluid flow inside matrix and fractures domains respectively but also they are flexible to deal with arbitrarily shaped boundaries and any fracture networks moreover the results from the newly predictive model show an excellent agreement with the field measurements by taking stress sensitive effect inside the matrix and fractures domains into account in this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 as for an mfhw in a tight formation its transient pressure response can be classified as seven flow regimes i e bilinear flow fluid feed linear flow early radial flow compound linear flow transition flow and pseudoradial flow 2 the theoretical type curve for the entire flow period is characterized with different permeability moduli based on the properties of matrix and fractures indicating that the uniform permeability is only suitable for a reservoir with the constant stress sensitivity 3 the convergence skin effect mainly affects the early time flow period while it starts to emerge in the late time period with a decrease in both minimum fracture conductivity and initial fracture conductivity 4 the initial fracture conductivities in the secondary and natural fractures impose a significant influence on the early time flow period and the transition flow regime 5 the minimum fracture conductivity in the primary fracture tends to shift upward on the type curves in the late time period with respect to the minimum fracture conductivity in the secondary and natural fractures there is an inappreciable impact on the entire flow period and 6 as for a two zone system the mobility ratio is introduced to differentiate the flow capacity contrast between the srv and usrv which is illustrated with the deviation of pressure derivative curve in the late time period this work incorporates the effects of stress sensitivity and the convergence skin into flow equations to improve the prediction accuracy which are commonly neglected in the traditional models in addition the bem and the ltfdm allow us to accurately and efficiently evaluate transient pressure behavior in a reservoir with an arbitrarily shaped boundary and complex fracture networks due to the fact that the bem is restricted to a homogenous model it can only be applied to obtain the solution of an equation which can be appropriately linearized in this study the

4396,the hydrology of the canadian prairie region is complicated by the existence of numerous land depressions that change the contributing area dynamically and result in a non linear and hysteretic relationship between contributing area and storage depressions are represented conceptually in most hydrologic models as simple storage bucket units these conceptual approaches are simplified and might not adequately represent the dynamics of the depressions and the changing non contributing area either temporally or spatially and therefore the simulation of streamflow remains challenging this study advances a more physically based simulation of the hydrology streamflow and spatiotemporal pluvial nival flooding extents and the associated non contributing area in the prairies this is achieved by coupling the mesh hydrology land surface model with a newly developed surface routing component designed to explicitly deal with the prairie pothole system prima and is referred to as mesh prima in this model mesh handles the classical vertical water and energy balance calculations while prima routes the water over the landscape and quantifies the depressional storage and runoff the streamflow simulation of mesh prima is compared against that of mesh with its current conceptual prairie algorithm mesh pdmrof on the smith creek research basin in saskatchewan canada mesh prima shows an improved streamflow and flood simulation compared to mesh pdmrof and can replicate the non linear and hysteretic relationship of the basin response mesh prima allows for mapping the spatial distribution of water pluvial nival flooding and the non contributing area over landscape for different events the results of mesh prima can help in updating the non contributing area map and in identifying pluvial nival flooding hazard which is useful in flooding contexts keywords land surface models prairie potholes non contributing area hysteresis prairie streamflow pluvial nival flooding 1 introduction the prairies are characterized by sequences of flat and undulating terrain with numerous land depressions of glacial origin referred to as prairie potholes anteau et al 2016 these potholes can retain considerable amounts of runoff shook and pomeroy 2011 van der kamp and hayashi 2009 and consequently cause the basin response to be complex non linear and hysteretic shook et al 2013 the amount of retained runoff depends on the available storage in the land depressions that vary in area and volume ahmed et al 2020a these potholes are usually disconnected from the stream network and thus they do not contribute to streamflow under dry conditions hayashi et al 2003 martin 2001 therefore most of the prairies are designated as non contributing area wherein these areas do not contribute flow to the basin outlet for events with return periods of 2 years or smaller godwin and martin 1975 prairie potholes can contribute flow to the stream network under wet conditions in this situation the surface area of potholes is expanded and many of them may connect merge to form larger potholes shook and pomeroy 2011 the potholes are connected by surface or subsurface flow through a fill and spill mechansim shaw et al 2012 wherein a depression spills contributes flow to downstream areas after being filled such a mechanism results in a dynamic non contributing area that increases the hydrological complexities of the prairies and makes traditional hydrological models inapplicable ahmed et al 2020b mekonnen et al 2016 2014 cold region processes such as blowing snow fang et al 2007 snowmelt and frozen soil infiltration gray and landine 1988 pomeroy et al 2007 increase the hydrological complexities further in the prairie environment different approaches have been proposed to handle the pothole complexities in different hydrological rain on grid hru models e g chu et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2014 muhammad et al 2019 shook et al 2013 these approaches use a lumped or a series of reservoirs to represent the potholes in which a reservoir contributes flow after exceeding its capacity such approaches do not account for water travel time calculations between the different depressions which can significantly impact the magnitude and timing of flow another drawback of these approaches is their inability to simulate the spatiotemporal changes of non contributing area and water extents over the landscape these approaches are simplified and they may not adequately capture the dynamics and complexities of the potholes therefore the streamflow simulation remains challenging in the prairies and it becomes even more challenging when peak flow prediction is emphasized ahmed et al 2020b the hydrological model for prairie region hypr ahmed et al 2020b was proposed as an engineering solution to the flood prediction problem in the prairies as it uses very limited inputs and it is computationally efficient compared to more sophisticated solutions models hypr was based on the conceptual hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning light model hbv light seibert and vis 2012 for process representation and the probability distribution model based runoff generation pdmrof algorithm mekonnen et al 2014 for pothole representation although hypr showed potential to solve the flood prediction problem by accurately simulating both the overall hydrograph and peak flows in multiple prairie watersheds it simply cannot represent the spatial water extents over the landscape coupled hydrologic hydraulic modelling frameworks e g li et al 2021 nguyen et al 2016 can be used to simulate the runoff amounts and can route the water over the different landscape elements to generate water extents however the hydrologic component of such frameworks does not simulate the pothole complexities further in these frameworks there is no feedback from the hydraulic to the hydrologic component regarding the amount of ponded water on surface which is a key state variable in the prairies and can significantly change the amount of evaporation soil moisture storage and consequently the generated runoff form hydrologic models therefore the use of such frameworks without modifications might not be useful in the prairie region in the past decade the prairie region has been impacted by many flooding events that resulted in severe social and economic damages brimelow et al 2014 in the prairies flood damages are not associated with fluvial flooding only pluvial nival flooding can also cause major issues to agricultural and urban areas that reside near potholes pluvial nival flooding is typical in the prairies under wet conditions as potholes can be filled and their surface area expanded causing the surrounding areas to be flooded shook et al 2015 however assessing flooding impacts has been typically limited to fluvial flooding e g bharath and elshorbagy 2018 elshorbagy et al 2017 with less attention to landscape pluvial nival flooding thus it is important to accurately simulate the magnitude of floods and the corresponding areal extents of water over the landscape to contribute to the proper assessment of combined flood risks in the prairies there is a need for a land surface model that has sound physical representation of the complex prairie hydrological processes hydrologic component and can predict the spatial water distribution over prairie landscape hydraulic component and the progression of pluvial nival flood water in addition to the prediction of the hydrograph such a model can be used to further investigate the mechanisms of generating different runoff and flood regimes in both fluvial and pluvial nival dominated events the main objective of this study is to couple the modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology land surface model mesh pietroniro et al 2007 with the physically based prairie region inundation mapping model prima ahmed et al 2020a in a stand alone hydrologic hydraulic tool namely mesh prima capable of properly simulating the complex prairie hydrology pothole systems and non contributing area dynamics both spatially and temporally in an explicit and fully dynamic distributed manner for better streamflow and peak flow simulation and pluvial nival flood hazard mapping in the prairies we argue that adding a prairie customized routing component to handle pothole complexities in a land surface model can yield i an improved overall streamflow and peak flow simulations and ii an improved understanding and simulation of the progression of pluvial nival flooding while capturing the overall hydrological cycle in the prairies in a physically based manner these are key factors for understanding floods and their various generation mechanisms and for assessing their impacts in prairie landscapes the mesh prima model is significantly different from the stand alone prima model prima model can only simulate simple vertical fluxes infiltration and evaporation using conceptual equations ahmed et al 2020a however mesh prima captures all the components of the hydrologic cycle in the prairies based on sound physics and can be linked in the future to climate models to improve the prediction of future climate projections 2 methodology the mesh model was coupled with prima to improve the streamflow simulation and allow for local scale flood and non contributing area mapping in the prairie region the streamflow prediction of mesh prima was compared against mesh with its alternative prairie pothole runoff algorithm the non contributing area map generated by mesh prima was compared against the existing static non contributing area map which is currently being used to evaluate prairie basins and their contributing area by both researchers and practitioners the resulting flooding extents over the basin obtained from mesh prima was used to investigate the spatial connection between potholes and to assess the pluvial nival flooding hazard over the basin a detailed methodology is provided below 2 1 the mesh prima model 2 1 1 the mesh model the modelisation environmentale communautaire communal environment model mec was an initiative developed by environment and climate change canada eccc to simulate different components of an earth systems model esm it was configured to form a modelling platform called mesh mec surface hydrology to couple land surface and hydrological models pietroniro et al 2007 the mesh model was proposed to provide a framework for coupling the robust physically based land surface schemes of regional and global climate models with hydrological processes to better represent the land surface which can further be coupled with distributed routing models for streamflow simulation the components in the mesh model solve both the energy and water balances of the land surface provided meteorological driving data and the water balance of a stream network provided runoff fields in most cases these components are run in a coupled mode where the hydrologic land surface scheme provides the runoff field to route flow through the stream network mesh has shown potential for simulating streamflow and other hydrological processes in canada budhathoki et al 2020 davison et al 2016 haghnegahdar et al 2015 maclean 2009 mekonnen et al 2014 mengistu and spence 2016 yassin et al 2017 mesh consists of three main components 1 a prognostic land surface component that calculates the vertical water and energy budget and the exchange of vertical fluxes between land surface soil column snow surface ponded water and vegetation canopy and the atmosphere 2 a runoff generation component that calculates the lateral fluxes and generates surface and subsurface runoff and 3 a river routing component that routes the lateral fluxes through the channel stream network to the watershed outlet mesh commonly uses the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 to calculate the vertical water and energy budget for soil snow ponded water and vegetation other vertical water budgets components such as the soil vegetation snow svs system which is currently being implemented in the canadian numerical weather prediction model alavi et al 2016 are also available in mesh class uses richard s equation to calculate the soil moisture for different layers typically three layers in the soil column there are three alternative runoff generation components algorithms in mesh the first is the traditional class runoff algorithm that calculates the total runoff as excess surface runoff and baseflow runoff surface runoff occurs when water which cannot infiltrate into the soil exceeds a specific minimum ponding depth whereas baseflow runoff occurs when there is drainage from the bottom of the soil column and this drainage depth is used in darcy s equation to calculate the baseflow the second runoff generation algorithm is watrof soulis et al 2000 which is based on the concept of sloped soil layers with a horizontal hydraulic conductivity that decreases as the soil depth increases watrof calculates surface runoff using manning s equation and interflow from saturated and unsaturated zones using richard s equation baseflow is generated in the same way as by the traditional class runoff algorithm the third runoff generation algorithm is the pdmrof algorithm mekonnen et al 2014 which was adapted from the probability distribution model pdm moore 2007 to handle the pothole complexities instead of soil storage in the pdmrof algorithm the capacity of different potholes can be drawn from a pareto distribution and runoff is calculated as a function of the storage in potholes pdmrof does not simulate interflow baseflow is generated in the same way as by the traditional class runoff algorithm as for the routing component mesh uses the watroute algorithm from the watflood model kouwen et al 1993 to route the flows through the stream network using the continuity and manning s equations the spatial heterogeneity of the basin properties is handled in mesh using the grouped response unit approach gru kouwen et al 1993 in which areas with the same properties are combined together in one gru this makes the mesh model computationally efficient and reduces the required number of model parameters the stream network and drainage properties for mesh are typically discretized into regular grid cells the hydrologic information of each cell e g elevation slope hydrologic connectivity to other grid cells is derived by processing a hydrologically conditioned dem both hydrologic land surface schemes currently coded in mesh require seven meteorological driving variables incoming shortwave and longwave radiation total precipitation rate air temperature wind speed barometric surface pressure and specific humidity as input at a sub daily temporal scale 2 1 2 the prima model the prairie region inundation mapping model prima ahmed et al 2020a is a distributed hydraulic model that simulates the movement of water over prairie landscapes prima consists of two main components a water redistribution and routing wrr component and a losses component the wrr component in prima uses a set of rules along with manning s equation in an iterative way to redistribute surface runoff generated by the losses component over prairie landscape the wrr component equilibrates the water surface elevation between adjacent dem cells it also quantifies the magnitude and direction of flow travel time and flow rate from cell to cell over the dem that represents the landscape the losses component which is based on the hbv model approach ahmed et al 2020b requires daily precipitation and temperature to simulate surface runoff added water to the landscape which is redistributed by the wrr component and infiltration and evaporation losses removed water from the depression over each grid cell evaporation is calculated as a function of air temperature while runoff and infiltration are calculated as a function of soil moisture storage of each cell in the basin the losses component was proposed in prima to simulate the dominant vertical fluxes to allow for the simulation of temporal changes in the areal extents caused by adding or removing water from the landscape and pothole storage prima when used in conjunction with a conceptual hydrological system like hbv was shown to be successful in simulating the spatial distribution of water over the complex prairie landscape during the spring snowmelt period when compared against remote sensing data ahmed et al 2020a in this study prima was coupled with mesh and the resulting new hydrologic hydraulic modelling platform mesh prima is proposed to improve the non contributing area and pothole representation and streamflow simulation in the prairies in the mesh prima setup mesh calculates the vertical fluxes at a coarse meso grid scale subbasin scale which is typically 10 km and prima redistributes excess water laterally on a very fine grid for the specific subbasin the dem scale which is 30 m in other words mesh prima has two different layers for each mesh coarse grid subbasin one hydrologic layer for the land surface model to handle the vertical water balance and hydrological processes representation 10 km and a fine resolution hydraulic layer 30 mdem resolution for prima to redistribute water over the landscape identify spatial water distribution and quantify the storage and outflow fig 1 in mesh prima mesh calculates the excess water and losses depths to be added removed from ponded water and prima uses the wrr component to redistribute the remaining ponded water over the landscape prima s losses component was not used as added or removed water depths are handled by mesh based on its detailed physically based methods prima was implemented to replace the pdmrof algorithm in mesh and to enable mesh to provide the additional output of pothole storage and areal extent of water and non contributing area it is well understood that prairie depressions are connected through overland and interflow runoff from the shallow soil layers hayashi et al 2016 1998 van der kamp and hayashi 2009 therefore prima receives input water as the surface rofo and the interflow runoff from the first two soil layers rofs1 2 both calculated by the watrof algorithm fig 1 losses infiltration seepage and evaporation from ponded water in prima were calculated by mesh then the net water input to prima the difference between input water and losses was added to the dem fig 1 and prima redistributes that water iteratively quantifies the storage in the depressions and calculates the net outflow reaching the stream network the net outflow from prima i e from depressions and the remaining runoff depths interflow runoff from the third soil layer rofs3 and baseflow from the bottom of the soil column rofb fig 1 go directly to the routing component of mesh to estimate the streamflow more details on the technical implementation of prima inside mesh are provided in the supplemental file section s1 2 2 study area and data it is important to test the proposed model mesh prima and the mesh model with the alternative prairie pothole runoff algorithm namely mesh pdmrof on a prairie watershed with sufficient streamflow records minimum level of flow regulation and a good understanding of the complexities of the prairie pothole ahmed et al 2020a dumanski et al 2015 fang et al 2010 shook et al 2013 shook and pomeroy 2011 therefore smith creek research basin scrb fig 2 was chosen as a study area to test the performance of mesh prima scrb has a total area of 435 km2 and an approximate effective area of 57 8 km2 according to the existing static non contributing area pfra map government of canada aafc 2021 the currently available pfra non contributing area map fig 2 is static and was delineated based on visual interpretation of available topographic maps for events with a magnitude of a 2 year return period or smaller shaw et al 2013 the landscape of scrb is relatively flat almost 3 average slope with cropland and pasture as the dominant landcover scrb was represented in mesh using one grid cell 30 km resolution and one gru with five different computational units landcover types to reduce the computational burden we argue that more discretization of the mesh grids would not significantly improve the results and that one mesh grid cell with five different computational units is sufficient to simulate the medium sized scrb since the soil properties landcover and meteorological forcing are almost uniform over scrb the landscape was represented in prima using the canadian digital surface model cdsm with about 2 25 million finer grids 20 m resolution inside the one mesh grid as the input dem government of canada cdsm 2021 we used the cdsm instead of the canadian dem because the latter is void filled and contains no depressions with which to represent potholes the scrb was delineated using the cdsm and the resulting streams that match the rivers observed on available satellite imageries were selected as the scrb main rivers fig 2 all cells that lie on the centerline of the main rivers were considered as outlet cells in prima any water reaching these outlet cells while prima iterates for the specific time step to distribute water over landscape was removed from the landscape and was passed to the routing component of mesh to route the water to the outlet we did this to reduce the number of iterations required for prima because prima requires thousands of iterations to move water along the river landcover types were identified from the canadian land cover data government of canada circa 2000 2021 the vegetation parameters in the model were set to their recommended values from literature verseghy 2011 and the soil texture information was acquired from the canadian soil information system cansis http sis agr gc ca cansis the rest of the model parameters were calibrated within their range table 1 9 for mesh prima and 7 for mesh pdmrof to best fit the observed flow for mesh prima and mesh pdmrof the spatially uniform precipitation input for the models was obtained from the canadian precipitation analysis product capa lespinas et al 2015 whereas the rest of the meteorological inputs were obtained from the global environmental multiscale atmospheric model gem mailhot et al 2006 data were acquired for the period from 2005 to 2020 streamflow records were obtained from the water survey of canada wsa from 1975 to 2017 gauge id 05me007 the simulation period was chosen based on the availability of both meteorological and streamflow data 2005 to 2017 hydrologic year october to september 2 3 model calibration the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used as an objective function for model calibration to compare simulated to observed flows at the watershed outlet each of the two models mesh pdmrof and mesh prima was calibrated independently to best fit the calibrated parameters the first three years of the simulation were considered as a spin up period the results of the models during these years are excluded from the calculation of the objective function and any analysis the period from 2008 to 2011 was considered as a calibration period and the period from 2012 to 2017 was considered as a validation period the calibration period includes the 2011 flood event which is useful for model parameter identification ahmed et al 2020b the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 within the ostrich optimization toolkit shawn matott 2017 was used for model calibration by maximizing the nse value using 1000 runs for both models the parameters in table 1 were calibrated within their respective range with the objective to have the simulated flows best fit to observed ones 2 4 streamflow performance evaluation the resulting streamflow from each model mesh prima and mesh pdmrof was compared separately against observed flows using visual inspection of the hydrograph and four quantitative performance measures nse nseot nselog and percent bias pbias nse was used to assess the model performance for the overall hydrograph with some focus on peak flow nseot was calculated using the nse formula but for flows over a defined threshold 95th percentile and was used to assess the goodness of fit in peak flow simulation nselog uses the logarithmic transformation of flows within the nse formula to assess the simulation of low flows pbias was used to assess the performance in preserving the overall runoff volume streamflow simulation with nse values greater than 0 4 can be considered acceptable in the prairies also streamflow simulations with pbias values less than 35 may be deemed satisfactory acceptable in the prairies because it is an indicator of event capture rather than water balance error ahmed et al 2020b dibike et al 2020 muhammad et al 2019 streamflow simulations satisfying these criteria are referred to as acceptable satisfactory in this study it is important to note that these criteria were not used as calibration target for the models 2 5 dynamic non contributing area delineation the spatial distribution of water over the landscape resulting from mesh prima was also used to assess the changing dynamic non contributing area for different events over the course of the simulation multiple functions algorithms from whitebox tools wbt lindsay 2016 which is a free open source gis toolbox were used to delineate the landscape to quantify the contributing and non contributing areas of the basin the following are the main steps in non contributing area delineation the depressions and their capacity were identified from the dem using the depth in sink function from wbt then the filling state current storage of each depression identified from the resulting water depth raster from mesh prima for a specific event time step was compared to the capacity of the respective depression the non filled depressions for the specific event time step were identified as depressions with storage smaller than their capacity a raster containing the locations of the non filled depressions and the main rivers is generated for each event this raster and the flow direction raster corresponding to a filled dem were used in the watershed function the resulting raster from the watershed function contains the contributing areas that contributes flow connected to the rivers and the non contributing areas that are dominated by the non filled depressions 2 6 non contributing area evaluation metrics the currently available pfra non contributing area map fig 2 was used as a reference to further validate the non contributing area map generated by mesh prima for an event that has a magnitude of 2 years return period it is important to note that mesh prima was calibrated to fit the streamflow observations only and no calibration was conducted to fit the non contributing area of mesh prima to the pfra map the non contributing area map of mesh prima is dynamic and changes based on the magnitude of the event the dynamic non contributing area maps can be seen as an update of the currently used non contributing area map over the studied basin and the entire prairie region in future two performance metrics were used to assess the ability of mesh prima to replicate the spatial non contributing area of the pfra as an observed data for the 2008 spring snowmelt peak event that is equivalent to a 2 years return period event namely the hit rate hr and the false alarm ratio far these metrics are typically used to assess the spatial agreement between observations and predictions of flooded areas however they are used in this study to assess the spatial agreement between observed and simulated non contributing area the hit rate hr or the probability of detection is used to measure agreement between the simulated and observed non contributing area without penalizing the model for overpredicting the non contributing areas hr is expressed as follows 1 hr a sim a obs a obs where asim and aobs are the simulated mesh prima and observed pfra non contributing areas respectively hr values range from 0 to 1 with a value of 1 indicating an exact match spatially between observed and simulated non contributing areas the false alarm ratio far was used to indicate overprediction of the non contributing area far can be decomposed as false alarms divided by true and false alarms and is expressed as follows 2 far a sim a obs a sim a obs a sim a obs where a sim a obs a a sim a a obs refers to areas that were falsely predicted as non contributing by mesh prima but were observed as contributing by the pfra map false alarm far ranges from 0 to 1 with a value of 0 indicating exact match between observations and simulations with no false alarms overprediction 2 7 flood extents hazard maps the average inundation depth and the frequency of inundation percentage of time steps a dem cell was inundated for each dem cell in the study area resulting from the water depth raster that mesh prima generated over the simulation period were used to understand and quantify the spatial connectivity between land depressions and their ephemerality the frequency of inundation foii for any dem cell i is expressed as 4 foi i n i n t where ni is the number of time steps a dem cell i was inundated over the course of the simulation period and nt is total number of time steps in mesh prima simulations the frequency of inundation raster was used as an indication of the areas that are highly likely to be flooded either permanently or during flooding events the average inundation depth over the simulation period calculated for each dem cell and frequency of inundation combined were used as an indicator of pluvial nival flood hazard over the basin 3 results and analysis 3 1 streamflow performance mesh pdmrof vs mesh prima the streamflow simulation of mesh pdmrof and mesh prima for scrb are shown in fig 3 the mesh pdmrof model showed satisfactory agreement with observations during the calibration period as indicated by the nse value table 2 however during the validation period the performance of mesh pdmrof deteriorated and the model missed many events and had errors in estimating the magnitude of the remaining events it had an unsatisfactory performance in replicating the overall hydrograph nse peak flows nseot low flows nselog and the runoff volume pbias in the validation period table 2 the mesh prima model showed satisfactory streamflow simulation in the calibration period based on the performance metrics table 2 and was better able to capture small peaks e g 2010 and overestimated the 2011 flooding event fig 3 even though the calibration period length was smaller than that of the validation period the performance of mesh prima improved further in the validation period and the model was able to capture peak flow events especially the 2014 spring snowmelt and summer events fig 3 mesh prima shows satisfactory performance in replicating the overall hydrograph and low flows in the calibration and validation periods nse and nselog respectively table 2 it also shows satisfactory and good simulation of the peak flows as indicated by nseot table 2 for the calibration and validation periods respectively and a satisfactory performance in preserving the total runoff volume during the calibration period however mesh prima underestimated the runoff volume in the validation period pbias table 2 because it missed some peaks e g summer 2012 and 2016 and underestimated the magnitude of the 2015 and 2017 peak flows fig 3 this may have been caused by some underestimation in the capa precipitation compared to available observations for those specific events capa underestimated the precipitation of 2012 and 2016 by 12 and 21 respectively figure s2 it was also shown that capa underestimates summer rainfall when compared against observations in another prairie basin budhathoki et al 2020 when capa was used to drive the mesh model the simulations completely miss or underestimate summer and sometimes winter events in multiple prairie and non prairie basins budhathoki et al 2020 davison et al 2016 mekonnen et al 2014 overall mesh prima showed an improved streamflow and peak flow simulation compared to mesh pdmrof although the performance of the latter was better in the calibration period mesh prima outperformed mesh pdmrof in the overall simulation period especially in the validation period when looking at the hydrograph fig 3 and the performance metrics table 2 the streamflow of the scrb is complex and previous studies showed severe errors biases in estimating the flow volume magnitude e g pomeroy et al 2010 2014 however the results are satisfactory by mesh prima model given that a low optimization budget was used to calibrate the model the inherent complexities of the basin and the underestimation in capa precipitation it can be clearly seen that mesh prima provided a better and more realistic simulation of runoff amounts compared to the mesh model with no account for pothole storage figure s3 also mesh prima provided an improved streamflow simulation compared to mesh pdmrof since pdmrof is a conceptual algorithm it did well during the calibration period because it was adequately fitted to specific data during that period however it was unable to preserve the same good performance in the validation period on the other hand prima has more support based on physical justification and it is less likely to be overfitted therefore the performance of the model was satisfactory and it improved further in the validation period more details on the comparison of mesh pdmrof and mesh prima is provided in the discussion section 3 2 dynamic non contributing area map generated by mesh prima the spatial extent of the non contributing area of the basin can be obtained from mesh prima only since mesh pdmrof cannot provide information about the spatial distribution of non contributing areas overall the simulated non contributing area for the spring peak flow event of 2008 showed a good agreement with the observed pfra map especially for the northern and north western parts of the basin fig 4 the simulated non contributing area of 2008 replicated the pfra map with a hr value of 0 90 mesh prima overestimated the non contributing area when compared to the pfra map especially the area south of the two streams confluence with a far of 0 10 fig 4 these areas have many depressions that are clearly visible on available satellite images and the used dem with no prominent streams that can connect them to the main river thus it can be assumed that this area is unlikely to contribute flow to the river network for events with such a low magnitude due to mesh prima s ability to fit the pfra map the prediction of non contributing area of mesh prima is reasonably accurate consequently mesh prima was used to investigate the non contributing areas for different events during the simulation period the non contributing area maps generated by mesh prima that correspond to peak spring snowmelt events for different years in the simulation period are shown in fig 5 the spatial extent of the non contributing area changes from year to year based on the storage in the depressions flood years e g 2011 2013 and 2014 have small non contributing area with 2014 being the smallest low flow years e g 2008 to 2010 and 2016 have greater non contributing area extents compared to flood years fig 5 the river bank area always contributes flow to the river network during both low flow and flood years as it has direct connection to the streams outlet and no depressions can retain water 3 3 contributing area storage and streamflow curves the relationship between the average ponded depth storage and the fractional contributing area of the scrb for the different hydrologic years based on mesh pdmrof and mesh prima is shown in fig 6 it is known that the relationship between contributing area and ponded depth is non linear and hysteretic shook and pomeroy 2011 however mesh pdmrof did not show hysteresis nor nonlinearity in the relationship between the contributing area and the average ponded depth over the basin mesh pdmrof almost followed the same linear curve during filling and emptying the potholes as indicated by increasing or decreasing the storage fig 6 on the other hand mesh prima showed a clear non linear and hysteretic clockwise loop for different years the shape of the relationship is very different from year to year in mesh prima as it is a function of the storage the contributing area increases with the increase in storage wetting phase of potholes in a clockwise direction especially for high flow flood years such as 2011 and 2014 in flood years the contributing area increases until the total basin area contributes flow to the outlet e g 2014 the removal of water from the potholes due to infiltration and or evaporation drying of potholes can cause sudden reduction in the contributing area in a clockwise direction in almost all years fig 6 nested hysteretic loops are found when there were multiple consecutive wetting and drying cycles due to significant snowmelt or rainfall events of the years e g 2011 2014 and 2015 fig 6 mesh pdmrof assumes that the basin has no contributing area and the entire basin does not contribute flow if the depressions are near empty small ponded depths fig 6 on the other hand mesh prima assumes that there is a minimum contributing area riverbank area that always contributes flow to the outlet even when the depressions are near empty small ponded depth mesh pdmrof ignores the fact that defined streams rivers and their banks always contribute flow to the outlet and this has to be considered in scrb that has a well developed river since mesh prima shows a non linear hysteretic relationship between contributing area and ponded depth fig 6 it is consistent with the observed signature of the prairie landscape characteristics both mesh pdmrof and mesh prima showed non linear and clockwise hysteretic relationship between contributing area and streamflow in different years fig 7 and this is very different from the ones in fig 6 there are some instances where a high streamflow is associated with low or medium contributing area e g 2011 and 2014 for both models this shows the contribution from interflow from the third soil layer and baseflow from the bottom of the soil column to the stream network directly the non contributing area was defined based on the connection between potholes that occur mostly due to surface water for mesh pdmrof and surface and interflow from the first two soil layer mesh prima and it does not account for the contribution from third soil layers or from the bottom of the soil column the high streamflow that was associated with almost 0 97 contributing area fraction for 2014 in mesh prima fig 7 is associated with the spring snowmelt peak flow of that year in which the flood was generated by surface runoff between depression on the other hand the high streamflow associated with small contributing area of almost 0 25 for 2014 is associated with the summer event of 2014 which was driven mainly by contribution from the third soil layer rofs3 and the baseflow from the bottom of the soil column rofb that contribute directly to the river fig 7 this is very important as it shows the usefulness of land surface models which can help in tracing and investigating different flood triggering mechanisms in the prairies 4 discussion 4 1 on the relationship between streamflow performance storage and contributing area prima vs pdmrof mesh prima showed an improved simulation of the streamflow compared to mesh pdmrof fig 3 and table 2 and also was able to identify the spatial distribution of ponded water supplemental file section s4 and the spatial non contributing area over the landscape fig 5 mesh prima also showed improved flood simulation flood magnitude timing and pluvial nival flooding extents relative to mesh pdmrof which is needed to assess non fluvial flooding impacts such information especially the pluvial nival flooding extents cannot be obtained using mesh pdmrof or any other prairie hydrologic model latent and sensible heat fluxes to the atmosphere generated by mesh prima were seen to be different from mesh pdmrof due to the differences in the water extents simulated it was beyond the scope of this work to determine if these changes show that the simulation of these fluxes were also improved a separate study could look at other benefits of mesh prima particularly where these relate to other components of an esm if it can be shown that these changes correspond to improved fluxes back to the atmosphere relative to observations then the impacts of mesh prima on local weather prediction could also be explored for example using a version of mesh prima coupled with an atmospheric model e g gem mesh prima is more computationally demanding compared to mesh pdmrof as it needs to redistribute the water over very fine grid cells and due to the amount of information that it produces although a low computational budget was used to calibrate the models e g 1000 model trial mesh prima showed potential to simulate the complex prairie hydrology hydraulics this also shows the robustness of mesh prima as it was able to show satisfactory to good simulation of streamflow and peak flow using a small number of trials for model calibration increasing the calibration budget should further improve the streamflow simulation results pdmrof is a conceptual algorithm and it is based on certain simplifying assumptions that make it partially valid for the prairie region the most important and critical assumption that affects the simulation of pdmrof is that there are no water travel time calculations between the different depressions which affects the magnitude and timing of water reaching the outlet this is very important and needs to be addressed to account for the impact of the varying size depressions and their location distance to the outlet on the streamflow further the parameters of pdmrof are conceptual parameters which means that it is difficult to relate these parameters to field observations this also affects the simulation of pdmrof as it might need more model calibration trials to improve the streamflow simulation more importantly pdmrof is unable to simulate the hysteretic relationship between contributing area and ponded depth which further affects its theoretical credibility as well as its ability to capture the complexities of the potholes and consequently the streamflow on the other hand prima can be considered as a physically based algorithm that simulates the complexities of the prairie potholes it simulates the fill spill and merge split mechanisms between depressions in a fully distributed and dynamic manner and calculates the travel time of water between depressions further it shows potential to simulate the hysteretic relationship between contributing area and storage the only parameter inside prima itself is manning s roughness coefficient which can be related to field observations when they are available even if roughness value is not known a low computational budget for model calibration can be sufficient to arrive at a good simulation of flow and the corresponding inundation extents fig 6 suggests that the relationship between contributing area and storage average ponded water depth is non linear and the shape of the curve changes based on the storage of the potholes the relationship has a different non linear behavior for different years and it might be difficult to come up with a single equation that can describe this relationship during different hydrologic years events of varying magnitude this shows why conceptual algorithms i e pdmrof have difficulties in producing acceptable flow simulation since they use a fixed equation to describe the relation between contributing area and storage further it is important to differentiate between the hysteresis in the contributing area and storage curves fig 6 and the contributing area and streamflow curves fig 7 a model that can predict the first is simulating the actual physics and connections among depressions e g mesh prima however the latter hysteretic relationship is unlikely related to the ability to simulate the dynamics or actual conditions of the depressions correctly mesh pdmrof failed to show hysteretic relationship in fig 6 and consequently did not show satisfactory streamflow simulation however it showed hysteresis in the contributing area and streamflow relationship fig 7 the hysteretic relation in fig 7 is caused by the effect of flow routing in the channel it is known that the relationship between active contributing area and the streamflow is hysteretic even for non prairie watersheds nippgen et al 2015 and this is caused by the effect of the routing that changes the contributing area for the same flow on the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph another possible reason for the hysteresis in that curve is the contribution from baseflow to the streamflow which may associate low contributing area to high streamflow caused by that contribution fig 7 4 2 progression of flooding and pluvial nival flooding hazard in the prairies observations related to the spatial distribution of water over scrb are not readily available to be used to further validate assess the simulation of water distribution over the basin by mesh prima however it was assumed that mesh prima simulated the flooding extents in potholes reasonably well since it successfully simulated both the streamflow and the non contributing area compared to observations therefore the results of the model were used to investigate the spatial extents of pluvial nival flooding over the basin it was shown that a flood can be triggered by different responses from surface and or subsurface flow the 2011 spring flood event was generated by a combined contribution from surface flow between depressions and subsurface flow the 2014 spring flood event was mainly driven by contribution from surface flow the magnitude of different components controlling the generation of flow e g snowpack depth antecedent moisture conditions of the pothole and soil available energy to melt the snowpack can be manipulated to investigate which combination generates high or low flow such information would help in further understanding of the complex prairie hydrology and flood flow generation in the prairies using the proposed physically based model mesh prima in future studies an average inundation depth map fig 8 over the entire simulation period can be generated and used to explore the possible connections between potholes it can be noticed also that most of the potholes in the basin are ephemeral having very shallow to shallow depth with very low to low frequency of inundation fig 8 while the deep potholes are constantly wet as indicated from the same figure the depressions are connected through very shallow flow paths areas that are ephemeral intermittent as indicated by the frequency of inundation plot fig 8 once these connections are established many potholes can merge to form larger depressions and increase the contributing area significantly e g central and northern parts of the basin figure s4 for 2014 and average inundation depth in fig 8 maps similar to the average inundation depth or the frequency of inundation generated by mesh prima can be generated under storms conditions of known probabilities to produce hazard maps such as the one shown in figure s4 for 2014 flood such information in pothole dominated areas has not been studied extensively and are needed to help practitioners decision makers and the public in assessing the situation of the agricultural residential and commercial properties that reside near potholes the hazard maps are important in assessing the urban expansion and investigating future development locations such maps are also valuable in assessing the vulnerability of different areas in the basin to floods which can contribute to the reduction of the associated flooding risks in the prairie environment 5 conclusions the mesh model was modified by adding a physically based algorithm prima to improve the representation of prairie potholes and the non contributing area dynamics in land surface models the performance of mesh prima and the mesh model with its current prairie algorithm mesh pdmrof was tested on the smith creek research basin scrb in saskatchewan canada mesh prima showed improved streamflow and peak flow simulation in the scrb compared to the existing pothole runoff algorithm mesh pdmrof more importantly mesh prima simulated the potholes in a fully dynamic and distributed manner and was able to identify the spatial distribution of water and the spatial extents of the non contributing area over the basin mesh prima simulated a non linear and hysteretic relationship between the contributing area and the ponded water depth unlike mesh pdmrof that failed to show the same behavior the non contributing area map generated by mesh prima for an event with a magnitude of a 2 year return period showed a good agreement with the commonly used observation based pfra static non contributing area map mesh prima generated dynamic non contributing area maps that change based on the magnitude of the event such dynamic maps can be valuable for informing public policy practitioners and decision makers and for re evaluating different basins in the prairie region the flooding extents over the basin generated by mesh prima can be used to assess pluvial nival flood hazard over the basin credit authorship contribution statement mohamed ismaiel ahmed conceptualization methodology software validation formal

4396,the hydrology of the canadian prairie region is complicated by the existence of numerous land depressions that change the contributing area dynamically and result in a non linear and hysteretic relationship between contributing area and storage depressions are represented conceptually in most hydrologic models as simple storage bucket units these conceptual approaches are simplified and might not adequately represent the dynamics of the depressions and the changing non contributing area either temporally or spatially and therefore the simulation of streamflow remains challenging this study advances a more physically based simulation of the hydrology streamflow and spatiotemporal pluvial nival flooding extents and the associated non contributing area in the prairies this is achieved by coupling the mesh hydrology land surface model with a newly developed surface routing component designed to explicitly deal with the prairie pothole system prima and is referred to as mesh prima in this model mesh handles the classical vertical water and energy balance calculations while prima routes the water over the landscape and quantifies the depressional storage and runoff the streamflow simulation of mesh prima is compared against that of mesh with its current conceptual prairie algorithm mesh pdmrof on the smith creek research basin in saskatchewan canada mesh prima shows an improved streamflow and flood simulation compared to mesh pdmrof and can replicate the non linear and hysteretic relationship of the basin response mesh prima allows for mapping the spatial distribution of water pluvial nival flooding and the non contributing area over landscape for different events the results of mesh prima can help in updating the non contributing area map and in identifying pluvial nival flooding hazard which is useful in flooding contexts keywords land surface models prairie potholes non contributing area hysteresis prairie streamflow pluvial nival flooding 1 introduction the prairies are characterized by sequences of flat and undulating terrain with numerous land depressions of glacial origin referred to as prairie potholes anteau et al 2016 these potholes can retain considerable amounts of runoff shook and pomeroy 2011 van der kamp and hayashi 2009 and consequently cause the basin response to be complex non linear and hysteretic shook et al 2013 the amount of retained runoff depends on the available storage in the land depressions that vary in area and volume ahmed et al 2020a these potholes are usually disconnected from the stream network and thus they do not contribute to streamflow under dry conditions hayashi et al 2003 martin 2001 therefore most of the prairies are designated as non contributing area wherein these areas do not contribute flow to the basin outlet for events with return periods of 2 years or smaller godwin and martin 1975 prairie potholes can contribute flow to the stream network under wet conditions in this situation the surface area of potholes is expanded and many of them may connect merge to form larger potholes shook and pomeroy 2011 the potholes are connected by surface or subsurface flow through a fill and spill mechansim shaw et al 2012 wherein a depression spills contributes flow to downstream areas after being filled such a mechanism results in a dynamic non contributing area that increases the hydrological complexities of the prairies and makes traditional hydrological models inapplicable ahmed et al 2020b mekonnen et al 2016 2014 cold region processes such as blowing snow fang et al 2007 snowmelt and frozen soil infiltration gray and landine 1988 pomeroy et al 2007 increase the hydrological complexities further in the prairie environment different approaches have been proposed to handle the pothole complexities in different hydrological rain on grid hru models e g chu et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2014 muhammad et al 2019 shook et al 2013 these approaches use a lumped or a series of reservoirs to represent the potholes in which a reservoir contributes flow after exceeding its capacity such approaches do not account for water travel time calculations between the different depressions which can significantly impact the magnitude and timing of flow another drawback of these approaches is their inability to simulate the spatiotemporal changes of non contributing area and water extents over the landscape these approaches are simplified and they may not adequately capture the dynamics and complexities of the potholes therefore the streamflow simulation remains challenging in the prairies and it becomes even more challenging when peak flow prediction is emphasized ahmed et al 2020b the hydrological model for prairie region hypr ahmed et al 2020b was proposed as an engineering solution to the flood prediction problem in the prairies as it uses very limited inputs and it is computationally efficient compared to more sophisticated solutions models hypr was based on the conceptual hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning light model hbv light seibert and vis 2012 for process representation and the probability distribution model based runoff generation pdmrof algorithm mekonnen et al 2014 for pothole representation although hypr showed potential to solve the flood prediction problem by accurately simulating both the overall hydrograph and peak flows in multiple prairie watersheds it simply cannot represent the spatial water extents over the landscape coupled hydrologic hydraulic modelling frameworks e g li et al 2021 nguyen et al 2016 can be used to simulate the runoff amounts and can route the water over the different landscape elements to generate water extents however the hydrologic component of such frameworks does not simulate the pothole complexities further in these frameworks there is no feedback from the hydraulic to the hydrologic component regarding the amount of ponded water on surface which is a key state variable in the prairies and can significantly change the amount of evaporation soil moisture storage and consequently the generated runoff form hydrologic models therefore the use of such frameworks without modifications might not be useful in the prairie region in the past decade the prairie region has been impacted by many flooding events that resulted in severe social and economic damages brimelow et al 2014 in the prairies flood damages are not associated with fluvial flooding only pluvial nival flooding can also cause major issues to agricultural and urban areas that reside near potholes pluvial nival flooding is typical in the prairies under wet conditions as potholes can be filled and their surface area expanded causing the surrounding areas to be flooded shook et al 2015 however assessing flooding impacts has been typically limited to fluvial flooding e g bharath and elshorbagy 2018 elshorbagy et al 2017 with less attention to landscape pluvial nival flooding thus it is important to accurately simulate the magnitude of floods and the corresponding areal extents of water over the landscape to contribute to the proper assessment of combined flood risks in the prairies there is a need for a land surface model that has sound physical representation of the complex prairie hydrological processes hydrologic component and can predict the spatial water distribution over prairie landscape hydraulic component and the progression of pluvial nival flood water in addition to the prediction of the hydrograph such a model can be used to further investigate the mechanisms of generating different runoff and flood regimes in both fluvial and pluvial nival dominated events the main objective of this study is to couple the modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology land surface model mesh pietroniro et al 2007 with the physically based prairie region inundation mapping model prima ahmed et al 2020a in a stand alone hydrologic hydraulic tool namely mesh prima capable of properly simulating the complex prairie hydrology pothole systems and non contributing area dynamics both spatially and temporally in an explicit and fully dynamic distributed manner for better streamflow and peak flow simulation and pluvial nival flood hazard mapping in the prairies we argue that adding a prairie customized routing component to handle pothole complexities in a land surface model can yield i an improved overall streamflow and peak flow simulations and ii an improved understanding and simulation of the progression of pluvial nival flooding while capturing the overall hydrological cycle in the prairies in a physically based manner these are key factors for understanding floods and their various generation mechanisms and for assessing their impacts in prairie landscapes the mesh prima model is significantly different from the stand alone prima model prima model can only simulate simple vertical fluxes infiltration and evaporation using conceptual equations ahmed et al 2020a however mesh prima captures all the components of the hydrologic cycle in the prairies based on sound physics and can be linked in the future to climate models to improve the prediction of future climate projections 2 methodology the mesh model was coupled with prima to improve the streamflow simulation and allow for local scale flood and non contributing area mapping in the prairie region the streamflow prediction of mesh prima was compared against mesh with its alternative prairie pothole runoff algorithm the non contributing area map generated by mesh prima was compared against the existing static non contributing area map which is currently being used to evaluate prairie basins and their contributing area by both researchers and practitioners the resulting flooding extents over the basin obtained from mesh prima was used to investigate the spatial connection between potholes and to assess the pluvial nival flooding hazard over the basin a detailed methodology is provided below 2 1 the mesh prima model 2 1 1 the mesh model the modelisation environmentale communautaire communal environment model mec was an initiative developed by environment and climate change canada eccc to simulate different components of an earth systems model esm it was configured to form a modelling platform called mesh mec surface hydrology to couple land surface and hydrological models pietroniro et al 2007 the mesh model was proposed to provide a framework for coupling the robust physically based land surface schemes of regional and global climate models with hydrological processes to better represent the land surface which can further be coupled with distributed routing models for streamflow simulation the components in the mesh model solve both the energy and water balances of the land surface provided meteorological driving data and the water balance of a stream network provided runoff fields in most cases these components are run in a coupled mode where the hydrologic land surface scheme provides the runoff field to route flow through the stream network mesh has shown potential for simulating streamflow and other hydrological processes in canada budhathoki et al 2020 davison et al 2016 haghnegahdar et al 2015 maclean 2009 mekonnen et al 2014 mengistu and spence 2016 yassin et al 2017 mesh consists of three main components 1 a prognostic land surface component that calculates the vertical water and energy budget and the exchange of vertical fluxes between land surface soil column snow surface ponded water and vegetation canopy and the atmosphere 2 a runoff generation component that calculates the lateral fluxes and generates surface and subsurface runoff and 3 a river routing component that routes the lateral fluxes through the channel stream network to the watershed outlet mesh commonly uses the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 to calculate the vertical water and energy budget for soil snow ponded water and vegetation other vertical water budgets components such as the soil vegetation snow svs system which is currently being implemented in the canadian numerical weather prediction model alavi et al 2016 are also available in mesh class uses richard s equation to calculate the soil moisture for different layers typically three layers in the soil column there are three alternative runoff generation components algorithms in mesh the first is the traditional class runoff algorithm that calculates the total runoff as excess surface runoff and baseflow runoff surface runoff occurs when water which cannot infiltrate into the soil exceeds a specific minimum ponding depth whereas baseflow runoff occurs when there is drainage from the bottom of the soil column and this drainage depth is used in darcy s equation to calculate the baseflow the second runoff generation algorithm is watrof soulis et al 2000 which is based on the concept of sloped soil layers with a horizontal hydraulic conductivity that decreases as the soil depth increases watrof calculates surface runoff using manning s equation and interflow from saturated and unsaturated zones using richard s equation baseflow is generated in the same way as by the traditional class runoff algorithm the third runoff generation algorithm is the pdmrof algorithm mekonnen et al 2014 which was adapted from the probability distribution model pdm moore 2007 to handle the pothole complexities instead of soil storage in the pdmrof algorithm the capacity of different potholes can be drawn from a pareto distribution and runoff is calculated as a function of the storage in potholes pdmrof does not simulate interflow baseflow is generated in the same way as by the traditional class runoff algorithm as for the routing component mesh uses the watroute algorithm from the watflood model kouwen et al 1993 to route the flows through the stream network using the continuity and manning s equations the spatial heterogeneity of the basin properties is handled in mesh using the grouped response unit approach gru kouwen et al 1993 in which areas with the same properties are combined together in one gru this makes the mesh model computationally efficient and reduces the required number of model parameters the stream network and drainage properties for mesh are typically discretized into regular grid cells the hydrologic information of each cell e g elevation slope hydrologic connectivity to other grid cells is derived by processing a hydrologically conditioned dem both hydrologic land surface schemes currently coded in mesh require seven meteorological driving variables incoming shortwave and longwave radiation total precipitation rate air temperature wind speed barometric surface pressure and specific humidity as input at a sub daily temporal scale 2 1 2 the prima model the prairie region inundation mapping model prima ahmed et al 2020a is a distributed hydraulic model that simulates the movement of water over prairie landscapes prima consists of two main components a water redistribution and routing wrr component and a losses component the wrr component in prima uses a set of rules along with manning s equation in an iterative way to redistribute surface runoff generated by the losses component over prairie landscape the wrr component equilibrates the water surface elevation between adjacent dem cells it also quantifies the magnitude and direction of flow travel time and flow rate from cell to cell over the dem that represents the landscape the losses component which is based on the hbv model approach ahmed et al 2020b requires daily precipitation and temperature to simulate surface runoff added water to the landscape which is redistributed by the wrr component and infiltration and evaporation losses removed water from the depression over each grid cell evaporation is calculated as a function of air temperature while runoff and infiltration are calculated as a function of soil moisture storage of each cell in the basin the losses component was proposed in prima to simulate the dominant vertical fluxes to allow for the simulation of temporal changes in the areal extents caused by adding or removing water from the landscape and pothole storage prima when used in conjunction with a conceptual hydrological system like hbv was shown to be successful in simulating the spatial distribution of water over the complex prairie landscape during the spring snowmelt period when compared against remote sensing data ahmed et al 2020a in this study prima was coupled with mesh and the resulting new hydrologic hydraulic modelling platform mesh prima is proposed to improve the non contributing area and pothole representation and streamflow simulation in the prairies in the mesh prima setup mesh calculates the vertical fluxes at a coarse meso grid scale subbasin scale which is typically 10 km and prima redistributes excess water laterally on a very fine grid for the specific subbasin the dem scale which is 30 m in other words mesh prima has two different layers for each mesh coarse grid subbasin one hydrologic layer for the land surface model to handle the vertical water balance and hydrological processes representation 10 km and a fine resolution hydraulic layer 30 mdem resolution for prima to redistribute water over the landscape identify spatial water distribution and quantify the storage and outflow fig 1 in mesh prima mesh calculates the excess water and losses depths to be added removed from ponded water and prima uses the wrr component to redistribute the remaining ponded water over the landscape prima s losses component was not used as added or removed water depths are handled by mesh based on its detailed physically based methods prima was implemented to replace the pdmrof algorithm in mesh and to enable mesh to provide the additional output of pothole storage and areal extent of water and non contributing area it is well understood that prairie depressions are connected through overland and interflow runoff from the shallow soil layers hayashi et al 2016 1998 van der kamp and hayashi 2009 therefore prima receives input water as the surface rofo and the interflow runoff from the first two soil layers rofs1 2 both calculated by the watrof algorithm fig 1 losses infiltration seepage and evaporation from ponded water in prima were calculated by mesh then the net water input to prima the difference between input water and losses was added to the dem fig 1 and prima redistributes that water iteratively quantifies the storage in the depressions and calculates the net outflow reaching the stream network the net outflow from prima i e from depressions and the remaining runoff depths interflow runoff from the third soil layer rofs3 and baseflow from the bottom of the soil column rofb fig 1 go directly to the routing component of mesh to estimate the streamflow more details on the technical implementation of prima inside mesh are provided in the supplemental file section s1 2 2 study area and data it is important to test the proposed model mesh prima and the mesh model with the alternative prairie pothole runoff algorithm namely mesh pdmrof on a prairie watershed with sufficient streamflow records minimum level of flow regulation and a good understanding of the complexities of the prairie pothole ahmed et al 2020a dumanski et al 2015 fang et al 2010 shook et al 2013 shook and pomeroy 2011 therefore smith creek research basin scrb fig 2 was chosen as a study area to test the performance of mesh prima scrb has a total area of 435 km2 and an approximate effective area of 57 8 km2 according to the existing static non contributing area pfra map government of canada aafc 2021 the currently available pfra non contributing area map fig 2 is static and was delineated based on visual interpretation of available topographic maps for events with a magnitude of a 2 year return period or smaller shaw et al 2013 the landscape of scrb is relatively flat almost 3 average slope with cropland and pasture as the dominant landcover scrb was represented in mesh using one grid cell 30 km resolution and one gru with five different computational units landcover types to reduce the computational burden we argue that more discretization of the mesh grids would not significantly improve the results and that one mesh grid cell with five different computational units is sufficient to simulate the medium sized scrb since the soil properties landcover and meteorological forcing are almost uniform over scrb the landscape was represented in prima using the canadian digital surface model cdsm with about 2 25 million finer grids 20 m resolution inside the one mesh grid as the input dem government of canada cdsm 2021 we used the cdsm instead of the canadian dem because the latter is void filled and contains no depressions with which to represent potholes the scrb was delineated using the cdsm and the resulting streams that match the rivers observed on available satellite imageries were selected as the scrb main rivers fig 2 all cells that lie on the centerline of the main rivers were considered as outlet cells in prima any water reaching these outlet cells while prima iterates for the specific time step to distribute water over landscape was removed from the landscape and was passed to the routing component of mesh to route the water to the outlet we did this to reduce the number of iterations required for prima because prima requires thousands of iterations to move water along the river landcover types were identified from the canadian land cover data government of canada circa 2000 2021 the vegetation parameters in the model were set to their recommended values from literature verseghy 2011 and the soil texture information was acquired from the canadian soil information system cansis http sis agr gc ca cansis the rest of the model parameters were calibrated within their range table 1 9 for mesh prima and 7 for mesh pdmrof to best fit the observed flow for mesh prima and mesh pdmrof the spatially uniform precipitation input for the models was obtained from the canadian precipitation analysis product capa lespinas et al 2015 whereas the rest of the meteorological inputs were obtained from the global environmental multiscale atmospheric model gem mailhot et al 2006 data were acquired for the period from 2005 to 2020 streamflow records were obtained from the water survey of canada wsa from 1975 to 2017 gauge id 05me007 the simulation period was chosen based on the availability of both meteorological and streamflow data 2005 to 2017 hydrologic year october to september 2 3 model calibration the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used as an objective function for model calibration to compare simulated to observed flows at the watershed outlet each of the two models mesh pdmrof and mesh prima was calibrated independently to best fit the calibrated parameters the first three years of the simulation were considered as a spin up period the results of the models during these years are excluded from the calculation of the objective function and any analysis the period from 2008 to 2011 was considered as a calibration period and the period from 2012 to 2017 was considered as a validation period the calibration period includes the 2011 flood event which is useful for model parameter identification ahmed et al 2020b the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 within the ostrich optimization toolkit shawn matott 2017 was used for model calibration by maximizing the nse value using 1000 runs for both models the parameters in table 1 were calibrated within their respective range with the objective to have the simulated flows best fit to observed ones 2 4 streamflow performance evaluation the resulting streamflow from each model mesh prima and mesh pdmrof was compared separately against observed flows using visual inspection of the hydrograph and four quantitative performance measures nse nseot nselog and percent bias pbias nse was used to assess the model performance for the overall hydrograph with some focus on peak flow nseot was calculated using the nse formula but for flows over a defined threshold 95th percentile and was used to assess the goodness of fit in peak flow simulation nselog uses the logarithmic transformation of flows within the nse formula to assess the simulation of low flows pbias was used to assess the performance in preserving the overall runoff volume streamflow simulation with nse values greater than 0 4 can be considered acceptable in the prairies also streamflow simulations with pbias values less than 35 may be deemed satisfactory acceptable in the prairies because it is an indicator of event capture rather than water balance error ahmed et al 2020b dibike et al 2020 muhammad et al 2019 streamflow simulations satisfying these criteria are referred to as acceptable satisfactory in this study it is important to note that these criteria were not used as calibration target for the models 2 5 dynamic non contributing area delineation the spatial distribution of water over the landscape resulting from mesh prima was also used to assess the changing dynamic non contributing area for different events over the course of the simulation multiple functions algorithms from whitebox tools wbt lindsay 2016 which is a free open source gis toolbox were used to delineate the landscape to quantify the contributing and non contributing areas of the basin the following are the main steps in non contributing area delineation the depressions and their capacity were identified from the dem using the depth in sink function from wbt then the filling state current storage of each depression identified from the resulting water depth raster from mesh prima for a specific event time step was compared to the capacity of the respective depression the non filled depressions for the specific event time step were identified as depressions with storage smaller than their capacity a raster containing the locations of the non filled depressions and the main rivers is generated for each event this raster and the flow direction raster corresponding to a filled dem were used in the watershed function the resulting raster from the watershed function contains the contributing areas that contributes flow connected to the rivers and the non contributing areas that are dominated by the non filled depressions 2 6 non contributing area evaluation metrics the currently available pfra non contributing area map fig 2 was used as a reference to further validate the non contributing area map generated by mesh prima for an event that has a magnitude of 2 years return period it is important to note that mesh prima was calibrated to fit the streamflow observations only and no calibration was conducted to fit the non contributing area of mesh prima to the pfra map the non contributing area map of mesh prima is dynamic and changes based on the magnitude of the event the dynamic non contributing area maps can be seen as an update of the currently used non contributing area map over the studied basin and the entire prairie region in future two performance metrics were used to assess the ability of mesh prima to replicate the spatial non contributing area of the pfra as an observed data for the 2008 spring snowmelt peak event that is equivalent to a 2 years return period event namely the hit rate hr and the false alarm ratio far these metrics are typically used to assess the spatial agreement between observations and predictions of flooded areas however they are used in this study to assess the spatial agreement between observed and simulated non contributing area the hit rate hr or the probability of detection is used to measure agreement between the simulated and observed non contributing area without penalizing the model for overpredicting the non contributing areas hr is expressed as follows 1 hr a sim a obs a obs where asim and aobs are the simulated mesh prima and observed pfra non contributing areas respectively hr values range from 0 to 1 with a value of 1 indicating an exact match spatially between observed and simulated non contributing areas the false alarm ratio far was used to indicate overprediction of the non contributing area far can be decomposed as false alarms divided by true and false alarms and is expressed as follows 2 far a sim a obs a sim a obs a sim a obs where a sim a obs a a sim a a obs refers to areas that were falsely predicted as non contributing by mesh prima but were observed as contributing by the pfra map false alarm far ranges from 0 to 1 with a value of 0 indicating exact match between observations and simulations with no false alarms overprediction 2 7 flood extents hazard maps the average inundation depth and the frequency of inundation percentage of time steps a dem cell was inundated for each dem cell in the study area resulting from the water depth raster that mesh prima generated over the simulation period were used to understand and quantify the spatial connectivity between land depressions and their ephemerality the frequency of inundation foii for any dem cell i is expressed as 4 foi i n i n t where ni is the number of time steps a dem cell i was inundated over the course of the simulation period and nt is total number of time steps in mesh prima simulations the frequency of inundation raster was used as an indication of the areas that are highly likely to be flooded either permanently or during flooding events the average inundation depth over the simulation period calculated for each dem cell and frequency of inundation combined were used as an indicator of pluvial nival flood hazard over the basin 3 results and analysis 3 1 streamflow performance mesh pdmrof vs mesh prima the streamflow simulation of mesh pdmrof and mesh prima for scrb are shown in fig 3 the mesh pdmrof model showed satisfactory agreement with observations during the calibration period as indicated by the nse value table 2 however during the validation period the performance of mesh pdmrof deteriorated and the model missed many events and had errors in estimating the magnitude of the remaining events it had an unsatisfactory performance in replicating the overall hydrograph nse peak flows nseot low flows nselog and the runoff volume pbias in the validation period table 2 the mesh prima model showed satisfactory streamflow simulation in the calibration period based on the performance metrics table 2 and was better able to capture small peaks e g 2010 and overestimated the 2011 flooding event fig 3 even though the calibration period length was smaller than that of the validation period the performance of mesh prima improved further in the validation period and the model was able to capture peak flow events especially the 2014 spring snowmelt and summer events fig 3 mesh prima shows satisfactory performance in replicating the overall hydrograph and low flows in the calibration and validation periods nse and nselog respectively table 2 it also shows satisfactory and good simulation of the peak flows as indicated by nseot table 2 for the calibration and validation periods respectively and a satisfactory performance in preserving the total runoff volume during the calibration period however mesh prima underestimated the runoff volume in the validation period pbias table 2 because it missed some peaks e g summer 2012 and 2016 and underestimated the magnitude of the 2015 and 2017 peak flows fig 3 this may have been caused by some underestimation in the capa precipitation compared to available observations for those specific events capa underestimated the precipitation of 2012 and 2016 by 12 and 21 respectively figure s2 it was also shown that capa underestimates summer rainfall when compared against observations in another prairie basin budhathoki et al 2020 when capa was used to drive the mesh model the simulations completely miss or underestimate summer and sometimes winter events in multiple prairie and non prairie basins budhathoki et al 2020 davison et al 2016 mekonnen et al 2014 overall mesh prima showed an improved streamflow and peak flow simulation compared to mesh pdmrof although the performance of the latter was better in the calibration period mesh prima outperformed mesh pdmrof in the overall simulation period especially in the validation period when looking at the hydrograph fig 3 and the performance metrics table 2 the streamflow of the scrb is complex and previous studies showed severe errors biases in estimating the flow volume magnitude e g pomeroy et al 2010 2014 however the results are satisfactory by mesh prima model given that a low optimization budget was used to calibrate the model the inherent complexities of the basin and the underestimation in capa precipitation it can be clearly seen that mesh prima provided a better and more realistic simulation of runoff amounts compared to the mesh model with no account for pothole storage figure s3 also mesh prima provided an improved streamflow simulation compared to mesh pdmrof since pdmrof is a conceptual algorithm it did well during the calibration period because it was adequately fitted to specific data during that period however it was unable to preserve the same good performance in the validation period on the other hand prima has more support based on physical justification and it is less likely to be overfitted therefore the performance of the model was satisfactory and it improved further in the validation period more details on the comparison of mesh pdmrof and mesh prima is provided in the discussion section 3 2 dynamic non contributing area map generated by mesh prima the spatial extent of the non contributing area of the basin can be obtained from mesh prima only since mesh pdmrof cannot provide information about the spatial distribution of non contributing areas overall the simulated non contributing area for the spring peak flow event of 2008 showed a good agreement with the observed pfra map especially for the northern and north western parts of the basin fig 4 the simulated non contributing area of 2008 replicated the pfra map with a hr value of 0 90 mesh prima overestimated the non contributing area when compared to the pfra map especially the area south of the two streams confluence with a far of 0 10 fig 4 these areas have many depressions that are clearly visible on available satellite images and the used dem with no prominent streams that can connect them to the main river thus it can be assumed that this area is unlikely to contribute flow to the river network for events with such a low magnitude due to mesh prima s ability to fit the pfra map the prediction of non contributing area of mesh prima is reasonably accurate consequently mesh prima was used to investigate the non contributing areas for different events during the simulation period the non contributing area maps generated by mesh prima that correspond to peak spring snowmelt events for different years in the simulation period are shown in fig 5 the spatial extent of the non contributing area changes from year to year based on the storage in the depressions flood years e g 2011 2013 and 2014 have small non contributing area with 2014 being the smallest low flow years e g 2008 to 2010 and 2016 have greater non contributing area extents compared to flood years fig 5 the river bank area always contributes flow to the river network during both low flow and flood years as it has direct connection to the streams outlet and no depressions can retain water 3 3 contributing area storage and streamflow curves the relationship between the average ponded depth storage and the fractional contributing area of the scrb for the different hydrologic years based on mesh pdmrof and mesh prima is shown in fig 6 it is known that the relationship between contributing area and ponded depth is non linear and hysteretic shook and pomeroy 2011 however mesh pdmrof did not show hysteresis nor nonlinearity in the relationship between the contributing area and the average ponded depth over the basin mesh pdmrof almost followed the same linear curve during filling and emptying the potholes as indicated by increasing or decreasing the storage fig 6 on the other hand mesh prima showed a clear non linear and hysteretic clockwise loop for different years the shape of the relationship is very different from year to year in mesh prima as it is a function of the storage the contributing area increases with the increase in storage wetting phase of potholes in a clockwise direction especially for high flow flood years such as 2011 and 2014 in flood years the contributing area increases until the total basin area contributes flow to the outlet e g 2014 the removal of water from the potholes due to infiltration and or evaporation drying of potholes can cause sudden reduction in the contributing area in a clockwise direction in almost all years fig 6 nested hysteretic loops are found when there were multiple consecutive wetting and drying cycles due to significant snowmelt or rainfall events of the years e g 2011 2014 and 2015 fig 6 mesh pdmrof assumes that the basin has no contributing area and the entire basin does not contribute flow if the depressions are near empty small ponded depths fig 6 on the other hand mesh prima assumes that there is a minimum contributing area riverbank area that always contributes flow to the outlet even when the depressions are near empty small ponded depth mesh pdmrof ignores the fact that defined streams rivers and their banks always contribute flow to the outlet and this has to be considered in scrb that has a well developed river since mesh prima shows a non linear hysteretic relationship between contributing area and ponded depth fig 6 it is consistent with the observed signature of the prairie landscape characteristics both mesh pdmrof and mesh prima showed non linear and clockwise hysteretic relationship between contributing area and streamflow in different years fig 7 and this is very different from the ones in fig 6 there are some instances where a high streamflow is associated with low or medium contributing area e g 2011 and 2014 for both models this shows the contribution from interflow from the third soil layer and baseflow from the bottom of the soil column to the stream network directly the non contributing area was defined based on the connection between potholes that occur mostly due to surface water for mesh pdmrof and surface and interflow from the first two soil layer mesh prima and it does not account for the contribution from third soil layers or from the bottom of the soil column the high streamflow that was associated with almost 0 97 contributing area fraction for 2014 in mesh prima fig 7 is associated with the spring snowmelt peak flow of that year in which the flood was generated by surface runoff between depression on the other hand the high streamflow associated with small contributing area of almost 0 25 for 2014 is associated with the summer event of 2014 which was driven mainly by contribution from the third soil layer rofs3 and the baseflow from the bottom of the soil column rofb that contribute directly to the river fig 7 this is very important as it shows the usefulness of land surface models which can help in tracing and investigating different flood triggering mechanisms in the prairies 4 discussion 4 1 on the relationship between streamflow performance storage and contributing area prima vs pdmrof mesh prima showed an improved simulation of the streamflow compared to mesh pdmrof fig 3 and table 2 and also was able to identify the spatial distribution of ponded water supplemental file section s4 and the spatial non contributing area over the landscape fig 5 mesh prima also showed improved flood simulation flood magnitude timing and pluvial nival flooding extents relative to mesh pdmrof which is needed to assess non fluvial flooding impacts such information especially the pluvial nival flooding extents cannot be obtained using mesh pdmrof or any other prairie hydrologic model latent and sensible heat fluxes to the atmosphere generated by mesh prima were seen to be different from mesh pdmrof due to the differences in the water extents simulated it was beyond the scope of this work to determine if these changes show that the simulation of these fluxes were also improved a separate study could look at other benefits of mesh prima particularly where these relate to other components of an esm if it can be shown that these changes correspond to improved fluxes back to the atmosphere relative to observations then the impacts of mesh prima on local weather prediction could also be explored for example using a version of mesh prima coupled with an atmospheric model e g gem mesh prima is more computationally demanding compared to mesh pdmrof as it needs to redistribute the water over very fine grid cells and due to the amount of information that it produces although a low computational budget was used to calibrate the models e g 1000 model trial mesh prima showed potential to simulate the complex prairie hydrology hydraulics this also shows the robustness of mesh prima as it was able to show satisfactory to good simulation of streamflow and peak flow using a small number of trials for model calibration increasing the calibration budget should further improve the streamflow simulation results pdmrof is a conceptual algorithm and it is based on certain simplifying assumptions that make it partially valid for the prairie region the most important and critical assumption that affects the simulation of pdmrof is that there are no water travel time calculations between the different depressions which affects the magnitude and timing of water reaching the outlet this is very important and needs to be addressed to account for the impact of the varying size depressions and their location distance to the outlet on the streamflow further the parameters of pdmrof are conceptual parameters which means that it is difficult to relate these parameters to field observations this also affects the simulation of pdmrof as it might need more model calibration trials to improve the streamflow simulation more importantly pdmrof is unable to simulate the hysteretic relationship between contributing area and ponded depth which further affects its theoretical credibility as well as its ability to capture the complexities of the potholes and consequently the streamflow on the other hand prima can be considered as a physically based algorithm that simulates the complexities of the prairie potholes it simulates the fill spill and merge split mechanisms between depressions in a fully distributed and dynamic manner and calculates the travel time of water between depressions further it shows potential to simulate the hysteretic relationship between contributing area and storage the only parameter inside prima itself is manning s roughness coefficient which can be related to field observations when they are available even if roughness value is not known a low computational budget for model calibration can be sufficient to arrive at a good simulation of flow and the corresponding inundation extents fig 6 suggests that the relationship between contributing area and storage average ponded water depth is non linear and the shape of the curve changes based on the storage of the potholes the relationship has a different non linear behavior for different years and it might be difficult to come up with a single equation that can describe this relationship during different hydrologic years events of varying magnitude this shows why conceptual algorithms i e pdmrof have difficulties in producing acceptable flow simulation since they use a fixed equation to describe the relation between contributing area and storage further it is important to differentiate between the hysteresis in the contributing area and storage curves fig 6 and the contributing area and streamflow curves fig 7 a model that can predict the first is simulating the actual physics and connections among depressions e g mesh prima however the latter hysteretic relationship is unlikely related to the ability to simulate the dynamics or actual conditions of the depressions correctly mesh pdmrof failed to show hysteretic relationship in fig 6 and consequently did not show satisfactory streamflow simulation however it showed hysteresis in the contributing area and streamflow relationship fig 7 the hysteretic relation in fig 7 is caused by the effect of flow routing in the channel it is known that the relationship between active contributing area and the streamflow is hysteretic even for non prairie watersheds nippgen et al 2015 and this is caused by the effect of the routing that changes the contributing area for the same flow on the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph another possible reason for the hysteresis in that curve is the contribution from baseflow to the streamflow which may associate low contributing area to high streamflow caused by that contribution fig 7 4 2 progression of flooding and pluvial nival flooding hazard in the prairies observations related to the spatial distribution of water over scrb are not readily available to be used to further validate assess the simulation of water distribution over the basin by mesh prima however it was assumed that mesh prima simulated the flooding extents in potholes reasonably well since it successfully simulated both the streamflow and the non contributing area compared to observations therefore the results of the model were used to investigate the spatial extents of pluvial nival flooding over the basin it was shown that a flood can be triggered by different responses from surface and or subsurface flow the 2011 spring flood event was generated by a combined contribution from surface flow between depressions and subsurface flow the 2014 spring flood event was mainly driven by contribution from surface flow the magnitude of different components controlling the generation of flow e g snowpack depth antecedent moisture conditions of the pothole and soil available energy to melt the snowpack can be manipulated to investigate which combination generates high or low flow such information would help in further understanding of the complex prairie hydrology and flood flow generation in the prairies using the proposed physically based model mesh prima in future studies an average inundation depth map fig 8 over the entire simulation period can be generated and used to explore the possible connections between potholes it can be noticed also that most of the potholes in the basin are ephemeral having very shallow to shallow depth with very low to low frequency of inundation fig 8 while the deep potholes are constantly wet as indicated from the same figure the depressions are connected through very shallow flow paths areas that are ephemeral intermittent as indicated by the frequency of inundation plot fig 8 once these connections are established many potholes can merge to form larger depressions and increase the contributing area significantly e g central and northern parts of the basin figure s4 for 2014 and average inundation depth in fig 8 maps similar to the average inundation depth or the frequency of inundation generated by mesh prima can be generated under storms conditions of known probabilities to produce hazard maps such as the one shown in figure s4 for 2014 flood such information in pothole dominated areas has not been studied extensively and are needed to help practitioners decision makers and the public in assessing the situation of the agricultural residential and commercial properties that reside near potholes the hazard maps are important in assessing the urban expansion and investigating future development locations such maps are also valuable in assessing the vulnerability of different areas in the basin to floods which can contribute to the reduction of the associated flooding risks in the prairie environment 5 conclusions the mesh model was modified by adding a physically based algorithm prima to improve the representation of prairie potholes and the non contributing area dynamics in land surface models the performance of mesh prima and the mesh model with its current prairie algorithm mesh pdmrof was tested on the smith creek research basin scrb in saskatchewan canada mesh prima showed improved streamflow and peak flow simulation in the scrb compared to the existing pothole runoff algorithm mesh pdmrof more importantly mesh prima simulated the potholes in a fully dynamic and distributed manner and was able to identify the spatial distribution of water and the spatial extents of the non contributing area over the basin mesh prima simulated a non linear and hysteretic relationship between the contributing area and the ponded water depth unlike mesh pdmrof that failed to show the same behavior the non contributing area map generated by mesh prima for an event with a magnitude of a 2 year return period showed a good agreement with the commonly used observation based pfra static non contributing area map mesh prima generated dynamic non contributing area maps that change based on the magnitude of the event such dynamic maps can be valuable for informing public policy practitioners and decision makers and for re evaluating different basins in the prairie region the flooding extents over the basin generated by mesh prima can be used to assess pluvial nival flood hazard over the basin credit authorship contribution statement mohamed ismaiel ahmed conceptualization methodology software validation formal

4397,seeking more water yield in the over utilized water resources regions that are home to nearly 35 of the population all over the world is a great challenge under future climate change impacts of land conversion i e land conversion from cropland to grassland and forest and climate change during near future 2030s 2021 2040 mid future 2050s 2041 2060 and far future 2080s 2071 2090 periods on vegetation dynamics lai and water budgets evapotranspiration and runoff were investigated in a typical over utilized water resources area of china xiong an new area xna using the waves ecohydrological model future climate change impacts were assessed with statistically downscaled forcing of 18 global circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathways rcps using secondary bias correction technique projected future climate indicated that xna would become warmer and wetter in future the waves model was calibrated against remotely sensed lai and et data modeling results during the historical period of 1982 2012 showed that forest evaporated more water 32 0 mm yr 1 than cropland while grassland used almost the same amount of water as cropland under future climate conditions both water use and water yield would increase in cropland and grassland due to increased precipitation forest was predicted to use 9 5 14 6 36 4 55 8 mm yr 1 more water and to have 2 6 52 4 2 6 51 1 mm yr 1 more water yield in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and in all three future periods 2030s 2050s and 2080s under rcp8 5 due to greater increases in precipitation afforestation is not recommended as a land management practice for more water yield in near future but could be implemented to achieve a win win situation for more water yield and more forest coverage in mid and far future periods in xna due to increased precipitation this study highlights that uncertainties in projected future climate pose formidable challenges in management of vegetative land for more water yield in the over utilized water resources regions keywords water resources management climate change land conversion over utilization water carbon coupling 1 introduction with increasing water demands due to economic development and population growth water resources have been over exploited and over utilized in many regions of the world ragab and prudhomme 2002 kahil et al 2015 more than 35 of the population all over the world live with severe water scarcity in the over utilized water resources regions kahil et al 2015 climate change has been widely reported to exacerbate water scarcity in the over utilized water resources regions and the impact is expected to increase in the future vorosmarty et al 2000 milly et al 2008 water yield or runoff which is largely determined by climate and land use is vital for ecological conservation and social development in these regions rohatyn et al 2018 however management of water resources mainly water yield in the over utilized water resources regions is still a great challenge because of complex nonlinear interactions between regional water availability and vegetation and the difficulties in runoff simulation caused by intensive human interferences vegetation as an important regulator of the water cycle in response to climate change has been simplified and even neglected in many previous studies about the impacts of climate change and land use change on water yield yang et al 2014 2019 gabiri et al 2019 yilmaz et al 2019 vegetation controls about 60 of the water flux from the land to the atmosphere and its growth is largely affected by temperature precipitation solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and co2 concentration etc schlesinger and bernhardt 1997 theurillat and guisan 2001 global climate change has already significantly impacted terrestrial ecosystems and the impacts are expected to be even greater in the future seddon et al 2016 but the responses of vegetation growth to climate change vary greatly spatially because the combined impacts of elevated atmospheric co2 and rising temperature on vegetation growth greatly depend on biomes and biota piao et al 2006 climate change has been reported to have great impacts on regional water resources directly by precipitation changes and indirectly by affecting vegetation growth ivanov et al 2008 complex nonlinear interactions between regional water availability and vegetation also exist across different spatio temporal scales scheffer et al 2010 on the one hand vegetation adapts to the changing water resources through different growth strategies such as changing stomatal conductance theurillat and guisan 2001 on the other hand vegetation can alter water resources through affecting evaportranspiration and soil water content li et al 2018 thus accurate vegetation growth is vital for the simulations of water use and water yield under future climate change water yield is difficult to simulate in the over utilized water resources regions especially under land conversion and future climate change conditions land management practices have been widely proposed and implemented as effective measures to achieve more water yield brown et al 2005 ellison et al 2012 however predicting the impacts of land use cover change on the hydrological cycle is still difficult especially under climate change conditions due to the complex interactions among different drivers including climate vegetation growth catchment hydrological characteristics etc kirchner et al 2020 water yield under land use change and climate change is generally estimated by hydrological models hydrological models have poor evapotranspiration et simulation because vegetation growth is not well parameterized in these models zhang et al 2020 this problem is more serious in arid regions where et is the most important component of the water cycle requiring more than 90 of annual precipitation arora 2002 more importantly hydrological models based on calibrated rainfall runoff relationship during historical periods may no longer be applicable due to nonstationary rainfall runoff relationship caused by intensive human interference in over utilized water resources regions yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 ecohydrological models primarily based on water carbon energy cycles rather than on a rainfall runoff relationship can well consider interaction between vegetation growth and regional water resources chen et al 2015 thus the long term water yield can be credibly simulated by making use of the coupled water carbon energy ecohydrological models based on accurate ecosystem evapotranspiration estimation rather than by detangling non stationary runoff time series caused by multiple human water utilization behaviors the ecohydrological models are difficult to be calibrated in data poor regions due to lack of sufficient observations or intensive human interferences on ecohydrological processes different from hydrological models the water cycle and vegetation growth of ecohydrological models need to be constrained at the same time which means more data are needed to calibrate ecohydrological models for the ungauged or data poor regions some researches have attempted to use published hydrological parameter values in previous studies bárdossy 2007 parajka et al 2007 zhang and chiew 2009 li et al 2014 however adopted parameter values for gauged sites cannot simulate runoff reliably in ungauged or data poor regions with little observed streamflow data alternatively remotely sensed data have been used to calibrate hydrological models including evapotranspiration and vegetation growth data pedinotti et al 2014 martin et al 2016 baguis and roulin 2017 accurately simulating of et with the help of remotely sensed et can lead to accurately simulating of runoff by hydrological models because et closely relates to soil moisture that is also vital for runoff simulation it has been proved that it is possible to satisfactorily simulate runoff when hydrological model is calibrated against et zhang et al 2020 vegetation growth is generally measured by leaf area index lai or normalized difference vegetation index ndvi recently many remotely sensed et and lai ndvi datasets have been generated based on different algorithms myneni et al 2002 li et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 therefore remotely sensed data can be used to calibrate ecohydrological models effectively in ungauged regions in this study impacts of land conversion and climate change on vegetation dynamics canopy lai and water budgets et and runoff were investigated in an over utilized water resources region using a coupled water carbon energy ecohydrological model waves the xiong an new area xna a district that central government allocates huge resources to extend links among metropolis beijing tianjin and hebei province was chosen as a case study area the xna is a typical over utilized water resources region located in the north china plain significant land cover use change is anticipated to occur in the future as forest cover increases from the current 10 to 40 by 2035 due to ecological restoration increased forest cover may bring many ecological benefits but it will also increase ecosystem water use it is important to understand the impacts of increased forest cover in xna on water yield and its sustainability especially in the context of climate change the waves model water vegetation energy and solute model see zhang et al 1996 with a coupled water carbon energy structure was chosen because it can simulate ecosystem water use and water yield well under changing conditions in this study water use et and water yield runoff of three typical ecosystems cropland grassland and forest in three future periods near future 2030s 2021 2040 mid future 2050s 2041 2060 and far future 2080s 2071 2090 were assessed using projected future climate forcing data from 18 global circulation models gcms in coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 under three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the specific objectives of this study were to 1 test the capability of the waves model for simulating vegetation growth and the water cycle in an over utilized water resources region of china i e xna 2 quantify the individual impacts of land conversion and climate change and their combined impacts on vegetation growth and water budgets in xna 3 assess water yield of xna with different land management options under future climate change 4 provide land management recommendations for more water yield in the over utilized water resources regions under future climate conditions 2 methods 2 1 study area the xna was selected as the study area to investigate impacts of land conversion and climate change on water budgets in the over utilized water resources regions the xna is a district of china that central government allocates huge resources to extend links among metropolis beijing tianjin and hebei province it includes three counties i e xiongxian anxin and rongcheng see fig 1 the xna is located in the north china plain and is the location of the region s largest natural freshwater wetland baiyangdian lake since the 1980s the water surface area of baiyangdian lake has decreased significantly from historical levels of 1000 km2 to less than 366 km2 and dried out periodically due to over exploitation of water resources moiwo et al 2010 according to future development plans the xna will undergo a significant land conversion in order to increase forest coverage from 10 to 40 by 2035 for ecological restoration resulting in greater demand for water resources in the new area thus one important point of interest for local water resource management authorities in this new area is to increase forest coverage at no expense of water availability or even to reach a win win situation with both more forest coverage and more water availability in future the xna is located in the eastern portion of the daqing river basin drb the drb is one of the five major rivers in the haihe river basin the drb resides within the latitude and longitude ranges of 113 39 e 116 50 e and 38 23 n 40 09 n flowing across hebei beijing tianjin and shanxi provinces fig 1 it covers an area of 4 3 104 km2 of which 43 are mountain and hilly areas and 57 are plain and depression areas the drb has an elevation ranging from 7 m to 2286 m above mean sea level the soil is characterized by cinnamon soil fluvo aquic soil and coarse soil the predominant land use types in the drb are cropland 45 5 grassland 20 8 and forest 18 8 based on land use data from the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn default aspx the drb has a temperate continental monsoon climate dominated by summer rainfall the mean annual precipitation 1961 2016 of drb is about 518 1 mm that mainly falls in july and august about 56 the mean annual temperature 1961 2014 is 11 1 c and the temperature increases gradually from northwest to southeast across the basin 2 2 ecohydrological model the waves model is a one dimensional ecohydrological model developed by zhang and dawes 1998 it is a process based model that simulates the dynamic interactions between the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum using a daily time step and is therefore well suited to investigate the hydrological and ecological responses to changes in land management and climatic variation zhang et al 1996 zhang and dawes 1998 the model has been successfully applied to simulate ecosystem water use deep soil water groundwater recharge water use efficiency and crop yield in china australia and other regions wang et al 2001 kang et al 2003 green et al 2007 tian et al 2017 in waves available energy is partitioned into transpiration and soil evaporation using beer s law et is calculated by the penman monteith formula based on a big leaf model the model can accurately simulate the effects of stomatal conductance on vegetation carbon sequestration and the coupled canopy and atmosphere relationship using the omega approach proposed by jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 actual carbon assimilation is estimated as the multiplicative product of the maximum carbon assimilation value and the relative growth rate the maximum carbon assimilation is the maximum growth rate under optimum conditions the relative growth rate is estimated using the integrated rate methodology proposed by wu et al 1994 and limited by the relative availabilities of solar radiation water and nutrients after respiration the remaining assimilated carbon is dynamically allocated to leaf stem and root carbon pools according to different priorities as described by running and gower 1991 this method allows leaf area to dynamically respond to external environmental factors such as solar radiation temperature and precipitation and are set in advance soil water movement is simulated using a fully finite difference numerical solution of the richards equation dawes and short 1993 overland flow is generated when rainfall intensity exceeds soil infiltration capacity and when rain falls onto the saturated soil surface lateral flow can occur at any saturated soil layer and is simulated by darcy s law if slope is non zero to solve the richards equation the analytical soil water model developed by white and broadbridge 1988 is used to describe the relationships among water potential volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity a more detailed description of the waves model can be found in zhang and dawes 1998 2 3 data the meteorological data required to run the waves model include precipitation maximum and minimum temperature vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation based on the location of meteorological stations around the basin and for the convenience of model calibration three simulation points were selected in the drb in order to calibrate the parameters of three typical ecosystems cropland grassland and forest as shown in fig 1 the genclim program a modification of the mountain microclimate simulator mt clim proposed by running et al 1987 was used to generate the meteorological data required by the waves model based on the program daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation data from the langfang baoding and yuxian meteorological stations were interpolated to adjacent simulation points 1 cropland 2 grassland and 3 forest with elevation and aspect related corrections the solar radiation of simulation points can be estimated by multiplying the daily total extraterrestrial insolation on a horizontal surface daily total potential radiation by a linear scalar the daily total transmittance atmospheric transmissivity is calculated as an exponential function of diurnal temperature amplitude of the meteorological stations bristow and campbell 1984 the potential radiation model was proposed and developed by garnier and ohmura 1968 buffo et al 1972 and swift 1976 the vapor pressure deficit is derived from the estimated dew point and air temperature using equations of murray 1967 if dew point data are not available which is common the night minimum temperature is assumed to be equal to the daily dew point the details of program can be found in running et al 1987 the daily precipitation and daily maximum and minimum temperatures at the three meteorological stations were obtained from the meteorological station dataset of the national meteorological information center http data cma cn the baoding station was the closest meteorological station to the xna and was selected to simulate impacts of land use and climate changes on water budgets of the xna the remotely sensed lai and et data were used to calibrate the waves model the lai data were obtained from the gimms lai3g dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 083 0 083 and a temporal resolution of 15 days zhu et al 2013 the et data were obtained from the gleam et dataset version 3a with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of one day based on remote sensing data and ground meteorological data miralles et al 2010 projected future climate forcing data were obtained from 18 gcms under a very low emission scenario rcp2 6 a medium stabilization emission scenario rcp4 5 and a very high emission scenario rcp8 5 the data for the 18 gcms were obtained from cmip5 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 detailed descriptions of the 18 gcms can be found in the supplementary materials table s1 2 4 statistical downscaling method and secondary bias correction the statistical downscaling method sdsm developed by liu and zuo 2012 was used to downscale the monthly gcm data to daily site data the downscaling method is based on empirical relationships between historical observation data and future data from the gcm simulations the downscaling method has two steps spatial downscaling and temporal downscaling first the monthly climate projections from gcms are downscaled to specific sites using the inverse distance weighted interpolation method a bias correction procedure by analyzing the observed historical climate data and gcm simulated projections for a 40 years period of 1960 1999 is used to correct site based monthly gcm values after spatial downscaling bias in gcm projected future climate is corrected with an assumption that the monthly gcm bias is stationary in the future a modified version of the weather generator wgen is then used to stochastically generate daily climate series for specific sites this method can be easily applied to any archived monthly gcm data for any site and across multiple time periods as the approach requires only monthly gcm data and daily historical climate records unlike other statistical downscaling methods this method does not require atmospheric circulation or sea surface temperatures as predictors and could run on a small computer thus greatly reducing computing cost the statistical downscaling method has been widely validated in china and australia wang et al 2016 he et al 2018 the sdsm attempts to correct stationary bias and systemic errors such as mean bias and projected trends in the future but it cannot correct the resulting incorrect representations of dynamic and or physical processes or non stationary bias simulated by gcms liu and zuo 2012 therefore the statistical properties of the outputs of the waves model driven by downscaled gcm data are not expected to be similar with those driven by observations the differences between them can be corrected by a secondary bias correction sbc procedure yang et al 2016 in this study sbc was used to correct the multi year averages of waves model outputs x x g x gb x ob where x is the value after correction xg is the value from the waves model forced with downscaled gcm data x gb is the mean value over a historical baseline period from the same simulation and x ob is the corresponding mean value over the historical baseline from an identical simulation forced with observed climate variables 2 5 parameter estimation in the waves model vegetation and soil parameters must be calibrated locally soil parameters can be estimated based on knowledge of the soil layering and the parameters of the broadbridge white soil model broadbridge and white 1988 that model describes the relationships between soil water potential volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity the soil depth was set as 3 m and was divided into three layers the soil textures of the different layers were obtained from the topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 100 cm soil texture maps produced by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations http www fao org the initial soil parameters were derived from the mean value of each type of soil texture recommended for the broadbridge white soil model the model uses 26 vegetation parameters including rainfall interception coefficient maximum carbon assimilation rate optimum growth temperature specific leaf area respiration coefficients of leaves and roots leaf mortality rate etc most of these vegetation parameters can be measured directly or obtained from literature dealing with vegetation physiology only a few of the remaining of vegetation parameters have to be calibrated locally the grassland and forest in the study area were dominated by annual pasture and deciduous broadleaf forest respectively the cropland was dominated by the winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer corn zea mays l rotation because ecosystem water use was mainly concentrated in summer and due to the complexity of simulating two types of vegetation simultaneously in the model the cropland was simulated as a single annual crop the vegetation parameters of cropland were mainly based on summer corn in order to compensate for the rotation characteristics of winter wheat and summer maize both crop conditions were taken into consideration in terms of vegetation growing season accumulated temperature and monthly fluctuations in lai especially in winter the waves model was calibrated against remotely sensed lai and et data for the three typical ecosystems of the drb lai is an important factor in regulating vegetation carbon sequestration transpiration and micro meteorological environment and was used to calibrate vegetation growth and the energy and water balances the remotely sensed et was used to calibrate the energy and water balances since measured et and runoff data were not available in the drb due to intensive human activity and non stationary water cycle the historical period was set as 1982 2014 during which meteorological and remotely sensed data were available according to the typical 2 1 separation of available data for calibration and validation 1982 2003 was used as the calibration period and 2004 2014 was used as the validation period the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the performance of the waves model the parameters were initially calibrated using a genetic algorithm goldberg 1989 and then were optimized manually in terms of their physical meaning 2 6 modeling scenarios in this study six scenarios with different vegetation types and climate forcing data were designed to investigate the individual and combined impacts of land conversion and climate change on vegetation dynamics and water budgets in the xna detailed descriptions of the six scenarios are given in table 1 scenario 0 s0 was designed for the historical climate 1982 2014 and current vegetation type i e cropland s0 was used as the baseline for assessing the impacts of land conversion and climate change on water budgets scenario 1 s1 and scenario 2 s2 were the same as s0 except the vegetation types were grassland and forest respectively scenario 3 s3 was the same as s0 except the climate forcing was the projected future climate data from 18 gcms scenario 4 s4 and scenario 5 s5 considered the impacts of both land conversion and future climate change s4 was designed for grassland while s5 was designed for forest under the projected future climate data from the 18 gcms the differences between s1 and s0 as well as between s2 and s0 represented the impacts of land conversion on water budgets the differences between s3 and s0 represented the impacts of future climate change on water budgets the differences between s4 and s0 as well as between s5 and s0 represented the combined impacts of land conversion and climate change on water budgets soil properties were assumed to be constant in the future so the soil parameters of the model were set to the same in the six scenarios 3 results 3 1 future climate change of the xna four meteorological variables were used to represent future climatic conditions centered on the near future 2030s 2021 2040 mid future 2050s 2041 2060 and far future 2080s 2071 2090 periods including precipitation p daily mean temperature t a potential et pet and solar radiation r a pet was calculated using the priestley taylor equation based on projected meteorological variables from the gcms taking 1981 2010 as the baseline period the mean annual changes of the four meteorological variables during the three future periods projected by the 18 gcms under the three rcps are shown in fig 2 consistent increases in p t a and pet over time were found under all three rcps the changes in p were almost the same 6 5 in all three future periods under rcp2 6 mean annual p increased by 7 3 15 1 and 13 7 in the 2030s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp4 5 the changes in p increased monotonically from 8 2 in the 2030s to 19 5 in the 2080s under rcp8 5 t a increased by 8 1 in the 2030s but increased by about 10 5 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp2 6 the changes in t a increased over time from 8 3 2030s to 17 1 2080s under rcp4 5 and from 9 6 2030s to 32 1 2080s under rcp8 5 projected future p and t a indicated that the xna would become warmer and wetter pet changes increased with time ranging from 2 4 2030s to 7 6 2080s under rcp2 6 from 1 8 2030s to 8 6 2080s under rcp4 5 and from 1 6 2030s to 11 3 2080s under rcp8 5 compared with the baseline value r a initially decreased by 0 03 0 6 and 1 1 in the 2030s under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and then increased by 4 5 3 7 and 2 4 in the 2080s the directions of seasonal changes in the four meteorological variables were consistent with those of annual changes fig s1 3 2 model calibration and validation simulated lai and et agreed well with the remotely sensed values in all three typical ecosystems shown in table 2 and fig 3 the waves model was calibrated over the historical period using remotely sensed daily et and half monthly lai as shown in table 2 the r2 and nse values for lai in all three typical ecosystems during the calibration and validation periods were greater than 0 65 and 0 60 respectively the rmse of lai in the cropland and grassland were less than 0 50 m2 m2 while the rsme of lai in forest was slightly larger than the other two statistical results for et simulation performance shown in table 2 indicated that the model performed well in simulating daily et nse greater than 0 60 r2 greater than 0 65 rmse less than 0 75 mm d 1 the slopes of the regression lines between simulated and remotely sensed lai and et in the three ecosystems were all close to but slightly less than 1 0 fig 3 indicating that the waves model tended to slightly underestimate both lai and et in all three ecosystems these results indicated that vegetation and soil parameters were successfully calibrated and the waves model was capable of reproducing both lai and et dynamics satisfactorily in the study area hence the calibrated model can be further used to evaluate the impacts of land use and climate changes on vegetation dynamics and water budgets in the xna 3 3 impacts of land conversion during the historical period the mean annual changes in lai et and runoff caused by land conversion under historical climatic condition are shown in fig 4 the differences between s1 and s0 represented the impacts of land conversion from cropland to grassland and showed that lai decreased by 9 7 0 05 m2 m2 et increased by 0 6 2 3 mm yr 1 and runoff decreased by 2 1 2 8 mm yr 1 the differences between s2 and s0 represented the impacts of the land conversion from cropland to forest and showed that estimated lai et and runoff changed by 81 2 0 36 m2 m2 8 3 32 0 mm yr 1 and 31 1 32 8 mm yr 1 respectively during the historical period 1982 2014 impacts of land conversion from cropland to grassland were marginal especially on et and runoff but impacts of land conversion from cropland to forest were more substantial the results showed that cropland would generate more water yield i e runoff than grassland and forest under the historical climatic condition 3 4 impacts of future climate change estimated mean annual changes in lai et and runoff caused by future climate change are shown in fig 5 future climate changes have a negative impact on vegetation growth and this negative impact would generally increase with the periods of projection compared with the baseline period mean annual lai decreased by 12 1 in the 2030s and decreased by almost the same amount of 16 0 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp2 6 lai showed a monotonous decrease under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with ranges from 13 2 to 24 6 and 15 4 to 44 4 respectively future climate change would suppress the vegetation growth but it would both increase water use and water yield estimated mean annual et all increased gradually with the periods of projection under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with ranges from 2 6 to 4 4 from 1 7 to 6 7 and from 2 2 to 10 6 respectively the mean annual runoff increased by about 20 in three future periods under rcp2 6 increased by 30 4 in the 2030s and remained around 56 0 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and increased continuously from 34 9 to 68 1 under rcp8 5 the absolute changes in lai et and runoff can be found in the table s2 in the supplementary compared with the mean annual values during the baseline period of 1981 2010 the changes in mean annual lai et and runoff in the three future periods under the three rcps were in the same direction however the magnitudes of the changes under the three rcps were different in different future periods estimated lai et and runoff showed greater changes under the high emission scenario rcp8 5 than under the lower emission scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 in the 2080s but similar responses were not observed in the 2030s and 2050s the uncertainties in estimated lai et and runoff changes from 18 gcms were shown using violin plot in the fig 5 as well the uncertainties of estimated lai and et changes caused by 18 gcms were less than those of runoff changes 3 5 combined impacts of land conversion and climate change 3 5 1 land conversion from cropland to grassland one land management option considered for the xna is to convert cropland to grassland the estimated combined impacts of land conversion from cropland to grassland and climate change on lai et and runoff are shown in fig 6 the land conversion from cropland to grassland would not change the fact that future climate change suppressed vegetation growth increased water use and water yield estimated lai decreased by about 20 in all three future periods under rcp2 6 but showed even greater reductions under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with ranges from 19 6 to 27 1 and from 20 9 to 41 3 respectively estimated et increased gradually with the periods of projection from 4 4 to 6 6 under rcp2 6 from 3 5 to 9 6 under rcp4 5 and from 4 2 to 15 2 under rcp8 5 estimated runoff increased from 18 6 to 10 8 under rcp2 6 increased from 23 4 in the 2030s to the almost same amount of 45 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and continuously increased from 27 4 to 50 7 under rcp8 5 compared with values during the baseline period of 1981 2010 the similarity of the trends and magnitudes of changes in lai et and runoff in s3 and s4 showed that climate change dominated the changes in vegetation growth and water budgets in grassland besides estimated changes in lai et and runoff under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were generally greater than those under rcp2 6 the changes in lai et and runoff in the three future periods under the three rcps were in the same direction but uncertainties of different gcms are large in the same period as shown in violin plots the uncertainties of estimated lai and et changes from 18 gcms were less than those of runoff changes 3 5 2 land conversion from cropland to forest the other possible land management option for the xna is to convert cropland to forest the estimated combined impacts of land conversion from cropland to forest and climate change on lai et and runoff are shown in fig 7 estimated lai would all increased in all future periods under three rcps compared with the baseline value but the magnitude of increases gradually decreased with the periods of projection under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with ranges from 74 2 to 71 4 from 71 1 to 63 5 and from 71 0 to 46 8 respectively estimated et continuously increased from 10 9 to 12 4 and from 10 4 to 14 6 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 respectively et increases changed from 9 5 in the 2030s to 13 6 in the 2050s and then to 12 7 in the 2080s under rcp4 5 lai and et would all increased in the future periods but runoff decreased slightly under rcp2 6 and mostly increased under the other two rcps specially estimated runoff decreased from 7 1 to 11 7 under rcp2 6 decreased by 1 3 in the 2030s but increased by about 30 0 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and continuously increased from 2 6 to 52 4 under rcp8 5 compared with the impacts of future climate change on lai et and runoff the combined impacts of land conversion from cropland to forest and climate change caused opposite changes in lai amplified the changes in et and narrowed or reversed changes in runoff the magnitude of lai increases gradually decreased with the periods of projection which was mainly due to the increasing negative impact of future climate change on vegetation growth land conversion from cropland to forest would lead to greater increases in water use of 15 30 mm yr 1 mainly due to precipitation increase in the future the magnitudes and signs of changes in runoff were significantly different among the three rcps especially for the changes in the 2050s and 2080s 4 discussion 4 1 vegetation responses to land conversion and climate change waves estimated a slight decrease in lai when cropland was converted to grassland and estimated a significant increase in lai when cropland was converted to forest lai of forest was generally larger than lai of crop or grass under the same climatic condition which was consistent with the findings of others colombo et al 2003 fang et al 2014 kahiu and hanan 2018 the lai differences between crop and grass under the same climatic condition mainly depend on plant functional type the lai of grassland is smaller than that of cropland which may be caused by its larger aerodynamic resistance leaf respiration coefficient and smaller carbon assimilation rate in the waves model in our study summer corn c4 crop and annual pasture were simulated as the main vegetation types of cropland and grassland respectively the decrease in lai when the cropland was converted to grassland was consistent with the finding of alton 2018 future climate change would significantly impact vegetation growth and the impacts are expected to be even greater over time the reductions in lai of cropland were mainly the combined result of impacts of rising temperature on carbon assimilation and respiration morison et al 2007 cheng et al 2014 hatfield and prueger 2015 carbon assimilation i e photosynthesis gradually increases with rising temperature up to some optimal temperature and then decreases while respiration increases monotonically with rising temperature morison et al 2007 the estimated decreases in lai suggest that the rising temperature has a greater impact on respiration than on assimilation the reason is likely due to the fact that the calibrated optimal temperatures of the three vegetation types for growth were very close to the mean daily temperature during the growing season for the historical period thus any increase in temperature in the future could suppress vegetation growth additionally rising temperature has an indirect negative impact on vegetation growth in waves model via aggravating water stress because rising temperature is associated with increases in potential et there is no consensus about the response of vegetation growth to climate change stephen et al 2008 krishnaswamy et al 2014 seddon et al 2016 and the response of specific vegetation types to climate change depends on the regional climate regimes gao et al 2017 but predicted responses of vegetation growth in cropland in this study were consistent with previous assessments that climate change may suppress the vegetation growth luo et al 2008 gao et al 2017 previous studies have shown that vegetation growth responses to climate change can vary dramatically because of the differences in plant functioning structure and distribution piao et al 2006 negrón juárez et al 2009 the lai reductions when cropland was converted to grassland in the future were mainly caused by climate change because of small difference 0 05 m2 m2 was estimated when cropland was converted to grassland under historical climatic condition fig 4 but the increases in lai when cropland was converted to forest in the future were largely caused by land conversion because the negative impacts of climate change on lai were offset by the positive impacts of land conversion from cropland to forest 0 36 m2 m2 the different trends of lai with the periods of projection among the emission scenarios were mainly caused by different trends of temperature increases the temperature first increased to some maximum value and then almost remained unchanged under rcp2 6 continuously increased with time under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which were consistent with the trends of lai reductions these results indicate that changes in vegetative land and climate had significant impacts on vegetation growth and it is therefore essential to consider the impacts of both on the future water yield of the xna 4 2 water budgets response to land conversion and climate change land conversion affects the regional water budgets mainly in two ways direct impacts on the timing and magnitude of et and indirect impacts of vegetation coverage and types on streamflow generation claessens et al 2006 liu et al 2008 the results of the land conversion scenarios showed that water use was higher in forest than in grassland and cropland under the historical climatic condition which was caused by the greater water demand of the forest because of its denser canopy and deeper root system zhang et al 2001 a slight increase in water use was observed when cropland was converted to grassland even though the cropland had a larger lai than grassland this may have been caused by greater soil evaporation 52 due to the larger evaporated areas in grassland along with the changes of vegetative land urbanized area would be the most noticeable changes in land use in the xna and would have significant impacts on water resources in the future the expected impacts of urbanization include reduced infiltration baseflow and lag times of runoff after rainfall and increased storm flow volumes peak discharge frequency of floods and surface runoff du et al 2012 however the impacts of urbanization on water resources are out of scope of this study and will be further investigated in the future climate change especially changes in temperature and precipitation can have significant impacts on water budgets nash and gleick 1991 generally increases in temperature and precipitation can lead to increases in et and vice versa mishra and lilhare 2016 in waves model et is calculated using penman monteith formula which is closely related to solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and temperature etc the solar radiation would decrease in 2030s but pet would still increase due to the increased temperature the water use of cropland still increased in the future though the future climate change would suppress the vegetation growth which was probably caused by increasing precipitation and pet changes in runoff are largely determined by changes in precipitation cheng et al 2014 reshmidevi et al 2018 in this study runoff increased in all three future periods under all three rcps mainly in response to increased precipitation besides as an important regulator of water resources in response to climate change vegetation is crucial for water resources under future climate change infiltration capacity has been reported to increase as a power law function of aboveground biomass in water limited ecosystems thompson et al 2015 lai was used to represent vegetation growth in this study lai is generally proportional to aboveground biomass so infiltration capacity may decrease with the decreased lai in the future that is benefit for runoff generation the increases in precipitation were amplified more than two fold in runoff which agreed with previous research sankarasubramanian et al 2001 chiew et al 2006 overall the relative changes in et were smaller than those observed for runoff under climate change which was consistent with the findings of al mukhtar et al 2014 predicting water yield under the combined impacts of land conversion and climate change is of great importance for understanding the hydrologic processes for this over utilized water resources region under different land management options when both changes in vegetative land and climate were considered i e s4 and s5 the direction of predicted changes in et in the three future periods under all rcps was the same as the direction of the impacts of climate change alone this suggests that climate change is more dominant than land conversion in controlling et in the xna however the runoff showed different responses to the combined impacts of land conversion and climate change the effect of land conversion from cropland to forest on runoff was greater than that of climate change but the trend was opposite for grassland the runoff reductions in forest were due to the increases in runoff caused by climate change being offset by the decreases in runoff caused by land conversions 32 8 mm yr 1 this suggested that climate change especially regarding precipitation was more dominant than land conversion from cropland to forest on the direction of the water yield change besides the changes in vegetative land would change infiltration capacity thus water yield the infiltration capacity of forest is generally larger than those of crop and grass thompson et al 2015 which may along with higher water use lead to decreased runoff in the three periods under rcp2 6 and in the 2030s under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 overall estimated changes in runoff had wider ranges than those of lai and et under climate change which indicated that uncertainties in projected climate change by different gcms pose formidable challenges in estimating water yield in the over utilized water resources regions 4 3 management of vegetative land for more water yield in the over utilized water resources regions the projected climate forcing data used in this study showed that the xna would become warmer and wetter in the future which was consistent with the results of previous studies in the haihe river basin yuan et al 2005 li and ding 2012 the future climate change of the xna brings both opportunities and challenges to future water yield and land management according to the simulated results in this study both cropland and grassland in both near future and far future periods would have greater water use and water yield due to projected increases in precipitation impacts of afforestation on water budgets varied with different climatic conditions basically afforestation would lead to less water yield in all three future periods under rcp2 6 and in the near future under rcp4 5 but it would lead to more water yield in other cases due to greater increases in precipitation therefore afforestation is not recommended as a future land management practice for more water yield in the xna in the near future and should be implemented carefully to achieve a win win situation for more water yield and larger forest cover in the mid and far future periods for the over utilized water resources regions water resources management is still challenging due to complex nonlinear interactions between regional water availability and vegetation and the difficulties in runoff simulation caused by intensive human interferences this study accounted complex interactions between vegetation and regional water resources by making use of a coupled water carbon energy ecohydrological model which also can credibly simulate long term water availability based on accurate ecosystem evapotranspiration estimation rather than by detangling non stationary runoff time series caused by multiple human water utilization behaviors the results of this study can be used as a reference for more water yield in the over utilized water resources regions the management of water resources has been sought by changing land use cover types to integrate the various potential attributes of water resources using a hydro economic model and cooperative game theory kahil et al 2015 2016 afforestation has been considered an effective means of alleviating negative impacts of climate change in many over utilized water resources regions huang et al 2003 betts and richard 2011 afforestation can mitigate negative impacts of climate change not only through its biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes but also by its effect on water budgets through land cover use changes bastin et al 2019 determining how to balance the impacts of afforestation on climate change and water resources is difficult in these regions kirchner et al 2020 the results presented in this study showed that crop grass or other short vegetation are more suited to these regions than forest because this type of vegetation consumes less water than forests under the same climatic conditions this paper highlights the role of climatic conditions with regard to land management in order to obtain more water yield especially in connection with afforestation in this study more water yield was specifically targeted as the change in runoff or streamflow for water resources management the influence of land management on water yield over the lifetime of any options that are introduced must be evaluated carefully under changing climate also the ecological effects of land management should be considered in order to effectively evaluate the trade offs between water yield impacts and the provision of ecosystem goods services and values including regulation of micro climate biodiversity social values etc bonan et al 1992 brauman et al 2007 poff et al 2016 the uncertainties or spread of the predicted changes by waves model is obvious the uncertainties of the output variables lai et and runoff are resulted from the uncertainties of two or more meteorological variables because they are generally controlled by multiple factors mainly meteorological factors besides percentages absolute values of change baseline values rather than absolute values are used to quantify changes in simulated variables and thus uncertainties of changes are closely related to the values over the historical period baseline value for example a small difference in absolute values of the change of different gcms under changing environment can lead to a large difference in the final percentages of change if runoff over the historical period is relatively small except for runoff in scenario 5 fig 7 c most changes of et runoff and lai in other scenarios driven by the 18 gcms have noticeable uncertainties but most of them have the same signs for fig 7 c the results driven by different gcms show a wide range of uncertainties or spread but larger portion of points are distributed near the mean value of 18 gcms indicated by violin plot which allows us to reasonably use the mean values to represent the predicted changes lai et and runoff from 18 gcms climate models will likely continue to improve but the uncertainty of future climate change is likely to remain large in the coming decades great efforts should be devoted to explore different approaches for investigating the impacts of climate change on water budgets i e use of bottom up approaches poff et al 2016 5 conclusions under projected persistent increasing of air temperature in the future more water yield is vital for ecological conservation and social development in the over utilized water resources regions but it is still difficult to be reliably predicated and sustainably managed here a typical water over utilized region in the north china plain xiong an new area xna where local water resource management authorities try to reach a win win situation with both more forest coverage and more water availability in future was taken as a case study area to find an effective solution the interactions between vegetation dynamics and water cycle were comprehensively considered in the assessment of water availability under changing environment by use of a coupled water carbon energy ecohydrological model the waves model was constrained against remotely sensed lai and et which can improve the performance of ecohydrological models in the ungauged region ensemble projections downscaled statistically from 18 gcms under three rcps were used to comprehensively assess the impacts of climate change which can effectively balance out non stationary bias among various gcms besides a secondary bias correction sbc procedure was adopted to further correct biased representations of dynamical and or physical processes and non stationary biases simulated by gcms consistent with previous studies forest evaporated more water than cropland and grassland under historical climate conditions under future climate conditions both water use and water yield increased in cropland and grassland due to increased precipitation future climate change may bring opportunities for future water yield and land management in the over utilized water resources regions projected increased precipitation made a win win situation for more water yield and more forest coverage in the mid and far future periods in the studied region possible this study provides a successful study case and new approach for assessing regional water resources under changing environment in the over utilized water

vegetation dynamics lai and water budgets evapotranspiration and runoff were investigated in a typical over utilized water resources area of china xiong an new area xna using the waves ecohydrological model future climate change impacts were assessed with statistically downscaled forcing of 18 global circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathways rcps using secondary bias correction technique projected future climate indicated that xna would become warmer and wetter in future the waves model was calibrated against remotely sensed lai and et data modeling results during the historical period of 1982 2012 showed that forest evaporated more water 32 0 mm yr 1 than cropland while grassland used almost the same amount of water as cropland under future climate conditions both water use and water yield would increase in cropland and grassland due to increased precipitation forest was predicted to use 9 5 14 6 36 4 55 8 mm yr 1 more water and to have 2 6 52 4 2 6 51 1 mm yr 1 more water yield in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and in all three future periods 2030s 2050s and 2080s under rcp8 5 due to greater increases in precipitation afforestation is not recommended as a land management practice for more water yield in near future but could be implemented to achieve a win win situation for more water yield and more forest coverage in mid and far future periods in xna due to increased precipitation this study highlights that uncertainties in projected future climate pose formidable challenges in management of vegetative land for more water

already significantly impacted terrestrial ecosystems and the impacts are expected to be even greater in the future seddon et al 2016 but the responses of vegetation growth to climate change vary greatly spatially because the combined impacts of elevated atmospheric co2 and rising temperature on vegetation growth greatly depend on biomes and biota piao et al 2006 climate change has been reported to have great impacts on regional water resources directly by precipitation changes and indirectly by affecting vegetation growth ivanov et al 2008 complex nonlinear interactions between regional water availability and vegetation also exist across different spatio temporal scales scheffer et al 2010 on the one hand vegetation adapts to the changing water resources through different growth strategies such as changing stomatal conductance theurillat and guisan 2001 on the other hand vegetation can alter water resources through affecting evaportranspiration and soil water content li et al 2018 thus accurate vegetation growth is vital for the simulations of water use and water yield under future climate change water yield is difficult to simulate in the over utilized water resources regions especially under land conversion and future climate change conditions land management practices have been widely proposed and implemented as effective measures to achieve more water yield brown et al 2005 ellison et al 2012 however predicting the impacts of land use cover change on the hydrological cycle is still difficult especially under climate change conditions due to the complex interactions among different drivers including climate vegetation growth catchment hydrological characteristics etc kirchner et al 2020 water yield under land use change and climate change is generally estimated by hydrological models hydrological models have poor evapotranspiration et simulation because vegetation growth is not well parameterized in these models zhang et al 2020 this problem is more serious in arid regions where et is the most important component of the water cycle requiring more than 90 of annual precipitation arora 2002 more importantly hydrological models based on calibrated rainfall runoff relationship during historical periods may no longer be applicable due to nonstationary rainfall runoff relationship caused by intensive human interference in over utilized water resources regions yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 ecohydrological models primarily based on water carbon energy cycles rather than on a rainfall runoff relationship can well consider interaction between vegetation growth and regional water resources chen et al 2015 thus the long term water yield can be credibly simulated by making use of the coupled water carbon energy ecohydrological models based on accurate ecosystem evapotranspiration estimation rather than by detangling non stationary runoff time series caused by multiple human water utilization behaviors the ecohydrological models are difficult to be calibrated in data poor regions due to lack of sufficient observations or intensive human interferences on ecohydrological processes different from hydrological models the water cycle and vegetation growth of ecohydrological models need to be constrained at the same time which means more data are needed to calibrate ecohydrological models for the ungauged or data poor regions some researches have attempted to use published hydrological parameter values in previous studies bárdossy 2007 parajka et al 2007 zhang and chiew 2009 li et al 2014 however adopted parameter values for gauged sites cannot simulate runoff reliably in ungauged or data poor regions with little observed streamflow data alternatively remotely sensed data have been used to calibrate hydrological models including evapotranspiration and vegetation growth data pedinotti et al 2014 martin et al 2016 baguis and roulin 2017 accurately simulating of et with the help of remotely sensed et can lead to accurately simulating of runoff by hydrological models because et closely relates to soil moisture that is also vital for runoff simulation it has been proved that it is possible to satisfactorily simulate runoff when hydrological model is calibrated against et zhang et al 2020 vegetation growth is generally measured by leaf area index lai or normalized difference vegetation index ndvi recently many remotely sensed et and lai ndvi datasets have been generated based on different algorithms myneni et al 2002 li et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 therefore remotely sensed data can be used to calibrate ecohydrological models effectively in ungauged regions in this study impacts of land conversion and climate change on vegetation dynamics canopy lai and water budgets et and runoff were investigated in an over utilized water resources region using a coupled water carbon energy ecohydrological model waves the xiong an new area xna a district that central government allocates huge resources to extend links among metropolis beijing tianjin and hebei province was chosen as a case study area the xna is a typical over utilized water resources region located in the north china plain significant land cover use change is anticipated to occur in the future as forest cover increases from the current 10 to 40 by 2035 due to ecological restoration increased forest cover may bring many ecological benefits but it will also increase ecosystem water use it is important to understand the impacts of increased forest cover in xna on water yield and its sustainability especially in the context of climate change the waves model water vegetation energy and solute model see zhang et al 1996 with a coupled water carbon energy structure was chosen because it can simulate ecosystem water use and water yield well under changing conditions in this study water use et and water yield runoff of three typical ecosystems cropland grassland and forest in three future periods near future 2030s 2021 2040 mid future 2050s 2041 2060 and far future 2080s 2071 2090 were assessed using projected future climate forcing data from 18 global circulation models gcms in coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 under three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the specific objectives of this study were to 1 test the capability of the waves model for simulating vegetation growth and the water cycle in an over utilized water resources region of china i e xna 2 quantify the individual impacts of land conversion and climate change and their combined impacts on vegetation growth and water budgets in xna 3 assess water yield of xna with different land management options under future climate change 4 provide land management recommendations for more water yield in the over utilized water resources regions under future climate conditions 2 methods 2 1 study area the xna was selected as the study area to investigate impacts of land conversion and climate change on water budgets in the over utilized water resources regions the xna is a district of china that central government allocates huge resources to extend links among metropolis beijing tianjin and hebei province it includes three counties i e xiongxian anxin and rongcheng see fig 1 the xna is located in the north china plain and is the location of the region s largest natural freshwater wetland baiyangdian lake since the 1980s the water surface area of baiyangdian lake has decreased significantly from historical levels of 1000 km2 to less than 366 km2 and dried out periodically due to over exploitation of water resources moiwo et al 2010 according to future development plans the xna will undergo a significant land conversion in order to increase forest coverage from 10 to 40 by 2035 for ecological restoration resulting in greater demand for water resources in the new area thus one important point of interest for local water resource management authorities in this new area is to increase forest coverage at no expense of water availability or even to reach a win win situation with both more forest coverage and more water availability in future the xna is located in the eastern portion of the daqing river basin drb the drb is one of the five major rivers in the haihe river basin the drb resides within the latitude and longitude ranges of 113 39 e 116 50 e and 38 23 n 40 09 n flowing across hebei beijing tianjin and shanxi provinces fig 1 it covers an area of 4 3 104 km2 of which 43 are mountain and hilly areas and 57 are plain and depression areas the drb has an elevation ranging from 7 m to 2286 m above mean sea level the soil is characterized by cinnamon soil fluvo aquic soil and coarse soil the predominant land use types in the drb are cropland 45 5 grassland 20 8 and forest 18 8 based on land use data from the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn default aspx the drb has a temperate continental monsoon climate dominated by summer rainfall the mean annual precipitation 1961 2016 of drb is about 518 1 mm that mainly falls in july and august about 56 the mean annual temperature 1961 2014 is 11 1 c and the temperature increases gradually from northwest to southeast across the basin 2 2 ecohydrological model the waves model is a one dimensional ecohydrological model developed by zhang and dawes 1998 it is a process based model that simulates the dynamic interactions between the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum using a daily time step and is therefore well suited to investigate the hydrological and ecological responses to changes in land management and climatic variation zhang et al 1996 zhang and dawes 1998 the model has been successfully applied to simulate ecosystem water use deep soil water groundwater recharge water use efficiency and crop yield in china australia and other regions wang et al 2001 kang et al 2003 green et al 2007 tian et al 2017 in waves available energy is partitioned into transpiration and soil evaporation using beer s law et is calculated by the penman monteith formula based on a big leaf model the model can accurately simulate the effects of stomatal conductance on vegetation carbon sequestration and the coupled canopy and atmosphere relationship using the omega approach proposed by jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 actual carbon assimilation is estimated as the multiplicative product of the maximum carbon assimilation value and the relative growth rate the maximum carbon assimilation is the maximum growth rate under optimum conditions the relative growth rate is estimated using the integrated rate methodology proposed by wu et al 1994 and limited by the relative availabilities of solar radiation water and nutrients after respiration the remaining assimilated carbon is dynamically allocated to leaf stem and root carbon pools according to different priorities as described by running and gower 1991 this method allows leaf area to dynamically respond to external environmental factors such as solar radiation temperature and precipitation and are set in advance soil water movement is simulated using a fully finite difference numerical solution of the richards equation dawes and short 1993 overland flow is generated when rainfall intensity exceeds soil infiltration capacity and when rain falls onto the saturated soil surface lateral flow can occur at any saturated soil layer and is simulated by darcy s law if slope is non zero to solve the richards equation the analytical soil water model developed by white and broadbridge 1988 is used to describe the relationships among water potential volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity a more detailed description of the waves model can be found in zhang and dawes 1998 2 3 data the meteorological data required to run the waves model include precipitation maximum and minimum temperature vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation based on the location of meteorological stations around the basin and for the convenience of model calibration three simulation points were selected in the drb in order to calibrate the parameters of three typical ecosystems cropland grassland and forest as shown in fig 1 the genclim program a modification of the mountain microclimate simulator mt clim proposed by running et al 1987 was used to generate the meteorological data required by the waves model based on the program daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation data from the langfang baoding and yuxian meteorological stations were interpolated to adjacent simulation points 1 cropland 2 grassland and 3 forest with elevation and aspect related corrections the solar radiation of simulation points can be estimated by multiplying the daily total extraterrestrial insolation on a horizontal surface daily total potential radiation by a linear scalar the daily total transmittance atmospheric transmissivity is calculated as an exponential function of diurnal temperature amplitude of the meteorological stations bristow and campbell 1984 the potential radiation model was proposed and developed by garnier and ohmura 1968 buffo et al 1972 and swift 1976 the vapor pressure deficit is derived from the estimated dew point and air temperature using equations of murray 1967 if dew point data are not available which is common the night minimum temperature is assumed to be equal to the daily dew point the details of program can be found in running et al 1987 the daily precipitation and daily maximum and minimum temperatures at the three meteorological stations were obtained from the meteorological station dataset of the national meteorological information center http data cma cn the baoding station was the closest meteorological station to the xna and was selected to simulate impacts of land use and climate changes on water budgets of the xna the remotely sensed lai and et data were used to calibrate the waves model the lai data were obtained from the gimms lai3g dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 083 0 083 and a temporal resolution of 15 days zhu et al 2013 the et data were obtained from the gleam et dataset version 3a with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of one day based on remote sensing data and ground meteorological data miralles et al 2010 projected future climate forcing data were obtained from 18 gcms under a very low emission scenario rcp2 6 a medium stabilization emission scenario rcp4 5 and a very high emission scenario rcp8 5 the data for the 18 gcms were obtained from cmip5 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 detailed descriptions of the 18 gcms can be found in the supplementary materials table s1 2 4 statistical downscaling method and secondary bias correction the statistical downscaling method sdsm developed by liu and zuo 2012 was used to downscale the monthly gcm data to daily site data the downscaling method is based on empirical relationships between historical observation data and future data from the gcm simulations the downscaling method has two steps spatial downscaling and temporal downscaling first the monthly climate projections from gcms are downscaled to specific sites using the inverse distance weighted interpolation method a bias correction procedure by analyzing the observed historical climate data and gcm simulated projections for a 40 years period of 1960 1999 is used to correct site based monthly gcm values after spatial downscaling bias in gcm projected future climate is corrected with an assumption that the monthly gcm bias is stationary in the future a modified version of the weather generator wgen is then used to stochastically generate daily climate series for specific sites this method can be easily applied to any archived monthly gcm data for any site and across multiple time periods as the approach requires only monthly gcm data and daily historical climate records unlike other statistical downscaling methods this method does not require atmospheric circulation or sea surface temperatures as predictors and could run on a small computer thus greatly reducing computing cost the statistical downscaling method has been widely validated in china and australia wang et al 2016 he et al 2018 the sdsm attempts to correct stationary bias and systemic errors such as mean bias and projected trends in the future but it cannot correct the resulting incorrect representations of dynamic and or physical processes or non stationary bias simulated by gcms liu and zuo 2012 therefore the statistical properties of the outputs of the waves model driven by downscaled gcm data are not expected to be similar with those driven by observations the differences between them can be corrected by a secondary bias correction sbc procedure yang et al 2016 in this study sbc was used to correct the multi year averages of waves model outputs x x g x gb x ob where x is the value after correction xg is the value from the waves model forced with downscaled gcm data x gb is the mean value over a historical baseline period from the same simulation and x ob is the corresponding mean value over the historical baseline from an identical simulation forced with observed climate variables 2 5 parameter estimation in the waves model vegetation and soil parameters must be calibrated locally soil parameters can be estimated based on knowledge of the soil layering and the parameters of the broadbridge white soil model broadbridge and white 1988 that model describes the relationships between soil water potential volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity the soil depth was set as 3 m and was divided into three layers the soil textures of the different layers were obtained from the topsoil 0 30 cm and subsoil 30 100 cm soil texture maps produced by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations http www fao org the initial soil parameters were derived from the mean value of each type of soil texture recommended for the broadbridge white soil model the model uses 26 vegetation parameters including rainfall interception coefficient maximum carbon assimilation rate optimum growth temperature specific leaf area respiration coefficients of leaves and roots leaf mortality rate etc most of these vegetation parameters can be measured directly or obtained from literature dealing with vegetation physiology only a few of the remaining of vegetation parameters have to be calibrated locally the grassland and forest in the study area were dominated by annual pasture and deciduous broadleaf forest respectively the cropland was dominated by the winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer corn zea mays l rotation because ecosystem water use was mainly concentrated in summer and due to the complexity of simulating two types of vegetation simultaneously in the model the cropland was simulated as a single annual crop the vegetation parameters of cropland were mainly based on summer corn in order to compensate for the rotation characteristics of winter wheat and summer maize both crop conditions were taken into consideration in terms of vegetation growing season accumulated temperature and monthly fluctuations in lai especially in winter the waves model was calibrated against remotely sensed lai and et data for the three typical ecosystems of the drb lai is an important factor in regulating vegetation carbon sequestration transpiration and micro meteorological environment and was used to calibrate vegetation growth and the energy and water balances the remotely sensed et was used to calibrate the energy and water balances since measured et and runoff data were not available in the drb due to intensive human activity and non stationary water cycle the historical period was set as 1982 2014 during which meteorological and remotely sensed data were available according to the typical 2 1 separation of available data for calibration and validation 1982 2003 was used as the calibration period and 2004 2014 was used as the validation period the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the performance of the waves model the parameters were initially calibrated using a genetic algorithm goldberg 1989 and then were optimized manually in terms of their physical meaning 2 6 modeling scenarios in this study six scenarios with different vegetation types and climate forcing data were designed to investigate the individual and combined impacts of land conversion and climate change on vegetation dynamics and water budgets in the xna detailed descriptions of the six scenarios are given in table 1 scenario 0 s0 was designed for the historical climate 1982 2014 and current vegetation type i e cropland s0 was used as the baseline for assessing the impacts of land conversion and climate change on water budgets scenario 1 s1 and scenario 2 s2 were the same as s0 except the vegetation types were grassland and forest respectively scenario 3 s3 was the same as s0 except the climate forcing was the projected future climate data from 18 gcms scenario 4 s4 and scenario 5 s5 considered the impacts of both land conversion and future climate change s4 was designed for grassland while s5 was designed for forest under the projected future climate data from the 18 gcms the differences between s1 and s0 as well as between s2 and s0 represented the impacts of land conversion on water budgets the differences between s3 and s0 represented the impacts of future climate change on water budgets the differences between s4 and s0 as well as between s5 and s0 represented the combined impacts of land conversion and climate change on water budgets soil properties were assumed to be constant in the future so the soil parameters of the model were set to the same in the six scenarios 3 results 3 1 future climate change of the xna four meteorological variables were used to represent future climatic conditions centered on the near future 2030s 2021 2040 mid future 2050s 2041 2060 and far future 2080s 2071 2090 periods including precipitation p daily mean temperature t a potential et pet and solar radiation r a pet was calculated using the priestley taylor equation based on projected meteorological variables from the gcms taking 1981 2010 as the baseline period the mean annual changes of the four meteorological variables during the three future periods projected by the 18 gcms under the three rcps are shown in fig 2 consistent increases in p t a and pet over time were found under all three rcps the changes in p were almost the same 6 5 in all three future periods under rcp2 6 mean annual p increased by 7 3 15 1 and 13 7 in the 2030s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp4 5 the changes in p increased monotonically from 8 2 in the 2030s to 19 5 in the 2080s under rcp8 5 t a increased by 8 1 in the 2030s but increased by about 10 5 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp2 6 the changes in t a increased over time from 8 3 2030s to 17 1 2080s under rcp4 5 and from 9 6 2030s to 32 1 2080s under rcp8 5 projected future p and t a indicated that the xna would become warmer and wetter pet changes increased with time ranging from 2 4 2030s to 7 6 2080s under rcp2 6 from 1 8 2030s to 8 6 2080s under rcp4 5 and from 1 6 2030s to 11 3 2080s under rcp8 5 compared with the baseline value r a initially decreased by 0 03 0 6 and 1 1 in the 2030s under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and then increased by 4 5 3 7 and 2 4 in the 2080s the directions of seasonal changes in the four meteorological variables were consistent with those of annual changes fig s1 3 2 model calibration and validation simulated lai and et agreed well with the remotely sensed values in all three typical ecosystems shown in table 2 and fig 3 the waves model was calibrated over the historical period using remotely sensed daily et and half monthly lai as shown in table 2 the r2 and nse values for lai in all three typical ecosystems during the calibration and validation periods were greater than 0 65 and 0 60 respectively the rmse of lai in the cropland and grassland were less than 0 50 m2 m2 while the rsme of lai in forest was slightly larger than the other two statistical results for et simulation performance shown in table 2 indicated that the model performed well in simulating daily et nse greater than 0 60 r2 greater than 0 65 rmse less than 0 75 mm d 1 the slopes of the regression lines between simulated and remotely sensed lai and et in the three ecosystems were all close to but slightly less than 1 0 fig 3 indicating that the waves model tended to slightly underestimate both lai and et in all three ecosystems these results indicated that vegetation and soil parameters were successfully calibrated and the waves model was capable of reproducing both lai and et dynamics satisfactorily in the study area hence the calibrated model can be further used to evaluate the impacts of land use and climate changes on vegetation dynamics and water budgets in the xna 3 3 impacts of land conversion during the historical period the mean annual changes in lai et and runoff caused by land conversion under historical climatic condition are shown in fig 4 the differences between s1 and s0 represented the impacts of land conversion from cropland to grassland and showed that lai decreased by 9 7 0 05 m2 m2 et increased by 0 6 2 3 mm yr 1 and runoff decreased by 2 1 2 8 mm yr 1 the differences between s2 and s0 represented the impacts of the land conversion from cropland to forest and showed that estimated lai et and runoff changed by 81 2 0 36 m2 m2 8 3 32 0 mm yr 1 and 31 1 32 8 mm yr 1 respectively during the historical period 1982 2014 impacts of land conversion from cropland to grassland were marginal especially on et and runoff but impacts of land conversion from cropland to forest were more substantial the results showed that cropland would generate more water yield i e runoff than grassland and forest under the historical climatic condition 3 4 impacts of future climate change estimated mean annual changes in lai et and runoff caused by future climate change are shown in fig 5 future climate changes have a negative impact on vegetation growth and this negative impact would generally increase with the periods of projection compared with the baseline period mean annual lai decreased by 12 1 in the 2030s and decreased by almost the same amount of 16 0 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp2 6 lai showed a monotonous decrease under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with ranges from 13 2 to 24 6 and 15 4 to 44 4 respectively future climate change would suppress the vegetation growth but it would both increase water use and water yield estimated mean annual et all increased gradually with the periods of projection under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with ranges from 2 6 to 4 4 from 1 7 to 6 7 and from 2 2 to 10 6 respectively the mean annual runoff increased by about 20 in three future periods under rcp2 6 increased by 30 4 in the 2030s and remained around 56 0 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and increased continuously from 34 9 to 68 1 under rcp8 5 the absolute changes in lai et and runoff can be found in the table s2 in the supplementary compared with the mean annual values during the baseline period of 1981 2010 the changes in mean annual lai et and runoff in the three future periods under the three rcps were in the same direction however the magnitudes of the changes under the three rcps were different in different future periods estimated lai et and runoff showed greater changes under the high emission scenario rcp8 5 than under the lower emission scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 in the 2080s but similar responses were not observed in the 2030s and 2050s the uncertainties in estimated lai et and runoff changes from 18 gcms were shown using violin plot in the fig 5 as well the uncertainties of estimated lai and et changes caused by 18 gcms were less than those of runoff changes 3 5 combined impacts of land conversion and climate change 3 5 1 land conversion from cropland to grassland one land management option considered for the xna is to convert cropland to grassland the estimated combined impacts of land conversion from cropland to grassland and climate change on lai et and runoff are shown in fig 6 the land conversion from cropland to grassland would not change the fact that future climate change suppressed vegetation growth increased water use and water yield estimated lai decreased by about 20 in all three future periods under rcp2 6 but showed even greater reductions under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with ranges from 19 6 to 27 1 and from 20 9 to 41 3 respectively estimated et increased gradually with the periods of projection from 4 4 to 6 6 under rcp2 6 from 3 5 to 9 6 under rcp4 5 and from 4 2 to 15 2 under rcp8 5 estimated runoff increased from 18 6 to 10 8 under rcp2 6 increased from 23 4 in the 2030s to the almost same amount of 45 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and continuously increased from 27 4 to 50 7 under rcp8 5 compared with values during the baseline period of 1981 2010 the similarity of the trends and magnitudes of changes in lai et and runoff in s3 and s4 showed that climate change dominated the changes in vegetation growth and water budgets in grassland besides estimated changes in lai et and runoff under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were generally greater than those under rcp2 6 the changes in lai et and runoff in the three future periods under the three rcps were in the same direction but uncertainties of different gcms are large in the same period as shown in violin plots the uncertainties of estimated lai and et changes from 18 gcms were less than those of runoff changes 3 5 2 land conversion from cropland to forest the other possible land management option for the xna is to convert cropland to forest the estimated combined impacts of land conversion from cropland to forest and climate change on lai et and runoff are shown in fig 7 estimated lai would all increased in all future periods under three rcps compared with the baseline value but the magnitude of increases gradually decreased with the periods of projection under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 with ranges from 74 2 to 71 4 from 71 1 to 63 5 and from 71 0 to 46 8 respectively estimated et continuously increased from 10 9 to 12 4 and from 10 4 to 14 6 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 respectively et increases changed from 9 5 in the 2030s to 13 6 in the 2050s and then to 12 7 in the 2080s under rcp4 5 lai and et would all increased in the future periods but runoff decreased slightly under rcp2 6 and mostly increased under the other two rcps specially estimated runoff decreased from 7 1 to 11 7 under rcp2 6 decreased by 1 3 in the 2030s but increased by about 30 0 in the 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 and continuously increased from 2 6 to 52 4 under rcp8 5 compared with the impacts of future climate change on lai et and runoff the combined impacts of land conversion from cropland to forest and climate change caused opposite changes in lai amplified the changes in et and narrowed or reversed changes in runoff the magnitude of lai increases gradually decreased with the periods of projection which was mainly due to the increasing negative impact of future climate change on vegetation growth land conversion from cropland to forest would lead to greater increases in water use of 15 30 mm yr 1 mainly due to precipitation increase in the future the magnitudes and signs of changes in runoff were significantly different among the three rcps especially for the changes in the 2050s and 2080s 4 discussion 4 1 vegetation responses to land conversion and climate change waves estimated a slight decrease in lai when cropland was converted to grassland and estimated a significant increase in lai when cropland was converted to forest lai of forest was generally larger than lai of crop or grass under the same climatic condition which was consistent with the findings of others colombo et al 2003 fang et al 2014 kahiu and hanan 2018 the lai differences between crop and grass under the same climatic condition mainly depend on plant functional type the lai of grassland is smaller than that of cropland which may be caused by its larger aerodynamic resistance leaf respiration coefficient and smaller carbon assimilation rate in the waves model in our study summer corn c4 crop and annual pasture were simulated as the main vegetation types of cropland and grassland respectively the decrease in lai when the cropland was converted to grassland was consistent with the finding of alton 2018 future climate change would significantly impact vegetation growth and the impacts are expected to be even greater over time the reductions in lai of cropland were mainly the combined result of impacts of rising temperature on carbon assimilation and respiration morison et al 2007 cheng et al 2014 hatfield and prueger 2015 carbon assimilation i e photosynthesis gradually increases with rising temperature up to some optimal temperature and then decreases while respiration increases monotonically with rising temperature morison et al 2007 the estimated decreases in lai suggest that the rising temperature has a greater impact on respiration than on assimilation the reason is likely due to the fact that the calibrated optimal temperatures of the three vegetation types for growth were very close to the mean daily temperature during the growing season for the historical period thus any increase in temperature in the future could suppress vegetation growth additionally rising temperature has an indirect negative impact on vegetation growth in waves model via aggravating water stress because rising temperature is associated with increases in potential et there is no consensus about the response of vegetation growth to climate change stephen et al 2008 krishnaswamy et al 2014 seddon et al 2016 and the response of specific vegetation types to climate change depends on the regional climate regimes gao et al 2017 but predicted responses of vegetation growth in cropland in this study were consistent with previous assessments that climate change may suppress the vegetation growth luo et al 2008 gao et al 2017 previous studies have shown that vegetation growth responses to climate change can vary dramatically because of the differences in plant functioning structure and distribution piao et al 2006 negrón juárez et al 2009 the lai reductions when cropland was converted to grassland in the future were mainly caused by climate change because of small difference 0 05 m2 m2 was estimated when cropland was converted to grassland under historical climatic condition fig 4 but the increases in lai when cropland was converted to forest in the future were largely caused by land conversion because the negative impacts of climate change on lai were offset by the positive impacts of land conversion from cropland to forest 0 36 m2 m2 the different trends of lai with the periods of projection among the emission scenarios were mainly caused by different trends of temperature increases the temperature first increased to some maximum value and then almost remained unchanged under rcp2 6 continuously increased with time under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which were consistent with the trends of lai reductions these results indicate that changes in vegetative land and climate had significant impacts on vegetation growth and it is therefore essential to consider the impacts of both on the future water yield of the xna 4 2 water budgets response to land conversion and climate change land conversion affects the regional water budgets mainly in two ways direct impacts on the timing and magnitude of et and indirect impacts of vegetation coverage and types on streamflow generation claessens et al 2006 liu et al 2008 the results of the land conversion scenarios showed that water use was higher in forest than in grassland and cropland under the historical climatic condition which was caused by the greater water demand of the forest because of its denser canopy and deeper root system zhang et al 2001 a slight increase in water use was observed when cropland was converted to grassland even though the cropland had a larger lai than grassland this may have been caused by greater soil evaporation 52 due to the larger evaporated areas in grassland along with the changes of vegetative land urbanized area would be the most noticeable changes in land use in the xna and would have significant impacts on water resources in the future the expected impacts of urbanization include reduced infiltration baseflow and lag times of runoff after rainfall and increased storm flow volumes peak discharge frequency of floods and surface runoff du et al 2012 however the impacts of urbanization on water resources are out of scope of this study and will be further investigated in the future climate change especially changes in temperature and precipitation can have significant impacts on water budgets nash and gleick 1991 generally increases in temperature and precipitation can lead to increases in et and vice versa mishra and lilhare 2016 in waves model et is calculated using penman monteith formula which is closely related to solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and temperature etc the solar radiation would decrease in 2030s but pet would still increase due to the increased temperature the water use of cropland still increased in the future though the future climate change would suppress the vegetation growth which was probably caused by increasing precipitation and pet changes in runoff are largely determined by changes in precipitation cheng et al 2014 reshmidevi et al 2018 in this study runoff increased in all three future periods under all three rcps mainly in response to increased precipitation besides as an important regulator of water resources in response to climate change vegetation is crucial for water resources under future climate change infiltration capacity has been reported to increase as a power law function of aboveground biomass in water limited ecosystems thompson et al 2015 lai was used to represent vegetation growth in this study lai is generally proportional to aboveground biomass so infiltration capacity may decrease with the decreased lai in the future that is benefit for runoff generation the increases in precipitation were amplified more than two fold in runoff which agreed with previous research sankarasubramanian et al 2001 chiew et al 2006 overall the relative changes in et were smaller than those observed for runoff under climate change which was consistent with the findings of al mukhtar et al 2014 predicting water yield under the combined impacts of land conversion and climate change is of great importance for understanding the hydrologic processes for this over utilized water resources region under different land management options when both changes in vegetative land and climate were considered i e s4 and s5 the direction of predicted changes in et in the three future periods under all rcps was the same as the direction of the impacts of climate change alone this suggests that climate change is more dominant than land conversion in controlling et in the xna however the runoff showed different responses to the combined impacts of land conversion and climate change the effect of land conversion from cropland to forest on runoff was greater than that of climate change but the trend was opposite for grassland the runoff reductions in forest were due to the increases in runoff caused by climate change being offset by the decreases in runoff caused by land conversions 32 8 mm yr 1 this suggested that climate change especially regarding precipitation was more dominant than land conversion from cropland to forest on the direction of the water yield change besides the changes in vegetative land would change infiltration capacity thus water yield the infiltration capacity of forest is generally larger than those of crop and grass thompson et al 2015 which may along with higher water use lead to decreased runoff in the three periods under rcp2 6 and in the 2030s under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 overall estimated changes in runoff had wider ranges than those of lai and et under climate change which indicated that uncertainties in projected climate change by different gcms pose formidable challenges in estimating water yield in the over utilized water resources regions 4 3 management of vegetative land for more water yield in the over utilized water resources regions the projected climate forcing data used in this study showed that the xna would become warmer and wetter in the future which was consistent with the results of previous studies in the haihe river basin yuan et al 2005 li and ding 2012 the future climate change of the xna brings both opportunities and challenges to future water yield and land management according to the simulated results in this study both cropland and grassland in both near future and far future periods would have greater water use and water yield due to projected increases in precipitation impacts of afforestation on water budgets varied with different climatic conditions basically afforestation would lead to less water yield in all three future periods under rcp2 6 and in the near future under rcp4 5 but it would lead to more water yield in other cases due to greater increases in precipitation therefore afforestation is not recommended as a future land management practice for more water yield in the xna in the near future and should be implemented carefully to achieve a win win situation for more water yield and larger forest cover in the mid and far future periods for the over utilized water resources regions water resources management is still challenging due to complex nonlinear interactions between regional water availability and vegetation and the difficulties in runoff simulation caused by intensive human interferences this study accounted complex interactions between vegetation and regional water resources by making use of a coupled water carbon energy ecohydrological model which also can credibly simulate long term water availability based on accurate ecosystem evapotranspiration estimation rather than by detangling non stationary runoff time series caused by multiple human water utilization behaviors the results of this study can be used as a reference for more water yield in the over utilized water resources regions the management of water resources has been sought by changing land use cover types to integrate the various potential attributes of water resources using a hydro economic model and cooperative game theory kahil et al 2015 2016 afforestation has been considered an effective means of alleviating negative impacts of climate change in many over utilized water resources regions huang et al 2003 betts and richard 2011 afforestation can mitigate negative impacts of climate change not only through its biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes but also by its effect on water budgets through land cover use changes bastin et al 2019 determining how to balance the impacts of afforestation on climate change and water resources is difficult in these regions kirchner et al 2020 the results presented in this study showed that crop grass or other short vegetation are more suited to these regions than forest because this type of vegetation consumes less water than forests under the same climatic conditions this paper highlights the role of climatic conditions with regard to land management in order to obtain more water yield especially in connection with afforestation in this study more water yield was specifically targeted as the change in runoff or streamflow for water resources management the influence of land management on water yield over the lifetime of any options that are introduced must be evaluated carefully under changing climate also the ecological effects of land management should be considered in order to effectively evaluate the trade offs between water yield impacts and the provision of ecosystem goods services and values including regulation of micro climate biodiversity social values etc bonan et al 1992 brauman et al 2007 poff et al 2016 the uncertainties or spread of the predicted changes by waves model is obvious the uncertainties of the output variables lai et and runoff are resulted from the uncertainties of two or more meteorological variables because they are generally controlled by multiple factors mainly meteorological factors besides percentages absolute values of change baseline values rather than absolute values are used to quantify changes in simulated variables and thus uncertainties of changes are closely related to the values over the historical period baseline value for example a small difference in absolute values of the change of different gcms under changing environment can lead to a large difference in the final percentages of change if runoff over the historical period is relatively small except for runoff in scenario 5 fig 7 c most changes of et runoff and lai in other scenarios driven by the 18 gcms have noticeable uncertainties but most of them have the same signs for fig 7 c the results driven by different gcms show a wide range of uncertainties or spread but larger portion of points are distributed near the mean value of 18 gcms indicated by violin plot which allows us to reasonably use the mean values to represent the predicted changes lai et and runoff from 18 gcms climate models will likely continue to improve but the uncertainty of future climate change is likely to remain large in the coming decades great efforts should be devoted to explore different approaches for investigating the impacts of climate change on water budgets i e use of bottom up approaches poff et al 2016 5 conclusions under projected persistent increasing of air temperature in the future more water yield is vital for ecological conservation and social development in the over utilized water resources regions but it is still difficult to be reliably predicated and sustainably managed here a typical water over utilized region in the north china plain xiong an new area xna where local water resource management authorities try to reach a win win situation with both more forest coverage and more water availability in future was taken as a case study area to find an effective solution the interactions between vegetation dynamics and water cycle were comprehensively considered in the assessment of water availability under changing environment by use of a coupled water carbon energy ecohydrological model the waves model was constrained against remotely sensed lai and et which can improve the performance of ecohydrological models in the ungauged region ensemble projections downscaled statistically from 18 gcms under three rcps were used to comprehensively assess the impacts of climate change which can effectively balance out non stationary bias among various gcms besides a secondary bias correction sbc procedure was adopted to further correct biased representations of dynamical and or physical processes and non stationary biases simulated by gcms consistent with previous studies forest evaporated more water than cropland and grassland under historical climate conditions under future climate conditions both water use and water yield increased in cropland and grassland due to increased precipitation future climate change may bring opportunities for future water yield and land management in the over utilized water resources regions projected increased precipitation made a win win situation for more water yield and more forest coverage in the mid and far future periods in the studied region possible this study provides a successful study case and new approach for assessing regional water resources under changing environment in the over utilized water

4398,in recent years the number of floods following unprecedented rainfall events have increased in iran during early spring march 21st to april 20th referred to in iran as the month of farvadin while numerous studies have addressed changes in climate extremes and precipitation trends at different temporal scales from daily to annual across the country analyses of short duration and heavy precipitation especially during recent years are rarely considered furthermore most studies investigate the variations in extremes and total precipitation using a limited number of synoptic weather stations across iran this study assesses the variations in heavy precipitation precipitation with intensities greater than or equal to 3 mm 3 h at 0 04 spatial and 3 hourly temporal resolution during the month of farvardin in addition the effect of atmospheric river conditions over iran and their possible link to intensifying heavy precipitation is explored for this purpose the connected object connect algorithm is applied on a precipitation dataset precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs and an integrated water vapor transport ivt dataset from the nasa modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 the results suggest that the increase in the number of floods in recent years is related to the increase in the intensity and volume of heavy precipitation events although the frequency and duration of heavy precipitation events have not changed significantly furthermore the results show that atmospheric river conditions over the country are present during the same window as each year s most extreme events it is found that 8 out of 13 of the largest ars over iran come from moisture plumes with pathways over the african and red sea keywords remote sensing heavy precipitation connect algorithm persiann ccs merra 2 1 introduction over the 2018 2020 period iran experienced several unprecedented precipitation events that caused devastating floods across the country during the first month of spring referred to as the month of farvardin spanning from march 21st to april 20th during farvardin 2019 iran was hit by three major waves of extreme precipitation events which led to flooding in 26 of iran s 31 provinces according to the international disaster database www emdat be these widespread major floods caused 3 5 billion 2019 usd in economic damages and more than 78 fatalities aminyavari et al 2019 asanjan et al 2019 inundations and landslides also damaged 8 700 miles one third of iran s roads and completely destroyed more than 700 bridges bozorgmehr 2019 heavy rainfall during farvardin 2020 caused damage to large areas in 18 provinces of the country more than 11 people lost their lives and the total economic damages were in excess of 2 2 billion united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs https www unocha org due to these recent catastrophic flooding events there is a need to better understand the variability in precipitation intensity frequency and mechanisms of precipitation in early spring over iran there are several studies that have investigated the spatial and temporal variations of precipitation over iran at different temporal scales using a synoptic gauge dataset with different data record lengths boroujerdy 2008 feizi et al 2014 javari 2016 kousari et al 2011 najafi and moazami 2016 raziei et al 2014 shirvani 2017 some e et al 2012 tabari et al 2011 zarenistanak et al 2014 for example modarres et al 2007 studied the precipitation variability over iran by analyzing annual precipitation data collected from 20 gauge stations for the period from 1955 to 2000 of those 20 stations 18 showed no statistically significant trends in precipitation tabari et al 2011 conducted a study to investigate the variations in annual and seasonal precipitation using 61 synoptic stations for the period from 1966 to 2005 their results indicated that the amount of annual precipitation decreased significantly over time at about 60 of the stations similarly they showed that trends for the spring and winter precipitation were mostly negative during the study period soltani et al 2012 applied the mann kendall test to the annual and monthly rainfall time series of 33 synoptic stages for the period from 1951 to 2005 by analyzing the annual precipitation they concluded that there was no significant climate change overall in iran specifically in march rainfall while significant negative trends were noticed at 29 stations in april more recently an investigation by zarei and masoudi 2019 of precipitation variations based on 40 stations during the time period from 1967 to 2014 revealed that about 30 of the stations showed significant decreases in annual precipitation although the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation over iran is investigated by these studies there are still some notable gaps first these studies analyze a limited number of synoptic weather stations making it difficult to understand precipitation variation at high spatial resolution over the whole country furthermore urbanization over recent decades may have affected the station data trends second the synoptic gauge precipitation network provides precipitation observations at a daily time scale this temporal resolution limits the focus of the studies to the total amount of precipitation at daily to annual scales therefore the variations in heavy precipitation at sub daily scales e g hourly 3 hourly were not explored third the temporal extent of these studies spans to the year 2013 meaning the unprecedented rainfall events during farvardin over the 2018 2020 period have not been examined the inadequate and sparse networks of rain gauge stations across iran increase the uncertainties in previous study findings additionally the daily temporal resolution of rain gauge networks undermines their applicability to capture the variations in short duration heavy precipitation events maggioni et al 2016 mosaffa et al 2020a 2020b 2020c yang et al 2005 satellite based precipitation estimates are a promising alternative to ground based rain measurements offering global precipitation estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution especially over sparsely gauged regions sadeghi et al 2020 2021 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs which provides near real time precipitation estimates at 0 04 spatial resolution an0d hourly temporal resolution is an attractive candidate for short duration extreme precipitation analysis hong et al 2004 many studies have evaluated the estimation performance of persiann ccs at global to local scales beck et al 2019 bitew and gebremichael 2010 conti et al 2014 hirpa et al 2010 hong et al 2007 hsu et al 1997 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 romilly and gebremichael 2011 asanjan et al 2019 salmani dehaghi and samani 2019 over iran mosaffa et al 2020a mosaffa et al 2020b and mosaffa et al 2020c evaluated the near real time precipitation estimation products including persiann ccs and tropical rainfall measuring mission real time trmm 3b42 rt comparing these products against 28 rain gauge observations for the period from 2003 to 2014 their results showed that persiann ccs performed better in terms of both rainfall detection and estimation compared to trmm 3b42 rt katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 evaluated persiann ccs against 1 130 rain gauge stations over iran for the period from december 2008 to november 2018 and showed that persiann ccs estimates are consistent with gauge observations in this study we leverage the high spatiotemporal resolution persiann ccs dataset to investigate the variation of short term heavy precipitation in the month of farvardin over the last two decades 2003 2020 this study highlights the application of near global persiann ccs estimates for exploring precipitation variation over countries where the number of rain gauges is limited like iran iranian agriculture is highly dependent on precipitation in spring especially that in the month of farvardin the first spring month in the iranian calendar according to persiann ccs measurements approximately a quarter of the annual precipitation in iran occurs during farvardin the consequences of climate change on the intensification of the hydrologic cycle including floods and droughts caused many heavy precipitation events in recent years for example according to iranian agriculture ministry s crisis management department flooding in multiple iran provinces during farvardin 2019 caused nearly 3 billion to the agriculture sector https www tehrantimes com news 434705 among those provinces early spring floods caused financial damages amounting to approximately 714 million to 200 000 ha of khuzestan farming lands alone in this study we use persiann ccs estimates to address the gaps in the previous studies for investigating heavy precipitation events during the month of farvardin over iran first the high spatial resolution of the persiann ccs estimates enables us to investigate the variations in precipitation at 0 04 spatial resolution second the hourly temporal resolution of the persiann ccs estimates provides us the opportunity to explore the variations in short duration extreme precipitation for this purpose this study utilizes the connected object connect algorithm run on the persiann ccs estimates which is an object oriented tracking algorithm to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in short term heavy precipitation during the month of farvardin over iran using the persiann ccs dataset as input in this study we consider 3 mm 3 h as the threshold precipitation rate to determine heavy precipitation this study highlights the application of the connect algorithm along with persiann ccs dataset for analyzing natural hazards associated with ar events such as floods over different regions of the globe to further explore the spatiotemporal variations of heavy precipitation events during farvardin we examine the presence of atmospheric rivers ars over the country and during periods of extreme precipitation the spatial distribution of precipitation over iran is mostly affected by the interaction of large scale atmospheric circulation types and the zagros and alborz ranges some particular meteorological conditions such as the position of mid tropospheric ridges troughs and the jet stream along with ars that bring moisture from faraway water bodies are pushed upward by orography and produce precipitation over iran in early spring alijani 2002 azizi et al 2013 vaghefi et al 2019 the effective synoptic conditions for spring precipitation in iran are mainly driven by the interconnection and positioning of the mediterranean low pressures the siberian high pressure the red sea and the arabian low tropospheric anticyclones alijani and harman 1985 darand and daneshvar 2014 nazaripour and daneshvar 2014 thus far there has been minimal insight into how ars contribute to heavy precipitation that occurs during the early spring across the country recently dezfuli 2019 investigated the mechanisms of ars over the middle east by examining the unprecedented precipitation event that occurred during march 24 25 2019 their results indicated that the strong nearly 9000 km long ar dena that was propagated from the atlantic ocean and was fed by additional moisture from surrounding bodies of water along its pathway was responsible for this unprecedented precipitation in this study we leverage the connect algorithm to further examine the presence and therefore implied influence of ars during the most extreme precipitation events that have occurred during the month of farvardin during the last two decades the detailed goals of this study are 1 investigate the temporal variations in heavy precipitation events that occurred in the month of farvardin from 2003 to 2020 using persiann ccs estimates 2 explore ar conditions over iran especially during heavy precipitation events that occurred during the last two decades 3 explore the applications of the connect with persiann ccs for tracking short term precipitation events 4 investigate the performance of persiann ccs for the precipitation events behind iran s major floods in 2019 the rest of this paper is organized as follows in the next section we describe the datasets precipitation and integrated water vapor transport hereafter ivt which are used in this study in section 3 we briefly describe the connect algorithm and the methodology used to analyze the variations in heavy precipitation during farvardin results are presented in section 4 we summarize the major findings of this study and conclude this paper in section 5 2 study area data 2 1 study area iran is in a semi arid and arid subtropical region of southwest asia at longitude 25 40 n and latitude 44 65 e the country is bounded by the caspian sea on the north and the persian gulf and gulf of oman in the south fig 1 the study area covers the extent of iran s borders measuring at about 1 6 million km2 iran is characterized by complex topography most of the central and southeastern parts of iran are covered by barren arid areas dashte e kavir and dashte e lut and western and northern regions are covered by zagros and alborz main mountain ranges iran is the scene of various meteorological and climatological mechanisms mostly induced by the subtropical high pressure regimes resulting in uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation across the country the southern part of iran is affected by the anticyclonic circulation over the arabian sea raziei et al 2012 the el niño southern oscillation enso nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 saghafian et al 2017 and the monsoon phenomenon yadav 2016 zarrin et al 2010 while mountainous regions in western iran block moisture loaded ars from the tropical atlantic ocean and europe driven by the black sea and mediterranean cyclones azizi et al 2013 vaghefi et al 2019 in our study to identify the spatial and temporal variations of heavy precipitation events during the month of farvardin and examine the effect of ars on these variations we consider a large spatial domain from 10 w to 70 e and from 0 to 50 n including some parts of north atlantic ocean europe middle east and north africa fig 1 2 2 data sets persiann ccs persiann ccs is a satellite based operational product that consists of hourly rainfall estimates at 0 04 0 04 approximately 4 km spatial resolution hong et al 2004 it uses infrared ir imagery from geostationary satellites and extracts the cloud features such as temperature geometry and texture to estimate rainfall using a data driven model persiann ccs is a useful tool for monitoring and analyzing heavy precipitation events in near real time at a quasi global scale 60 n to 60 s this dataset is available as an operational climate data record via the chrs data portal http chrsdata eng uci edu nguyen et al 2019 persiann cdr persiann climate data record cdr like persiann ccs is a rainfall product that is a quasi global and satellite based persiann cdr differs from persiann ccs by its intention while persiann ccs is primarily for real time measurements persiann cdr s long duration 1983 present makes it most useful for climate scale studies ashouri et al 2015 sadeghi 2018 sadeghi et al 2019a 2019b as accuracy is a primary motivation for the development of persiann cdr data daily passive microwave data and monthly gpcp v2 3 rain gauge values are used for bias correction persiann cdr s focus on accuracy means it s not available at scales as fine as persiann ccs persiann cdr s spatiotemporal resolution is limited to daily and 0 25 0 25 pixels in this study persiann cdr is used to investigate the climatology of ar associated rainfall during farvardin like persiann ccs persiann cdr is available from the chrs data portal see above integrated water vapor transport from merra 2 integrated water vapor transport ivt is the amount of atmospheric moisture integrated across all levels of the atmosphere calculated from the following formula i v t 1 g p surf p 200 q v d p where p is pressure hpa p 200 is pressure at 200 hpa assumed to be the top of the atmosphere p surf is the geopotential height at the earth s surface 1000 hpa q is specific humidity at pressure height p v is the wind velocity m s at p and g is gravitational acceleration ivt was calculated from the wind and pressure values retrieved from the national aeronautical and space agency s nasa modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 data gelaro et al 2017 gauge dataset to evaluate persiann ccs s accuracy during farvardin 2019 the persiann ccs estimates are compared with ground based gauge observations from 70 synoptic meteorological stations from the iran meteorological organization at the daily scale these evaluations are performed over 4 provinces fars lorestan kermanshah and ilam which were affected the most by the heavy precipitation events during farvardin 2019 the comparison is conducted against persiann ccs pixels that contained at least one meteorological ground based observation 3 methodology 3 1 connect the connected object connect algorithm is a big data algorithm that uses connectivity overlap to segment group and track elevated or anomalous data signatures in large volumes of data it was developed to study hydroclimate extremes including but not limited to ars shearer et al 2020 tropical and extratropical cyclones shearer et al 2021 droughts and more the algorithm s architecture is designed with object oriented analysis in mind where objects are identified items events etc that can be represented by attributes and statistics and object oriented analysis is the study of populations of objects from their attributes and statistics fig 2 object oriented analysis has noteworthy benefits for hydroclimate studies events are discretely counted and recorded meaning they can be examined individually or their population considered statistically from techniques as simple as calculating averages and percentiles to distribution building and cluster analysis connect uses three dimensional x y spatial and temporal voxels of a target variable e g rainfall to construct objects where voxels with intensities above a user defined threshold are contiguous over space and time performed using a flood filling algorithm as grouping voxels across the time axis captures the evolution of an object from genesis to terminus connect performs well as a tracking algorithm meaning objects segmented by connect are the lifecycles of weather phenomena connect auto calculates object characteristics such as spatiotemporal properties like volume speed duration etc and outputs it into a table for statistical object oriented analysis for this study 3 hourly precipitation data from persiann ccs during the month of farvardin every year from 2003 to 2020 was used as input to connect as our interest for this study lies entirely within the boundaries of iran precipitation fields are clipped to the country s borders to capture longer duration heavy events over the region connect was set up to only consider rainfall totals equal to or greater than 3 mm 3 h and to filter objects with durations shorter than twelve hours selecting the threshold parameter for connect is largely based on balancing between over segmenting and under segmenting over segmented rainfall disrupts the tracking functionality of connect smaller objects moving at faster speeds will not overlap during subsequent timesteps and will not be considered as the same object at the same time under segmented rainfall will track multiple events as a singular conglomerate event as an example consider rainfall systems in the intertropical convergence zone at very low thresholds connect will not differentiate between the light rainfall that constantly occurs in the region and the periodic heavy rainfall from transient mesoscale convective systems that also frequently form and dissipate over the course of a day if a researcher s goal is to study the lifecycles of the latter phenomena a higher rainfall threshold rate is required for suitable results we note similarities between the geography of iran and california further explained in the subsequent section and therefore elect to use the 1 mm hour here 3 mm 3 hour threshold used in sellars et al 2015 at this value rainfall is a less than half of the glossary of meteorology s definition of moderate rainfall 2 5 mm hour but well above the rainfall rates of a drizzle 0 3 mm hour meaning rainfall rates captured are impactful but not necessarily extreme a higher threshold is undesirable as it omits important data and serves to underestimate storm total volume calculations 3 2 defining the thresholds for detecting ar over iran an ar is a narrow transient atmospheric pathway that transports a large amount of water vapor from distant water bodies in dry countries like iran which is located in subtropical latitudes ars originating from water bodies located west of the country can be a significant source of precipitation furthermore guan and waliser 2015 showed that ars are contribute to orographic rainfall occurrences and can cause extreme precipitation events and flooding in iran therefore for hydrological purposes it would be useful to study extreme precipitation events and ars particularly in mountainous region of iran e g zagros range to investigate whether the most extreme ccs connect objects over iran were related to ar activity we utilized the methodology from rutz et al 2014 hereby referred to as rutz rutz defines an ar as a region of ivt greater than 250 kg m 1 s 1 that extends to a length greater than or equal to 2 000 km the rutz methodology is referred to as a permissive methodology as opposed to a restrictive method which means its requirements are laxer and generally tend to classify anomalous ivt regions as ars more often than other methodologies this methodology was selected because iran has notable analogs to california where the methodology was developed including its northwest southeast trending zagros mountain range with peaks up to 4 400 m which has the same orientation and prominence as the sierra nevada range along with its location in the lower mid latitudes however we acknowledge that iran s position east of the dry saharan desert is in stark contrast to california s proximity west of the pacific ocean a water body source which feeds pacific ars with their moisture though a notable analog exists in the red and mediterranean seas along with the persian gulf dezfuli 2019 furthermore ars over iran have yet to be analyzed using an precipitation linked ivt threshold which can be utilized in global studies like that used in rutz et al 2014 the 85th percentile of ivt over iran and the surrounding region was used as a threshold in dezfuli 2019 and esfandiari and lashkari 2020 the values of which would be far too low of a threshold to be useful over north america europe etc it is important to note that we do not argue that using a regionally derived ivt threshold makes the ars in these studies less deserving of the ar label however by proving that ars exist at ivt levels that can be utilized globally and is tied to precipitation we prove that iran is a region where ars of noteworthy strength frequently occur at least in the month of farvardin making it comparable to the north american west coast europe chile and other regions of the world to robustly investigate the influence ars have in the region during farvardin the climatology of ars and ar precipitation over iran during the month of farvardin is investigated using the rutz methodology and the multi decade persiann cdr precipitation dataset over 1990 2019 the 30 year duration was chosen in compliance with the standards of the world meteorological organization wmo fig 3 explores three metrics that seek to investigate how ars impact iran during farvardin specifically regarding frequency and its link to precipitation in the zagros mountains precipitation and ivt are correlated to values as high as 55 including the greater tehran metropolis moreover moderate correlations of 35 45 exist across the entirely of north and central iran ar frequencies are greatest along the coast of the persian gulf and the gulf of oman up to the foot of the zagros mountains where they occur on average 7 10 of the month or up to 3 days a month thus two similarities between the climatology of iran and california are observed the high correlation between ivt and rainfall especially in topographically complex regions rutz et al 2014 and the high frequency of elevated ivt fluxes that perpendicularly strike a prominent mountain range in addition the fraction of ar rainfall is over 50 in the southern part of the country owing to these similarities it can established that 1 atmospheric rivers at ivt fluxes required by the rutz methodology impact linked are non insignificant players in iran s farvardin hydroclimate meaning 2 the rutz methodology and others that aren t linked to climatological averages like what is done in defuzli 2019 are appropriate to use in the region for ar related studies in this study we investigate the contribution of ars on heavy precipitation using ivt and gauge information despite the breadth of analysis done in this study regarding ars over iran and their perceived link to heavy precipitation events it is vital to note that establishing a concrete link between ars and heavy precipitation requires numerical modeling simulation as described by davolio et al 2020 and such research should be conducted before solid conclusions can be made such numerical simulations are outside the scope of this study 3 3 performance measurements categorical evaluation statistics including probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi are utilized to evaluate the performance of the persiann ccs dataset for detecting rain no rain pixels continuous indices including pearson s correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and bias bias bias estimation observation are used to assess the accuracy performance of persiann ccs in estimating the rainfall intensity a value of 1 mm day is utilized as a rain no rain threshold in both persiann ccs estimates and ground based gauge observations 4 results and discussion fig 4 displays the spatial map of the accumulated precipitation for the month of farvardin during the period from 2003 to 2020 using persiann ccs data the mean monthly precipitation during farvardin for this period was 86 mm for the most recent years the average precipitation was 107 mm in 2018 178 mm in 2019 and 100 mm in 2020 all of which were higher than the baseline mean precipitation from 2003 to 2020 furthermore the year 2019 when iran experienced many floods was the wettest year in the last two decades in addition fig 4 reveals that the spatial pattern of accumulated precipitation varies among different years the greatest concentration of rainfall occurred over northeastern iran in 2003 while southwestern iran experienced the bulk of precipitation in 2019 4 1 evaluation of persiann ccs for 2019 as discussed in the introduction katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 mosaffa et al 2020a mosaffa et al 2020b and mosaffa et al 2020c evaluated the performance of the daily persiann ccs estimates over iran for the period prior to 2018 the intention of this study is not to evaluate the capability of persiann ccs for precipitation estimation but rather evaluate rainfall totals during farvardin 2019 against ground based observations for the provinces that experienced floods table 2 presents spatial averages of categorical and continuous evaluation metrics over four selected provinces fars ilam kermanshah and lorestan these are among the provinces that reported the greatest flooding damages during the farvardin 2019 floods in terms of categorical statistics pod and far values are 0 78 and 0 28 over these provinces respectively persiann ccs with 0 65 0 53 has the best worst performance in terms of csi over kermanshah ilam province according to continuous statistical metrics the correction coefficient cc is approximately 0 55 in the selected provinces and the highest cc values appear over the ilam province with the value of 0 75 also rmse ranges from 16 55 to 23 14 mm day in terms of bias persiann ccs mainly overestimates bias 0 precipitation intensity when comparing our results to those of previous studies which evaluated different satellite precipitation products over iran alijanian et al 2017 mahbod et al 2019 moazami et al 2013 mosaffa et al 2020b 2020c it must be pointed out that persiann ccs performs better than other near real time products during farvardin 2019 fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of pod far csi cc rmse and bias over the four selected provinces this figure shows that pod values in all stations is above 0 75 except a station in the north of fars province and a couple of stations in the middle of western provinces which have pod about 0 6 western provinces including kermanshah ilam and lorestan have lower far than the fars province in the south of iran except for a few stations with csi below 0 5 mostly found in the fars province other stations have csi greater than 0 5 the spatial distribution of cc indicates that the persiann ccs algorithm has better performance over the western provinces than over fars according to fig 5 cc in regions that experienced heavier precipitation is higher than in the other regions stations in the lorestan province have the highest rmse compared with other stations on the contrary stations in the south of fars and kermanshah provinces have the lowest rmse although precipitation is overestimated bias 0 in most of the stations results of bias in the north of the kermanshah province and a couple of stations in the east of the lorestan province shows an underestimation of precipitation comparing with the conducted evaluation studies for near real time precipitation over iran persiann ccs has the potential to be used as a candidate for short term duration precipitation studies 4 2 temporal variations of heavy precipitation events during the period 2003 2020 using persiann ccs estimates to quantify how the number of floods has been increasing during the last three years we plot the frequency intensity duration and volume of precipitation for the period 2003 2020 over the study area fig 6 for this purpose we apply the connect algorithm with a 3 mm 3 hour threshold on the persiann ccs estimates for the period 2003 2020 for the month of farvardin across iran the frequency fig 6a of heavy precipitation events events with more than 3 mm 3 hour rainfall does not show a significant change across the country during the month of farvardin the average number of intense events is 97 however the highest number is 151 events occurring in 2019 the variations in intensity of heavy precipitation events fig 6b demonstrate that the average magnitude of heavy rainfall has increased during the last three years the average intensity of heavy precipitation events is 15 7 mm 3 hour for the whole period compared with 55 3 mm 3 hour in 2018 79 0 mm 3 hour in 2019 and 30 1 mm 3 hour in 2020 these results are consistent with the increase in the number of floods reported across iran during the last three years the average duration of heavy precipitation fig 6c was 14 2 h during the last two decades while peaking to 23 8 h in 2019 the average volume of heavy precipitation fig 6d during the month of farvardin for the whole study period is 0 7 km3 event while an average of 0 97 km3 event was recorded over the last three years of the study the total volume of heavy precipitation per year fig 6e was 77 km3 on average compared with an average of 132 km3 of precipitation occurring during the last three years most notably the total precipitation volume was 191 km3 in 2019 overall we can conclude that the increase in intensity average volume per event and total volume of heavy precipitation are the main reasons for the increases in the number of floods during the last three years over iran 4 3 investigating atmospheric river presence during heavy precipitation events from 2003 to 2020 the rutz et al 2014 methodology was used to determine whether there was ar activity during the most extreme farvardin rainfall events every year during 2003 2020 including extra significant events in 2019 and 2020 as rutz is considered a permissive methodology which implies an enhanced possibility of non ar ivt features being classified as ars we further checked to see if ar activities existed over any area in iran for at least 24 h thereby ensuring that an event satisfies the requirements of an ar 1 the weakest category for an ar from the scale introduced by ralph et al 2019 over the study period it was observed that ar conditions existed during every year s most extreme events along with the two extra extreme events in 2019 and 2020 among them only three years 2010 2011 and 2013 had ar conditions for less than 24 h with the shortest 2011 that lasted for 9 h furthermore some events such as the extreme rainfall event of 2004 could be traced back to multiple ar events affecting different regions of iran dezfuli 2019 observed that the sources of moisture for ars that impact iran come from the surrounding bodies of water including the mediterranean sea the caspian sea the persian gulf the red sea and the atlantic ocean from our analysis we identify that the sources of moisture for ars in the region are from the atlantic ocean via a northern africa pathway and from the red sea via the red sea strait bab el mandeb these pathways are also recognized in esfandiari and lashkari 2020 in fig 7 we showcase the three most observed ar lifecycles in the region 1 those that propagate from the atlantic ocean over northern africa without significant influence from the red sea fig 7c d driven by the saharan anticyclone shay el et al 1999 2 those with moisture chiefly coming from the red sea fig 7b via the red sea strait driven by a moisture transport at the 850 hpa level following a favorable position of the arabian cyclone and mid tropospheric troughs raziei et al 2012 and 3 those which are created by merging bodies of moisture from both the red sea and the atlantic ocean fig 7a e though the timing between ars can vary between being simultaneous red sea and african moisture at the same time 2003 and 2019 and being subsequent one source of moisture followed by other of these two different timings it is the former that produces the events of greater volume with the precipitation events of 2003 and 2019 being 4th and 1st heaviest by rainfall volume table 1 showcases each ar with its pathway determined by examining ivt objects at the 200 and 250 kg m 1 s 1 levels of the ar examined three were found to come from moisture via the african pathway seven from the red sea strait ten from both sources and two from other sources gulf of aden and arabian sea this means that out of the 22 observed ars 17 were reliant on moisture fluxes from the gulf of aden while 13 could be linked to moisture transport over the african continent furthermore each ar was ranked by the amount of precipitation it produced over iran as calculated by connect the three highest ranking ars all come from the three different ar classes each occurring within the 2018 2019 period afterwards ars with moisture from both sources make up 7 out of 10 of the ars ranked 4th to 13th yet only 3 out of 9 of the ars ranked 14th onwards are from both sources in summary ars with moisture from both the african and red sea sources are the most frequently observed ars that coincide with heavy precipitation over iran fig 8 shows the accumulated amount of precipitation occurring during the events shown in fig 7 the most extreme event that occurred in farvardin 2003 which was ranked the 4th greatest event by volume and propagated from the red sea and the atlantic ocean mainly occurred in northeastern iran on the other hand the heavy precipitation that occurred in farvardin 2019 that involved the most extreme events in terms of volume during the last two decades and had similar pathway to that from 2003 mainly occurred over southwestern iran this figure shows precipitation from the most extreme events in 2003 2012 2017 2018 and 2019 and highlights that extreme events in recent farvardins 2018 and 2019 are heavier than those of the past 5 conclusion spring precipitation especially during the month of farvardin is important for iranian agriculture over the past few years an increase in the number of floods occurring after unprecedented rainfall events during the month of farvardin have affected millions of people across iran caused the loss of life damaged infrastructure and engendered substantial economic losses in iran s agriculture sector the apparent increase in the number of floods during the last three years 2018 2020 led us to investigate the variations in different aspects of heavy precipitation events like intensity and frequency as well as their associated mechanisms during the month of farvardin to our knowledge there is no study which explores the precipitation variations and mechanisms during this month the previous studies over iran mainly focused on analyzing heavy precipitation at daily scales over the whole year however there is a need to assess the flood causing short duration heavy precipitation that occurs in early spring in addition using a limited number of synoptic gauge observations has hindered the ability to explore the variations in precipitation at a high spatial resolution in this study we applied the connect algorithm with a 3 mm 3 hour threshold on the persiann ccs estimates at 0 04 spatial resolution to explore the variations in frequency intensity duration and volume of heavy precipitation during farvardin for the period from 2003 to 2020 the results indicated that increases in intensity and volume of heavy precipitation are the main reasons for the rising number of floods during farvardin over the years 2018 2020 however a significant increase in frequency and duration of heavy precipitation are not observed the results also show that the frequency intensity duration and volume of heavy precipitation was the highest in 2019 during the last two decades based on the persiann ccs estimates this is also supported by the international emergency events database https www emdat be which ranked the floods in farvardin 2019 as the costliest economic loss in iranian history during the last two decades spatial analyses revealed that heavy precipitation events occurred over almost the entire country in farvardin during the period 2003 2020 with the heaviest volume of rainfall hitting southwestern iran in 2019 and the second highest volume in northeastern iran in 2018 in addition we observe that the spatiotemporal distribution of heavy precipitation events extracted by the connect algorithm are consistent with extreme events occurred over iran investigating the presence of ar conditions on heavy precipitation events that occurred during the month of farvardin revealed that ars exist during every year s most extreme events in addition we classify the ar pathways that occurred in the country during farvardin into three main categories 1 ars that propagated from the atlantic ocean via north africa driven by the saharan anticyclone 2 ars that propagated from the red sea via the red sea strait and are influenced by the arabian cyclone and mid tropospheric troughs 3 ars created by merging bodies of moisture from both the atlantic ocean and the red sea our further investigations revealed that 8 out of 13 of the largest ars over iran come from moisture plumes with pathways over the african continent and the red sea although this study mainly explored the variations of short term precipitation over iran for a specific month the same procedure can be followed for other regions this study highlighted that the high spatial 0 04 and temporal 3 hourly resolution of persiann ccs at a global scale is an attractive feature for analyzing precipitation variations especially over the countries with limited rain gauge observations in addition the connect algorithm which is an object oriented tracking algorithm can be used for the investigation of natural hazards associated with ar events such as floods and mudslides over different regions credit

4398,in recent years the number of floods following unprecedented rainfall events have increased in iran during early spring march 21st to april 20th referred to in iran as the month of farvadin while numerous studies have addressed changes in climate extremes and precipitation trends at different temporal scales from daily to annual across the country analyses of short duration and heavy precipitation especially during recent years are rarely considered furthermore most studies investigate the variations in extremes and total precipitation using a limited number of synoptic weather stations across iran this study assesses the variations in heavy precipitation precipitation with intensities greater than or equal to 3 mm 3 h at 0 04 spatial and 3 hourly temporal resolution during the month of farvardin in addition the effect of atmospheric river conditions over iran and their possible link to intensifying heavy precipitation is explored for this purpose the connected object connect algorithm is applied on a precipitation dataset precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs and an integrated water vapor transport ivt dataset from the nasa modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 the results suggest that the increase in the number of floods in recent years is related to the increase in the intensity and volume of heavy precipitation events although the frequency and duration of heavy precipitation events have not changed significantly furthermore the results show that atmospheric river conditions over the country are present during the same window as each year s most extreme events it is found that 8 out of 13 of the largest ars over iran come from moisture plumes with pathways over the african and red sea keywords remote sensing heavy precipitation connect algorithm persiann ccs merra 2 1 introduction over the 2018 2020 period iran experienced several unprecedented precipitation events that caused devastating floods across the country during the first month of spring referred to as the month of farvardin spanning from march 21st to april 20th during farvardin 2019 iran was hit by three major waves of extreme precipitation events which led to flooding in 26 of iran s 31 provinces according to the international disaster database www emdat be these widespread major floods caused 3 5 billion 2019 usd in economic damages and more than 78 fatalities aminyavari et al 2019 asanjan et al 2019 inundations and landslides also damaged 8 700 miles one third of iran s roads and completely destroyed more than 700 bridges bozorgmehr 2019 heavy rainfall during farvardin 2020 caused damage to large areas in 18 provinces of the country more than 11 people lost their lives and the total economic damages were in excess of 2 2 billion united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs https www unocha org due to these recent catastrophic flooding events there is a need to better understand the variability in precipitation intensity frequency and mechanisms of precipitation in early spring over iran there are several studies that have investigated the spatial and temporal variations of precipitation over iran at different temporal scales using a synoptic gauge dataset with different data record lengths boroujerdy 2008 feizi et al 2014 javari 2016 kousari et al 2011 najafi and moazami 2016 raziei et al 2014 shirvani 2017 some e et al 2012 tabari et al 2011 zarenistanak et al 2014 for example modarres et al 2007 studied the precipitation variability over iran by analyzing annual precipitation data collected from 20 gauge stations for the period from 1955 to 2000 of those 20 stations 18 showed no statistically significant trends in precipitation tabari et al 2011 conducted a study to investigate the variations in annual and seasonal precipitation using 61 synoptic stations for the period from 1966 to 2005 their results indicated that the amount of annual precipitation decreased significantly over time at about 60 of the stations similarly they showed that trends for the spring and winter precipitation were mostly negative during the study period soltani et al 2012 applied the mann kendall test to the annual and monthly rainfall time series of 33 synoptic stages for the period from 1951 to 2005 by analyzing the annual precipitation they concluded that there was no significant climate change overall in iran specifically in march rainfall while significant negative trends were noticed at 29 stations in april more recently an investigation by zarei and masoudi 2019 of precipitation variations based on 40 stations during the time period from 1967 to 2014 revealed that about 30 of the stations showed significant decreases in annual precipitation although the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation over iran is investigated by these studies there are still some notable gaps first these studies analyze a limited number of synoptic weather stations making it difficult to understand precipitation variation at high spatial resolution over the whole country furthermore urbanization over recent decades may have affected the station data trends second the synoptic gauge precipitation network provides precipitation observations at a daily time scale this temporal resolution limits the focus of the studies to the total amount of precipitation at daily to annual scales therefore the variations in heavy precipitation at sub daily scales e g hourly 3 hourly were not explored third the temporal extent of these studies spans to the year 2013 meaning the unprecedented rainfall events during farvardin over the 2018 2020 period have not been examined the inadequate and sparse networks of rain gauge stations across iran increase the uncertainties in previous study findings additionally the daily temporal resolution of rain gauge networks undermines their applicability to capture the variations in short duration heavy precipitation events maggioni et al 2016 mosaffa et al 2020a 2020b 2020c yang et al 2005 satellite based precipitation estimates are a promising alternative to ground based rain measurements offering global precipitation estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution especially over sparsely gauged regions sadeghi et al 2020 2021 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system persiann ccs which provides near real time precipitation estimates at 0 04 spatial resolution an0d hourly temporal resolution is an attractive candidate for short duration extreme precipitation analysis hong et al 2004 many studies have evaluated the estimation performance of persiann ccs at global to local scales beck et al 2019 bitew and gebremichael 2010 conti et al 2014 hirpa et al 2010 hong et al 2007 hsu et al 1997 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 romilly and gebremichael 2011 asanjan et al 2019 salmani dehaghi and samani 2019 over iran mosaffa et al 2020a mosaffa et al 2020b and mosaffa et al 2020c evaluated the near real time precipitation estimation products including persiann ccs and tropical rainfall measuring mission real time trmm 3b42 rt comparing these products against 28 rain gauge observations for the period from 2003 to 2014 their results showed that persiann ccs performed better in terms of both rainfall detection and estimation compared to trmm 3b42 rt katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 evaluated persiann ccs against 1 130 rain gauge stations over iran for the period from december 2008 to november 2018 and showed that persiann ccs estimates are consistent with gauge observations in this study we leverage the high spatiotemporal resolution persiann ccs dataset to investigate the variation of short term heavy precipitation in the month of farvardin over the last two decades 2003 2020 this study highlights the application of near global persiann ccs estimates for exploring precipitation variation over countries where the number of rain gauges is limited like iran iranian agriculture is highly dependent on precipitation in spring especially that in the month of farvardin the first spring month in the iranian calendar according to persiann ccs measurements approximately a quarter of the annual precipitation in iran occurs during farvardin the consequences of climate change on the intensification of the hydrologic cycle including floods and droughts caused many heavy precipitation events in recent years for example according to iranian agriculture ministry s crisis management department flooding in multiple iran provinces during farvardin 2019 caused nearly 3 billion to the agriculture sector https www tehrantimes com news 434705 among those provinces early spring floods caused financial damages amounting to approximately 714 million to 200 000 ha of khuzestan farming lands alone in this study we use persiann ccs estimates to address the gaps in the previous studies for investigating heavy precipitation events during the month of farvardin over iran first the high spatial resolution of the persiann ccs estimates enables us to investigate the variations in precipitation at 0 04 spatial resolution second the hourly temporal resolution of the persiann ccs estimates provides us the opportunity to explore the variations in short duration extreme precipitation for this purpose this study utilizes the connected object connect algorithm run on the persiann ccs estimates which is an object oriented tracking algorithm to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in short term heavy precipitation during the month of farvardin over iran using the persiann ccs dataset as input in this study we consider 3 mm 3 h as the threshold precipitation rate to determine heavy precipitation this study highlights the application of the connect algorithm along with persiann ccs dataset for analyzing natural hazards associated with ar events such as floods over different regions of the globe to further explore the spatiotemporal variations of heavy precipitation events during farvardin we examine the presence of atmospheric rivers ars over the country and during periods of extreme precipitation the spatial distribution of precipitation over iran is mostly affected by the interaction of large scale atmospheric circulation types and the zagros and alborz ranges some particular meteorological conditions such as the position of mid tropospheric ridges troughs and the jet stream along with ars that bring moisture from faraway water bodies are pushed upward by orography and produce precipitation over iran in early spring alijani 2002 azizi et al 2013 vaghefi et al 2019 the effective synoptic conditions for spring precipitation in iran are mainly driven by the interconnection and positioning of the mediterranean low pressures the siberian high pressure the red sea and the arabian low tropospheric anticyclones alijani and harman 1985 darand and daneshvar 2014 nazaripour and daneshvar 2014 thus far there has been minimal insight into how ars contribute to heavy precipitation that occurs during the early spring across the country recently dezfuli 2019 investigated the mechanisms of ars over the middle east by examining the unprecedented precipitation event that occurred during march 24 25 2019 their results indicated that the strong nearly 9000 km long ar dena that was propagated from the atlantic ocean and was fed by additional moisture from surrounding bodies of water along its pathway was responsible for this unprecedented precipitation in this study we leverage the connect algorithm to further examine the presence and therefore implied influence of ars during the most extreme precipitation events that have occurred during the month of farvardin during the last two decades the detailed goals of this study are 1 investigate the temporal variations in heavy precipitation events that occurred in the month of farvardin from 2003 to 2020 using persiann ccs estimates 2 explore ar conditions over iran especially during heavy precipitation events that occurred during the last two decades 3 explore the applications of the connect with persiann ccs for tracking short term precipitation events 4 investigate the performance of persiann ccs for the precipitation events behind iran s major floods in 2019 the rest of this paper is organized as follows in the next section we describe the datasets precipitation and integrated water vapor transport hereafter ivt which are used in this study in section 3 we briefly describe the connect algorithm and the methodology used to analyze the variations in heavy precipitation during farvardin results are presented in section 4 we summarize the major findings of this study and conclude this paper in section 5 2 study area data 2 1 study area iran is in a semi arid and arid subtropical region of southwest asia at longitude 25 40 n and latitude 44 65 e the country is bounded by the caspian sea on the north and the persian gulf and gulf of oman in the south fig 1 the study area covers the extent of iran s borders measuring at about 1 6 million km2 iran is characterized by complex topography most of the central and southeastern parts of iran are covered by barren arid areas dashte e kavir and dashte e lut and western and northern regions are covered by zagros and alborz main mountain ranges iran is the scene of various meteorological and climatological mechanisms mostly induced by the subtropical high pressure regimes resulting in uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation across the country the southern part of iran is affected by the anticyclonic circulation over the arabian sea raziei et al 2012 the el niño southern oscillation enso nazemosadat and ghasemi 2004 saghafian et al 2017 and the monsoon phenomenon yadav 2016 zarrin et al 2010 while mountainous regions in western iran block moisture loaded ars from the tropical atlantic ocean and europe driven by the black sea and mediterranean cyclones azizi et al 2013 vaghefi et al 2019 in our study to identify the spatial and temporal variations of heavy precipitation events during the month of farvardin and examine the effect of ars on these variations we consider a large spatial domain from 10 w to 70 e and from 0 to 50 n including some parts of north atlantic ocean europe middle east and north africa fig 1 2 2 data sets persiann ccs persiann ccs is a satellite based operational product that consists of hourly rainfall estimates at 0 04 0 04 approximately 4 km spatial resolution hong et al 2004 it uses infrared ir imagery from geostationary satellites and extracts the cloud features such as temperature geometry and texture to estimate rainfall using a data driven model persiann ccs is a useful tool for monitoring and analyzing heavy precipitation events in near real time at a quasi global scale 60 n to 60 s this dataset is available as an operational climate data record via the chrs data portal http chrsdata eng uci edu nguyen et al 2019 persiann cdr persiann climate data record cdr like persiann ccs is a rainfall product that is a quasi global and satellite based persiann cdr differs from persiann ccs by its intention while persiann ccs is primarily for real time measurements persiann cdr s long duration 1983 present makes it most useful for climate scale studies ashouri et al 2015 sadeghi 2018 sadeghi et al 2019a 2019b as accuracy is a primary motivation for the development of persiann cdr data daily passive microwave data and monthly gpcp v2 3 rain gauge values are used for bias correction persiann cdr s focus on accuracy means it s not available at scales as fine as persiann ccs persiann cdr s spatiotemporal resolution is limited to daily and 0 25 0 25 pixels in this study persiann cdr is used to investigate the climatology of ar associated rainfall during farvardin like persiann ccs persiann cdr is available from the chrs data portal see above integrated water vapor transport from merra 2 integrated water vapor transport ivt is the amount of atmospheric moisture integrated across all levels of the atmosphere calculated from the following formula i v t 1 g p surf p 200 q v d p where p is pressure hpa p 200 is pressure at 200 hpa assumed to be the top of the atmosphere p surf is the geopotential height at the earth s surface 1000 hpa q is specific humidity at pressure height p v is the wind velocity m s at p and g is gravitational acceleration ivt was calculated from the wind and pressure values retrieved from the national aeronautical and space agency s nasa modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 data gelaro et al 2017 gauge dataset to evaluate persiann ccs s accuracy during farvardin 2019 the persiann ccs estimates are compared with ground based gauge observations from 70 synoptic meteorological stations from the iran meteorological organization at the daily scale these evaluations are performed over 4 provinces fars lorestan kermanshah and ilam which were affected the most by the heavy precipitation events during farvardin 2019 the comparison is conducted against persiann ccs pixels that contained at least one meteorological ground based observation 3 methodology 3 1 connect the connected object connect algorithm is a big data algorithm that uses connectivity overlap to segment group and track elevated or anomalous data signatures in large volumes of data it was developed to study hydroclimate extremes including but not limited to ars shearer et al 2020 tropical and extratropical cyclones shearer et al 2021 droughts and more the algorithm s architecture is designed with object oriented analysis in mind where objects are identified items events etc that can be represented by attributes and statistics and object oriented analysis is the study of populations of objects from their attributes and statistics fig 2 object oriented analysis has noteworthy benefits for hydroclimate studies events are discretely counted and recorded meaning they can be examined individually or their population considered statistically from techniques as simple as calculating averages and percentiles to distribution building and cluster analysis connect uses three dimensional x y spatial and temporal voxels of a target variable e g rainfall to construct objects where voxels with intensities above a user defined threshold are contiguous over space and time performed using a flood filling algorithm as grouping voxels across the time axis captures the evolution of an object from genesis to terminus connect performs well as a tracking algorithm meaning objects segmented by connect are the lifecycles of weather phenomena connect auto calculates object characteristics such as spatiotemporal properties like volume speed duration etc and outputs it into a table for statistical object oriented analysis for this study 3 hourly precipitation data from persiann ccs during the month of farvardin every year from 2003 to 2020 was used as input to connect as our interest for this study lies entirely within the boundaries of iran precipitation fields are clipped to the country s borders to capture longer duration heavy events over the region connect was set up to only consider rainfall totals equal to or greater than 3 mm 3 h and to filter objects with durations shorter than twelve hours selecting the threshold parameter for connect is largely based on balancing between over segmenting and under segmenting over segmented rainfall disrupts the tracking functionality of connect smaller objects moving at faster speeds will not overlap during subsequent timesteps and will not be considered as the same object at the same time under segmented rainfall will track multiple events as a singular conglomerate event as an example consider rainfall systems in the intertropical convergence zone at very low thresholds connect will not differentiate between the light rainfall that constantly occurs in the region and the periodic heavy rainfall from transient mesoscale convective systems that also frequently form and dissipate over the course of a day if a researcher s goal is to study the lifecycles of the latter phenomena a higher rainfall threshold rate is required for suitable results we note similarities between the geography of iran and california further explained in the subsequent section and therefore elect to use the 1 mm hour here 3 mm 3 hour threshold used in sellars et al 2015 at this value rainfall is a less than half of the glossary of meteorology s definition of moderate rainfall 2 5 mm hour but well above the rainfall rates of a drizzle 0 3 mm hour meaning rainfall rates captured are impactful but not necessarily extreme a higher threshold is undesirable as it omits important data and serves to underestimate storm total volume calculations 3 2 defining the thresholds for detecting ar over iran an ar is a narrow transient atmospheric pathway that transports a large amount of water vapor from distant water bodies in dry countries like iran which is located in subtropical latitudes ars originating from water bodies located west of the country can be a significant source of precipitation furthermore guan and waliser 2015 showed that ars are contribute to orographic rainfall occurrences and can cause extreme precipitation events and flooding in iran therefore for hydrological purposes it would be useful to study extreme precipitation events and ars particularly in mountainous region of iran e g zagros range to investigate whether the most extreme ccs connect objects over iran were related to ar activity we utilized the methodology from rutz et al 2014 hereby referred to as rutz rutz defines an ar as a region of ivt greater than 250 kg m 1 s 1 that extends to a length greater than or equal to 2 000 km the rutz methodology is referred to as a permissive methodology as opposed to a restrictive method which means its requirements are laxer and generally tend to classify anomalous ivt regions as ars more often than other methodologies this methodology was selected because iran has notable analogs to california where the methodology was developed including its northwest southeast trending zagros mountain range with peaks up to 4 400 m which has the same orientation and prominence as the sierra nevada range along with its location in the lower mid latitudes however we acknowledge that iran s position east of the dry saharan desert is in stark contrast to california s proximity west of the pacific ocean a water body source which feeds pacific ars with their moisture though a notable analog exists in the red and mediterranean seas along with the persian gulf dezfuli 2019 furthermore ars over iran have yet to be analyzed using an precipitation linked ivt threshold which can be utilized in global studies like that used in rutz et al 2014 the 85th percentile of ivt over iran and the surrounding region was used as a threshold in dezfuli 2019 and esfandiari and lashkari 2020 the values of which would be far too low of a threshold to be useful over north america europe etc it is important to note that we do not argue that using a regionally derived ivt threshold makes the ars in these studies less deserving of the ar label however by proving that ars exist at ivt levels that can be utilized globally and is tied to precipitation we prove that iran is a region where ars of noteworthy strength frequently occur at least in the month of farvardin making it comparable to the north american west coast europe chile and other regions of the world to robustly investigate the influence ars have in the region during farvardin the climatology of ars and ar precipitation over iran during the month of farvardin is investigated using the rutz methodology and the multi decade persiann cdr precipitation dataset over 1990 2019 the 30 year duration was chosen in compliance with the standards of the world meteorological organization wmo fig 3 explores three metrics that seek to investigate how ars impact iran during farvardin specifically regarding frequency and its link to precipitation in the zagros mountains precipitation and ivt are correlated to values as high as 55 including the greater tehran metropolis moreover moderate correlations of 35 45 exist across the entirely of north and central iran ar frequencies are greatest along the coast of the persian gulf and the gulf of oman up to the foot of the zagros mountains where they occur on average 7 10 of the month or up to 3 days a month thus two similarities between the climatology of iran and california are observed the high correlation between ivt and rainfall especially in topographically complex regions rutz et al 2014 and the high frequency of elevated ivt fluxes that perpendicularly strike a prominent mountain range in addition the fraction of ar rainfall is over 50 in the southern part of the country owing to these similarities it can established that 1 atmospheric rivers at ivt fluxes required by the rutz methodology impact linked are non insignificant players in iran s farvardin hydroclimate meaning 2 the rutz methodology and others that aren t linked to climatological averages like what is done in defuzli 2019 are appropriate to use in the region for ar related studies in this study we investigate the contribution of ars on heavy precipitation using ivt and gauge information despite the breadth of analysis done in this study regarding ars over iran and their perceived link to heavy precipitation events it is vital to note that establishing a concrete link between ars and heavy precipitation requires numerical modeling simulation as described by davolio et al 2020 and such research should be conducted before solid conclusions can be made such numerical simulations are outside the scope of this study 3 3 performance measurements categorical evaluation statistics including probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi are utilized to evaluate the performance of the persiann ccs dataset for detecting rain no rain pixels continuous indices including pearson s correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and bias bias bias estimation observation are used to assess the accuracy performance of persiann ccs in estimating the rainfall intensity a value of 1 mm day is utilized as a rain no rain threshold in both persiann ccs estimates and ground based gauge observations 4 results and discussion fig 4 displays the spatial map of the accumulated precipitation for the month of farvardin during the period from 2003 to 2020 using persiann ccs data the mean monthly precipitation during farvardin for this period was 86 mm for the most recent years the average precipitation was 107 mm in 2018 178 mm in 2019 and 100 mm in 2020 all of which were higher than the baseline mean precipitation from 2003 to 2020 furthermore the year 2019 when iran experienced many floods was the wettest year in the last two decades in addition fig 4 reveals that the spatial pattern of accumulated precipitation varies among different years the greatest concentration of rainfall occurred over northeastern iran in 2003 while southwestern iran experienced the bulk of precipitation in 2019 4 1 evaluation of persiann ccs for 2019 as discussed in the introduction katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 mosaffa et al 2020a mosaffa et al 2020b and mosaffa et al 2020c evaluated the performance of the daily persiann ccs estimates over iran for the period prior to 2018 the intention of this study is not to evaluate the capability of persiann ccs for precipitation estimation but rather evaluate rainfall totals during farvardin 2019 against ground based observations for the provinces that experienced floods table 2 presents spatial averages of categorical and continuous evaluation metrics over four selected provinces fars ilam kermanshah and lorestan these are among the provinces that reported the greatest flooding damages during the farvardin 2019 floods in terms of categorical statistics pod and far values are 0 78 and 0 28 over these provinces respectively persiann ccs with 0 65 0 53 has the best worst performance in terms of csi over kermanshah ilam province according to continuous statistical metrics the correction coefficient cc is approximately 0 55 in the selected provinces and the highest cc values appear over the ilam province with the value of 0 75 also rmse ranges from 16 55 to 23 14 mm day in terms of bias persiann ccs mainly overestimates bias 0 precipitation intensity when comparing our results to those of previous studies which evaluated different satellite precipitation products over iran alijanian et al 2017 mahbod et al 2019 moazami et al 2013 mosaffa et al 2020b 2020c it must be pointed out that persiann ccs performs better than other near real time products during farvardin 2019 fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of pod far csi cc rmse and bias over the four selected provinces this figure shows that pod values in all stations is above 0 75 except a station in the north of fars province and a couple of stations in the middle of western provinces which have pod about 0 6 western provinces including kermanshah ilam and lorestan have lower far than the fars province in the south of iran except for a few stations with csi below 0 5 mostly found in the fars province other stations have csi greater than 0 5 the spatial distribution of cc indicates that the persiann ccs algorithm has better performance over the western provinces than over fars according to fig 5 cc in regions that experienced heavier precipitation is higher than in the other regions stations in the lorestan province have the highest rmse compared with other stations on the contrary stations in the south of fars and kermanshah provinces have the lowest rmse although precipitation is overestimated bias 0 in most of the stations results of bias in the north of the kermanshah province and a couple of stations in the east of the lorestan province shows an underestimation of precipitation comparing with the conducted evaluation studies for near real time precipitation over iran persiann ccs has the potential to be used as a candidate for short term duration precipitation studies 4 2 temporal variations of heavy precipitation events during the period 2003 2020 using persiann ccs estimates to quantify how the number of floods has been increasing during the last three years we plot the frequency intensity duration and volume of precipitation for the period 2003 2020 over the study area fig 6 for this purpose we apply the connect algorithm with a 3 mm 3 hour threshold on the persiann ccs estimates for the period 2003 2020 for the month of farvardin across iran the frequency fig 6a of heavy precipitation events events with more than 3 mm 3 hour rainfall does not show a significant change across the country during the month of farvardin the average number of intense events is 97 however the highest number is 151 events occurring in 2019 the variations in intensity of heavy precipitation events fig 6b demonstrate that the average magnitude of heavy rainfall has increased during the last three years the average intensity of heavy precipitation events is 15 7 mm 3 hour for the whole period compared with 55 3 mm 3 hour in 2018 79 0 mm 3 hour in 2019 and 30 1 mm 3 hour in 2020 these results are consistent with the increase in the number of floods reported across iran during the last three years the average duration of heavy precipitation fig 6c was 14 2 h during the last two decades while peaking to 23 8 h in 2019 the average volume of heavy precipitation fig 6d during the month of farvardin for the whole study period is 0 7 km3 event while an average of 0 97 km3 event was recorded over the last three years of the study the total volume of heavy precipitation per year fig 6e was 77 km3 on average compared with an average of 132 km3 of precipitation occurring during the last three years most notably the total precipitation volume was 191 km3 in 2019 overall we can conclude that the increase in intensity average volume per event and total volume of heavy precipitation are the main reasons for the increases in the number of floods during the last three years over iran 4 3 investigating atmospheric river presence during heavy precipitation events from 2003 to 2020 the rutz et al 2014 methodology was used to determine whether there was ar activity during the most extreme farvardin rainfall events every year during 2003 2020 including extra significant events in 2019 and 2020 as rutz is considered a permissive methodology which implies an enhanced possibility of non ar ivt features being classified as ars we further checked to see if ar activities existed over any area in iran for at least 24 h thereby ensuring that an event satisfies the requirements of an ar 1 the weakest category for an ar from the scale introduced by ralph et al 2019 over the study period it was observed that ar conditions existed during every year s most extreme events along with the two extra extreme events in 2019 and 2020 among them only three years 2010 2011 and 2013 had ar conditions for less than 24 h with the shortest 2011 that lasted for 9 h furthermore some events such as the extreme rainfall event of 2004 could be traced back to multiple ar events affecting different regions of iran dezfuli 2019 observed that the sources of moisture for ars that impact iran come from the surrounding bodies of water including the mediterranean sea the caspian sea the persian gulf the red sea and the atlantic ocean from our analysis we identify that the sources of moisture for ars in the region are from the atlantic ocean via a northern africa pathway and from the red sea via the red sea strait bab el mandeb these pathways are also recognized in esfandiari and lashkari 2020 in fig 7 we showcase the three most observed ar lifecycles in the region 1 those that propagate from the atlantic ocean over northern africa without significant influence from the red sea fig 7c d driven by the saharan anticyclone shay el et al 1999 2 those with moisture chiefly coming from the red sea fig 7b via the red sea strait driven by a moisture transport at the 850 hpa level following a favorable position of the arabian cyclone and mid tropospheric troughs raziei et al 2012 and 3 those which are created by merging bodies of moisture from both the red sea and the atlantic ocean fig 7a e though the timing between ars can vary between being simultaneous red sea and african moisture at the same time 2003 and 2019 and being subsequent one source of moisture followed by other of these two different timings it is the former that produces the events of greater volume with the precipitation events of 2003 and 2019 being 4th and 1st heaviest by rainfall volume table 1 showcases each ar with its pathway determined by examining ivt objects at the 200 and 250 kg m 1 s 1 levels of the ar examined three were found to come from moisture via the african pathway seven from the red sea strait ten from both sources and two from other sources gulf of aden and arabian sea this means that out of the 22 observed ars 17 were reliant on moisture fluxes from the gulf of aden while 13 could be linked to moisture transport over the african continent furthermore each ar was ranked by the amount of precipitation it produced over iran as calculated by connect the three highest ranking ars all come from the three different ar classes each occurring within the 2018 2019 period afterwards ars with moisture from both sources make up 7 out of 10 of the ars ranked 4th to 13th yet only 3 out of 9 of the ars ranked 14th onwards are from both sources in summary ars with moisture from both the african and red sea sources are the most frequently observed ars that coincide with heavy precipitation over iran fig 8 shows the accumulated amount of precipitation occurring during the events shown in fig 7 the most extreme event that occurred in farvardin 2003 which was ranked the 4th greatest event by volume and propagated from the red sea and the atlantic ocean mainly occurred in northeastern iran on the other hand the heavy precipitation that occurred in farvardin 2019 that involved the most extreme events in terms of volume during the last two decades and had similar pathway to that from 2003 mainly occurred over southwestern iran this figure shows precipitation from the most extreme events in 2003 2012 2017 2018 and 2019 and highlights that extreme events in recent farvardins 2018 and 2019 are heavier than those of the past 5 conclusion spring precipitation especially during the month of farvardin is important for iranian agriculture over the past few years an increase in the number of floods occurring after unprecedented rainfall events during the month of farvardin have affected millions of people across iran caused the loss of life damaged infrastructure and engendered substantial economic losses in iran s agriculture sector the apparent increase in the number of floods during the last three years 2018 2020 led us to investigate the variations in different aspects of heavy precipitation events like intensity and frequency as well as their associated mechanisms during the month of farvardin to our knowledge there is no study which explores the precipitation variations and mechanisms during this month the previous studies over iran mainly focused on analyzing heavy precipitation at daily scales over the whole year however there is a need to assess the flood causing short duration heavy precipitation that occurs in early spring in addition using a limited number of synoptic gauge observations has hindered the ability to explore the variations in precipitation at a high spatial resolution in this study we applied the connect algorithm with a 3 mm 3 hour threshold on the persiann ccs estimates at 0 04 spatial resolution to explore the variations in frequency intensity duration and volume of heavy precipitation during farvardin for the period from 2003 to 2020 the results indicated that increases in intensity and volume of heavy precipitation are the main reasons for the rising number of floods during farvardin over the years 2018 2020 however a significant increase in frequency and duration of heavy precipitation are not observed the results also show that the frequency intensity duration and volume of heavy precipitation was the highest in 2019 during the last two decades based on the persiann ccs estimates this is also supported by the international emergency events database https www emdat be which ranked the floods in farvardin 2019 as the costliest economic loss in iranian history during the last two decades spatial analyses revealed that heavy precipitation events occurred over almost the entire country in farvardin during the period 2003 2020 with the heaviest volume of rainfall hitting southwestern iran in 2019 and the second highest volume in northeastern iran in 2018 in addition we observe that the spatiotemporal distribution of heavy precipitation events extracted by the connect algorithm are consistent with extreme events occurred over iran investigating the presence of ar conditions on heavy precipitation events that occurred during the month of farvardin revealed that ars exist during every year s most extreme events in addition we classify the ar pathways that occurred in the country during farvardin into three main categories 1 ars that propagated from the atlantic ocean via north africa driven by the saharan anticyclone 2 ars that propagated from the red sea via the red sea strait and are influenced by the arabian cyclone and mid tropospheric troughs 3 ars created by merging bodies of moisture from both the atlantic ocean and the red sea our further investigations revealed that 8 out of 13 of the largest ars over iran come from moisture plumes with pathways over the african continent and the red sea although this study mainly explored the variations of short term precipitation over iran for a specific month the same procedure can be followed for other regions this study highlighted that the high spatial 0 04 and temporal 3 hourly resolution of persiann ccs at a global scale is an attractive feature for analyzing precipitation variations especially over the countries with limited rain gauge observations in addition the connect algorithm which is an object oriented tracking algorithm can be used for the investigation of natural hazards associated with ar events such as floods and mudslides over different regions credit

4399,climate change and human activities have together altered the river hydrological regime and consequently threatened the health of river ecosystems quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health regimes is essential for water resource management and river ecology protection although previous studies have analysed the hydrologic alterations using some indicators separating effects of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health is needed for developing adaptive measures to protect the ecosystem of river basins in this study a comprehensive assessment framework for quantifying climatic and anthropogenic influences on river hydrological health variation was proposed the framework consists of the following steps 1 the reconstruction of natural river streamflow using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model 2 calculation of river hydrological health through the ecological flow threshold method and 3 quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health using the observed simulated comparison approach the semi arid laohahe basin in northern china which consists of three human influenced catchments taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo and one natural catchment xiquan was selected as the case study area the case study demonstrated that the proposed procedure is efficient in quantifying climatic and anthropogenic influences on river hydrological health the results revealed that the hydrological health level has significantly declined in the three human influenced catchments for the human influenced period 1980 2016 particularly in the 2000 s and 2010 s where it degraded much more severely whereas the relatively adequate rainfall in the 1990 s maintained the river hydrological health at a good status the quantitative evaluation showed that human activities were the main driving factors for the hydrological health degradation during the whole human influenced period with contributions of 80 8 91 9 and 86 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively widespread artificial water withdrawal and reservoir operation were the two crucial human activities that caused the degradation of river hydrological health for the studied catchment the proposed procedure and findings of this study not only help in deeper understanding of the evolutionary characteristics and driving mechanisms of river hydrological health in a changing environment in general but also provide scientific basis for local water resources management and river ecosystems protection keywords ecological flow hydrological health climate change human activities impact assessment 1 introduction rivers are one of the most crucial ecosystems in terms of both socioeconomic benefits and natural function and they play a vital role in the hydrological cycle as their channels are essential for nutrient cycling and energy flow between diverse ecosystems hotchkiss et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 palmer and ruhi 2019 from a systems perspective rivers have strong anti interference abilities however their self repairing capacity is inherently limited which means that when the external interference exceeds their capacity the riverine ecosystem will irreversibly be degraded and cause many service functions to decline or even disappear wohl et al 2005 poff 2018 belletti et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to maintain river health to ensure the sustainable development of economy and society in retrospect the concept of river health was first proposed in the 1972 clean water act by the usepa which means maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity where integrity refers to a condition in which the natural structure and function of ecosystems is maintained karr 1999 in other words the original and undisturbed state is the health state of the river in which the river ecosystem can support and maintain its primary ecological processes simpson et al 1999 and the river health refers to how similar the river is to an undamaged river of the same type especially regarding its biodiversity and ecosystem functions schofield and davies 1996 with the increased research scholars believe that river health should also include the service value of rivers to human society meyer 1997 johnson et al 2003 climate change and human activities however significantly affect river health resulting in the deterioration of water quality degradation of habitats and loss of riverine biodiversity habersack et al 2014 zhao et al 2019a belletti et al 2020 cui et al 2020 climate change affects the flow of rivers through alterations in rainfall and temperature patterns and intensity thereby affecting the ecological health of the river human activities such as dam construction immoderate water consumption and river cut off disturb the natural flow regime and hydrological cycle thus it is urgent to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on river health the generally accepted methods for evaluating river health can be assigned to two groups biological monitoring and comprehensive indicator methods norris and hawkins 2000 the majority of scholars are using the comprehensive indicator method because of the integrative perspective with a suit of physical chemical and biological variables richter et al 1996 1997 poff et al 2010 sofi et al 2020 generally in the comprehensive indicator method the flow and ecological flow satisfaction rate are important indicators because the natural flow regime plays a major role in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems lytle and poff 2004 zhao et al 2019a sofi et al 2020 mcmillan 2021 richter et al 1996 pioneered the development of the indicators of hydrological alteration iha as well as the range of variability approach richter et al 1997 which can assess the characteristics of flow variation establishing a link between different hydrological variables and ecological features some studies have identified a smaller subset of hydrological indicators to represent the overall change in flow regimes gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 2018 such as ecosurplus and ecodeficit vogel et al 2007 and the most ecologically relevant hydrological indicators yang et al 2008 ecological flow containing the quantity and regime of water flows is of great importance for maintaining the health of river and lake ecosystems and an extremely low daily flow supplement intensity may cause ineffective ecological restoration measures acreman and dunbar 2004 zhao et al 2019b therefore a river hydrological health h assessment method was proposed based on the ecological flow threshold which better represents the actual demand of river ecosystems for river flow ma et al 2019 based on the ecological flow thresholds the evolutionary characteristics and driving mechanisms of river hydrological health can be analysed the first step is the accurate calculation of ecological flow the widely accepted methods for calculating ecological flow can be divided into four main categories hydrological hydraulics habitat and holistic methods boner and furland 1982 mosely 1982 nehring and anderson 1993 hughes and hannart 2003 in particular the hydrological method is broadly used because of its ease of obtaining data simple calculation and in depth analysis of the overall hydrological regime of the river the hydrological methods mainly include the tennant method tennant 1976 monthly frequency method and monthly probability density curve method zhang et al 2018 nowadays due to environmental changes the consistency of river flow sequences often undergoes a certain degree of variation which affects the accuracy of ecological flow calculations zhang et al 2018 therefore the use of sub sequences before hydrological mutation is necessary for accurate calculation meanwhile by comparing the ecological flow with the flow before and after the hydrological mutation the river hydrological health of the two different periods can be evaluated tan et al 2018 then further analysis could be carried out to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health however a few recent studies assessed the impacts only from a qualitative perspective sellami et al 2016 tian et al 2019 yu et al 2020 mezger et al 2021 it is essential to develop a quantitative method that separates the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health the observed simulated comparison analysis method is widely used to distinguish the influence of human activities from climate change on streamflow by the reconstruction of natural streamflow wang et al 2020b this method which simulates near natural hydrological variables using hydrological models can avoid the uncertainties caused by naturalised data e g reservoir regulation records and human water withdrawal records which can be an effective method to quantitatively characterise the impact of environmental changes on river hydrological health in addition coupled with existing climate change models simulations the hydrological model simulation can predict the future river hydrological health variations under changing environment zhao et al 2019a therefore this study proposed a comprehensive assessment framework for quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health variation which consist of three steps 1 the reconstruction of river natural streamflow using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model 2 calculation of river hydrological health through the ecological flow threshold method and 3 quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health using the observed simulated comparison approach the semi arid laohahe basin in northern china was selected for the case study because its river streamflow has decreased significantly and streamflow interruption occurred in summer under intense human influence jiang et al 2011 yong et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the outcomes of this study improve our understanding of the evolutionary characteristics and driving mechanisms of river hydrological health in a changing environment and also provide scientific basis for practical water resource management and river ecosystems protection in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 laohahe basin the laohahe basin is located at the junction of the hebei and liaoning provinces and the inner mongolia autonomous region in northeastern china 41 42 75 n 117 25 120 e fig 1 it flows approximately 430 km eastward to the west liao river with its origin at qilaotu mountain in the northern part of the yan shan mountain chain it covers an area of 18112 km2 with the xinglongpo hydrological station 42 32 n 119 43 e the basin s elevation ranges from 427 m above mean sea level to over 2000 m a m s l in the upstream mountainous area descending from west to east yong et al 2013 the annual precipitation of this basin is 411 7 mm 1964 2016 summer is the main rainy season and approximately 88 of the annual precipitation occurs from may to september which leads to a significant seasonal variation in streamflow jiang et al 2012 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2020b in this study we selected four catchments including one headwater catchment xiquan two midstream catchments taipingzhuang and chifeng and the entire catchment table 1 lists the geographic and hydrological characteristics of these four catchments the average annual precipitation of these catchments ranges from 401 to 573 mm and the average annual streamflow from 21 to 126 mm the precipitation and runoff show similar characteristics of spatial variation increasing gradually from the northeast to the southwest 2 1 2 data the data used in this study included hydrometeorological geographic and socioeconomic data more details are as follows 1 the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn provided daily meteorological data from 1964 to 2016 including wind speed and maximum and minimum air temperatures measured by ten national standard meteorological stations fig 1 daily precipitation data of 52 rain gauges from 1964 to 2016 daily streamflow series of the same period for the four catchments and information of the three reservoirs were gathered from the water resources department of the inner mongolia autonomous region to drive the vic hydrological model the meteorological and precipitation data were interpolated into grid data with a resolution of 0 0625 0 0625 using the inverse distance weighting method in addition the daily precipitation and streamflow data were converted to monthly and annual averages 2 the geographic datasets consisted of soil type vegetable type and digital elevation model dem data soil types were obtained from the food and agricultural organization fao dataset vegetation types were provided by the university of maryland s 1 km global land cover production the 30 arcsecond global dem data were available from the u s geological survey usgs website https www usgs gov 3 socioeconomic statistics data were collected as follows population and gross domestic product gdp from the data centre for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn irrigated area and food production from the local statistical bureau 2 2 framework for quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological health as illustrated in fig 2 the proposed framework can be divided into three main steps for assessing river hydrological health evolution characteristics and quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on hydrological health variation first it is necessary to test the consistency of the hydrometeorological data previous studies in the laohahe basin have confirmed a significant decrease in streamflow jiang et al 2011 yong et al 2013 therefore we implemented a variation analysis of the hydrometeorological series for the selected four basins focussing on the trend and change point numerous methods are available for change point detection and we selected the mann kendall m k test mann 1945 kendall 1975 pettitt test pettitt 1979 and precipitation streamflow double cumulative curve dcc method according to the change point the whole period can be divided into two parts i e the baseline period undisturbed period and changed period disturbed period then the hydrological and meteorological forcing data in the undisturbed period were used to calibrate the vic hydrological model described in section 2 2 1 with an acquisition of optimal model parameters based on these parameters the meteorological forcing data for the disturbed period were used to drive the model for reconstructing simulating natural streamflow series which was considered to be only affected by climatic factors the second step was to establish an assessment of river hydrological health the most suitable ecological flow was first calculated and the threshold of ecological flow was determined accordingly then a hydrological health algorithm was constructed and the level of hydrological health was calculated the final step focussed on quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on hydrological health variation the total change in the observed hydrological health level between disturbed and undisturbed periods presents the combined effects of climate change and human activities whereas the change in the simulated hydrological health level between both periods can be considered as solely the effect of climate change jiang et al 2019 based on the assumption that climatic factors are independent of human activities we can quantitatively separate the impacts of climate change and human activities 2 2 1 vic hydrological model to simulate the hydrological process we used the macro scale semi distributed vic model liang et al 1994 developed by the university of washington university of california at berkeley and princeton university the model solves the surface energy and water balance to study the effects of droughts luo and wood 2007 water resource impacts vano et al 2010 ecologically relevant flow indicators wenger et al 2010 shrestha et al 2013 and for various other applications the model parameters can be commonly classified into two categories the parameters in the first category can be determined directly from soil type and land cover data including the saturated soil potential ψ s m soil porosity θ s m3 m3 saturated hydraulic conductivity k s m s root depth and fraction the other category consists of seven user calibrated parameters can refer to liang et al 1994 and wang et al 2020b while optimizing the seven sensitive parameters three criteria were used to evaluate the model performance jiang et al 2018 that is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of correlation and relative error bias calculated by the following equations 1 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs

hydrological health assessment method despite ample research on ecological flow there is still a lack of universal definitions and standard calculation methods for ecological flow several methods currently exist for the measurement of ecological flow criteria such as the tennant method tennant 1976 and flow duration curve mu et al 2008 which are susceptible to extreme events and annual distribution inequality tan et al 2018 therefore based on the bioadaptability wilson and franklin 2002 and plasticity lai et al 2010 theory of ecosystems the river discharge corresponding to the extreme value of the monthly probability density curve is treated as the most suitable ecological discharge for that month in this study then the relevant ecological flow thresholds can be defined according to ma et al 2019 the definitions can be described as follows the most suitable ecological flow q 0 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the flow corresponding to the maximum of the monthly average flow probability density function is the most suitable ecological flow for the month and the most suitable annual ecological flow process is composed of the most suitable ecological flow per month optimal lower threshold for ecological flow q 1 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the mean value of the minimum and optimum ecological flow is treated as the lower threshold of the optimal ecological flow the optimal lower threshold annual ecological flow process is composed of the optimal lower threshold for ecological flow per month optimal upper threshold for ecological flow q 2 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the mean value of the maximum and optimum ecological flow is treated as the upper threshold of the optimal ecological flow the optimal upper threshold annual ecological flow process is composed of the optimal upper threshold for ecological flow per month minimum ecological flow q 3 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the minimum value of the monthly average flow of several years is treated as the minimum ecological flow of that month the minimum annual ecological flow process is composed of the minimum ecological flow per month maximum ecological flow q 4 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the maximum value of the monthly average flow over several years is treated as the maximum ecological flow of that month the maximum annual ecological flow process is composed of the maximum ecological flow per month extremely small ecological flow q 5 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the minimum daily flow per month for several years is treated as the extremely small ecological flow of that month the extremely small annual ecological flow process is composed of the extremely small ecological flow per month extremely large ecological flow q 6 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the maximum daily flow per month for several years is treated as the extremely large ecological flow of that month the extremely large annual ecological flow process is composed of the extremely large ecological flow per month different ecological flow thresholds present different states of river health in addition compared with low flow large floods can improve species diversity in rivers which suggests that excessive flow has a better ecological influence than small flow then the river hydrological health assessment algorithm can be constructed ma et al 2019 as shown in eq 4 4 h q q 5 0 5 10 0 q 5 q q 5 q 3 q 5 1 5 1 10 q 5 q 3 q q 3 q 1 q 3 2 4 10 q 3 q 1 q q 1 q 0 q 1 1 8 10 q 1 q 0 q 2 q q 2 q 0 1 9 10 q 0 q 2 q 4 q q 4 q 2 2 6 10 q 2 q 4 q 6 q q 6 q 4 1 5 2 5 10 q 4 q 6 1 5 q 6 q q 6 1 0 5 10 q 6 1 5 q 6 5 1 5 q 6 where h denotes the river hydrological health q 0 denotes the most suitable ecological flow q 1 and q 2 denote the optimal lower and upper thresholds for ecological flow q 3 and q 4 denote the minimum and maximum ecological flows and q 5 and q 6 denote the extremely small and large ecological flows respectively to be consistent with the difference between the minimum flow value of zero and the extremely small ecological flow tan et al 2018 suggest that the upper threshold is taken twice as much as that of the maximum history daily flow which is the same as the upper threshold of the tennant method valued 200 however ma et al 2019 point that it is more practical to set the extremely large ecological flow value as 1 5 times the maximum ecological flow because the tennant method generally calculates the annual average flow in this study we adopt the ma s suggestion when floods exceed this extremely large flow they are also calculated as 1 5 times the maximum daily flow in addition all the data for calculating ecological flows came from the undisturbed period considering that human activities have affected river health during the changed period the proposed assessment method is applicable for different time scales such as the annual scale where we only need to change the time scale and the remaining steps are the same as in the previous analysis 2 2 3 quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological health variation based on the assessment algorithm the evolutionary characteristics of river hydrological health can be depicted under the conditions of observed and simulated streamflow for a small basin climate change is mainly controlled by external forces thus climate change and human activities were regarded as independent variables then the effects of these two variables on river hydrological health can be quantified as follows wang et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2020a 5 δ h t δ h c δ h h h 2 obs h 1 obs 6 δ h c h 2 sim h 1 sim 7 δ h h δ h t δ h c h 2 obs h 1 obs h 2 sim h 1 sim 8 i c δ h c δ h t 100 9 i h δ h h δ h t 100 where δ h t and δ h t are the total change in hydrological health and its absolute value respectively δ h c and δ h h represent the change in hydrological health induced by climate change and human activities respectively h 1 obs and h 2 obs denote the observed average annual value of hydrological health for undisturbed and disturbed periods respectively h 1 sim and h 2 sim denote the simulated average annual value of hydrological health for undisturbed and disturbed periods respectively i c and i h suggest the relative effects in percentage of climate change and human activities respectively overall the main procedure is as follows 1 divide the undisturbed and disturbed periods and then reconstruct the natural streamflow series 2 establish the assessment algorithm and calculate river hydrological health under different streamflow series and 3 quantify the difference between observed and simulated changes in hydrological health 3 results 3 1 natural streamflow reconstruction as shown in table 2 the m k test results demonstrated that precipitation and potential evapotranspiration calculated via the penman monteith equation recommended by fao series have no significant increasing or decreasing trend for the four catchments whereas the streamflow series decreased drastically except for the xiquan catchment fig 3 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments the high values of streamflow appear in the 1960 s to 1970 s and then start to gradually decline until the late 1980 s but in the mid 1990 s the laoha basin seems to enter a relative wet period and a rebound of the streamflow occurs for the three catchments in the most recent decade the annual streamflow are seriously reduced to their historical lowest levels from the pettitt test table 2 and dcc results fig 3 the first change point of streamflow series occurred in 1979 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments therefore we divided the whole period 1964 2016 into the undisturbed period 1964 1979 and disturbed period 1980 2016 the semi distributed vic hydrological model was used to reconstruct the natural streamflow and the comparison of the reconstructed and observed streamflow series is presented in fig 4 then nse cc and bias metrics were calculated and are presented in table 3 the values of nse cc and bias for the taipingzhuang catchment were 0 90 0 95 and 1 59 during the calibration period 1964 1974 and 0 82 0 91 and 5 47 during the validation period 1975 1979 respectively for the chifeng catchment the values of nse cc and bias were 0 77 0 88 0 6 and 0 71 0 85 and 11 3 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the nse cc and bias values for the xinglongpo catchment during the calibration and validation periods were 0 83 and 0 80 0 91 and 0 90 and 1 2 and 1 6 respectively overall these results indicate that the accuracy of the reconstructed streamflow satisfied the requirements of this study 3 2 calculation of the most suitable ecological flow when the river flow is the appropriate value of the most suitable ecological flow in each month it can maintain the health of the river ecosystem and the stability of the population structure of biological species which is of great significance to the management of river health to ensure the accuracy of the ecological flow calculation results we compared the calculation results with other methods in this study the nonparametric estimation kernel density function kd was used to fit the monthly flow order the parametric estimation was also used to fit the monthly flow order zhang et al 2018 which uses the statistical d of the kolmogorov smirnov k s method to test the goodness of fit and select the appropriate distribution function a comparison of the results showed that the generalized extreme value distribution gev was more suitable for the monthly average flow series of the study area according to li et al 2007 we selected a 50 guarantee rate q50 in the monthly frequency calculation method for the most suitable ecological flow calculation the results of the aforementioned method were also verified by the tennant method which is the most widespread hydrological method worldwide tharme 2003 and often used to verify the rationality of other ecological flow calculation methods li and ling 2014 pastor et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 the monthly ecological flows calculated by the kd method were located between the gev method and the q50 method the lower threshold of the optimum flow calculated by the tennant method mafl is generally lower than the result of the kd method while sometimes higher than it of the gev method we also carried out a comparison in the annual scale showed in table 4 the annual ecological flows fell on the optimum flow range recommended by the tennant method except for the xiquan catchment meanwhile the result of the kd method was closer to the optimum flow range in the xiquan catchment therefore the kd method for calculating the ecological flow used in this study was accurate and reasonable based on the calculation of the most suitable ecological flow q 0 the relevant ecological flows q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 q 5 q 6 were calculated fig 6 shows the breakdown of ecological flow according to the threshold definition in section 2 and the annual distribution of each hydrological station under various hydrological health levels 3 3 assessment of river hydrological health we calculated the river hydrological health of each catchment using the assessment method established in section 2 as fig 7 illustrates the observed hydrological health during the undisturbed period was better than that during the disturbed period for the three human impacted catchments before 1980 the river hydrological health level was generally higher than 80 whereas it was lower than 50 after 1980 except from 1990 to 1999 the hydrological health of the simulated streamflow exhibited good consistency and was in a better state at the monthly scale e g june october with a level of over 90 furthermore we calculated the health degree at the annual scale and the average value during different periods as shown in table 5 the averages of the hydrological health levels were 89 4 88 8 and 91 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively from 1964 to 1979 however the averages were 45 9 51 1 and 50 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively for the human influenced period 1980 2016 which indicated an evident decline especially in the 2010 s the means of hydrological health were 11 5 2 1 and 8 8 respectively suggesting a significant variation of flow regimes 3 4 quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health considering the hydrological health calculation results from the observed and simulated series the impacts of climate change and human activities can be quantitatively separated based on the framework described in section 2 in addition we calculated the relative contributions of climate change and human activities over different decades during the disturbed period to further assess decadal variations the results of the quantitative estimation are shown in table 5 and fig 8 for the entire disturbed period the impact of human activities on hydrological health variation is conspicuously greater than that of climate change the contributions of human activities were 80 8 91 9 and 86 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively whereas the percentages of climate change contribution on health variation were only 19 2 8 1 and 14 0 respectively for the different decades during the disturbed period the contribution of human activities to hydrological health variation shows an increasing trend except in the 1990 s considering the whole basin xinglongpo catchment as an example the percentages of human activities were 73 5 0 6 87 3 and 97 5 respectively from the 1980 s to the 2010 s although the percentage of human activities was low in the 1990 s it still showed a slight variation with a decrease of 3 6 a previous study showed that precipitation was abundant during the period of 1990 1999 and less water was drawn from river channels for industrial production and agricultural irrigation yong et al 2013 wang et al 2020b consequently hydrological health remained at a high level in the 1990 s the taipingzhuang and chifeng catchments showed similar characteristics to the xinglongpo catchment these results illustrate that in the human influenced period especially in the 2000 s and 2010 s human activities drastically influenced hydrological health which is of great importance to aquatic ecosystems 4 discussions 4 1 rationality analysis of river hydrological health assessment in this study we adopted a hydrological health assessment method based on the ecological flow threshold using dimensionless mathematical formulas seven different levels of ecological flow were coupled into a system to assess river hydrological health q 0 is the most suitable ecological flow and the rationality of the calculation results is proved in section 3 2 q 1 and q 2 denote the optimal lower and upper thresholds for ecological flow respectively previous studies have often used the most suitable ecological flow plus or minus the standard deviation and the frequency range of the hydrological sequence with a specific ratio to obtain the above two thresholds shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 however these methods can easily make the optimal limits of suitable ecological flow exceed the maximum and minimum ecological flow the method adopted in this study treat the mean value of the minimum maximum and optimum ecological flow as the lower upper threshold of the optimal ecological flow which can resolve the mentioned problem moreover the method considers the influence of extreme flow on the upper and lower limits of the suitable flow interval q 3 and q 4 denote the minimum and maximum ecological flows respectively these two values are the minimum and maximum values of each month in the selected monthly average flow sequence when the aquatic organisms have safely experienced such a minimum maximum flow under natural conditions and the ecosystem has not been severely damaged to the extent that it is irreversible it means that the aquatic ecosystem can adapt to such flow conditions when the flow exceeds these two thresholds it indicates that the river ecosystem has been severely damaged q 5 and q 6 denote the extremely small and extremely large ecological flows respectively and their values are the minimum and maximum daily flows of each month in the selected daily flow sequence such extreme events have great impacts on river ecosystems and may lead to the extinction of some species causing irreversible ecological disasters however the probability of their occurrence is small therefore these flows were assigned to a smaller subsection in the study area the xiquan catchment is located in the headwaters of the laohahe basin which is less disturbed by human activities and has no significant changing trend in runoff table 2 hence it was selected as a reference basin to evaluate the rationality of the above hydrological health assessment method by calculating the hydrological health under the condition of observed and simulated flow sequences as shown in fig 7 the monthly scale hydrological health sequence distribution in the xiquan catchment is relatively consistent with a good overall health level and no evident variation in the other three catchments the observed hydrological health sequence showed a significant change with a change point in 1979 which was consistent with the characteristics of runoff change in addition the observed and simulated hydrological health indexes in the xiquan catchment were 91 27 and 96 05 in the baseline period respectively whereas those in the changed period were 91 65 and 96 27 compared to the hydrological health changes of the other three human influenced basins fig 8 it is considered that the hydrological health of the xiquan catchment had no significant change in summary we suggest that the application of a river hydrological health assessment based on the ecological flow threshold in the laohahe basin is reasonable 4 2 impact of human activities on river hydrological health the results in section 3 4 show that climate change and human activities have significant impacts on the hydrological health of the laohahe basin among which human activities are the main influencing factor with contributions of more than 80 especially in the chifeng catchment with a contribution of more than 90 in the laohahe basin agriculture stock raising and the mining industry are the three main activities in production jiang et al 2011 large scale agricultural irrigation reduces the flow of the river meanwhile with economic development and population growth urban water supply and industrial water use are also increasing which exacerbates the decrease in water in the river thereby affecting its hydrological health fig 9 a shows that since 1980 socioeconomic data in the study area have increased significantly the scale of agricultural production has been continuously expanding with grain crops mainly wheat corn rice and soybean accounting for approximately 70 and grain output has increased by approximately 4 million tonnes large scale agricultural planting requires sufficient water to meet the irrigation demand particularly in march to may every year when crops are in the critical sowing period large amounts of water resources are consumed making the hydrological health of rivers at a low level in the middle and lower reaches the gdp of the research area shows a trend of exponential growth especially after 2000 where the growth rate is evident simultaneously the population of the region peaked in 2000 and remained relatively high correspondingly the hydrological health of the whole basin is seriously degraded especially in the chifeng catchment the river health is maintained at a relatively high level only in summer june august which is mainly because the largest city in the study area is located in this catchment fig 9 b shows an intuitive display of water withdrawal over the last decade the percentage of water withdrawal from natural river runoff showed an increasing trend and reached a peak in 2010 beyond 75 since then the percentage remained high this is consistent with the results of the hydrological health regime in our study which revealed a more serious deterioration of hydrological health and a higher contribution of human activities in the 2010 s the excessive development of water resources has caused streamflow cut off resulting in severe river ecosystem degradation this seriously restricts the sustainable development of the basin and attracts government attention hence the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china proposed a new initiative to use west liao river water resources as its capacity permits for water resources management and water environment restoration of the basin tang et al 2019 the outcomes of this study will provide scientific guidance for this new initiative and promote the protection of local river ecosystems reservoir regulation is another human activity that obstructs flow regimes and consequently affects river hydrological health as shown in fig 1 there are three large reservoirs in the basin namely sanzuodian reservoir total storage capacity 3 69 108 m3 erdaohezi reservoir total storage capacity 0 8 108 m3 and dahushi reservoir total storage capacity 1 2 108 m3 the principle of reservoir regulations in the basin generally follows the maintenance of storage in winter and spring and the release of water in summer and autumn to meet the needs of agricultural irrigation yong et al 2013 ren et al 2014 thereby exacerbating hydrological health degradation the reservoir drainage is generally lower than the natural inflow however the precipitation in the basin is mostly concentrated from june to september therefore from june to september every year a certain amount of flow can still be ensured in the channel thereby maintaining the hydrological health at a relatively high level fig 7 the impact of climate change on hydrological health is mainly manifested by the changes in precipitation the hydrological health of the basin remained at a relatively high level in the 1990 s compared with the 1980 s and the 2000 s with more precipitation and increased intra channel flow yong et al 2013 4 3 advantages of the new framework in this study we proposed a framework based on ecological flow which was used to assess hydrological health and its evolution characteristics then quantitatively analyse the attribution of the evolution the framework can reflect not only the inter annual evolution characteristics of hydrological health but also the intra annual distribution characteristics of hydrological health for example after the year 2000 the hydrological health of each sub catchment showed persistent low intra and inter annual values from march to may and from september to november fig 8 b c and d these persistent low values may cause great damage to the river ecosystem as described in section 4 2 these durations are highly likely to result from regular human activity therefore compared with the traditional iha method haghighi and kløve 2013 haghighi et al 2014 which can only reflect the inter annual changes of hydrological regime this framework can provide a better scientific basis for protecting the ecological health of rivers in addition there are autocorrelation and information redundancy among the 33 variables of iha smakhtin and shilpakar 2006 which makes it difficult to operate and manage in water resource management practice clausen and biggs 2000 cheng et al 2018 however based on biological adaptability and taking ecological flow as the evaluation the method of assessing river hydrological health is simple and scientific we have also used the framework to assess the contribution of climate change and human activities on hydrological health changes over time in order to better understand the evolution of hydrological regimes and their causes in the changing environment in summary the proposed framework can be easily utilized to study the changes of river hydrological health and the effect of climate change and human activities as well as the method introduced by cui et al 2020 meanwhile our framework is convenient to regulate water resources without damaging river hydrological health because of the less variables moreover considering the timeliness of ecological flow and the spatial adaptability of ecological components with multiscale and multiobjective the method can infer the general hydrologic health of the river section by using the instantaneous flow of the monitored section so as to infer the ecosystem health of the river at the same time the use of short term inflow forecasts and economic and social water demand forecasts can assess hydrological health within a certain period of time so as to provide a scientific basis for the rational allocation of water resources and the restoration of river ecosystems 4 4 uncertainties and limitations although the approach proposed in this study was successfully applied to assess the evolutionary characteristics of river hydrological health and to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health it still has some uncertainties and limitations the approach proposed in this study is based on the vic hydrological model when a hydrological model is used uncertainty is inevitable the model structure parameter values and input data quality are all sources of model uncertainty which influence the reliability of the simulated streamflow despite these limitations previous studies have shown that the vic model is capable of representing most water resource indicators and 32 ecologically relevant indicators of iha wenger et al 2010 shrestha et al 2013 meanwhile as table 3 and fig 4 a show the nse bias and cc values of the xiquan catchment were 0 78 9 19 and 0 91 in the calibration period 1965 1974 0 79 5 8 and 0 92 during the validation period 1975 1979 and 0 77 0 14 and 0 88 in the simulation period 1980 2016 respectively these results suggest that the model performance during the disturbed period is acceptable for the following assessment of natural river hydrological health in future studies we can compare the simulation results of multiple hydrological models and use optimization method to reduce uncertainties jiang et al 2019 cui et al 2020 another limitation of our proposed framework is that there is no quantitative separation of the effects of different human activity patterns on river hydrological health such as land use and land cover changes human withdrawals and reservoir regulations under different conditions the influence of human activities on runoff is not always consistent for example in the humid dongjiang river basin in china the regulation of high and low flows of reservoirs will lead to an increase in ecological surplus zhang et al 2015 however a reservoir significantly increased the ecological deficit in the semi humid and semi arid yellow river basin zhang et al 2018 in the semi arid laohahe basin the influence of land use and land cover change on runoff is less than that of rainfall and the amount of artificial water withdrawal will be more than 50 of the natural runoff in a normal year liu et al 2009 jiang et al 2012 therefore further analysis is required as the data becomes available to better understand the effects of different types of human activities on river hydrological health 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a comprehensive assessment framework for quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health variation which combines the river natural streamflow reconstruction using vic hydrological model the river hydrological health calculation through the ecological flow threshold method and the quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities using the observed simulated comparison approach the framework was applied to the semi arid laohahe basin in northern china the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 the method based on ecological flow thresholds can effectively assess the river hydrological health and the proposed framework can be effectively utilized to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on the hydrological health by using the observed simulated comparison approach 2 in the laohahe basin the river hydrological health degraded significantly during the human influenced period 1980 2016 particularly in the 2000 s and 2010 s where it degraded much more severely while in the 1990 s the hydrological health maintained a good status because of the increasing rainfall 3 for the entire human influenced period the contributions of human activities to hydrological health degeneration were 80 8 91 9 and 86 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively widespread artificial water withdrawal and reservoir operation were the two crucial human activities that caused the degradation of river hydrological health for the studied catchment the findings of this study help to understand the evolutionary characteristics and driving mechanisms of river hydrological health in a changing environment which will be helpful for local water resources management and river ecosystems protection although the laohahe basin was selected as a case study in this study the proposed approach can be applied to other regions as well future studies should focus on constructing a comprehensive framework that separates the impacts of different kinds of human activities land use change reservoir regulations and human water withdrawal on river hydrological health which will provide valuable information for adapting different types of human activity responses according to river hydrological health credit authorship contribution statement shanhu jiang conceptualization methodology project administration le zhou data curation

4399,climate change and human activities have together altered the river hydrological regime and consequently threatened the health of river ecosystems quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health regimes is essential for water resource management and river ecology protection although previous studies have analysed the hydrologic alterations using some indicators separating effects of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health is needed for developing adaptive measures to protect the ecosystem of river basins in this study a comprehensive assessment framework for quantifying climatic and anthropogenic influences on river hydrological health variation was proposed the framework consists of the following steps 1 the reconstruction of natural river streamflow using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model 2 calculation of river hydrological health through the ecological flow threshold method and 3 quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health using the observed simulated comparison approach the semi arid laohahe basin in northern china which consists of three human influenced catchments taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo and one natural catchment xiquan was selected as the case study area the case study demonstrated that the proposed procedure is efficient in quantifying climatic and anthropogenic influences on river hydrological health the results revealed that the hydrological health level has significantly declined in the three human influenced catchments for the human influenced period 1980 2016 particularly in the 2000 s and 2010 s where it degraded much more severely whereas the relatively adequate rainfall in the 1990 s maintained the river hydrological health at a good status the quantitative evaluation showed that human activities were the main driving factors for the hydrological health degradation during the whole human influenced period with contributions of 80 8 91 9 and 86 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively widespread artificial water withdrawal and reservoir operation were the two crucial human activities that caused the degradation of river hydrological health for the studied catchment the proposed procedure and findings of this study not only help in deeper understanding of the evolutionary characteristics and driving mechanisms of river hydrological health in a changing environment in general but also provide scientific basis for local water resources management and river ecosystems protection keywords ecological flow hydrological health climate change human activities impact assessment 1 introduction rivers are one of the most crucial ecosystems in terms of both socioeconomic benefits and natural function and they play a vital role in the hydrological cycle as their channels are essential for nutrient cycling and energy flow between diverse ecosystems hotchkiss et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 palmer and ruhi 2019 from a systems perspective rivers have strong anti interference abilities however their self repairing capacity is inherently limited which means that when the external interference exceeds their capacity the riverine ecosystem will irreversibly be degraded and cause many service functions to decline or even disappear wohl et al 2005 poff 2018 belletti et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to maintain river health to ensure the sustainable development of economy and society in retrospect the concept of river health was first proposed in the 1972 clean water act by the usepa which means maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity where integrity refers to a condition in which the natural structure and function of ecosystems is maintained karr 1999 in other words the original and undisturbed state is the health state of the river in which the river ecosystem can support and maintain its primary ecological processes simpson et al 1999 and the river health refers to how similar the river is to an undamaged river of the same type especially regarding its biodiversity and ecosystem functions schofield and davies 1996 with the increased research scholars believe that river health should also include the service value of rivers to human society meyer 1997 johnson et al 2003 climate change and human activities however significantly affect river health resulting in the deterioration of water quality degradation of habitats and loss of riverine biodiversity habersack et al 2014 zhao et al 2019a belletti et al 2020 cui et al 2020 climate change affects the flow of rivers through alterations in rainfall and temperature patterns and intensity thereby affecting the ecological health of the river human activities such as dam construction immoderate water consumption and river cut off disturb the natural flow regime and hydrological cycle thus it is urgent to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on river health the generally accepted methods for evaluating river health can be assigned to two groups biological monitoring and comprehensive indicator methods norris and hawkins 2000 the majority of scholars are using the comprehensive indicator method because of the integrative perspective with a suit of physical chemical and biological variables richter et al 1996 1997 poff et al 2010 sofi et al 2020 generally in the comprehensive indicator method the flow and ecological flow satisfaction rate are important indicators because the natural flow regime plays a major role in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems lytle and poff 2004 zhao et al 2019a sofi et al 2020 mcmillan 2021 richter et al 1996 pioneered the development of the indicators of hydrological alteration iha as well as the range of variability approach richter et al 1997 which can assess the characteristics of flow variation establishing a link between different hydrological variables and ecological features some studies have identified a smaller subset of hydrological indicators to represent the overall change in flow regimes gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 2018 such as ecosurplus and ecodeficit vogel et al 2007 and the most ecologically relevant hydrological indicators yang et al 2008 ecological flow containing the quantity and regime of water flows is of great importance for maintaining the health of river and lake ecosystems and an extremely low daily flow supplement intensity may cause ineffective ecological restoration measures acreman and dunbar 2004 zhao et al 2019b therefore a river hydrological health h assessment method was proposed based on the ecological flow threshold which better represents the actual demand of river ecosystems for river flow ma et al 2019 based on the ecological flow thresholds the evolutionary characteristics and driving mechanisms of river hydrological health can be analysed the first step is the accurate calculation of ecological flow the widely accepted methods for calculating ecological flow can be divided into four main categories hydrological hydraulics habitat and holistic methods boner and furland 1982 mosely 1982 nehring and anderson 1993 hughes and hannart 2003 in particular the hydrological method is broadly used because of its ease of obtaining data simple calculation and in depth analysis of the overall hydrological regime of the river the hydrological methods mainly include the tennant method tennant 1976 monthly frequency method and monthly probability density curve method zhang et al 2018 nowadays due to environmental changes the consistency of river flow sequences often undergoes a certain degree of variation which affects the accuracy of ecological flow calculations zhang et al 2018 therefore the use of sub sequences before hydrological mutation is necessary for accurate calculation meanwhile by comparing the ecological flow with the flow before and after the hydrological mutation the river hydrological health of the two different periods can be evaluated tan et al 2018 then further analysis could be carried out to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health however a few recent studies assessed the impacts only from a qualitative perspective sellami et al 2016 tian et al 2019 yu et al 2020 mezger et al 2021 it is essential to develop a quantitative method that separates the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health the observed simulated comparison analysis method is widely used to distinguish the influence of human activities from climate change on streamflow by the reconstruction of natural streamflow wang et al 2020b this method which simulates near natural hydrological variables using hydrological models can avoid the uncertainties caused by naturalised data e g reservoir regulation records and human water withdrawal records which can be an effective method to quantitatively characterise the impact of environmental changes on river hydrological health in addition coupled with existing climate change models simulations the hydrological model simulation can predict the future river hydrological health variations under changing environment zhao et al 2019a therefore this study proposed a comprehensive assessment framework for quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health variation which consist of three steps 1 the reconstruction of river natural streamflow using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model 2 calculation of river hydrological health through the ecological flow threshold method and 3 quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health using the observed simulated comparison approach the semi arid laohahe basin in northern china was selected for the case study because its river streamflow has decreased significantly and streamflow interruption occurred in summer under intense human influence jiang et al 2011 yong et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the outcomes of this study improve our understanding of the evolutionary characteristics and driving mechanisms of river hydrological health in a changing environment and also provide scientific basis for practical water resource management and river ecosystems protection in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 laohahe basin the laohahe basin is located at the junction of the hebei and liaoning provinces and the inner mongolia autonomous region in northeastern china 41 42 75 n 117 25 120 e fig 1 it flows approximately 430 km eastward to the west liao river with its origin at qilaotu mountain in the northern part of the yan shan mountain chain it covers an area of 18112 km2 with the xinglongpo hydrological station 42 32 n 119 43 e the basin s elevation ranges from 427 m above mean sea level to over 2000 m a m s l in the upstream mountainous area descending from west to east yong et al 2013 the annual precipitation of this basin is 411 7 mm 1964 2016 summer is the main rainy season and approximately 88 of the annual precipitation occurs from may to september which leads to a significant seasonal variation in streamflow jiang et al 2012 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2020b in this study we selected four catchments including one headwater catchment xiquan two midstream catchments taipingzhuang and chifeng and the entire catchment table 1 lists the geographic and hydrological characteristics of these four catchments the average annual precipitation of these catchments ranges from 401 to 573 mm and the average annual streamflow from 21 to 126 mm the precipitation and runoff show similar characteristics of spatial variation increasing gradually from the northeast to the southwest 2 1 2 data the data used in this study included hydrometeorological geographic and socioeconomic data more details are as follows 1 the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn provided daily meteorological data from 1964 to 2016 including wind speed and maximum and minimum air temperatures measured by ten national standard meteorological stations fig 1 daily precipitation data of 52 rain gauges from 1964 to 2016 daily streamflow series of the same period for the four catchments and information of the three reservoirs were gathered from the water resources department of the inner mongolia autonomous region to drive the vic hydrological model the meteorological and precipitation data were interpolated into grid data with a resolution of 0 0625 0 0625 using the inverse distance weighting method in addition the daily precipitation and streamflow data were converted to monthly and annual averages 2 the geographic datasets consisted of soil type vegetable type and digital elevation model dem data soil types were obtained from the food and agricultural organization fao dataset vegetation types were provided by the university of maryland s 1 km global land cover production the 30 arcsecond global dem data were available from the u s geological survey usgs website https www usgs gov 3 socioeconomic statistics data were collected as follows population and gross domestic product gdp from the data centre for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn irrigated area and food production from the local statistical bureau 2 2 framework for quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological health as illustrated in fig 2 the proposed framework can be divided into three main steps for assessing river hydrological health evolution characteristics and quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on hydrological health variation first it is necessary to test the consistency of the hydrometeorological data previous studies in the laohahe basin have confirmed a significant decrease in streamflow jiang et al 2011 yong et al 2013 therefore we implemented a variation analysis of the hydrometeorological series for the selected four basins focussing on the trend and change point numerous methods are available for change point detection and we selected the mann kendall m k test mann 1945 kendall 1975 pettitt test pettitt 1979 and precipitation streamflow double cumulative curve dcc method according to the change point the whole period can be divided into two parts i e the baseline period undisturbed period and changed period disturbed period then the hydrological and meteorological forcing data in the undisturbed period were used to calibrate the vic hydrological model described in section 2 2 1 with an acquisition of optimal model parameters based on these parameters the meteorological forcing data for the disturbed period were used to drive the model for reconstructing simulating natural streamflow series which was considered to be only affected by climatic factors the second step was to establish an assessment of river hydrological health the most suitable ecological flow was first calculated and the threshold of ecological flow was determined accordingly then a hydrological health algorithm was constructed and the level of hydrological health was calculated the final step focussed on quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on hydrological health variation the total change in the observed hydrological health level between disturbed and undisturbed periods presents the combined effects of climate change and human activities whereas the change in the simulated hydrological health level between both periods can be considered as solely the effect of climate change jiang et al 2019 based on the assumption that climatic factors are independent of human activities we can quantitatively separate the impacts of climate change and human activities 2 2 1 vic hydrological model to simulate the hydrological process we used the macro scale semi distributed vic model liang et al 1994 developed by the university of washington university of california at berkeley and princeton university the model solves the surface energy and water balance to study the effects of droughts luo and wood 2007 water resource impacts vano et al 2010 ecologically relevant flow indicators wenger et al 2010 shrestha et al 2013 and for various other applications the model parameters can be commonly classified into two categories the parameters in the first category can be determined directly from soil type and land cover data including the saturated soil potential ψ s m soil porosity θ s m3 m3 saturated hydraulic conductivity k s m s root depth and fraction the other category consists of seven user calibrated parameters can refer to liang et al 1994 and wang et al 2020b while optimizing the seven sensitive parameters three criteria were used to evaluate the model performance jiang et al 2018 that is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of correlation and relative error bias calculated by the following equations 1 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 2 cc i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 3 bias i 1 n q sim i q obs i i 1 n q obs i where q obs i and q sim i are the observed and simulated runoff mm month at time step i respectively q obs and q sim are the mean observed and simulated runoff values mm month respectively and n is the number of data points 2 2 2 river hydrological health assessment method despite ample research on ecological flow there is still a lack of universal definitions and standard calculation methods for ecological flow several methods currently exist for the measurement of ecological flow criteria such as the tennant method tennant 1976 and flow duration curve mu et al 2008 which are susceptible to extreme events and annual distribution inequality tan et al 2018 therefore based on the bioadaptability wilson and franklin 2002 and plasticity lai et al 2010 theory of ecosystems the river discharge corresponding to the extreme value of the monthly probability density curve is treated as the most suitable ecological discharge for that month in this study then the relevant ecological flow thresholds can be defined according to ma et al 2019 the definitions can be described as follows the most suitable ecological flow q 0 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the flow corresponding to the maximum of the monthly average flow probability density function is the most suitable ecological flow for the month and the most suitable annual ecological flow process is composed of the most suitable ecological flow per month optimal lower threshold for ecological flow q 1 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the mean value of the minimum and optimum ecological flow is treated as the lower threshold of the optimal ecological flow the optimal lower threshold annual ecological flow process is composed of the optimal lower threshold for ecological flow per month optimal upper threshold for ecological flow q 2 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the mean value of the maximum and optimum ecological flow is treated as the upper threshold of the optimal ecological flow the optimal upper threshold annual ecological flow process is composed of the optimal upper threshold for ecological flow per month minimum ecological flow q 3 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the minimum value of the monthly average flow of several years is treated as the minimum ecological flow of that month the minimum annual ecological flow process is composed of the minimum ecological flow per month maximum ecological flow q 4 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the maximum value of the monthly average flow over several years is treated as the maximum ecological flow of that month the maximum annual ecological flow process is composed of the maximum ecological flow per month extremely small ecological flow q 5 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the minimum daily flow per month for several years is treated as the extremely small ecological flow of that month the extremely small annual ecological flow process is composed of the extremely small ecological flow per month extremely large ecological flow q 6 in the selected flow sequence of the undisturbed period the maximum daily flow per month for several years is treated as the extremely large ecological flow of that month the extremely large annual ecological flow process is composed of the extremely large ecological flow per month different ecological flow thresholds present different states of river health in addition compared with low flow large floods can improve species diversity in rivers which suggests that excessive flow has a better ecological influence than small flow then the river hydrological health assessment algorithm can be constructed ma et al 2019 as shown in eq 4 4 h q q 5 0 5 10 0 q 5 q q 5 q 3 q 5 1 5 1 10 q 5 q 3 q q 3 q 1 q 3 2 4 10 q 3 q 1 q q 1 q 0 q 1 1 8 10 q 1 q 0 q 2 q q 2 q 0 1 9 10 q 0 q 2 q 4 q q 4 q 2 2 6 10 q 2 q 4 q 6 q q 6 q 4 1 5 2 5 10 q 4 q 6 1 5 q 6 q q 6 1 0 5 10 q 6 1 5 q 6 5 1 5 q 6 where h denotes the river hydrological health q 0 denotes the most suitable ecological flow q 1 and q 2 denote the optimal lower and upper thresholds for ecological flow q 3 and q 4 denote the minimum and maximum ecological flows and q 5 and q 6 denote the extremely small and large ecological flows respectively to be consistent with the difference between the minimum flow value of zero and the extremely small ecological flow tan et al 2018 suggest that the upper threshold is taken twice as much as that of the maximum history daily flow which is the same as the upper threshold of the tennant method valued 200 however ma et al 2019 point that it is more practical to set the extremely large ecological flow value as 1 5 times the maximum ecological flow because the tennant method generally calculates the annual average flow in this study we adopt the ma s suggestion when floods exceed this extremely large flow they are also calculated as 1 5 times the maximum daily flow in addition all the data for calculating ecological flows came from the undisturbed period considering that human activities have affected river health during the changed period the proposed assessment method is applicable for different time scales such as the annual scale where we only need to change the time scale and the remaining steps are the same as in the previous analysis 2 2 3 quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological health variation based on the assessment algorithm the evolutionary characteristics of river hydrological health can be depicted under the conditions of observed and simulated streamflow for a small basin climate change is mainly controlled by external forces thus climate change and human activities were regarded as independent variables then the effects of these two variables on river hydrological health can be quantified as follows wang et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2020a 5 δ h t δ h c δ h h h 2 obs h 1 obs 6 δ h c h 2 sim h 1 sim 7 δ h h δ h t δ h c h 2 obs h 1 obs h 2 sim h 1 sim 8 i c δ h c δ h t 100 9 i h δ h h δ h t 100 where δ h t and δ h t are the total change in hydrological health and its absolute value respectively δ h c and δ h h represent the change in hydrological health induced by climate change and human activities respectively h 1 obs and h 2 obs denote the observed average annual value of hydrological health for undisturbed and disturbed periods respectively h 1 sim and h 2 sim denote the simulated average annual value of hydrological health for undisturbed and disturbed periods respectively i c and i h suggest the relative effects in percentage of climate change and human activities respectively overall the main procedure is as follows 1 divide the undisturbed and disturbed periods and then reconstruct the natural streamflow series 2 establish the assessment algorithm and calculate river hydrological health under different streamflow series and 3 quantify the difference between observed and simulated changes in hydrological health 3 results 3 1 natural streamflow reconstruction as shown in table 2 the m k test results demonstrated that precipitation and potential evapotranspiration calculated via the penman monteith equation recommended by fao series have no significant increasing or decreasing trend for the four catchments whereas the streamflow series decreased drastically except for the xiquan catchment fig 3 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments the high values of streamflow appear in the 1960 s to 1970 s and then start to gradually decline until the late 1980 s but in the mid 1990 s the laoha basin seems to enter a relative wet period and a rebound of the streamflow occurs for the three catchments in the most recent decade the annual streamflow are seriously reduced to their historical lowest levels from the pettitt test table 2 and dcc results fig 3 the first change point of streamflow series occurred in 1979 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments therefore we divided the whole period 1964 2016 into the undisturbed period 1964 1979 and disturbed period 1980 2016 the semi distributed vic hydrological model was used to reconstruct the natural streamflow and the comparison of the reconstructed and observed streamflow series is presented in fig 4 then nse cc and bias metrics were calculated and are presented in table 3 the values of nse cc and bias for the taipingzhuang catchment were 0 90 0 95 and 1 59 during the calibration period 1964 1974 and 0 82 0 91 and 5 47 during the validation period 1975 1979 respectively for the chifeng catchment the values of nse cc and bias were 0 77 0 88 0 6 and 0 71 0 85 and 11 3 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the nse cc and bias values for the xinglongpo catchment during the calibration and validation periods were 0 83 and 0 80 0 91 and 0 90 and 1 2 and 1 6 respectively overall these results indicate that the accuracy of the reconstructed streamflow satisfied the requirements of this study 3 2 calculation of the most suitable ecological flow when the river flow is the appropriate value of the most suitable ecological flow in each month it can maintain the health of the river ecosystem and the stability of the population structure of biological species which is of great significance to the management of river health to ensure the accuracy of the ecological flow calculation results we compared the calculation results with other methods in this study the nonparametric estimation kernel density function kd was used to fit the monthly flow order the parametric estimation was also used to fit the monthly flow order zhang et al 2018 which uses the statistical d of the kolmogorov smirnov k s method to test the goodness of fit and select the appropriate distribution function a comparison of the results showed that the generalized extreme value distribution gev was more suitable for the monthly average flow series of the study area according to li et al 2007 we selected a 50 guarantee rate q50 in the monthly frequency calculation method for the most suitable ecological flow calculation the results of the aforementioned method were also verified by the tennant method which is the most widespread hydrological method worldwide tharme 2003 and often used to verify the rationality of other ecological flow calculation methods li and ling 2014 pastor et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 the monthly ecological flows calculated by the kd method were located between the gev method and the q50 method the lower threshold of the optimum flow calculated by the tennant method mafl is generally lower than the result of the kd method while sometimes higher than it of the gev method we also carried out a comparison in the annual scale showed in table 4 the annual ecological flows fell on the optimum flow range recommended by the tennant method except for the xiquan catchment meanwhile the result of the kd method was closer to the optimum flow range in the xiquan catchment therefore the kd method for calculating the ecological flow used in this study was accurate and reasonable based on the calculation of the most suitable ecological flow q 0 the relevant ecological flows q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 q 5 q 6 were calculated fig 6 shows the breakdown of ecological flow according to the threshold definition in section 2 and the annual distribution of each hydrological station under various hydrological health levels 3 3 assessment of river hydrological health we calculated the river hydrological health of each catchment using the assessment method established in section 2 as fig 7 illustrates the observed hydrological health during the undisturbed period was better than that during the disturbed period for the three human impacted catchments before 1980 the river hydrological health level was generally higher than 80 whereas it was lower than 50 after 1980 except from 1990 to 1999 the hydrological health of the simulated streamflow exhibited good consistency and was in a better state at the monthly scale e g june october with a level of over 90 furthermore we calculated the health degree at the annual scale and the average value during different periods as shown in table 5 the averages of the hydrological health levels were 89 4 88 8 and 91 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively from 1964 to 1979 however the averages were 45 9 51 1 and 50 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively for the human influenced period 1980 2016 which indicated an evident decline especially in the 2010 s the means of hydrological health were 11 5 2 1 and 8 8 respectively suggesting a significant variation of flow regimes 3 4 quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health considering the hydrological health calculation results from the observed and simulated series the impacts of climate change and human activities can be quantitatively separated based on the framework described in section 2 in addition we calculated the relative contributions of climate change and human activities over different decades during the disturbed period to further assess decadal variations the results of the quantitative estimation are shown in table 5 and fig 8 for the entire disturbed period the impact of human activities on hydrological health variation is conspicuously greater than that of climate change the contributions of human activities were 80 8 91 9 and 86 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively whereas the percentages of climate change contribution on health variation were only 19 2 8 1 and 14 0 respectively for the different decades during the disturbed period the contribution of human activities to hydrological health variation shows an increasing trend except in the 1990 s considering the whole basin xinglongpo catchment as an example the percentages of human activities were 73 5 0 6 87 3 and 97 5 respectively from the 1980 s to the 2010 s although the percentage of human activities was low in the 1990 s it still showed a slight variation with a decrease of 3 6 a previous study showed that precipitation was abundant during the period of 1990 1999 and less water was drawn from river channels for industrial production and agricultural irrigation yong et al 2013 wang et al 2020b consequently hydrological health remained at a high level in the 1990 s the taipingzhuang and chifeng catchments showed similar characteristics to the xinglongpo catchment these results illustrate that in the human influenced period especially in the 2000 s and 2010 s human activities drastically influenced hydrological health which is of great importance to aquatic ecosystems 4 discussions 4 1 rationality analysis of river hydrological health assessment in this study we adopted a hydrological health assessment method based on the ecological flow threshold using dimensionless mathematical formulas seven different levels of ecological flow were coupled into a system to assess river hydrological health q 0 is the most suitable ecological flow and the rationality of the calculation results is proved in section 3 2 q 1 and q 2 denote the optimal lower and upper thresholds for ecological flow respectively previous studies have often used the most suitable ecological flow plus or minus the standard deviation and the frequency range of the hydrological sequence with a specific ratio to obtain the above two thresholds shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 however these methods can easily make the optimal limits of suitable ecological flow exceed the maximum and minimum ecological flow the method adopted in this study treat the mean value of the minimum maximum and optimum ecological flow as the lower upper threshold of the optimal ecological flow which can resolve the mentioned problem moreover the method considers the influence of extreme flow on the upper and lower limits of the suitable flow interval q 3 and q 4 denote the minimum and maximum ecological flows respectively these two values are the minimum and maximum values of each month in the selected monthly average flow sequence when the aquatic organisms have safely experienced such a minimum maximum flow under natural conditions and the ecosystem has not been severely damaged to the extent that it is irreversible it means that the aquatic ecosystem can adapt to such flow conditions when the flow exceeds these two thresholds it indicates that the river ecosystem has been severely damaged q 5 and q 6 denote the extremely small and extremely large ecological flows respectively and their values are the minimum and maximum daily flows of each month in the selected daily flow sequence such extreme events have great impacts on river ecosystems and may lead to the extinction of some species causing irreversible ecological disasters however the probability of their occurrence is small therefore these flows were assigned to a smaller subsection in the study area the xiquan catchment is located in the headwaters of the laohahe basin which is less disturbed by human activities and has no significant changing trend in runoff table 2 hence it was selected as a reference basin to evaluate the rationality of the above hydrological health assessment method by calculating the hydrological health under the condition of observed and simulated flow sequences as shown in fig 7 the monthly scale hydrological health sequence distribution in the xiquan catchment is relatively consistent with a good overall health level and no evident variation in the other three catchments the observed hydrological health sequence showed a significant change with a change point in 1979 which was consistent with the characteristics of runoff change in addition the observed and simulated hydrological health indexes in the xiquan catchment were 91 27 and 96 05 in the baseline period respectively whereas those in the changed period were 91 65 and 96 27 compared to the hydrological health changes of the other three human influenced basins fig 8 it is considered that the hydrological health of the xiquan catchment had no significant change in summary we suggest that the application of a river hydrological health assessment based on the ecological flow threshold in the laohahe basin is reasonable 4 2 impact of human activities on river hydrological health the results in section 3 4 show that climate change and human activities have significant impacts on the hydrological health of the laohahe basin among which human activities are the main influencing factor with contributions of more than 80 especially in the chifeng catchment with a contribution of more than 90 in the laohahe basin agriculture stock raising and the mining industry are the three main activities in production jiang et al 2011 large scale agricultural irrigation reduces the flow of the river meanwhile with economic development and population growth urban water supply and industrial water use are also increasing which exacerbates the decrease in water in the river thereby affecting its hydrological health fig 9 a shows that since 1980 socioeconomic data in the study area have increased significantly the scale of agricultural production has been continuously expanding with grain crops mainly wheat corn rice and soybean accounting for approximately 70 and grain output has increased by approximately 4 million tonnes large scale agricultural planting requires sufficient water to meet the irrigation demand particularly in march to may every year when crops are in the critical sowing period large amounts of water resources are consumed making the hydrological health of rivers at a low level in the middle and lower reaches the gdp of the research area shows a trend of exponential growth especially after 2000 where the growth rate is evident simultaneously the population of the region peaked in 2000 and remained relatively high correspondingly the hydrological health of the whole basin is seriously degraded especially in the chifeng catchment the river health is maintained at a relatively high level only in summer june august which is mainly because the largest city in the study area is located in this catchment fig 9 b shows an intuitive display of water withdrawal over the last decade the percentage of water withdrawal from natural river runoff showed an increasing trend and reached a peak in 2010 beyond 75 since then the percentage remained high this is consistent with the results of the hydrological health regime in our study which revealed a more serious deterioration of hydrological health and a higher contribution of human activities in the 2010 s the excessive development of water resources has caused streamflow cut off resulting in severe river ecosystem degradation this seriously restricts the sustainable development of the basin and attracts government attention hence the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china proposed a new initiative to use west liao river water resources as its capacity permits for water resources management and water environment restoration of the basin tang et al 2019 the outcomes of this study will provide scientific guidance for this new initiative and promote the protection of local river ecosystems reservoir regulation is another human activity that obstructs flow regimes and consequently affects river hydrological health as shown in fig 1 there are three large reservoirs in the basin namely sanzuodian reservoir total storage capacity 3 69 108 m3 erdaohezi reservoir total storage capacity 0 8 108 m3 and dahushi reservoir total storage capacity 1 2 108 m3 the principle of reservoir regulations in the basin generally follows the maintenance of storage in winter and spring and the release of water in summer and autumn to meet the needs of agricultural irrigation yong et al 2013 ren et al 2014 thereby exacerbating hydrological health degradation the reservoir drainage is generally lower than the natural inflow however the precipitation in the basin is mostly concentrated from june to september therefore from june to september every year a certain amount of flow can still be ensured in the channel thereby maintaining the hydrological health at a relatively high level fig 7 the impact of climate change on hydrological health is mainly manifested by the changes in precipitation the hydrological health of the basin remained at a relatively high level in the 1990 s compared with the 1980 s and the 2000 s with more precipitation and increased intra channel flow yong et al 2013 4 3 advantages of the new framework in this study we proposed a framework based on ecological flow which was used to assess hydrological health and its evolution characteristics then quantitatively analyse the attribution of the evolution the framework can reflect not only the inter annual evolution characteristics of hydrological health but also the intra annual distribution characteristics of hydrological health for example after the year 2000 the hydrological health of each sub catchment showed persistent low intra and inter annual values from march to may and from september to november fig 8 b c and d these persistent low values may cause great damage to the river ecosystem as described in section 4 2 these durations are highly likely to result from regular human activity therefore compared with the traditional iha method haghighi and kløve 2013 haghighi et al 2014 which can only reflect the inter annual changes of hydrological regime this framework can provide a better scientific basis for protecting the ecological health of rivers in addition there are autocorrelation and information redundancy among the 33 variables of iha smakhtin and shilpakar 2006 which makes it difficult to operate and manage in water resource management practice clausen and biggs 2000 cheng et al 2018 however based on biological adaptability and taking ecological flow as the evaluation the method of assessing river hydrological health is simple and scientific we have also used the framework to assess the contribution of climate change and human activities on hydrological health changes over time in order to better understand the evolution of hydrological regimes and their causes in the changing environment in summary the proposed framework can be easily utilized to study the changes of river hydrological health and the effect of climate change and human activities as well as the method introduced by cui et al 2020 meanwhile our framework is convenient to regulate water resources without damaging river hydrological health because of the less variables moreover considering the timeliness of ecological flow and the spatial adaptability of ecological components with multiscale and multiobjective the method can infer the general hydrologic health of the river section by using the instantaneous flow of the monitored section so as to infer the ecosystem health of the river at the same time the use of short term inflow forecasts and economic and social water demand forecasts can assess hydrological health within a certain period of time so as to provide a scientific basis for the rational allocation of water resources and the restoration of river ecosystems 4 4 uncertainties and limitations although the approach proposed in this study was successfully applied to assess the evolutionary characteristics of river hydrological health and to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health it still has some uncertainties and limitations the approach proposed in this study is based on the vic hydrological model when a hydrological model is used uncertainty is inevitable the model structure parameter values and input data quality are all sources of model uncertainty which influence the reliability of the simulated streamflow despite these limitations previous studies have shown that the vic model is capable of representing most water resource indicators and 32 ecologically relevant indicators of iha wenger et al 2010 shrestha et al 2013 meanwhile as table 3 and fig 4 a show the nse bias and cc values of the xiquan catchment were 0 78 9 19 and 0 91 in the calibration period 1965 1974 0 79 5 8 and 0 92 during the validation period 1975 1979 and 0 77 0 14 and 0 88 in the simulation period 1980 2016 respectively these results suggest that the model performance during the disturbed period is acceptable for the following assessment of natural river hydrological health in future studies we can compare the simulation results of multiple hydrological models and use optimization method to reduce uncertainties jiang et al 2019 cui et al 2020 another limitation of our proposed framework is that there is no quantitative separation of the effects of different human activity patterns on river hydrological health such as land use and land cover changes human withdrawals and reservoir regulations under different conditions the influence of human activities on runoff is not always consistent for example in the humid dongjiang river basin in china the regulation of high and low flows of reservoirs will lead to an increase in ecological surplus zhang et al 2015 however a reservoir significantly increased the ecological deficit in the semi humid and semi arid yellow river basin zhang et al 2018 in the semi arid laohahe basin the influence of land use and land cover change on runoff is less than that of rainfall and the amount of artificial water withdrawal will be more than 50 of the natural runoff in a normal year liu et al 2009 jiang et al 2012 therefore further analysis is required as the data becomes available to better understand the effects of different types of human activities on river hydrological health 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a comprehensive assessment framework for quantifying the impacts of climate change and human activities on river hydrological health variation which combines the river natural streamflow reconstruction using vic hydrological model the river hydrological health calculation through the ecological flow threshold method and the quantification of the impacts of climate change and human activities using the observed simulated comparison approach the framework was applied to the semi arid laohahe basin in northern china the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 the method based on ecological flow thresholds can effectively assess the river hydrological health and the proposed framework can be effectively utilized to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on the hydrological health by using the observed simulated comparison approach 2 in the laohahe basin the river hydrological health degraded significantly during the human influenced period 1980 2016 particularly in the 2000 s and 2010 s where it degraded much more severely while in the 1990 s the hydrological health maintained a good status because of the increasing rainfall 3 for the entire human influenced period the contributions of human activities to hydrological health degeneration were 80 8 91 9 and 86 0 for the taipingzhuang chifeng and xinglongpo catchments respectively widespread artificial water withdrawal and reservoir operation were the two crucial human activities that caused the degradation of river hydrological health for the studied catchment the findings of this study help to understand the evolutionary characteristics and
