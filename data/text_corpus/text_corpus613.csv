3065,salinity is a major environmental phenomenon that affects watersheds and irrigated areas worldwide the watershed scale salinity modeling requires a watershed scale model like the soil and water assessment tool swat that simulates hydrologic processes throughout a watershed the richards equation can assist in addressing very complex processes that affect water flow in the unsaturated root zone influenced by gravity and capillarity at a field scale the swat model does not use the richards equation for modeling flows in the root zone resulting in less accuracy in simulating hydrologic processes related to agriculture this study presents an integrated framework for the watershed scale salinity modeling by modifying the water salt balance swat s model linked to the soil water atmosphere plant swap model the integrated framework was applied to the mond river basin of iran the model was calibrated and validated with historical records of the river discharge and salt concentration using the sufi 2 optimization algorithm to evaluate the model s strength and to verify the accuracy of simulations the model performance was satisfactory in calibration and validation periods with the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr ranging from 0 56 to 0 87 0 52 to 0 87 0 2 to 22 2 and 0 37 to 0 69 respectively also p factor values were more than 0 65 while r factor values were 1 40 keywords primary salinity secondary salinity swap swat watershed modeling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the term salinity refers to the occurrence of salts in water bodies and soils wallender and tanji 2011 primary salinity occurs naturally through chemical weathering of earth materials atmospheric deposits of ocean salts in coastal areas seawater intrusion into estuaries due to tidal events seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers saline water from rising groundwater inland saline lakes and playas and leaching from saline landforms wallender and tanji 2011 mirzavand et al 2020 secondary salinity refers to salting that results from human activities such as irrigation and drainage waters soil and water amendments animal manures and wastes chemical fertilizers sewage sludges and effluents desalinization brine discharges and oil and gas field brines wallender and tanji 2011 li et al 2019 watershed scale salinity modeling needs a comprehensive framework to simulate primary and secondary salinity processes field scale salinity models of root zone salt dynamics are widely used for simulating water flows and solute transports in subsurface systems these models include hydrus šimůnek et al 2013 swap soil water atmosphere plant kroes et al 2017 leachm leaching estimating and chemistry model hutson and wagenet 1989 rzwqm root zone water quality model hanson et al 1998 enviro gro pang and letey 1998 q3d zhu et

scale models do not address water and salt transports through a river environment which is a limitation in salinity studies river salinity routing models like realm resource allocation model diment 1991 perera et al 2005 iqqm the integrated quantity and quality model simons et al 1996 and msm bigmod close et al 2004 models which have been used for determination of the salinity management strategies for streams do not address water and salt transports in the land environment watershed scale salinity models such as bc2c dawes et al 2004 gilfedder et al 2009 2csalt stenson et al 2005 stenson et al 2011 class teng et al 2008 catsalt tuteja et al 2003 and wec c croton and barry 2001 models can simulate water and salt transports in both land and riverine environments these models have limitations in spatial and temporal scales cheng et al 2014 i e they cannot adequately address field scale and watershed scale processes simultaneously on a long term continuous basis bailey et al 2019 bailey et al 2019 applied a soil and water assessment tool swat based model to simulate the fate and transport of major ions so4 ca mg na k cl co3 and hco3 in an agricultural watershed since the water quantity modeling of the root zone of the swat model is not based on the richards equation kroes et al 2017 the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 cannot accurately address salinity processes related to agriculture that are affected by unsaturated root zone processes such as gravity and capillarity the swat s model maleki tirabadi et al 2021 can simulate salinity at the watershed scale but disregards agricultural activities the swat sf model maleki tirabadi et al 2022 which incorporates reliable expert scientific judgments into a watershed scale salinity model framework cannot directly address agricultural activities there is a need to improve the capabilities of watershed scale salinity frameworks in agriculture the swat neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2012 has been widely used for its modularity in quantity and quality components computational efficiency and the ability to predict long term impacts as a continuous model in watersheds throughout the world e g kim et al 2018 janney and jenkins 2019 hirt et al 2020 samimi et al 2020 in addition swat has been used in large river basins where data are not adequately available for calibration and validation jeong et al 2020 ouyang et al 2020 chen et al 2020 the swat s maleki tirabadi et al 2021 is a water salt balance model that can address the generation of salts transportation of salts through the landscapes transportation of salts from the landscapes into rivers and in stream transport of salts the model can quantify salt dissolution precipitation processes based on the maximum salt concentration in the soil and river environments two types of the salt dissolution process are simulated simultaneously in the soil the first salt dissolution process is dissolution from the precipitated salt transported through the soil hydrological processes this salt dissolution process is simulated using the salt mass balance approach the second salt dissolution process is from the solid salt generated by chemical weathering processes in the saline geological formation this salt dissolution process is simulated using the gis map of the saline geological formation if the precipitated salt related to the first salt dissolution process exists in the soil the model dissolves this precipitated salt in water otherwise if there is no precipitated salt in the soil the model dissolves the generated salt in the saline geological formation in water until the salt concentration reaches the maximum salt concentration the gis map of the saline geological formation and the maximum salt concentration are adjustable during the simulation period the swap kroes et al 2017 is an agro hydrological model that can simulate one dimensional water flow solute transport and heat flow processes in close interaction with crop development in the root zone the model can simulate the basic transport processes of salts pesticides and other solutes at the field scale using convection diffusion dispersion root uptake freundlich adsorption and first order decomposition relations many studies have verified the swap model s applicability for a wide range of agricultural systems and climatic conditions heuvelmans et al 2011 wessolek et al 2011 hao et al 2013 mokhtari et al 2018 li and ren 2021 the primary input data required by the swap model is related to the simulation meteorology crop rotation scheme irrigation soil water flow heat flow and solute transport the primary output data of the swap model is related to the water and solute balance soil profile crop growth and drainage xie and cui 2011 observed that the swap model is better at simulating upland areas than depression areas to overcome the deficiency of the swat model for water quantity modeling related to agriculture several attempts have been made to accurately address the effects of gravity and capillarity on water flow in the unsaturated root zone by integrating the swat model with the swap model liu et al 2013 developed an integrated swat swap modflow model to explore sustainable management strategies for surface and groundwater irrigation the swap model was first evaluated for the suitability of irrigation applications and groundwater depths then appropriate irrigation schedules and groundwater depths were introduced as input data to the swat and modflow models uniyal and dietrich 2019 improved auto irrigation in the swat model by changing the root density distribution they validated the modified model against the swap model and observed irrigation and crop yield data a watershed scale salinity framework can identify critical salinity processes in a watershed the main objective of this study is to develop a watershed scale integrated salinity framework for simulating natural and anthropogenic salinity processes in a large watershed for this purpose the watershed scale swat s model which can model natural salinity was modified to address the effects of anthropogenic activities using point sources and water uses in addition a method was proposed to link the modified swat s model and swap model to improve the simulation of the secondary salinity processes related to agriculture the salinity phenomenon that can be addressed within the integrated framework is the generation mobilization and accumulation of salts in different parts of the environment throughout a watershed the salinity sources may be natural unnatural point non point sources of the salts the salinity factors related to the entry of salts are the input of salts to the root zone through the rain irrigation and upward flux from the aquifer aquifer through the recharge and river this entry is through the surface runoff lateral flow return flow drainage and discharge from the springs sewages and upstream rivers the upward movement of the salt from the root zone to the soil surface through evaporation is also modeled furthermore salinity factors like the salt dissolution from the solid salt and the salt precipitation due to evaporation and transpiration are modeled for the root zone aquifer and river the methodology and results are explained in the following sections 2 methodology 2 1 integrated framework the swat model partitions a watershed into several sub basins with a reach or river that connects sub basins sub basins are portioned into multiple separate hydrologic response units hrus the root zone and shallow aquifer are the primary subsurface regions in the hrus the vadose zone receives the percolation from the root zone and recharges into the shallow aquifer based on the depth to the water table and the hydraulic properties of the geologic formations in the vadose zone neitsch et al 2011 the swat model simulates the amount of water that moves from one layer to the underlying layer in the root zone using the storage routing method neitsch et al 2011 the surface runoff is based on the scs curve number method neitsch et al 2011 a kinematic storage model based on the mass water balance method for the simulation of lateral flows neitsch et al 2011 if the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer exceeds a threshold value the return flow enters the river depending on the recharge neitsch et al 2011 water is routed through the river using the variable storage routing method neitsch et al 2011 the swat s model can simulate salt concentrations and salinity processes i e the generation transportation dissolution and precipitation of the salt in the watershed based on the salt mass balance method and the area ratios of saline geological formations maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the top boundary condition of the root zone the salt concentration of water that enters the root zone at the top is equal to the salt concentration of the rain maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the bottom boundary condition of the root zone the salt concentration of the downward flow is equal to the salt concentration of the lowest soil layer that is affected by the saline geological formation in the root zone maleki tirabadi et al 2021 the salt concentration of the upward flow is equal to the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the top boundary condition of the shallow aquifer the salt concentration of water that enters the shallow aquifer at the top is equal to the salt concentration of the recharge maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the bottom boundary condition of the shallow aquifer the salt concentration of the downward flow is equal to the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the surface runoff boundary condition the salt concentration of the surface runoff inflow to the river reach is equal to the salt concentration of the surface runoff that is affected by the saline geological formation in the river reach bed maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the lateral flow boundary condition the salt concentration of the lateral flow into the river reach is equal to the salt concentration of the lateral flow that is affected by the saline geological formation in the river reach bed maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the return flow boundary condition the salt concentration of the return flow into the river reach is equal to the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer that is affected by the presence of the saline geological formation in the river reach bed maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the upstream boundary condition of the river reach the salt concentration of water that enters the river reach from the upstream river reaches is equal to the weighted mean of the salt concentrations of the upstream river reaches based on the volume of input waters to the river reach from the upstream river reaches maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the downstream boundary condition of the river reach the salt concentration of water that leaves the river reach is equal to the salt concentration of the river reach maleki tirabadi et al 2021 the swap model simulates soil water flow using the richards equation kroes et al 2017 the soil hydraulic functions are modeled using the modified mualem van genuchten methods kroes et al 2017 the surface runoff occurs according to a specified resistance if the height of water stored on the soil surface exceeds a threshold depth kroes et al 2017 the drainage is simulated using the hooghoudt or ernst equations kroes et al 2017 both the head and flux can control the bottom boundary condition of the root zone kroes et al 2017 the salt transport can be simulated by considering the convection diffusion and dispersion processes and passive uptake by plant roots kroes et al 2017 the swat s model was modified and used as a base model for the water quantity and salinity modeling equations of the modified swat s model related to non farming soil profile the root zone and surface runoff are presented in supplementary section 1 1 in these equations the rain and upward flux from the shallow aquifer input the salt into the non farming soil profile also surface runoff lateral flow and percolation release the salt from the non farming soil profile the transportation of the salt through evaporation and the salt dissolution precipitation processes can occur in the non farming soil profile supplementary section 1 2 explains the equations of the modified swat s model related to the shallow aquifer in these equations the recharge enters the salt into the shallow aquifer the return flow upward flux from the shallow aquifer the recharge to the deep aquifer and water use e g irrigation move the salt from the shallow aquifer the salt dissolution precipitation processes can also occur in the shallow aquifer the swat model considers that water entering the deep aquifer is lost from the system neitsch et al 2011 thus the salt concentration is not simulated for the deep aquifer the recharge to the deep aquifer is only addressed by simulating the salt concentration in the shallow aquifer equations of the modified swat s model related to the river reach are explained in supplementary section 1 3 in these equations the surface runoff lateral flow return flow discharge from the upstream river reaches drainage and point source enter the salt into the river reach the salt load from the point source to the river reach is addressed by combining the salt mass loads of the springs and sewages the transmission loss discharge into downstream river reaches and water use e g irrigation remove the salt from the river reach furthermore salt dissolution precipitation processes can occur in the river reach the adjustable gis maps of the natural shallow and deep saline geological formations are used to identify locations of shallow deep and reach bed saline geological formations throughout the watershed in general shallow saline geological formations are located in the soil surface layer deep saline geological formations are below the soil surface and above the impermeable layer the gis map of the land use identifies the locations of the irrigated farms in the watershed point sources of the salinity such as springs and sewages are located along the river reach in each sub basin the proposed method for integrating the modified swat s model with the swap model is described in sections 2 1 1 and 2 4 2 1 1 coupling of the modified swat s model with the swap model the root zone of the hru has the same land use soil slope and management values neitsch et al 2011 the root zone of the swap model is represented by one vegetation type one soil type and one drainage condition kroes et al 2017 thus the root zone of the irrigated farming hru of the swat model is compatible with the root zone of the swap model and can be replaced with the root zone of the swap model fig 1 shows how the swap model is coupled with the modified swat s model in this figure salts are transported through water pathways between different parts of the environment water pathways except the upward flux from the shallow aquifer into the root zone of the non farming hru are default in the swat and swap models the salinity processes in the swap model and the natural salinity processes in the modified swat s model are also default the man made salinity processes in the modified swat s model are not default sub daily results of the swap model are aggregated and the daily data are exchanged between models to avoid creating extra water for each irrigated farming hru the modified swat s model only simulates daily amounts of the quantity and salt mass of four components that do not directly interact with the root zone of the hru these components are 1 the recharge from the shallow aquifer into the deep aquifer 2 the return flow from the shallow aquifer into the river reach 3 the water use from the shallow aquifer and 4 the recharge from the vadose zone into the shallow aquifer the swap model simulates daily amounts of the quantity and salt mass of other components specifically the surface runoff and the subsoil drainage contributions from the root zone of the irrigated farming hru into the river reach and the downward seepage from the root zone of the irrigated farming hru into the vadose zone unrestricted drainage and zero flux bottom boundary conditions are suitable for the bottom boundary condition of the swap model based on the depth of the groundwater table irrigation water is not applied to the root zone of the non farming hru this is only applied to the root zone of the irrigated farming hru the manual application of irrigation water can be specified under irrigation operation in the integrated framework the amount of irrigation water related to an irrigated farming hru which corresponds to the individual swap model is defined by the user in the modified swat s model irrigation water may be obtained from the surface water and groundwater sources the modified swat s model compares the amount of water available in the source with the amount specified for the withdrawal event if the amount available is less than the amount specified the modified swat s model will only use the available water neitsch et al 2011 the final irrigation values simulated by the modified swat s model can be adjusted based on the real field irrigation values by modifying user defined irrigation water values the modified swat s model introduces time series of quantities and salt masses of final irrigation waters for the irrigated farming hru as input data to the corresponding individual swap model for all days of the simulation period to use these time series values as input data in the swap model daily irrigation applications with the fixed irrigation regime are employed for the corresponding individual swap model fig 2 shows data exchange between the subroutines of the modified swat s and swap models using separate input output files in this figure the runoff quantity f drainage quantity f and seepage quantity f subroutines of the modified swat s model read quantities of the surface runoff drainage and downward seepage for each farm respectively the runoff nacl f runoff caso4 f drainage nacl f drainage caso4 f seepage nacl f and seepage caso4 f subroutines of the modified swat s model read nacl and caso4 masses of the surface runoff drainage and downward seepage for each farm respectively the swapoutput f90 subroutine of the swap model writes these data for each farm the irrigation quantity f irrigation nacl f irrigation caso4 f and irrigation tds f subroutines of the modified swat s model write quantities and nacl caso4 and total dissolved salt tds masses of applied irrigation waters for each farm respectively the swap f90 subroutine of the swap model reads these data for each farm in fig 2 the unit of the water quantity data is cm and the unit of the salt mass data is mg cm2 i e salt mass data mg cm2 water quantity data cm salt concentration data mg cm3 since the swap model simulates salts and tds as conservative non reactive tracers salts and tds are simulated separately thus the swap model is run three times for each irrigated farming hru the first run is for modeling tds and the second run is for modeling nacl the third run is for modeling caso4 since the salinity stress shown by tds reduces the productivity of crops the first run of the swap model is also done to evaluate the crop yields 2 2 calibration and validation procedure the calibration procedure requires changes in parameter values followed by a model run an interface to automate this procedure is useful abbaspour et al 2007 the iswat interface yang et al 2006 allows parameter aggregation based on the hydrologic group soil land use and sub basin specifications facilitating the calibration procedure in addition this interface has a generic format that allows for easy coupling with any optimization program abbaspour et al 2007 to calibrate the aggregate parameters in this study we modified the iswat interface to couple with the sufi 2 optimization program abbaspour et al 2007 the source codes of the iswat interface which have been prepared based on the input files of the swat model version 2000 yang et al 2006 were modified to properly consider input water quantity and salinity parameters of the modified swat s model maleki tirabadi et al 2021 the uncertainty of the model predictions was assessed based on the p factor the fraction of observations bracketed by the 95ppu band and r factor the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu band and the standard deviation of the measured variable indices the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 were used to assess the model performances based on the general recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 these recommendations are presented in table 1 2 3 study area the mond river basin is located in southern iran between 27 n to 30 n and 51 e to 55 e coordinates the watershed covers an area of approximately 47 300 km2 fig 3 shows the study area swat delineated sub basins dem map river network gauging stations average rainfall average potential evapotranspiration distribution map of shallow saline geological formations and distribution map of deep saline geological formations shallow saline geological formations are located in the surface layer of the soil while deep saline geological formations are found in subsurface layers of the soil the basin s elevation ranges from 16 m below sea level in the southwestern parts to 3 100 m in the northern parts of the basin the average elevation of the basin is 1 028 m the average annual rainfall in major parts of the mond river basin is below 300 mm year whereas the northwestern parts receive up to 700 mm year the stream salinity varies from 200 mg l to over 17 000 mg l in the mond river basin generally the stream salinity increases along the river from upstream to downstream the average groundwater salinity varies across the basin from 500 mg l to an excess of 5 000 mg l abgeer 2011 2 4 model setup the mond river basin was discretized into 56 sub basins and 407 hrus irrigated crops while economically important cover only about 2 5 of the basin area dryland crops cover almost 3 5 of the basin area as shown in fig 4 irrigation areas are mainly located north of the mond river basin there are thirty one irrigated farming hrus in the mond river basin these farms were divided into four groups the first group of farms includes the most upstream farms and the last group of farms consists of the most downstream farms two other groups including the remaining farms were placed between these groups as in fig 5 the modified swat s model was run first then the swap models were run separately for all farms placed in the first group of farms this procedure was repeated subsequently for other groups of farms respectively the modified swat s model was finally run five times 2 5 monitoring data the discharge and salt concentration data for three river gauges groundwater salinity data soil salinity data water use data including the municipal agricultural and industrial demands point source data including the discharge and salinity of the springs and sewages agricultural data and other data e g the gis maps of the shallow and deep saline geological formations were provided by the local water authorities and abgeer consulting engineers company abgeer 2011 wrm 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration evaluation and uncertainty analysis the watershed water quantity and quality models were calibrated from 1979 to 1992 and validated from 1993 to 1998 using the monthly observed discharge and salt concentration data the nash sutcliffe coefficient that was taken as the objective function for monthly time step simulations was assessed at three gauging stations i e dehram dejgah and ghontareh stations in the main stem for each iteration 1000 latin hypercube samples were prepared and fed into the model for the simulation to calibrate the discharge a global sensitivity analysis was used to find the most sensitive parameters of the streamflow based on the regression method abbaspour 2015 global sensitivity was measured by the values of each parameter s t stat the coefficient of a parameter divided by its standard error and associated p value probability of accepting the null hypothesis against the objective function a parameter with a larger absolute value of t stat and a smaller p value is a more sensitive parameter than other parameters a p value of 0 05 was used as a confidence limit to reject the null hypothesis eight parameters were sensitive to river discharges the sensitivity analysis results for the discharge sensitive parameters are shown in table 2 parameters related to the groundwater surface water interaction and groundwater dynamic such as the curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 baseflow alpha factor alpha bf the available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc and threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn were very sensitive the curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 was decreased this decrease is smaller for sub basins 5 11 17 and 24 than for other sub basins therefore surface runoff is more likely to occur in these sub basins than other sub basins the available water capacity sol awc of the soil layer and the plant available water were increased while the moist bulk density sol bd of the soil layer was decreased the soil porosity was increased and water content at the wilting point was decreased the field capacity was reduced and a higher volume of water was drained from the soil layer moreover more evapotranspiration occurred the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf was increased so the groundwater travel time was decreased the infiltration rate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k were increased concurrently therefore the baseflow was increased the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for the return flow to occur gwqmn was raised so a higher depth of water in the shallow aquifer is required for the occurrence of the groundwater flow into the river since the river reach s bed materials contain sand and gravel mixture with high silt clay content the effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel alluvium ch k2 was about 6 mm hr the river reach s bed materials loss rate was moderate arnold et al 2012 the soil evaporation compensation factor esco was reduced thus more evaporative demand was extracted from lower levels of the soil profile since the salt concentration data had lower precision than the discharge data the calibration of the salt concentration was performed after the discharge calibration several authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of multi site calibration over single site calibration chiang et al 2014 daggupati et al 2015 chen et al 2017 to calibrate the salt concentration the model was first calibrated for the dehram and dejgah stations individually to obtain the best salinity parameter sets for upstream sub basins the model was then calibrated for the ghontareh station the salinity parameters were the coefficient related to the upward movement of the salt to the soil surface salt percolation coefficient correction coefficient for the salt dissolution of the surface runoff ratio associated with the existence of the shallow salt in the hru ratio related to the presence of the deep salt in the hru maximum salt concentration for the hru the salt concentration of the rainfall the salt concentration of the sewage correction coefficient for the salt dissolution of input waters to the river reach via the upstream river reaches and the surface runoff ratio related to the existence of the salt in the river reach bed and maximum salt concentration for the river reach that have been explained in supplementary section 1 the salinity parameters were differentiated based on the basin s data to represent the geospatial and hydro geo chemical characteristics this ensures that the variability in each sub basin is captured and improves the efficiency of the multi site calibration a reasonable range was first assigned for each differentiated parameter the parameter ranges were then modified typically narrowed down according to the new parameter ranges suggested by the sufi 2 program and their reasonable physical limitations neitsch et al 2011 abbaspour 2015 to prevent over calibration of the models also the model simulation results were limited to reasonable ranges of soil groundwater river spring and sewage salinities for each hru and sub basin based on the field data from within the mond river basin calibration and validation performance results of the river gauges for the discharge nacl concentration and caso4 concentration are seen in table 3 and figs 6 7 and 8 reasonable agreement was seen between the simulated and observed values of the streamflow nacl concentration and caso4 concentration as shown in figs 6 7 and 8 the mean of nacl and caso4 concentrations sometimes vary between the calibration and validation periods for some stations since the primary component considered for the baseflow simulation is the point source including discharges from springs and sewages which has almost a constant value some incongruities were seen in predicting high salt concentrations table 4 shows the performances of water quantity and quality models based on the recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 these results indicate that the discharge nacl concentration and caso4 concentration were satisfactorily simulated for the dehram dejgah and ghontareh stations the baseflow was simulated better than the peak flow for all stations with a decrease in the cn2 parameter during the calibration process moreover the locations of peak flows peak nacl concentrations and peak caso4 concentrations were well predicted for these three stations there are not enough data for the calibration of the recharge however the quantities of the recharge component are generally reliable compared to the quantities of other components such as rainfall based on prior studies abgeer 2011 the 95ppu bands covered at least 65 of the observed discharges data for all stations the 95ppu bands covered at least 76 of the observed nacl and caso4 concentrations data for all stations abbaspour et al 2015 recommended a working value of greater than 0 7 for p factor and 1 5 for r factor the models attained rational performance ratings during both the calibration and validation periods the widths of the 95ppu bands are sufficiently narrow to indicate a relatively small uncertainty for the discharge nacl concentration and caso4 concentration simulations the p factor and r factor values also do not significantly vary between the calibration and validation periods these generally indicate that the discharge nacl concentration and caso4 concentration predictions almost properly consider the uncertainties of the models the reliable results of the proposed integrated framework indicate that it can sufficiently account for the hydrological and geochemical characteristics of a watershed 3 2 average salt concentrations each watershed has specific spatial distributions of salt concentrations spatial distributions of the average caso4 nacl and tds concentrations of the surface runoff root zone and shallow aquifer are illustrated in fig 9 using the results of the proposed integrated framework from 1979 to 1992 results indicate that the tds of the surface runoff is generally 2 000 mg l which is acceptable for many consumptive water uses in the mond river basin the groundwater quality of the mond river basin was categorized as brackish based on the recommendations of logeshkumaran et al 2015 the groundwater quality is also acceptable for many consumptive water uses in the mond river basin the average tds of the river reach 24 is greater than the average tds of the river reach 17 as shown in fig 3d it is because of two crucial salt diapirs konarsiah and jahani these salt diapirs increase the salinity of the river reach for the sub basin 24 therefore spatial distributions of salt concentrations which could be satisfactorily mapped using the results of the proposed integrated framework provided valuable information that can be used to determine the primary salinity sources and processes of a watershed the data is usable for watershed scale water and soil resource management 3 3 salt loadings horizontal flows may transport salts from the land into the river these horizontal flows are the surface runoff lateral flow from the soil profile the root zone and groundwater flow from the shallow aquifer besides vertical flows may transport salts between the soil profile and shallow aquifer these vertical flows are the downward recharge from the soil profile into the shallow aquifer and upward upflux from the shallow aquifer into the soil profile fig 10 a c shows spatial distributions of the total mass of caso4 nacl and tds transported by the surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow into the streamflow these spatial distributions were prepared using the results of the proposed integrated framework for 1979 1992 loadings of caso4 are mainly concentrated in the middle south and east of the mond river basin also nacl loadings are primarily concentrated in the north center and south of the mond river basin the amount of the transported salt mass depends concurrently on the volume of the transported water and the salt concentration of the transported water a sub basin may have a higher average salt concentration than another sub basin but the first sub basin has lower average salt mass transportation than the second sub basin the results of the proposed integrated framework show that the recharge into the shallow aquifer fig 10d is not significant for many sub basins thus the upflux fig 10e and salt transportation by the groundwater flow into the streamflow fig 10c are not significant for those sub basins however the groundwater flow contribution to the streamflow generally is not related to the rain in the mond river basin still the groundwater flows into the streamflow mainly occur due to many point sources i e springs and sewages patterns of salt loadings which were prepared using the results of the proposed integrated framework indicated the role of main salinity sources and processes in the salinity of a watershed the daily salt mass loading data can assist the watershed scale salinity investigation and management fig 11 shows the daily loadings and losses of caso4 nacl and tds for the river system the main component which enters salts into the main channel is the point source the salt concentration of the point source is the combination of the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer and a fixed salt concentration for each sub basin the fixed salt concentration is estimated based on the salt loading and water discharge into the river reach through the municipal agricultural and industrial sewages for each sub basin since the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer does not vary considerably for any sub basins point sources contribute approximately the same daily salt loadings into the river reach for each sub basin the highest amount of daily salt loadings into the river reach is mainly due to the high amount of corresponding daily water discharges into the river reach through lateral flows the maximum daily salt loadings from the groundwater flow and point source into the river reach are almost identical thus the results of the proposed integrated framework can properly compare daily natural and unnatural salt loadings into a river 3 4 salt balance components each natural and unnatural process has a specific role in releasing accumulating and transporting salts throughout a watershed fig 12 schematically illustrates relative caso4 nacl and tds mass balance components of the mond river basin since the total salt transportation through the surface runoff is lower than the amount of the total salt transportation through each of the other components the magnitudes of all salt transport components were adjusted based on the magnitude of the surface runoff component a fraction of transmission losses from the river reach is permanently lost due to the transmission to aquifers that does not contribute flow back to the river reach arnold et al 2012 since the modified swat s model parameter related to the fraction of transmission losses from the river reach was not a sensitive parameter for the mond river basin the default value of this parameter was not changed thus it was assumed that all transmission losses from the river reach were permanently lost as in fig 12 although the rain is a dilute source of caso4 the rain enters a considerable amount of caso4 from the atmosphere into the soil profile over time compared to the transport of caso4 through each of the other land based paths still the rain does not comparatively enter the considerable amount of nacl from the atmosphere into the soil profile about a third of the salt mass transportation via the shallow aquifer recharge returns to the soil profile via the upflux besides the loading of caso4 through lateral flow into the river reach is comparatively very considerable still the loading of the nacl from the lateral flow into the river reach is not comparatively very considerable salt balances of the main channel indicate that the dissolution of the salt is not generally significant in the main channels of the mond river basin the stream outflow from the watershed conveys comparatively lower masses of caso4 than the loading of caso4 from the rainfall still the streamflow out of the watershed conveys comparatively higher masses of nacl than the nacl loading from the rainfall the inclusion of the salt containing rainfall as the only salt input indicates that although caso4 is accumulated in the mond river basin nacl is mobilized from the basin fig 12e shows that the interaction of the point source with the river system about 96 of the total salt load noticeably affects the salt balance of the river system this result is conspicuous for caso4 and nacl fig 12d illustrates the importance of sewage loads compared to total point source loads for all sub basins of the mond river basin as in fig 12d the contributions of sewage loads to total point source loads are more than spring loads for most sub basins the results of the proposed integrated framework could indicate the role of primary and secondary due to anthropogenic activities salinity sources and processes in the salinity of a watershed 3 5 salt output input for sub basins all salinity processes occurring in a watershed such as salt transportations through the environment and the salt dissolution precipitation in the environment which can affect the salinity in the environment and the severity of the salinity can be assessed approximately using the salt balance ratios bugan et al 2015 guan et al 2010 salt output input o i ratios are commonly calculated based on the rainfall salt input and streamflow salt output schoups et al 2005 poulsen et al 2006 in this study the rainfall point source and input streamflows from upstream sub basins were considered salt inputs the output streamflow from the sub basins was considered as salt output the salt output input o i ratio is greater than 1 for watersheds that mobilize salts biggs et al 2013 jolly et al 2001 cresswell et al 2005 under natural conditions in semi arid to arid areas in which evaporation evapotranspiration greatly exceeds rainfall landscapes generally accumulate salts charman and murphy 1991 fig 13 shows the total salt output input o i ratios for all sub basins of the mond river basin results indicate that most sub basins of the mond river basin accumulate salts i e the salt output does not exceed the salt input as shown in fig 13 the salt output input o i ratios of the upstream sub basins are generally smaller than other sub basins i e the mobilization of the salt compared to the salt accumulation is not significant in the upstream sub basins the salt output input o i ratio of the sub basin 5 an upstream sub basin is greater than 1 downstream sub basins generally have higher salt output input o i ratios than other sub basins hence the severity of the salinity increases typically from the upstream to the downstream in the mond river basin this indicates that the salinity of a sub basin may significantly affect the salinity of its downstream sub basin the output input o i ratios of the total dissolved salt are about 0 02 for the whole basin thus the accumulation mobilization of salts could be inferred using the results of the proposed integrated framework for each sub basin and the entire watershed 3 6 average monthly rainfall discharge salt export and salt concentration the quantity and quality of the streamflow vary during the months of the year fig 14 illustrates a comparison between the average monthly rainfall discharge salt export and tds related to the dehram dejgah and ghontareh stations average rainfall was prepared using the data from the upstream sub basins the wet months of the year are from december to march while the river discharges are the highest values during these months the discharges of the rivers are very low during the rest of the year the ghontareh station has a broader range of the average monthly discharge about 65 m3 s and tds about 6700 mg l than the two other stations although the dehram station has a narrower range of the variation of the average monthly discharge about 10 m3 s than the dejgah station about 40 m3 s the dehram station has a broader range of the variation of the average monthly tds about 5200 mg l than the dejgah station about 3300 mg l therefore variations of each process have very different effects on the discharge and tds of rivers the highest amounts of tds occurred from may to october as in fig 14 tds and salt export trends are completely different for all stations but trends of the discharge and salt export are completely the same for all stations the highest salt export amounts occur in months with the lowest tds this indicates that the salt export depends highly on the discharge in the mond river basin the results of the proposed integrated framework approximately showed temporal patterns of salt exports and salt concentrations for a river 3 7 usability and limitations of the model agricultural activities cause many important salinity problems agriculture disturbs the natural hydrologic equilibrium in the landscape the runoff from agricultural areas profoundly affects the quality of the adjacent water resources in irrigated areas the effect of the irrigation water quality and salt build up in the soil profile on the plant growth may decline the crop yields therefore the proper consideration of agricultural activities is essential for the salinity modeling of a watershed that has been affected by anthropogenic activities the primary and secondary salinity processes are very complex moreover these processes are not fully understood thus salinity modeling encounters many difficulties models such as the bc2c gilfedder et al 2009 lascam sivapalan et al 1996a 1996b 1996c and 2csalt models stenson et al 2011 can be used for the primary salinity modeling at the watershed scale nevertheless these models do not specifically consider secondary salinity processes such as agricultural activities noory et al 2011 used the swap model for quantifying water management effects on drainage water amount and its salinity at the regional scale bailey et al 2019 also applied a swat based model to an irrigated area since the swat model has been designed for large scale modeling it cannot adequately address essential physical processes related to agriculture the effects of employing water and soil management options such as irrigation on the salinity of water and soil can be better studied using the proposed integrated framework other anthropogenic activities also can be considered by the water uses including various kinds of water uses that can be considered in the modified swat s model similar to the manual application of irrigation water and point sources in the proposed integrated framework properly considering the amounts of the daily water usage and point sources is preferable this will increase the confidence in the model s ability to estimate discharges salt loads and salt concentrations accurately the main limitation of the proposed integrated framework pertains to the structure of the water quantity model for example the modified swat s model is semi distributed and hrus are not internally connected groundwater is not adequately modeled using the modified swat s model some limitations also pertained to the salinity model of the integrated framework for example the interaction between individual salts is not directly simulated although it is required to run the modified swat s model multiple times the total running time of the modified swat s model is negligible compared to the total running time of the swap models the proposed integrated framework uses a general method to integrate the modified swat s model with the swap model this method can integrate the swat model with other distributed models there is a lack of comprehensive flow and salinity data in some locations this makes it difficult to calibrate and validate the model and increases the uncertainty of the model results continuous salt concentration data allow improvements in estimating salt balance components over various flow regimes wet and dry periods and seasons 4 conclusions this paper proposes a new method that integrates the modified swat s model with the swap model to improve watershed scale natural and secondary salinity modeling the modified swat s model can address the main components of the hydrologic cycle that contribute to salt transportation at the watershed scale besides the swap model can account for irrigated farms at the field scale a large scale model of the mond river basin was built using the integrated framework results show that the proposed integrated framework has reliable results constrained by data at the outlet and within the basin the performance of predictions was at least satisfactory for the discharge caso4 concentration and nacl concentration predictions for all gauging stations spatial distributions of salt concentrations of the surface runoff root zone aquifer and river can be mapped using the results of the proposed integrated framework daily natural and unnatural salt loadings into the river could be properly assessed utilizing the proposed integrated framework the accumulation mobilization of salts could be appropriately assessed for sub basins using the results of the proposed integrated framework the necessity of considering natural and secondary salinity sources and processes could be confirmed using the results of the proposed integrated framework the proposed integrated framework could exhibit the temporal patterns of salt exports and salt concentrations the proposed integrated framework can be utilized to comprehensively evaluate different best management practices for watershed scale water resource studies of basins facing natural and secondary salinity

3065,salinity is a major environmental phenomenon that affects watersheds and irrigated areas worldwide the watershed scale salinity modeling requires a watershed scale model like the soil and water assessment tool swat that simulates hydrologic processes throughout a watershed the richards equation can assist in addressing very complex processes that affect water flow in the unsaturated root zone influenced by gravity and capillarity at a field scale the swat model does not use the richards equation for modeling flows in the root zone resulting in less accuracy in simulating hydrologic processes related to agriculture this study presents an integrated framework for the watershed scale salinity modeling by modifying the water salt balance swat s model linked to the soil water atmosphere plant swap model the integrated framework was applied to the mond river basin of iran the model was calibrated and validated with historical records of the river discharge and salt concentration using the sufi 2 optimization algorithm to evaluate the model s strength and to verify the accuracy of simulations the model performance was satisfactory in calibration and validation periods with the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr ranging from 0 56 to 0 87 0 52 to 0 87 0 2 to 22 2

through chemical weathering of earth materials atmospheric deposits of ocean salts in coastal areas seawater intrusion into estuaries due to tidal events seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers saline water from rising groundwater inland saline lakes and playas and leaching from saline landforms wallender and tanji 2011 mirzavand et al 2020 secondary salinity refers to salting that results from human activities such as irrigation and drainage waters soil and water amendments animal manures and wastes chemical fertilizers sewage sludges and effluents desalinization brine discharges and oil and gas field brines wallender and tanji 2011 li et al 2019 watershed scale salinity modeling needs a comprehensive framework to simulate primary and secondary salinity processes field scale salinity models of root zone salt dynamics are widely used for simulating water flows and solute transports in subsurface systems these models include hydrus šimůnek et al 2013 swap soil water

1991 perera et al 2005 iqqm the integrated quantity and quality model simons et al 1996 and msm bigmod close et al 2004 models which have been used for determination of the salinity management strategies for streams do not address water and salt transports in the land environment watershed scale salinity models such as bc2c dawes et al 2004 gilfedder et al 2009 2csalt stenson et al 2005 stenson et al 2011 class teng et al 2008 catsalt tuteja et al 2003 and wec c croton and barry 2001 models can simulate water and salt transports in both land and riverine environments these models have limitations in spatial and temporal scales cheng et al 2014 i e they cannot adequately address field scale and watershed scale processes simultaneously on a long term continuous basis bailey et al 2019 bailey et al 2019 applied a soil and water assessment tool swat based model to simulate the fate and transport of major ions so4 ca mg na k cl co3 and hco3 in an agricultural watershed since the water quantity modeling of the root zone of the swat model is not based on the richards equation kroes et al 2017 the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 cannot accurately address salinity processes related to agriculture that are affected by unsaturated root zone processes such as gravity and capillarity the swat s model maleki tirabadi et al 2021 can simulate salinity at the watershed scale but disregards agricultural activities the swat sf model maleki tirabadi et al 2022 which incorporates reliable expert scientific judgments into a watershed scale salinity model framework cannot directly address agricultural activities there is a need to improve the capabilities of watershed scale salinity frameworks in agriculture the swat neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2012 has been widely used for its modularity in quantity and quality components computational efficiency and the ability to predict long term impacts as a continuous model in watersheds throughout the world e g kim et al 2018 janney and jenkins 2019 hirt et al 2020 samimi et al 2020 in addition swat has been used in large river basins where data are not adequately available for calibration and validation jeong et al 2020 ouyang et al 2020 chen et al 2020 the swat s maleki tirabadi et al 2021 is a water salt balance model that can address the generation of salts transportation of salts through the landscapes transportation of salts from the landscapes into rivers and in stream transport of salts the model can quantify salt dissolution precipitation processes based on the maximum salt concentration in the soil and river environments two types of the salt dissolution process are simulated simultaneously in the soil the first salt dissolution process is dissolution from the precipitated salt transported through the soil hydrological processes this salt dissolution process is simulated using the salt mass balance approach the second salt dissolution process is from the solid salt generated by chemical weathering processes in the saline geological formation this salt dissolution process is simulated using the gis map of the saline geological formation if the precipitated salt related to the first salt dissolution process exists in the soil the model dissolves this precipitated salt in water otherwise if there is no precipitated salt in the soil the model dissolves the generated salt in the saline geological formation in water until the salt concentration reaches the maximum salt concentration the gis map of the saline geological formation and the maximum salt concentration are adjustable during the simulation period the swap kroes et al 2017 is an agro hydrological model that can simulate one dimensional water flow solute transport and heat flow processes in close interaction with crop development in the root zone the model can simulate the basic transport processes of salts pesticides and other solutes at the field scale using convection diffusion dispersion root uptake freundlich adsorption and first order decomposition relations many studies have verified the swap model s applicability for a wide range of agricultural systems and climatic conditions heuvelmans et al 2011 wessolek et al 2011 hao et al 2013 mokhtari et al 2018 li and ren 2021 the primary input data required by the swap model is related to the simulation meteorology crop rotation scheme irrigation soil water flow heat flow and solute transport the primary output data of the swap model is related to the water and solute balance soil profile crop growth and drainage xie and cui 2011 observed that the swap model is better at simulating upland areas than depression areas to overcome the deficiency of the swat model for water quantity modeling related to agriculture several attempts have been made to accurately address the effects of gravity and capillarity on water flow in the unsaturated root zone by integrating the swat model with the swap model liu et al 2013 developed an integrated swat swap modflow model to explore sustainable management strategies for surface and groundwater irrigation the swap model was first evaluated for the suitability of irrigation applications and groundwater depths then appropriate irrigation schedules and groundwater depths were introduced as input data to the swat and modflow models uniyal and dietrich 2019 improved auto irrigation in the swat model by changing the root density distribution they validated the modified model against the swap model and observed irrigation and crop yield data a watershed scale salinity framework can identify critical salinity processes in a watershed the main objective of this study is to develop a watershed scale integrated salinity framework for simulating natural and anthropogenic salinity processes in a large watershed for this purpose the watershed scale swat s model which can model natural salinity was modified to address the effects of anthropogenic activities using point sources and water uses in addition a method was proposed to link the modified swat s model and swap model to improve the simulation of the secondary salinity processes related to agriculture the salinity phenomenon that can be addressed within the integrated framework is the generation mobilization and accumulation of salts in different parts of the environment throughout a watershed the salinity sources may be natural unnatural point non point sources of the salts the salinity factors related to the entry of salts are the input of salts to the root zone through the rain irrigation and upward flux from the aquifer aquifer through the recharge and river this entry is through the surface runoff lateral flow return flow drainage and discharge from the springs sewages and upstream rivers the upward movement of the salt from the root zone to the soil surface through evaporation is also modeled furthermore salinity factors like the salt dissolution from the solid salt and the salt precipitation due to evaporation and transpiration are modeled for the root zone aquifer and river the methodology and results are explained in the following sections 2 methodology 2 1 integrated framework the swat model partitions a watershed into several sub basins with a reach or river that connects sub basins sub basins are portioned into multiple separate hydrologic response units hrus the root zone and shallow aquifer are the primary subsurface regions in the hrus the vadose zone receives the percolation from the root zone and recharges into the shallow aquifer based on the depth to the water table and the hydraulic properties of the geologic formations in the vadose zone neitsch et al 2011 the swat model simulates the amount of water that moves from one layer to the underlying layer in the root zone using the storage routing method neitsch et al 2011 the surface runoff is based on the scs curve number method neitsch et al 2011 a kinematic storage model based on the mass water balance method for the simulation of lateral flows neitsch et al 2011 if the amount of water stored in the shallow aquifer exceeds a threshold value the return flow enters the river depending on the recharge neitsch et al 2011 water is routed through the river using the variable storage routing method neitsch et al 2011 the swat s model can simulate salt concentrations and salinity processes i e the generation transportation dissolution and precipitation of the salt in the watershed based on the salt mass balance method and the area ratios of saline geological formations maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the top boundary condition of the root zone the salt concentration of water that enters the root zone at the top is equal to the salt concentration of the rain maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the bottom boundary condition of the root zone the salt concentration of the downward flow is equal to the salt concentration of the lowest soil layer that is affected by the saline geological formation in the root zone maleki tirabadi et al 2021 the salt concentration of the upward flow is equal to the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the top boundary condition of the shallow aquifer the salt concentration of water that enters the shallow aquifer at the top is equal to the salt concentration of the recharge maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the bottom boundary condition of the shallow aquifer the salt concentration of the downward flow is equal to the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the surface runoff boundary condition the salt concentration of the surface runoff inflow to the river reach is equal to the salt concentration of the surface runoff that is affected by the saline geological formation in the river reach bed maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the lateral flow boundary condition the salt concentration of the lateral flow into the river reach is equal to the salt concentration of the lateral flow that is affected by the saline geological formation in the river reach bed maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the return flow boundary condition the salt concentration of the return flow into the river reach is equal to the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer that is affected by the presence of the saline geological formation in the river reach bed maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the upstream boundary condition of the river reach the salt concentration of water that enters the river reach from the upstream river reaches is equal to the weighted mean of the salt concentrations of the upstream river reaches based on the volume of input waters to the river reach from the upstream river reaches maleki tirabadi et al 2021 for the downstream boundary condition of the river reach the salt concentration of water that leaves the river reach is equal to the salt concentration of the river reach maleki tirabadi et al 2021 the swap model simulates soil water flow using the richards equation kroes et al 2017 the soil hydraulic functions are modeled using the modified mualem van genuchten methods kroes et al 2017 the surface runoff occurs according to a specified resistance if the height of water stored on the soil surface exceeds a threshold depth kroes et al 2017 the drainage is simulated using the hooghoudt or ernst equations kroes et al 2017 both the head and flux can control the bottom boundary condition of the root zone kroes et al 2017 the salt transport can be simulated by considering the convection diffusion and dispersion processes and passive uptake by plant roots kroes et al 2017 the swat s model was modified and used as a base model for the water quantity and salinity modeling equations of the modified swat s model related to non farming soil profile the root zone and surface runoff are presented in supplementary section 1 1 in these equations the rain and upward flux from the shallow aquifer input the salt into the non farming soil profile also surface runoff lateral flow and percolation release the salt from the non farming soil profile the transportation of the salt through evaporation and the salt dissolution precipitation processes can occur in the non farming soil profile supplementary section 1 2 explains the equations of the modified swat s model related to the shallow aquifer in these equations the recharge enters the salt into the shallow aquifer the return flow upward flux from the shallow aquifer the recharge to the deep aquifer and water use e g irrigation move the salt from the shallow aquifer the salt dissolution precipitation processes can also occur in the shallow aquifer the swat model considers that water entering the deep aquifer is lost from the system neitsch et al 2011 thus the salt concentration is not simulated for the deep aquifer the recharge to the deep aquifer is only addressed by simulating the salt concentration in the shallow aquifer equations of the modified swat s model related to the river reach are explained in supplementary section 1 3 in these equations the surface runoff lateral flow return flow discharge from the upstream river reaches drainage and point source enter the salt into the river reach the salt load from the point source to the river reach is addressed by combining the salt mass loads of the springs and sewages the transmission loss discharge into downstream river reaches and water use e g irrigation remove the salt from the river reach furthermore salt dissolution precipitation processes can occur in the river reach the adjustable gis maps of the natural shallow and deep saline geological formations are used to identify locations of shallow deep and reach bed saline geological formations throughout the watershed in general shallow saline geological formations are located in the soil surface layer deep saline geological formations are below the soil surface and above the impermeable layer the gis map of the land use identifies the locations of the irrigated farms in the watershed point sources of the salinity such as springs and sewages are located along the river reach in each sub basin the proposed method for integrating the modified swat s model with the swap model is described in sections 2 1 1 and 2 4 2 1 1 coupling of the modified swat s model with the swap model the root zone of the hru has the same land use soil slope and management values neitsch et al 2011 the root zone of the swap model is represented by one vegetation type one soil type and one drainage condition kroes et al 2017 thus the root zone of the irrigated farming hru of the swat model is compatible with the root zone of the swap model and can be replaced with the root zone of the swap model fig 1 shows how the swap model is coupled with the modified swat s model in this figure salts are transported through water pathways between different parts of the environment water pathways except the upward flux from the shallow aquifer into the root zone of the non farming hru are default in the swat and swap models the salinity processes in the swap model and the natural salinity processes in the modified swat s model are also default the man made salinity processes in the modified swat s model are not default sub daily results of the swap model are aggregated and the daily data are exchanged between models to avoid creating extra water for each irrigated farming hru the modified swat s model only simulates daily amounts of the quantity and salt mass of four components that do not directly interact with the root zone of the hru these components are 1 the recharge from the shallow aquifer into the deep aquifer 2 the return flow from the shallow aquifer into the river reach 3 the water use from the shallow aquifer and 4 the recharge from the vadose zone into the shallow aquifer the swap model simulates daily amounts of the quantity and salt mass of other components specifically the surface runoff and the subsoil drainage contributions from the root zone of the irrigated farming hru into the river reach and the downward seepage from the root zone of the irrigated farming hru into the vadose zone unrestricted drainage and zero flux bottom boundary conditions are suitable for the bottom boundary condition of the swap model based on the depth of the groundwater table irrigation water is not applied to the root zone of the non farming hru this is only applied to the root zone of the irrigated farming hru the manual application of irrigation water can be specified under irrigation operation in the integrated framework the amount of irrigation water related to an irrigated farming hru which corresponds to the individual swap model is defined by the user in the modified swat s model irrigation water may be obtained from the surface water and groundwater sources the modified swat s model compares the amount of water available in the source with the amount specified for the withdrawal event if the amount available is less than the amount specified the modified swat s model will only use the available water neitsch et al 2011 the final irrigation values simulated by the modified swat s model can be adjusted based on the real field irrigation values by modifying user defined irrigation water values the modified swat s model introduces time series of quantities and salt masses of final irrigation waters for the irrigated farming hru as input data to the corresponding individual swap model for all days of the simulation period to use these time series values as input data in the swap model daily irrigation applications with the fixed irrigation regime are employed for the corresponding individual swap model fig 2 shows data exchange between the subroutines of the modified swat s and swap models using separate input output files in this figure the runoff quantity f drainage quantity f and seepage quantity f subroutines of the modified swat s model read quantities of the surface runoff drainage and downward seepage for each farm respectively the runoff nacl f runoff caso4 f drainage nacl f drainage caso4 f seepage nacl f and seepage caso4 f subroutines of the modified swat s model read nacl and caso4 masses of the surface runoff drainage and downward seepage for each farm respectively the swapoutput f90 subroutine of the swap model writes these data for each farm the irrigation quantity f irrigation nacl f irrigation caso4 f and irrigation tds f subroutines of the modified swat s model write quantities and nacl caso4 and total dissolved salt tds masses of applied irrigation waters for each farm respectively the swap f90 subroutine of the swap model reads these data for each farm in fig 2 the unit of the water quantity data is cm and the unit of the salt mass data is mg cm2 i e salt mass data mg cm2 water quantity data cm salt concentration data mg cm3 since the swap model simulates salts and tds as conservative non reactive tracers salts and tds are simulated separately thus the swap model is run three times for each irrigated farming hru the first run is for modeling tds and the second run is for modeling nacl the third run is for modeling caso4 since the salinity stress shown by tds reduces the productivity of crops the first run of the swap model is also done to evaluate the crop yields 2 2 calibration and validation procedure the calibration procedure requires changes in parameter values followed by a model run an interface to automate this procedure is useful abbaspour et al 2007 the iswat interface yang et al 2006 allows parameter aggregation based on the hydrologic group soil land use and sub basin specifications facilitating the calibration procedure in addition this interface has a generic format that allows for easy coupling with any optimization program abbaspour et al 2007 to calibrate the aggregate parameters in this study we modified the iswat interface to couple with the sufi 2 optimization program abbaspour et al 2007 the source codes of the iswat interface which have been prepared based on the input files of the swat model version 2000 yang et al 2006 were modified to properly consider input water quantity and salinity parameters of the modified swat s model maleki tirabadi et al 2021 the uncertainty of the model predictions was assessed based on the p factor the fraction of observations bracketed by the 95ppu band and r factor the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu band and the standard deviation of the measured variable indices the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 were used to assess the model performances based on the general recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 these recommendations are presented in table 1 2 3 study area the mond river basin is located in southern iran between 27 n to 30 n and 51 e to 55 e coordinates the watershed covers an area of approximately 47 300 km2 fig 3 shows the study area swat delineated sub basins dem map river network gauging stations average rainfall average potential evapotranspiration distribution map of shallow saline geological formations and distribution map of deep saline geological formations shallow saline geological formations are located in the surface layer of the soil while deep saline geological formations are found in subsurface layers of the soil the basin s elevation ranges from 16 m below sea level in the southwestern parts to 3 100 m in the northern parts of the basin the average elevation of the basin is 1 028 m the average annual rainfall in major parts of the mond river basin is below 300 mm year whereas the northwestern parts receive up to 700 mm year the stream salinity varies from 200 mg l to over 17 000 mg l in the mond river basin generally the stream salinity increases along the river from upstream to downstream the average groundwater salinity varies across the basin from 500 mg l to an excess of 5 000 mg l abgeer 2011 2 4 model setup the mond river basin was discretized into 56 sub basins and 407 hrus irrigated crops while economically important cover only about 2 5 of the basin area dryland crops cover almost 3 5 of the basin area as shown in fig 4 irrigation areas are mainly located north of the mond river basin there are thirty one irrigated farming hrus in the mond river basin these farms were divided into four groups the first group of farms includes the most upstream farms and the last group of farms consists of the most downstream farms two other groups including the remaining farms were placed between these groups as in fig 5 the modified swat s model was run first then the swap models were run separately for all farms placed in the first group of farms this procedure was repeated subsequently for other groups of farms respectively the modified swat s model was finally run five times 2 5 monitoring data the discharge and salt concentration data for three river gauges groundwater salinity data soil salinity data water use data including the municipal agricultural and industrial demands point source data including the discharge and salinity of the springs and sewages agricultural data and other data e g the gis maps of the shallow and deep saline geological formations were provided by the local water authorities and abgeer consulting engineers company abgeer 2011 wrm 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration evaluation and uncertainty analysis the watershed water quantity and quality models were calibrated from 1979 to 1992 and validated from 1993 to 1998 using the monthly observed discharge and salt concentration data the nash sutcliffe coefficient that was taken as the objective function for monthly time step simulations was assessed at three gauging stations i e dehram dejgah and ghontareh stations in the main stem for each iteration 1000 latin hypercube samples were prepared and fed into the model for the simulation to calibrate the discharge a global sensitivity analysis was used to find the most sensitive parameters of the streamflow based on the regression method abbaspour 2015 global sensitivity was measured by the values of each parameter s t stat the coefficient of a parameter divided by its standard error and associated p value probability of accepting the null hypothesis against the objective function a parameter with a larger absolute value of t stat and a smaller p value is a more sensitive parameter than other parameters a p value of 0 05 was used as a confidence limit to reject the null hypothesis eight parameters were sensitive to river discharges the sensitivity analysis results for the discharge sensitive parameters are shown in table 2 parameters related to the groundwater surface water interaction and groundwater dynamic such as the curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 baseflow alpha factor alpha bf the available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc and threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn were very sensitive the curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 was decreased this decrease is smaller for sub basins 5 11 17 and 24 than for other sub basins therefore surface runoff is more likely to occur in these sub basins than other sub basins the available water capacity sol awc of the soil layer and the plant available water were increased while the moist bulk density sol bd of the soil layer was decreased the soil porosity was increased and water content at the wilting point was decreased the field capacity was reduced and a higher volume of water was drained from the soil layer moreover more evapotranspiration occurred the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf was increased so the groundwater travel time was decreased the infiltration rate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k were increased concurrently therefore the baseflow was increased the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for the return flow to occur gwqmn was raised so a higher depth of water in the shallow aquifer is required for the occurrence of the groundwater flow into the river since the river reach s bed materials contain sand and gravel mixture with high silt clay content the effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel alluvium ch k2 was about 6 mm hr the river reach s bed materials loss rate was moderate arnold et al 2012 the soil evaporation compensation factor esco was reduced thus more evaporative demand was extracted from lower levels of the soil profile since the salt concentration data had lower precision than the discharge data the calibration of the salt concentration was performed after the discharge calibration several authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of multi site calibration over single site calibration chiang et al 2014 daggupati et al 2015 chen et al 2017 to calibrate the salt concentration the model was first calibrated for the dehram and dejgah stations individually to obtain the best salinity parameter sets for upstream sub basins the model was then calibrated for the ghontareh station the salinity parameters were the coefficient related to the upward movement of the salt to the soil surface salt percolation coefficient correction coefficient for the salt dissolution of the surface runoff ratio associated with the existence of the shallow salt in the hru ratio related to the presence of the deep salt in the hru maximum salt concentration for the hru the salt concentration of the rainfall the salt concentration of the sewage correction coefficient for the salt dissolution of input waters to the river reach via the upstream river reaches and the surface runoff ratio related to the existence of the salt in the river reach bed and maximum salt concentration for the river reach that have been explained in supplementary section 1 the salinity parameters were differentiated based on the basin s data to represent the geospatial and hydro geo chemical characteristics this ensures that the variability in each sub basin is captured and improves the efficiency of the multi site calibration a reasonable range was first assigned for each differentiated parameter the parameter ranges were then modified typically narrowed down according to the new parameter ranges suggested by the sufi 2 program and their reasonable physical limitations neitsch et al 2011 abbaspour 2015 to prevent over calibration of the models also the model simulation results were limited to reasonable ranges of soil groundwater river spring and sewage salinities for each hru and sub basin based on the field data from within the mond river basin calibration and validation performance results of the river gauges for the discharge nacl concentration and caso4 concentration are seen in table 3 and figs 6 7 and 8 reasonable agreement was seen between the simulated and observed values of the streamflow nacl concentration and caso4 concentration as shown in figs 6 7 and 8 the mean of nacl and caso4 concentrations sometimes vary between the calibration and validation periods for some stations since the primary component considered for the baseflow simulation is the point source including discharges from springs and sewages which has almost a constant value some incongruities were seen in predicting high salt concentrations table 4 shows the performances of water quantity and quality models based on the recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 these results indicate that the discharge nacl concentration and caso4 concentration were satisfactorily simulated for the dehram dejgah and ghontareh stations the baseflow was simulated better than the peak flow for all stations with a decrease in the cn2 parameter during the calibration process moreover the locations of peak flows peak nacl concentrations and peak caso4 concentrations were well predicted for these three stations there are not enough data for the calibration of the recharge however the quantities of the recharge component are generally reliable compared to the quantities of other components such as rainfall based on prior studies abgeer 2011 the 95ppu bands covered at least 65 of the observed discharges data for all stations the 95ppu bands covered at least 76 of the observed nacl and caso4 concentrations data for all stations abbaspour et al 2015 recommended a working value of greater than 0 7 for p factor and 1 5 for r factor the models attained rational performance ratings during both the calibration and validation periods the widths of the 95ppu bands are sufficiently narrow to indicate a relatively small uncertainty for the discharge nacl concentration and caso4 concentration simulations the p factor and r factor values also do not significantly vary between the calibration and validation periods these generally indicate that the discharge nacl concentration and caso4 concentration predictions almost properly consider the uncertainties of the models the reliable results of the proposed integrated framework indicate that it can sufficiently account for the hydrological and geochemical characteristics of a watershed 3 2 average salt concentrations each watershed has specific spatial distributions of salt concentrations spatial distributions of the average caso4 nacl and tds concentrations of the surface runoff root zone and shallow aquifer are illustrated in fig 9 using the results of the proposed integrated framework from 1979 to 1992 results indicate that the tds of the surface runoff is generally 2 000 mg l which is acceptable for many consumptive water uses in the mond river basin the groundwater quality of the mond river basin was categorized as brackish based on the recommendations of logeshkumaran et al 2015 the groundwater quality is also acceptable for many consumptive water uses in the mond river basin the average tds of the river reach 24 is greater than the average tds of the river reach 17 as shown in fig 3d it is because of two crucial salt diapirs konarsiah and jahani these salt diapirs increase the salinity of the river reach for the sub basin 24 therefore spatial distributions of salt concentrations which could be satisfactorily mapped using the results of the proposed integrated framework provided valuable information that can be used to determine the primary salinity sources and processes of a watershed the data is usable for watershed scale water and soil resource management 3 3 salt loadings horizontal flows may transport salts from the land into the river these horizontal flows are the surface runoff lateral flow from the soil profile the root zone and groundwater flow from the shallow aquifer besides vertical flows may transport salts between the soil profile and shallow aquifer these vertical flows are the downward recharge from the soil profile into the shallow aquifer and upward upflux from the shallow aquifer into the soil profile fig 10 a c shows spatial distributions of the total mass of caso4 nacl and tds transported by the surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow into the streamflow these spatial distributions were prepared using the results of the proposed integrated framework for 1979 1992 loadings of caso4 are mainly concentrated in the middle south and east of the mond river basin also nacl loadings are primarily concentrated in the north center and south of the mond river basin the amount of the transported salt mass depends concurrently on the volume of the transported water and the salt concentration of the transported water a sub basin may have a higher average salt concentration than another sub basin but the first sub basin has lower average salt mass transportation than the second sub basin the results of the proposed integrated framework show that the recharge into the shallow aquifer fig 10d is not significant for many sub basins thus the upflux fig 10e and salt transportation by the groundwater flow into the streamflow fig 10c are not significant for those sub basins however the groundwater flow contribution to the streamflow generally is not related to the rain in the mond river basin still the groundwater flows into the streamflow mainly occur due to many point sources i e springs and sewages patterns of salt loadings which were prepared using the results of the proposed integrated framework indicated the role of main salinity sources and processes in the salinity of a watershed the daily salt mass loading data can assist the watershed scale salinity investigation and management fig 11 shows the daily loadings and losses of caso4 nacl and tds for the river system the main component which enters salts into the main channel is the point source the salt concentration of the point source is the combination of the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer and a fixed salt concentration for each sub basin the fixed salt concentration is estimated based on the salt loading and water discharge into the river reach through the municipal agricultural and industrial sewages for each sub basin since the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer does not vary considerably for any sub basins point sources contribute approximately the same daily salt loadings into the river reach for each sub basin the highest amount of daily salt loadings into the river reach is mainly due to the high amount of corresponding daily water discharges into the river reach through lateral flows the maximum daily salt loadings from the groundwater flow and point source into the river reach are almost identical thus the results of the proposed integrated framework can properly compare daily natural and unnatural salt loadings into a river 3 4 salt balance components each natural and unnatural process has a specific role in releasing accumulating and transporting salts throughout a watershed fig 12 schematically illustrates relative caso4 nacl and tds mass balance components of the mond river basin since the total salt transportation through the surface runoff is lower than the amount of the total salt transportation through each of the other components the magnitudes of all salt transport components were adjusted based on the magnitude of the surface runoff component a fraction of transmission losses from the river reach is permanently lost due to the transmission to aquifers that does not contribute flow back to the river reach arnold et al 2012 since the modified swat s model parameter related to the fraction of transmission losses from the river reach was not a sensitive parameter for the mond river basin the default value of this parameter was not changed thus it was assumed that all transmission losses from the river reach were permanently lost as in fig 12 although the rain is a dilute source of caso4 the rain enters a considerable amount of caso4 from the atmosphere into the soil profile over time compared to the transport of caso4 through each of the other land based paths still the rain does not comparatively enter the considerable amount of nacl from the atmosphere into the soil profile about a third of the salt mass transportation via the shallow aquifer recharge returns to the soil profile via the upflux besides the loading of caso4 through lateral flow into the river reach is comparatively very considerable still the loading of the nacl from the lateral flow into the river reach is not comparatively very considerable salt balances of the main channel indicate that the dissolution of the salt is not generally significant in the main channels of the mond river basin the stream outflow from the watershed conveys comparatively lower masses of caso4 than the loading of caso4 from the rainfall still the streamflow out of the watershed conveys comparatively higher masses of nacl than the nacl loading from the rainfall the inclusion of the salt containing rainfall as the only salt input indicates that although caso4 is accumulated in the mond river basin nacl is mobilized from the basin fig 12e shows that the interaction of the point source with the river system about 96 of the total salt load noticeably affects the salt balance of the river system this result is conspicuous for caso4 and nacl fig 12d illustrates the importance of sewage loads compared to total point source loads for all sub basins of the mond river basin as in fig 12d the contributions of sewage loads to total point source loads are more than spring loads for most sub basins the results of the proposed integrated framework could indicate the role of primary and secondary due to anthropogenic activities salinity sources and processes in the salinity of a watershed 3 5 salt output input for sub basins all salinity processes occurring in a watershed such as salt transportations through the environment and the salt dissolution precipitation in the environment which can affect the salinity in the environment and the severity of the salinity can be assessed approximately using the salt balance ratios bugan et al 2015 guan et al 2010 salt output input o i ratios are commonly calculated based on the rainfall salt input and streamflow salt output schoups et al 2005 poulsen et al 2006 in this study the rainfall point source and input streamflows from upstream sub basins were considered salt inputs the output streamflow from the sub basins was considered as salt output the salt output input o i ratio is greater than 1 for watersheds that mobilize salts biggs et al 2013 jolly et al 2001 cresswell et al 2005 under natural conditions in semi arid to arid areas in which evaporation evapotranspiration greatly exceeds rainfall landscapes generally accumulate salts charman and murphy 1991 fig 13 shows the total salt output input o i ratios for all sub basins of the mond river basin results indicate that most sub basins of the mond river basin accumulate salts i e the salt output does not exceed the salt input as shown in fig 13 the salt output input o i ratios of the upstream sub basins are generally smaller than other sub basins i e the mobilization of the salt compared to the salt accumulation is not significant in the upstream sub basins the salt output input o i ratio of the sub basin 5 an upstream sub basin is greater than 1 downstream sub basins generally have higher salt output input o i ratios than other sub basins hence the severity of the salinity increases typically from the upstream to the downstream in the mond river basin this indicates that the salinity of a sub basin may significantly affect the salinity of its downstream sub basin the output input o i ratios of the total dissolved salt are about 0 02 for the whole basin thus the accumulation mobilization of salts could be inferred using the results of the proposed integrated framework for each sub basin and the entire watershed 3 6 average monthly rainfall discharge salt export and salt concentration the quantity and quality of the streamflow vary during the months of the year fig 14 illustrates a comparison between the average monthly rainfall discharge salt export and tds related to the dehram dejgah and ghontareh stations average rainfall was prepared using the data from the upstream sub basins the wet months of the year are from december to march while the river discharges are the highest values during these months the discharges of the rivers are very low during the rest of the year the ghontareh station has a broader range of the average monthly discharge about 65 m3 s and tds about 6700 mg l than the two other stations although the dehram station has a narrower range of the variation of the average monthly discharge about 10 m3 s than the dejgah station about 40 m3 s the dehram station has a broader range of the variation of the average monthly tds about 5200 mg l than the dejgah station about 3300 mg l therefore variations of each process have very different effects on the discharge and tds of rivers the highest amounts of tds occurred from may to october as in fig 14 tds and salt export trends are completely different for all stations but trends of the discharge and salt export are completely the same for all stations the highest salt export amounts occur in months with the lowest tds this indicates that the salt export depends highly on the discharge in the mond river basin the results of the proposed integrated framework approximately showed temporal patterns of salt exports and salt concentrations for a river 3 7 usability and limitations of the model agricultural activities cause many important salinity problems agriculture disturbs the natural hydrologic equilibrium in the landscape the runoff from agricultural areas profoundly affects the quality of the adjacent water resources in irrigated areas the effect of the irrigation water quality and salt build up in the soil profile on the plant growth may decline the crop yields therefore the proper consideration of agricultural activities is essential for the salinity modeling of a watershed that has been affected by anthropogenic activities the primary and secondary salinity processes are very complex moreover these processes are not fully understood thus salinity modeling encounters many difficulties models such as the bc2c gilfedder et al 2009 lascam sivapalan et al 1996a 1996b 1996c and 2csalt models stenson et al 2011 can be used for the primary salinity modeling at the watershed scale nevertheless these models do not specifically consider secondary salinity processes such as agricultural activities noory et al 2011 used the swap model for quantifying water management effects on drainage water amount and its salinity at the regional scale bailey et al 2019 also applied a swat based model to an irrigated area since the swat model has been designed for large scale modeling it cannot adequately address essential physical processes related to agriculture the effects of employing water and soil management options such as irrigation on the salinity of water and soil can be better studied using the proposed integrated framework other anthropogenic activities also can be considered by the water uses including various kinds of water uses that can be considered in the modified swat s model similar to the manual application of irrigation water and point sources in the proposed integrated framework properly considering the amounts of the daily water usage and point sources is preferable this will increase the confidence in the model s ability to estimate discharges salt loads and salt concentrations accurately the main limitation of the proposed integrated framework pertains to the structure of the water quantity model for example the modified swat s model is semi distributed and hrus are not internally connected groundwater is not adequately modeled using the modified swat s model some limitations also pertained to the salinity model of the integrated framework for example the interaction between individual salts is not directly simulated although it is required to run the modified swat s model multiple times the total running time of the modified swat s model is negligible compared to the total running time of the swap models the proposed integrated framework uses a general method to integrate the modified swat s model with the swap model this method can integrate the swat model with other distributed models there is a lack of comprehensive flow and salinity data in some locations this makes it difficult to calibrate and validate the model and increases the uncertainty of the model results continuous salt concentration data allow improvements in estimating salt balance components over various flow regimes wet and dry periods and seasons 4 conclusions this paper proposes a new method that integrates the modified swat s model with the swap model to improve watershed scale natural and secondary salinity modeling the modified swat s model can address the main components of the hydrologic cycle that contribute to salt transportation at the watershed scale besides the swap model can account for irrigated farms at the field scale a large scale model of the mond river basin was built using the integrated framework results show that the proposed integrated framework has reliable results constrained by data at the outlet and within the basin the performance of predictions was at least satisfactory for the discharge caso4 concentration and nacl concentration predictions for all gauging stations spatial distributions of salt concentrations of the surface runoff root zone aquifer and river can be mapped using the results of the proposed integrated framework daily natural and unnatural salt loadings into the river could be properly assessed utilizing the proposed integrated framework the accumulation mobilization of salts could be appropriately assessed for sub basins using the results of the proposed integrated framework the necessity of considering natural and secondary salinity sources and processes could be confirmed using the results of the proposed integrated framework the proposed integrated framework could exhibit the temporal patterns of salt exports and salt concentrations the proposed integrated framework can be utilized to comprehensively evaluate different best management practices for watershed scale water resource studies of basins facing natural and secondary salinity

3066,direct push based hydraulic profiling tool hpt and geostatistically based hydraulic tomography ht are two promising techniques for the high resolution estimation of hydraulic conductivity k for unconsolidated sediments although hpt surveys could be conducted rapidly relating the 1 5 cm resolution injection logging profiles to k always involve the upscaling of centimeter scale measurements to coarser intervals for the development of site specific formulae on the other hand k fields reconstructed by ht could be smooth when pumping test data are sparse in this study an inverse modeling approach was firstly utilized to estimate k values directly from hpt survey data for the glaciofluvial deposits at the north campus research site ncrs in waterloo ontario canada a site specific power law relationship was generated for the ncrs to relate hpt profiles to the vertical distributions of k then the proposed inverse modeling approach was evaluated with a two dimensional synthetic aquifer under controlled conditions and the estimated k profiles from inverse analysis of synthetic hpt surveys were incorporated into the steady state ht results of the field study showed that k estimates from the developed formula corresponded better with k values from permeameter tests than those estimated from the empirical model of mccall and christy 2010 for hpt surveys moreover through synthetic experiments we demonstrated that integration of k values inverted from hpt into steady state ht analyses yielded k tomograms that were significantly better than the geostatistical inversion results relying on pumping test data alone overall this study highlights the need in developing site specific formulae for the hpt and the joint implementation of hpt and ht techniques for the more cost effective high resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity keywords subsurface heterogeneity hydraulic conductivity hydraulic profiling tool inverse modeling hydraulic tomography model calibration and validation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate descriptions of hydraulic conductivity k distributions have long been acknowledged as critical for groundwater flow and contaminant transport related issues gelhar 1986 carrera et al 2005 sudicky et al 2010 foster et al 2021 to obtain high resolution estimates of k fields numerous efforts are frequently required by traditional field and laboratory approaches such as slug tests flowmeter tests and core sample analyses e g zheng et al 2011 over the last two decades direct push dp e g soo et al 2000 butler et al 2002 borden et al 2021 and hydraulic tomography ht e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 luo et al 2020 have been widely validated as promising techniques for the high resolution characterization of aquifer systems compared to the conventional site characterization approaches dp based techniques have the great advantages of higher speed and lower financial cost thus facilitating high density measurements along vertical profiles in surficial unconsolidated sediments e g dietrich et al 2008 maliva 2016 a variety of dp based techniques have been developed for aquifer characterization see maliva 2016 for a recent summary specifically the hydraulic profiling tool hpt was developed to probe in situ soil permeability at a vertical resolution of 1 5 cm geoprobe 2007 bohling et al 2016 during hpt surveys water is injected at a relatively constant flow rate while advancing the tool and recording injection rates and pressures these hpt measurements can then be utilized to infer k profiles through various approaches for example mccall and christy 2010 proposed an empiricial relationship for hpt to convert injection flow rates and pressure profiles to k through compiling hpt and slug test data from seven field sites in central united states lessoff et al 2010 developed a site specific empirical relationship for a dp injection logging dpil survey one of the built in modules of hpt to infer k values after relating dpil logs to k estimates from dp slug tests at the lauswiesen field test site in germany with a radial vertical finite difference flow model liu et al 2009 and bohling et al 2012 adopted the model calibration approach to estimate coefficients for empirical models which converted dpil measurements to k estimates at the made site by minimizing the differences between observed and simulated pressure responses of dp permeameter tests most recently borden et al 2021 developed a physically based equation through numerical modeling analyses of hpt surveys although field evaluations confirmed that the above relationships produced k values that generally matched estimates from other approaches e g borden et al 2021 lessoff et al 2010 mccall et al 2014 recent hpt studies at the highly heterogeneous north campus research site ncrs waterloo canada revealed that the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 yielded k estimates that are about one order of magnitude higher than those from permeameter tests for low permeability sediments sun et al 2022 such a discrepancy suggested for the need in developing site specific empiricial relationships like those by liu et al 2009 and mccall and christy 2010 which however require additional field efforts in collecting k estimates from nearby locations by other approaches alternatively inverse modeling approaches similar to the one proposed by bohling et al 2016 which solely relied on hpt measurements could be adopted to estimate k profiles other than the work of bohling et al 2016 at the made site no other studies have evaluated the usefulness of the inverse modeling approach based solely on hpt measurements to estimate k therefore the first purpose of the current study is to investigate this research gap through the inverse modeling of data from a field hpt survey by sun et al 2022 at the ncrs under field conditions ht as one robust approach for the high resolution mapping of subsurface heterogeneity e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 has also been extensively validated through synthetic e g zhu et al 2009 mao et al 2016 tsai et al 2017 wang et al 2019 luo et al 2020 li et al 2021 laboratory e g liu et al 2002 illman et al 2007 berg and illman 2011a zhao et al 2015 luo et al 2017 and field studies e g berg and illman 2011b

surveys hydraulic response transient or steady state data observed at different locations during multiple pumping or injection tests are jointly interpreted and high resolution k and or ss fields are obtained when sufficient observation data are utilized cardiff et al 2013 and illman et al 2015 found that with sparse observation data density ht captured fewer details in estimated k fields some researchers proposed the fusion of various types of information with pressure head data to improve the performance of ht for example through the inclusion of flux measurements li et al 2008 zha et al 2014 pouladi et al 2021 geological information zhao et al 2016 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2018 geophysical data yeh et al 2008 soueid ahmed et al 2016 tracer test data yeh and zhu 2007 zhu et al 2009 lee and kitanidis 2014 and permeameter data berg and illman 2015 zhao and illman 2018 based on spatial cross correlation analysis zha et al 2014 found that flux measurements carried non redundant information about subsurface heterogeneity and joint interpretation of pressure head and flux measurements yielded an estimated k field with higher resolution zhao and illman 2018 concluded that using geological data as prior information for ht preserved geological features connectivity in k heterogeneity patterns lee and kitanidis 2014 found a clear improvement of estimated transmissivity fields in terms of the small scale features when tracer test data was utilized with pressure heads for ht inversions during a ht study at the ncrs berg and illman 2015 showed that conditioning the k tomogram with permeameter k data helped the geostatistical inversion model in identifying low k zones with improved results obtained for ht surveys illman 2014 and the above studies called for the need for data integration to further improve results from ht through field evaluations of both ht and dp based approaches bohling et al 2007 reported that k estimates from ht compared well with those from direct push permeameter tests sanchez león et al 2016 showed that dpil profiles revealed more vertical variation features than the k tomogram reconstructed by ht based on the pilot point method given the high efficiency in data acquisition by the hpt technique over other site characterization approaches the high vertical resolution of k values inferred from hpt surveys could potentially be one important additional data source for ht so far the usefulness of one dimensional k profiles obtained from hpt for ht surveys has not been examined in detail therefore another purpose of the current study is to further evaluate the usefulness of integrating hpt inferred k profiles into steady state hydraulic tomography ssht for high resolution characterization of spatially heterogeneous k fields in this study we first investigated the performance of an inverse modeling approach in estimating high resolution k from a single hpt survey at the ncrs by coupling the groundwater flow model hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2018 with the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 then a site specific formula was developed for the ncrs based on the estimated k and hpt survey data the formula was then validated through site data obtained from a separate hpt survey at the ncrs next numerical experiments were conducted in a small scale multi layered two dimensional aquifer system to evaluate the inverse modeling approach under controlled conditions geostatistical inversion models were then utilized to evaluate the benefits of integrating k values estimated from hpt profiles for ssht analyses based on pumping test data of different pumping and observation densities findings from this study add further insights into integrating data from hpt and ht techniques 2 hpt at the ncrs the ncrs is situated at the north campus of the university of waterloo waterloo canada over the last forty years extensive research and teaching activities were carried out to advance the understanding of surficial geology and hydrogeology of this highly heterogeneous site karrow 1979 robertson et al 2000 alexander et al 2011 sun et al 2022 recently from july 30th and august 1st of 2019 11 hpt surveys were conducted by sun et al 2022 to probe the subsurface heterogeneity to an approximate depth of 17 mbgs using the hpt model k6050 geoprobe fig 1 a shows the plan view of well locations at the ncrs and hpt surveys site investigations reported that the ncrs consists of alternating layers of glaciofluvial deposits which belong to the waterloo moraine karrow 1979 sebol 2000 an aquifer layer is located approximately 8 to 13 m below the ground surface and is composed mainly of sand sandy silt and sandy gravel alexander et al 2011 zhao and illman 2018 situated above and below the aquifer layer are low permeability silt and clay layers fig 1b during the advancement of hpt probe into ncrs sediments water was continuously injected through a screen 1 cm in diameter installed on the side of the hpt probe water pressure flow rate as well as electrical conductivity ec over time were recorded at a 1 5 cm vertical interval due to the highly heterogeneous nature of ncrs sediments the hpt probe was advanced with a minimum rate of around 0 2 mm s in the low k layers and at a maximum rate of about 5 cm s in the high k units at selected depths with low water injection pressures dissipation tests were conducted to measure the hydrostatic pressure in the tested formation water pressure was measured by the hpt pressure sensor installed inside the probe and closely behind the injection screen while the injection rate qinj was measured on ground surface the measured pressure is a combination of hydrostatic pressure atmospheric pressure water injection pressure and pressure caused by probe advancement borden et al 2021 usually after accounting for atmospheric and hydrostatic pressures the corrected pressure pc was utilized to represent water injection pressure to estimate k assuming the pressure generated by probe advancement is negligible mccall and christy 2010 following the same assumptions we selected the hpt3 survey closely located with the cmt1 well for the current study and to facilitate the comparison with existing site data to obtain the local hydrostatic pressures for the hpt3 survey four dissipation tests were conducted at depths of 4 18 4 47 10 41 and 11 22 m the calculated pc values were shown in fig 1c the qinj profile was plotted in fig 1d to show the changes in injection flow rates caused by the subsurface heterogeneity of ncrs the light blue shaded zones in figs 1c and 1d indicate the identified high permeability layers based on the fuzzy clustering analysis of the hpt3 pc profile by zhao and illman 2022a 3 inverse modeling of hpt data from the ncrs 3 1 groundwater flow model to simulate the profiling processes of the hpt3 survey water injection logging by the hpt probe was conceptualized as a series of single hole injection tests by continuously shifting the injection position at an interval of 1 5 cm from the top to the bottom of the surveyed profile for each simulated injection test in the model the water injection duration was determined from the continuous injection process of the hpt survey at the ncrs and varied from test to test depending on the time interval between current and previous hpt measurements in this way the downward advancement of the hpt survey was mimicked the transient injection tests were simulated with the groundwater flow model hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2018 which is versatile in model settings and could be flexibly customized to match various hpt scenarios in the field a groundwater water flow model with dimensions of 15 m 15 m 19 m in x y and z directions fig 1a was constructed to simulate water injection pressure obtained by sequential water injections the modeling domain was discretized into 181 944 rectangular elements and 191 748 nodes to represent the 1 5 cm vertical resolution of hpt measurements at the ncrs and to maintain computational efficiency an injection test based gridding scheme was developed and adopted to discretize the 15 m 15 m 19 m modeling domain specifically for the injection test at a certain depth the grid length in the z direction was gradually refined from 1 5 m at the top and bottom boundary to 1 5 cm as approaching the injection well and to 0 1 cm near the injection well the computational grid in the z direction was updated after shifting the injection position downward by 1 5 cm the grid sizes in the x and y directions were gradually refined from 2 m 2 m at the four outside boundaries to 0 1 cm 0 1 cm at the hpt survey location and kept constant during all injection tests of the hpt3 survey fig s1 meanwhile to account for the impact of the hpt probe 4 45 cm in diameter on k fields at the fine scale the probe was built in as a low permeability zone with a fixed k value of 1 0 10 12 m s 3 2 calibration approach inverse modeling of the hpt survey data was performed by coupling the groundwater flow model hgs aquanty inc 2018 with the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 during the calibration of each injection test the aquifer was treated to be homogeneous and isotropic the impact of ss variability on water injection pressure measurements was ignored which is consistent with one of the underlying assumptions of the hpt technique to estimate k liu et al 2012 through synthetic experiments borden et al 2021 reported that ss did not show a measurable impact on pc values when k was varied from 1 0 10 7 m s to 1 0 10 4 m s therefore for the current study only the effective k value was estimated by the inverse modeling of hpt survey data and a constant value of 9 3 10 6 m was adopted from zhao and illman 2018 for ss in hgs there are 850 pairs of measurements for each of the pc and qinj profiles in the hpt3 survey as suggested by liu et al 2012 the flow measurement is not considered to be accurate for qinj less than 10 ml min in low k sediments we therefore excluded 80 data pairs below this flow range for each injection test only one injection pressure data was recorded by the hpt survey as stated earlier the corrected water pressure pc represented the pressure generated by water injection to facilitate the calibration of the groundwater model water pressure was converted to head and pressure head change δ h was calculated from pc to represent the change in pressure caused by water injection k values were iteratively estimated by calibrations of an effective parameter groundwater model by minimizing an objective function that represented the squared residual between simulated and observed pressure head changes the optimization process converged when the lowest four objective function values were within a relative distance of 0 01 defined as 1 φ i φ min φ i 0 01 where фi is the objective function value at the end of the ith optimization iteration фmin is the lowest objective function achieved during the final four i e ith to the i 3 th optimization iterations we assessed the fits between simulated and observed pressure head changes for model calibrations through scatterplots and calculated the mean absolute error l1 and mean square error l2 for each injection test to further evaluate the fit between observed and simulated pressure head changes these quantities were computed as 2 l 1 1 n i 1 n δ h i δ h i 3 l 2 1 n i 1 n δ h i δ h i 2 where n is the total number of pressure head change data i indicates the data number δ h i and δ h i are the converted and simulated pressure head changes respectively in the following discussion both l1 and l2 norms are presented as the latter better assesses the large discrepancies of model calibrations 3 3 high resolution k estimates for the hpt3 survey at ncrs calibrations of the sequential injection tests from the hpt3 survey were performed on a personal computer equipped with 12 processors with 16 gb of ram the run time was about 72 h for the sequential calibration of 770 injection tests for future field implementations of this inversion approach with a large number of hpt data model calibration runs with a parallel environment would greatly reduce the computational time cost we first assessed the quality of model calibration by comparing the 770 simulated pressure head changes δh with those converted from the pc values obtained from the hpt3 survey as shown in fig 2 two groups of data were identified from fig 2 based on the differences between converted δh δhcon and simulated δh δhsim with data points in a well matched group group 1 following the 1 1 line indicating a near perfect match while data points from the poorly matched group group 2 showing under estimations of the converted δh values the differences between δhcon and δhsim in group 2 are generally larger than 1 0 m while differences in group 1 are no more than 0 4 m performance metrics showed that the l1 and l2 values of group 2 are four and seven orders of magnitude higher than those of group 1 respectively to examine the cause of this discrepancy we refer to fig 3 a which shows the vertical distribution of residual pc values converted from pressure head change data δhcon δhsim data examination of data locations in group 2 suggested that these data are obtained from 8 0 to 9 0 m and below 5 0 m above the bottom of the domain in fig 3a corresponding with low permeability sediments showing high pc values in fig 1c additional explanations of the poor matches in group 2 are provided subsequently in a later section the 770 k values estimated through calibrating the hpt3 survey data were shown in fig 3b in fig 3b group 1 data were shown as blue squares while group 2 data were shown as red squares we also jointly plotted the k estimates from permeameter tests of core samples collected from the collocated cmt1 well as gray squares and corresponding segmental arithmetic means of these k values as green lines in addition the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 which relates qinj pc to k values and is included in the di viewer software www geoprobe com direct image was adopted to calculate k values for the hpt3 survey referred hereafter as hpt3 mc k shown as black squares in fig 3c comparison among k estimates in figs 3b and 3c showed that the k values estimated by inverse analyses of hpt3 data referred hereafter as hpt3 inverted k for group 1 in fig 3b shared a similar variation pattern as the k values in fig 3c when k values are larger than 1 0 10 5 m s for example k estimates at depths from 12 0 to 13 5 m and from 5 5 to 7 0 m in figs 3b and 3c all suggested the existence of high permeability zones although the intralayer variation of k values are smoother in fig 3c at these two depth ranges k estimates by the two approaches were both higher than those estimated by permeameter analyses we also found some obvious differences between values of hpt3 inverted k and hpt3 mc k mostly for the depth where the hpt3 mc k was assigned a fixed value of the lower bound 3 5 10 7 m s by the di viewer software using the mccall and christy 2010 s approach from 9 5 to 11 5 m and from 7 0 to 9 5 m above the bottom of the model domain hpt3 inverted k values in group 1 varied over a range of 1 0 10 7 m s 1 0 10 5 m s which revealed more information on k variability than hpt3 mc k values below 5 0 m compared to the overestimation of k values for this low permeability zone by the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 results obtained by the inverse modeling approach showed a lower k variation range centred around the segmental arithmetic mean k value for the bottom clay layer these results suggest that the inverse modeling approach could potentially provide more accurate k estimates for low permeability sediments than the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 despite the fact that the inverse analysis approach yielded poor model calibration results for group 2 data 3 4 relationship between the hpt inverted k and the qinj pc at ncrs the overestimation of k values by the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 in fig 3c suggested the need for developing a site specific model to relate the hpt measurements to k therefore the estimated k values in fig 3b were plotted against the qinj pc data figs 1c and 1d to generate an empirical relationship for the hpt survey at hpt3 conducted at the ncrs as shown in fig 4 liu et al 2012 pointed out that for high permeability sediments with k approximately above 60 m d 6 9 10 4 m s the injection rate would be too small to produce a measurable pressure response bohling et al 2016 thus proposed a plateau function to account for the upper threshold of the hpt technique in fig 4 we plotted this upper threshold as a dashed pink line with a k value of 6 9 10 4 m s in addition the lower k boundary with a k value of 3 5 10 7 m s defined by the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 was also plotted in fig 4 as a dashed green line it is very noteworthy that there is an excellent match of our hpt3 inverted k values with a maximum value of 6 1 10 4 m s in group 1 with the upper threshold value of 6 9 10 4 m s suggested by liu et al 2012 most of the k estimates in group 1 fall in the range of 3 5 10 7 m s 6 9 10 4 m s with only several outliers shown just below the value of 3 5 10 7 m s on fig 4 we also showed a gray shaded area defined by qinj pc 1 7 10 7 m2 s and k 3 5 10 7 m s based on hpt surveys and slug test data from multiple field sites in central united states mccall and christy 2010 developed the empirical model of k 21 14 ln qinj pc 41 71 where k qinj and pc have the units of ft day ml min and psi respectively this formula showed a minimum value of 1 7 10 7 m2 s of qinj pc for the field measurements to produce non negative k therefore we use the gray shaded area to indicate qinj pc values that may produce unreliable estimates of k for the hpt survey at the ncrs for the poorly calibrated group 2 data red squares k estimates showed a substantial variation when the ratio of qinj pc was below 1 0 10 7 m2 s most of the qinj pc ratios fall within the gray shaded area suggesting the corresponding qinj and pc measurements may not be trustworthy for k estimation which could also lead to the poor matches of δhcon for group 2 data in fig 2 to gain a thorough understanding of this topic more technical evaluations are needed to systematically evaluate the reliability of qinj and pc measurements for low permeability sediments such as the ncrs clay deposits given the fact that the data points in group 2 red squares were poorly simulated by the inverse modeling approach they were not selected for the development of the relationship between qinj pc and k for the ncrs fig 4 therefore only 538 pairs of log qinj pc and log k were fitted to a linear model the best fit model as well as the coefficient of determination r2 was plotted in fig 4 in addition to account for the upper threshold of the hpt technique an upper limit of 6 9 10 4 m s was defined as suggested by liu et al 2012 therefore the following function was adopted to represent the dependence of k on qinj pc at the ncrs for this study 4 log k 1 41 log q inj p c 4 25 q inj p c 5 5 10 6 m 2 s k 6 9 10 4 m s q inj p c 5 5 10 6 m 2 s to evaluate the validity of the above relationship data from the hpt6 2 survey and the collocated cmt3 well were selected to compute k values from the hpt data as shown in fig 5 we note that four dissipation tests were conducted at depths of 4 62 5 03 11 54 and 12 13 m for the hpt6 2 survey based on the pc profile of the hpt6 2 survey fig 5b three potentially high k zones were identified by the fuzzy clustering analysis approach in zhao and illman 2022a corresponding to sand and sandy silt layers shown in fig 5a for the cmt3 well in fig 5c there was a decrease in qinj near the bottom of model domain and qinj less than 10 ml min was also abandoned during the calculation of k values figs 5d and 5e showed the estimated k profiles using the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 and eq 4 respectively k estimates from permeameter tests on core samples collected at the cmt3 well were jointly plotted as black circles and a gray line generally we found that fig 5e showed an improved match between k estimates from hpt data with k values of the permeameter tests than the match in fig 5d specifically from 1 to 4 m above the bottom of the domain the downward decreasing trend in k values was better captured in fig 5e while k values at the same locations in fig 5d were estimated as a constant value of 3 5 10 7 m s by the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 from 6 0 to 9 5 m above the bottom of the domain eq 4 also represented the vertical variations of k in surrounding sediments better than those in fig 5d as suggested by variations in qinj values and relatively constant pc values these overall improved matches clearly showed that the site specific model eq 4 developed from the hpt3 inverted k values could provide reasonable estimates for subsurface heterogeneity in k at the highly heterogeneous ncrs 4 synthetic experiments 4 1 experimental setup 4 1 1 two dimensional synthetic aquifer the inverse modeling analysis of hpt3 data yielded promising high resolution k estimates however further evaluation of these data for its direct use in groundwater flow modeling or in aquifer characterization by ht will require an extremely fine computational grid for field studies at the ncrs therefore to fulfill the goals of the current study a small scale two dimensional synthetic aquifer was constructed to evaluate the usefulness of hpt inverted k values under controlled conditions the synthetic aquifer is 161 0 cm in length 76 5 cm in height and 10 2 cm in width with 18 layers of an inter fingering pattern identical to the structure of a real sandbox constructed for solute transport experiments by illman et al 2012 fig 6 a the synthetic aquifer was discretized into 5 508 elements and 11 336 nodes with a grid length in z direction of 1 5 cm to match the vertical resolution of hpt injection tests under this experimental setting there is no need to upscale the high resolution k to a coarser grid which will sacrifice the heterogeneity details in hpt inverted k profiles for the synthetic experimental study the two dimensional synthetic aquifer was assigned with k values with a range similar to typical estimates for the sandbox constructed by illman et al 2012 the reference k field of the synthetic aquifer as shown in fig 6a was generated through 1 constructing a layered mean ln k field using values listed in table s1 2 generating a set of normally distributed random numbers with a mean of zero and a variance of 0 10 representing the perturbations of ln k to the layered mean ln k field and 3 perturbations of ln k were added to the mean ln k field and then back transformed yielding a k field with both interlayer and intralayer variability the k values of the synthetic aquifer ranged from 3 76 10 3 cm s to 3 57 10 1 cm s with a variance σ2 ln k of 0 85 and a geometric mean value of 3 85 10 2 cm s additional geostatistical parameters of the reference k field were summarized in table 1 similar to the field case in an earlier section the ss field was assumed to be homogeneous for simplicity and a value of 1 0 10 4 m was assigned to the groundwater model we set the left and right sides and top boundaries as constant head while the bottom front and back boundaries of the sandbox were set as no flow boundaries 4 1 2 simulation of hpt injection tests seven injection tests were performed along different vertical profiles at x 14 25 38 25 57 75 80 25 102 75 123 75 and 147 75 cm in fig 6a along each profile 51 injection tests were sequentially conducted at a constant injection flow rate of 0 5 ml s with a fixed injection interval of 1 5 cm for an injection duration of one second simulations of continuous injection tests were also performed using the groundwater flow model hgs aquanty inc 2018 for each injection test the simulated pressure head change at time 1 s since the initiation of injection at the same element was selected as the observed data by hpt surveys during field hpt surveys water injection and probe advancement rates fluctuated due to changes in the permeability of surrounding sediments figs 1d and 5c these two kinds of measurements were treated to be constant values here and the impact of the probe including its geometry on the k field was also ignored to simplify the analysis unlike the field hpt survey where injection pressure was recorded we simulated the pressure head changes δh at the injection element to represent the pressure changes caused by continuous water injection the simulated δh logs for seven hpt surveys were plotted in fig s2 compared to injection rates and pressure data obtained at the ncrs a smaller injection rate was utilized resulting in induced pressure head changes that were less than 12 cm in the low k layers and less than 3 cm near the top and bottom boundaries figs 7 and s2 such an experimental setting on one hand was due to the small size of the synthetic aquifer and on the other hand was intended to reduce potential impacts of boundary conditions on simulated pressure head changes 4 1 3 hydraulic tomography surveys after generating the reference k field cross hole pumping tests were simulated at eight ports ports 2 5 14 17 26 29 44 and 47 in fig 6b with a constant withdrawal rate of 5 0 ml min for 200 min to simulate ht surveys during each pumping test steady state head data were obtained at 47 observation ports other than the pumping well two scenarios of different pumping and observation densities were considered for the ssht analyses as indicated in fig 6b showing the pumping and observation locations in scenario 1 eight pumping tests ports 2 5 14 17 26 29 44 and 47 each having 47 observation data were selected to show the results of ssht analysis with high data density in scenario 2 the number of pumping tests and observation data was reduced to four ports 14 17 26 and 29 and 23 respectively to show the impact of sparse data density on ssht these four pumping ports were located in the central area which were consistent with the pumping observation density setting in scenario 1 and less affected by the constant head boundaries prescribed at the top as well as left and right sides of the modeling domain in total 376 and 92 data points were selected for model calibrations respectively this large amount of data reduction will also require less financial efforts as well as less computational resources and equipment for field ht implementations meanwhile additional cross hole pumping tests were simulated at 16 locations as denoted in fig 6b to produce steady state pumping test data which will be utilized for model validation of reconstructed k tomograms by the ht analyses 4 2 calibration results of hpt injection tests 4 2 1 inverse modeling of hpt data calibrations of the sequential injection tests from seven hpt surveys in the synthetic aquifer were also performed by coupling hgs aquanty inc 2018 with pest doherty 2015 the run time was 4 7 h to 6 h for the sequential calibration of 51 injection tests of each hpt survey following the calibration approach introduced in section 3 2 the synthetic aquifer was also treated as homogeneous and isotropic during the inverse analysis of hpt injection test data the simulated versus observed head changes for the 357 injection tests were plotted in fig 7 and the linear fit results were also shown generally by calibrating k to one observation data from each injection test the head changes induced by water injections could be well simulated with both values of the slope of the linear model and the coefficient of determination r2 equalling 1 due to the use of noise free injection data for model calibration the k values estimated through the inverse modeling of different hpt surveys were plotted in fig 8 as blue squares while the values extracted from the reference k field fig 6a were jointly shown as black squares for comparisons in fig 8 we see that the estimated k values generally matched the reference profiles in terms of distribution patterns of the high and low values however the k estimates of the inverse modeling approach for the low k layers are overestimated such as along hpt1 hpt2 and hpt3 of fig 8 the estimated k values also showed no obvious intralayer variations for low k layers in addition matches between estimated and reference k values in low k layers were also less consistent than matches for high k layers the relatively smooth variations in k profiles could also be attributed to treating the synthetic aquifer as homogeneous for inverse modeling which ignored the impact of aquifer heterogeneity near the injection well on pressure head changes more quantitative assessments of the simulated and reference k values are discussed in subsequent sections 4 2 2 geostatistical analysis of hpt inverted k the geostatistical parameters of the 357 k estimates from the inverse modeling of seven hpt surveys was calculated for the 2d domain and compared to the reference k field 5 508 values as listed in table 1 the geometric means kg and variances σ 2 lnk were calculated directly from the raw dataset while the correlation lengths were estimated by fitting the experimental variogram to an exponential variogram model as shown in fig s3 compared to the geostatistical parameters of the reference k field estimated k values have a higher geometric mean and a lower σ 2 lnk suggesting the less accurate characterization of low k layers and insufficient characterization of k variability by the inverse modeling approach the estimated k values also had larger correlation lengths in x and z directions than the reference field the fitted variogram based on 357 point scale estimates of k from inverse modeling of hpt data was then utilized for kriging fig 9 using the same grid as the reference k field compared to the reference k field in fig 6a the kriged k field captured major features of k heterogeneity although the results were smoothed specifically the low and high k layer distribution patterns featured in fig 6a were generally captured by the kriged k field although the low k layers were not as clearly reconstructed as shown in the reference field meanwhile the sharp boundaries layer continuity and juxtapositional tendencies of low k layers were generally missing from the kriged field the performance of this kriged field was further evaluated as prior information for the ssht analysis which is described next 4 3 steady state hydraulic tomography ssht survey results 4 3 1 geostatistical inversion of ht data inverse modeling of steady state pumping test data from different ssht scenarios were performed with the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code xiang et al 2009 simsle is a geostatistics based code which treats the natural logarithm of k as a stochastic process groundwater flow in the saturated aquifer is modeled through the stochastic conditional mean approach e g yeh et al 1996 one important advantage of simsle is that data sets are used simultaneously instead of sequentially to constrain the inverse problem xiang et al 2009 simsle first uses cokriging based on available hydraulic property data and observed head data to generate an estimate of aquifer hydraulic properties during this step the unconditional mean and spatial covariance function of hydraulic parameters are assumed to be known a priori for cokriging purposes in this study we selected the exponential covariance model for the estimated parameter field this estimated parameter field is then updated iteratively by simsle using head differences between observed and simulated heads the iterative process continues until the difference between two consecutively estimated hydraulic parameter fields or the largest head difference between simulated and observed is smaller than a user specified tolerance for the inversion of ssht data simsle requires initial guesses of the estimated parameter as well as corresponding variances and correlation scales as inputs for the first cokriged parameter field the initial guesses were set as k 6 27 10 2 cm s σ2 lnk 0 6 λx 32 2 cm and λz 7 9 cm where all were obtained from the geostatistical analysis of hpt inverted k three cases were considered for the geostatistical inversions of ssht data to characterize the k field to show the impact of data density on the geostatistical inversion approach as well as the usefulness of hpt inverted k values in improving the characterization of the heterogeneous k field by ssht in case 1 we used the pressure head data selected from 8 pumping tests ports 2 5 14 17 26 29 44 and 47 with each having 47 observation data in case 2 pressure head data were selected from four pumping tests ports 14 17 26 and 29 and 23 observation ports for both cases 1 and 2 simsle started with a uniform k distribution as an initial guess in case 3 the dataset utilized for model calibration of ssht was kept the same as in case 2 while the estimated k field in fig 9 was used as the prior mean field for the ssht analysis 4 3 2 case 1 fig s4a showed the simulated versus observed drawdowns from case 1 that utilized eight pumping tests for model calibration with simsle we provide the corresponding linear model fit a 45 degree line and r2 values on each subplot examination of fig s4a revealed that the highly parameterized geostatistical model case 1 was calibrated quite well with a high r2 value of 0 997 with a small bias and scatter as indicated by low l1 and l2 values fig 10 a showed the distribution of estimated k tomogram for case 1 examination of fig 10a revealed that the six low k values featured in the reference k distribution fig 6a were well captured although the thicknesses as well as connectivity of each layer were different from those in fig 6a comparisons between the estimated and reference log10 k values showed an r2 of 0 514 fig 10d suggesting that the estimated tomogram was a reasonable estimate of the reference k field visual examination of the k tomogram fig 10a also revealed that high k values were better reconstructed than low k values as indicated by the general overestimation of low k values compared to fig 6a sharp boundaries clearly shown in fig 6a were smoothed in fig 10a suggesting for the need of further efforts to improve the characterization of low k zones with ht alone starting with a homogeneous k distribution as an initial guess 4 3 3 case 2 the issue of reducing the number of observation data as well as pumping locations has been previously investigated by cardiff et al 2013 and illman et al 2015 they found that as the number of pumping and observation locations was progressively reduced for ht surveys there was a significant loss of heterogeneity details in the reconstructed hydraulic parameter fields which subsequently led to the reduced performance in predicting independent pumping tests in case 2 the number of pumping and observation ports used for ssht analysis as shown in fig 10b was only one half of those in case 1 results shown in figs s3b 10b and 10e suggested that although four pumping tests were calibrated quite well several important features were missed in the estimated k tomogram for case 2 fig 10b specifically the low k layer as clearly shown in the lower left area of the reference k field fig 6a and partially reconstructed in case 1 fig 10a was completely missed due to the reduced pumping and observation data density the scatterplot of reference versus estimated log10 k also showed a lowered r2 value of 0 264 compared to performance metrics for case 1 fig 10d meanwhile the continuity and shape of high and low k layers in fig 10b also became less clear compared to those in figs 6a and 10a incorrect identification of these high and low k features would lead to biased predictions of solute plumes and transport paths which were found to be very sensitive to the presence of low k lenses as well as fast flow channels zheng et al 2011 bianchi and zheng 2016 4 3 4 case 3 the above presented two baseline ssht cases showing the impact of reducing data density on geostatistical inversion could potentially lower the efficiency of field implementations of ht techniques at environmental remediation sites cho et al 2020 in this regard the in situ information on k of surficial sediments provided by the hpt technique could be used as the complementary information for the high resolution characterization of k fields by ssht therefore to evaluate the potential benefits of integrating hpt inverted k profiles into ssht the k distribution obtained through kriging in fig 9 was used as the prior mean distribution for the ssht which was then calibrated by simsle to 92 observation pressure head data selected from four pumping tests fig s4c showed the simulated versus observed drawdowns for the calibration of four pumping tests the linear fit results were the same as those of case 2 in terms of the slope intercept and r2 while the l1 and l2 norms were slightly smaller for case 3 in fig s4c however the reconstructed k tomogram of case 3 fig 10c showed significant improvements compared to the one of case 2 fig 10b specifically the low k layers were more clearly captured in fig 10c than in fig 10b and the lower left low k layer has also emerged fig 10c the linear fit metrics in fig 10f between reference versus estimated log10 k values also significantly improved than those in fig 10e and are very close to those metrics in fig 10d which were obtained by ssht using observation data from eight pumping tests these results are quite encouraging as these improvements suggested the great potential of integrating hpt inverted k profiles in future ht surveys conducted in surficial aquifer systems we also plotted the kriged k values against the reference k values in fig 10f as gray solid squares to show the benefits of model calibration with ssht in fig 10f we observe that kriged k values showed obvious bias for both high and low k zones when comparing the interpolated versus reference values on a pixel by pixel basis after calibrating the initial k field to 92 pressure head data the over and under estimation of k values were significantly improved for example the high k zones shown in lower right region of fig 9 were more reasonably reconstructed in fig 10c these results suggested that although the kriged k field could provide useful information regarding the general pattern of k heterogeneity calibration by ssht analysis was necessary to reliably capture the fine scale details of heterogeneity in the k tomogram previously ht based on geostatistical inversion approaches had been extensively validated through field studies as an effective technique for high resolution site characterization of both porous e g bohling et al 2007 berg and illman 2011b cardiff et al 2013 zhao and illman 2018 luo et al 2022 and fractured geologic media zha et al 2016 wang et al 2016 fischer et al 2020 compared to the laborious well drilling installation and conducting pumping injection tests for ht analyses results from our synthetic experimental study has shown that the integration of hpt data to ssht analysis could be quite powerful for small scale site characterization purposes due to its high efficiency in hpt data collection 4 4 impact of integrating hpt inverted k values into ssht in order to further examine the impact of using fig 9 as the prior mean k field for ssht analyses k values were extracted from cases 1 3 figs 10a to 10c along seven locations where hpt surveys were conducted the corresponding reference k values were also jointly plotted on fig 11 as black squares to provide direct evaluation of all three cases as seen in fig 11 the calibration case 1 to eight pumping tests produced k values that closely followed the variation patterns of all seven profiles suggesting the robust performance of the ssht analysis based on the geostatistical inversion approach when relatively sufficient data were available by reducing the number of pumping and observation locations to one half of case 1 k profiles estimated by case 2 showed large differences compared to reference values as indicated by the red curves in fig 11 generally the red curves became smoother for nearly all seven profiles with larger mismatches to low k ranges for hpt3 and hpt6 or incorrectly estimated as high k values for low k layers in hpt1 hpt2 and hpt7 this loss of heterogeneity detail captured by ssht could be attributed to the sparse observation density in the vertical direction for case 2 these results are also in concert with the conclusion reached by wen et al 2020 that new observation well locations would bring additional non redundant information needed by model calibration of ht in order to reveal improved details of aquifer heterogeneity by using the kriged k field as a prior mean field for the ssht analysis we found that the correspondences between the estimated k profiles in case 3 green curves and reference k values were significantly improved fig 11 for example along hpt3 the estimated k profile green curve in case 3 matched to the low and high k values much better than the red curve in case 2 meanwhile we also found that the green curves showed more consistent matches with reference k values even than the blue curves of case 1 at some depths showing sharp changes in k values such as for those k values from 25 to 35 cm above the bottom of model domain along hpt1 and from 35 to 45 cm above the bottom of model domain along hpt4 although these improvements could have been potentially obtained through the use of denser observation locations in the field the centimeter resolution probing by the hpt would be a more cost effective and reliable option to provide this kind of complementary information mccall and christy 2010 borden et al 2021 we next assessed the performance of k fields estimated by three ssht cases in predicting pumping tests not used in model calibration efforts scatterplots in fig 12 showed that with a reduced number of pumping and observation data for model calibration case 2 obviously performed worse in drawdown predictions of independent pumping tests than those in case 1 and further integration of the kriged k field into simsle yielded improved prediction performances although not as good as those in fig 12a for case 1 overall our two dimensional synthetic study reveals that improvements to ssht analysis are obtained by including hpt inverted k as prior distributions for geostatistical inverse models when abundant drawdown data and pumping tests are not available 5 summary and conclusions high resolution characterization of k fields in surficial aquifers consisting of unconsolidated sediments through the direct push based hpt technique and geostatistically based ht have been conducted separately over the last two decades to provide improved understanding of subsurface heterogeneity however empirical models relating hpt measurements to k profiles were developed through upscaling the centimeter resolution hpt data to k estimates from collocated areas by other approaches if there were any mccall and christy 2010 liu et al 2012 otherwise empirical formulae developed for other sites may be used directly for convenience which can provide biased k estimates sun et al 2022 the performance of geostatistically based ht technique on the other hand will require a sufficient amount of pumping test data to satisfactorily reconstruct the heterogeneous hydraulic parameter fields to address these issues we have investigated the usefulness of the inverse modeling approach by coupling hgs aquanty inc 2018 with pest doherty 2015 to directly estimate k values from high resolution data of hpt surveys recently conducted at the highly heterogeneous aquifer aquitard system of the ncrs based on the estimated k values a site specific formula was developed and the new formula was validated with a separate hpt survey at the ncrs then numerical experiments in a two dimensional synthetic aquifer were conducted to evaluate the benefits of integrating hpt inverted k values for ssht analyses based on the geostatistical inversion approach the results of our study led to the following major findings and conclusions 1 through conceptualizing the hpt injection logging as continuous injection tests the inverse modeling approach by coupling hgs aquanty inc 2018 with pest doherty 2015 provided k values that matched better with vertical variation patterns of k estimates from permeameter tests than those computed with the empirical formula provided by mccall and christy 2010 2 the hpt injection logging profiles were well calibrated by the inverse modeling approach for data in relatively high permeability sediments such as silt sandy silt sand and sand and gravel whereas inverse modeling of hpt data measured from low permeability clay sediments yielded poor matches for pressure changes where the injection flow rates were less than 1 0 ml s despite these poor matching results hpt inverted k estimates showed improved matches with k measurements from permeameter tests for the bottom low permeability clay layer where k values exceeded the lower boundary defined for the empirical formula by mccall and christy 2010 3 a new power law relationship was developed for the ncrs through fitting the hpt inverted k values in the well calibrated dataset group 1 in fig 2 with corresponding ratios of qinj pc from the hpt3 survey which yielded a r2 value of 0 98 for the fitted model this new formula produced an improved correspondence between predicted k values for the hpt6 2 survey and the k estimates from permeameter tests for the collocated cmt3 well these results suggested the validity of the site specific formula when applied to a separate hpt survey at the ncrs further studies are necessary to examine whether this new formula will produce robust k estimates at other hpt survey locations throughout the ncrs 4 numerical experiments in a two dimensional synthetic aquifer showed that when injection logging data from a hpt survey were well calibrated the inverse modeling approach captured the vertical variation patterns of the reference k field while tending to overestimate k values for low k layers when the heterogeneous aquifer is treated to be homogeneous by integrating the inverted k values for the synthetic hpt surveys ssht analysis with low data density four pumping tests each with 23 observation data performed comparable to the case with high data density eight pumping tests each with 47 observation data in terms of reconstructing the reference k field as well as predictions of independent pumping tests used for validation more importantly the k field estimated through the integration of hpt inverted k into the ssht analysis better defined sharp layer boundaries of both low and high k units than ssht relying only on pressure head information 5 overall our results showed that the inverse modeling approach by coupling hgs aquanty inc 2018 with pest doherty 2015 could be a better approach of providing more reliable k estimates for the development of a site specific relationship for the hpt technique without using additional k measurements to upscale the centimeter resolution to a coarser scale by other approaches findings from our field and synthetic study are encouraging for the joint implementations of hpt and ssht in the future nevertheless additional research efforts are needed in developing an optimized spatial sampling strategy for ht when hpt information is provided as well as refining k estimates from hpt injection logging data in low permeability sediments lessoff et al 2010 händel dietrich 2012 such as for the clay layers at the ncrs with a mean k of 1 0 10 8 m s to gain a better understanding of the reliability of k estimates through the inverse modeling approach for hpt survey data credit authorship contribution statement zhanfeng zhao

3066,direct push based hydraulic profiling tool hpt and geostatistically based hydraulic tomography ht are two promising techniques for the high resolution estimation of hydraulic conductivity k for unconsolidated sediments although hpt surveys could be conducted rapidly relating the 1 5 cm resolution injection logging profiles to k always involve the upscaling of centimeter scale measurements to coarser intervals for the development of site specific formulae on the other hand k fields reconstructed by ht could be smooth when pumping test data are sparse in this study an inverse modeling approach was firstly utilized to estimate k values directly from hpt survey data for the glaciofluvial deposits at the north campus research site ncrs in waterloo ontario canada a site specific power law relationship was generated for the ncrs to relate hpt profiles to the vertical distributions of k then the proposed inverse modeling approach was evaluated with a two dimensional synthetic aquifer under controlled conditions and the estimated k profiles from inverse analysis of synthetic hpt surveys were incorporated into the steady state ht results of the field study showed that k estimates from the developed formula corresponded better with k values from permeameter tests than those estimated from the empirical model of mccall and christy 2010 for hpt surveys moreover through synthetic experiments we demonstrated that integration of k values inverted from hpt into steady state ht analyses yielded k tomograms that were significantly better than the geostatistical inversion results relying on pumping test data alone overall this study highlights the need in developing site specific formulae for the hpt and the joint implementation of hpt and ht techniques for the more cost effective high resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity keywords subsurface heterogeneity hydraulic conductivity hydraulic profiling tool inverse modeling hydraulic tomography model calibration and validation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate descriptions of hydraulic conductivity k distributions have long been acknowledged as critical for groundwater flow and contaminant transport related issues gelhar 1986 carrera et al 2005 sudicky et al 2010 foster et al 2021 to obtain high resolution estimates of k fields numerous efforts are frequently required by traditional field and laboratory approaches such as slug tests flowmeter tests and core sample analyses e g zheng et al 2011 over the last two decades direct push dp e g soo et al 2000 butler et al 2002 borden et al 2021 and hydraulic tomography ht e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 luo et al 2020 have been widely validated as promising techniques for the high resolution characterization of aquifer systems compared to the conventional site characterization approaches dp based techniques have the great advantages of higher speed and lower financial cost thus facilitating high density measurements along vertical profiles in surficial unconsolidated sediments e g dietrich et al 2008 maliva 2016 a variety of dp based techniques have been developed for aquifer characterization see maliva 2016 for a recent summary specifically the hydraulic profiling tool hpt was developed to probe in situ soil permeability at a vertical resolution of 1 5 cm geoprobe 2007 bohling et al 2016 during hpt surveys water is injected at a relatively constant flow rate while advancing the tool and recording injection rates and pressures these hpt measurements can then be utilized to infer k profiles through various approaches for example mccall and christy 2010 proposed an empiricial relationship for hpt to convert injection flow rates and pressure profiles to k through compiling hpt and slug test data from seven field sites in central united states lessoff et al 2010 developed a site specific empirical relationship for a dp injection logging dpil survey one of the built in modules of hpt to infer k values after relating dpil logs to k estimates from dp slug tests at the lauswiesen field test site in germany with a radial vertical finite difference flow model liu et al 2009 and bohling et al 2012 adopted the model calibration approach to estimate coefficients for empirical models which converted dpil measurements to k estimates at the made site by minimizing the differences between observed and simulated pressure responses of dp permeameter tests most recently borden et al 2021 developed a physically based equation through numerical modeling analyses of hpt surveys although field evaluations confirmed that the above relationships produced k values that generally matched estimates from other approaches e g borden et al 2021 lessoff et al 2010 mccall et al 2014 recent hpt studies at the highly heterogeneous north campus research site ncrs waterloo canada revealed that the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 yielded k estimates that are about one order of magnitude higher than those from permeameter tests for low permeability sediments sun et al 2022 such a discrepancy suggested for the need in developing site specific empiricial relationships like those by liu et al 2009 and mccall and christy 2010 which however require additional field efforts in collecting k estimates from nearby locations by other approaches alternatively inverse modeling approaches similar to the one proposed by bohling et al 2016 which solely relied on hpt measurements could be adopted to estimate k profiles other than the work of bohling et al 2016 at the made site no other studies have evaluated the usefulness of the inverse modeling approach based solely on hpt measurements to estimate k therefore the first purpose of the current study is to investigate this research gap through the inverse modeling of data from a field hpt survey by sun et al 2022 at the ncrs under field conditions ht as one robust approach for the high resolution mapping of subsurface heterogeneity e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 has also been extensively validated through synthetic e g zhu et al 2009 mao et al 2016 tsai et

surveys hydraulic response transient or steady state data observed at different locations during multiple pumping or injection tests are jointly interpreted and high resolution k and or ss fields are obtained when sufficient observation data are utilized cardiff et al 2013 and illman et al 2015 found that with sparse observation data density ht captured fewer details in estimated k fields some researchers proposed the fusion of various types of information with pressure head data to improve the performance of ht for example through the inclusion of flux measurements li et al 2008 zha et al 2014 pouladi et al 2021 geological information zhao et al 2016 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2018 geophysical data yeh et al 2008 soueid ahmed et al 2016 tracer test data yeh and zhu 2007 zhu et al 2009 lee and kitanidis 2014 and permeameter data berg and illman 2015 zhao and illman 2018 based on spatial cross correlation analysis zha et al 2014 found that flux measurements carried non redundant information about subsurface heterogeneity and joint interpretation of pressure head and flux measurements yielded an estimated k field with higher resolution zhao and illman 2018 concluded that using geological data as prior information for ht preserved geological features connectivity in k heterogeneity patterns lee and kitanidis 2014 found a clear improvement of estimated transmissivity fields in terms of the small scale features when tracer test data was utilized with pressure heads for ht inversions during a ht study at the ncrs berg and illman 2015 showed that conditioning the k tomogram with permeameter k data helped the geostatistical inversion model in identifying low k zones with improved results obtained for ht surveys illman 2014 and the above studies called for the need for data integration to further improve results from ht through field evaluations of both ht and dp based approaches bohling et al 2007 reported that k estimates from ht compared well with those from direct push permeameter tests sanchez león et al 2016 showed that dpil profiles revealed more vertical variation features than the k tomogram reconstructed by ht based on the pilot point method given the high efficiency in data acquisition by the hpt technique over other site characterization approaches the high vertical resolution of k values inferred from hpt surveys could potentially be one important additional data source for ht so far the usefulness of one dimensional k profiles obtained from hpt for ht surveys has not been examined in detail therefore another purpose of the current study is to further evaluate the usefulness of integrating hpt inferred k profiles into steady state hydraulic tomography ssht for high resolution characterization of spatially heterogeneous k fields in this study we first investigated the performance of an inverse modeling approach in estimating high resolution k from a single hpt survey at the ncrs by coupling the groundwater flow model hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2018 with the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 then a site specific formula was developed for the ncrs based on the estimated k and hpt survey data the formula was then validated through site data obtained from a separate hpt survey at the ncrs next numerical experiments were conducted in a small scale multi layered two dimensional aquifer system to evaluate the inverse modeling approach under controlled conditions geostatistical inversion models were then utilized to evaluate the benefits of integrating k values estimated from hpt profiles for ssht analyses based on pumping test data of different pumping and observation densities findings from this study add further insights into integrating data from hpt and ht techniques 2 hpt at the ncrs the ncrs is situated at the north campus of the university of waterloo waterloo canada over the last forty years extensive research and teaching activities were carried out to advance the understanding of surficial geology and hydrogeology of this highly heterogeneous site karrow 1979 robertson et al 2000 alexander et al 2011 sun et al 2022 recently from july 30th and august 1st of 2019 11 hpt surveys were conducted by sun et al 2022 to probe the subsurface heterogeneity to an approximate depth of 17 mbgs using the hpt model k6050 geoprobe fig 1 a shows the plan view of well locations at the ncrs and hpt surveys site investigations reported that the ncrs consists of alternating layers of glaciofluvial deposits which belong to the waterloo moraine karrow 1979 sebol 2000 an aquifer layer is located approximately 8 to 13 m below the ground surface and is composed mainly of sand sandy silt and sandy gravel alexander et al 2011 zhao and illman 2018 situated above and below the aquifer layer are low permeability silt and clay layers fig 1b during the advancement of hpt probe into ncrs sediments water was continuously injected through a screen 1 cm in diameter installed on the side of the hpt probe water pressure flow rate as well as electrical conductivity ec over time were recorded at a 1 5 cm vertical interval due to the highly heterogeneous nature of ncrs sediments the hpt probe was advanced with a minimum rate of around 0 2 mm s in the low k layers and at a maximum rate of about 5 cm s in the high k units at selected depths with low water injection pressures dissipation tests were conducted to measure the hydrostatic pressure in the tested formation water pressure was measured by the hpt pressure sensor installed inside the probe and closely behind the injection screen while the injection rate qinj was measured on ground surface the measured pressure is a combination of hydrostatic pressure atmospheric pressure water injection pressure and pressure caused by probe advancement borden et al 2021 usually after accounting for atmospheric and hydrostatic pressures the corrected pressure pc was utilized to represent water injection pressure to estimate k assuming the pressure generated by probe advancement is negligible mccall and christy 2010 following the same assumptions we selected the hpt3 survey closely located with the cmt1 well for the current study and to facilitate the comparison with existing site data to obtain the local hydrostatic pressures for the hpt3 survey four dissipation tests were conducted at depths of 4 18 4 47 10 41 and 11 22 m the calculated pc values were shown in fig 1c the qinj profile was plotted in fig 1d to show the changes in injection flow rates caused by the subsurface heterogeneity of ncrs the light blue shaded zones in figs 1c and 1d indicate the identified high permeability layers based on the fuzzy clustering analysis of the hpt3 pc profile by zhao and illman 2022a 3 inverse modeling of hpt data from the ncrs 3 1 groundwater flow model to simulate the profiling processes of the hpt3 survey water injection logging by the hpt probe was conceptualized as a series of single hole injection tests by continuously shifting the injection position at an interval of 1 5 cm from the top to the bottom of the surveyed profile for each simulated injection test in the model the water injection duration was determined from the continuous injection process of the hpt survey at the ncrs and varied from test to test depending on the time interval between current and previous hpt measurements in this way the downward advancement of the hpt survey was mimicked the transient injection tests were simulated with the groundwater flow model hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2018 which is versatile in model settings and could be flexibly customized to match various hpt scenarios in the field a groundwater water flow model with dimensions of 15 m 15 m 19 m in x y and z directions fig 1a was constructed to simulate water injection pressure obtained by sequential water injections the modeling domain was discretized into 181 944 rectangular elements and 191 748 nodes to represent the 1 5 cm vertical resolution of hpt measurements at the ncrs and to maintain computational efficiency an injection test based gridding scheme was developed and adopted to discretize the 15 m 15 m 19 m modeling domain specifically for the injection test at a certain depth the grid length in the z direction was gradually refined from 1 5 m at the top and bottom boundary to 1 5 cm as approaching the injection well and to 0 1 cm near the injection well the computational grid in the z direction was updated after shifting the injection position downward by 1 5 cm the grid sizes in the x and y directions were gradually refined from 2 m 2 m at the four outside boundaries to 0 1 cm 0 1 cm at the hpt survey location and kept constant during all injection tests of the hpt3 survey fig s1 meanwhile to account for the impact of the hpt probe 4 45 cm in diameter on k fields at the fine scale the probe was built in as a low permeability zone with a fixed k value of 1 0 10 12 m s 3 2 calibration approach inverse modeling of the hpt survey data was performed by coupling the groundwater flow model hgs aquanty inc 2018 with the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 during the calibration of each injection test the aquifer was treated to be homogeneous and isotropic the impact of ss variability on water injection pressure measurements was ignored which is consistent with one of the underlying assumptions of the hpt technique to estimate k liu et al 2012 through synthetic experiments borden et al 2021 reported that ss did not show a measurable impact on pc values when k was varied from 1 0 10 7 m s to 1 0 10 4 m s therefore for the current study only the effective k value was estimated by the inverse modeling of hpt survey data and a constant value of 9 3 10 6 m was adopted from zhao and illman 2018 for ss in hgs there are 850 pairs of measurements for each of the pc and qinj profiles in the hpt3 survey as suggested by liu et al 2012 the flow measurement is not considered to be accurate for qinj less than 10 ml min in low k sediments we therefore excluded 80 data pairs below this flow range for each injection test only one injection pressure data was recorded by the hpt survey as stated earlier the corrected water pressure pc represented the pressure generated by water injection to facilitate the calibration of the groundwater model water pressure was converted to head and pressure head change δ h was calculated from pc to represent the change in pressure caused by water injection k values were iteratively estimated by calibrations of an effective parameter groundwater model by minimizing an objective function that represented the squared residual between simulated and observed pressure head changes the optimization process converged when the lowest four objective function values were within a relative distance of 0 01 defined as 1 φ i φ min φ i 0 01 where фi is the objective function value at the end of the ith optimization iteration фmin is the lowest objective function achieved during the final four i e ith to the i 3 th optimization iterations we assessed the fits between simulated and observed pressure head changes for model calibrations through scatterplots and calculated the mean absolute error l1 and mean square error l2 for each injection test to further evaluate the fit between observed and simulated pressure head changes these quantities were computed as 2 l 1 1 n i 1 n δ h i δ h i 3 l 2 1 n i 1 n δ h i δ h i 2 where n is the total number of pressure head change data i indicates the data number δ h i and δ h i are the converted and simulated pressure head changes respectively in the following discussion both l1 and l2 norms are presented as the latter better assesses the large discrepancies of model calibrations 3 3 high resolution k estimates for the hpt3 survey at ncrs calibrations of the sequential injection tests from the hpt3 survey were performed on a personal computer equipped with 12 processors with 16 gb of ram the run time was about 72 h for the sequential calibration of 770 injection tests for future field implementations of this inversion approach with a large number of hpt data model calibration runs with a parallel environment would greatly reduce the computational time cost we first assessed the quality of model calibration by comparing the 770 simulated pressure head changes δh with those converted from the pc values obtained from the hpt3 survey as shown in fig 2 two groups of data were identified from fig 2 based on the differences between converted δh δhcon and simulated δh δhsim with data points in a well matched group group 1 following the 1 1 line indicating a near perfect match while data points from the poorly matched group group 2 showing under estimations of the converted δh values the differences between δhcon and δhsim in group 2 are generally larger than 1 0 m while differences in group 1 are no more than 0 4 m performance metrics showed that the l1 and l2 values of group 2 are four and seven orders of magnitude higher than those of group 1 respectively to examine the cause of this discrepancy we refer to fig 3 a which shows the vertical distribution of residual pc values converted from pressure head change data δhcon δhsim data examination of data locations in group 2 suggested that these data are obtained from 8 0 to 9 0 m and below 5 0 m above the bottom of the domain in fig 3a corresponding with low permeability sediments showing high pc values in fig 1c additional explanations of the poor matches in group 2 are provided subsequently in a later section the 770 k values estimated through calibrating the hpt3 survey data were shown in fig 3b in fig 3b group 1 data were shown as blue squares while group 2 data were shown as red squares we also jointly plotted the k estimates from permeameter tests of core samples collected from the collocated cmt1 well as gray squares and corresponding segmental arithmetic means of these k values as green lines in addition the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 which relates qinj pc to k values and is included in the di viewer software www geoprobe com direct image was adopted to calculate k values for the hpt3 survey referred hereafter as hpt3 mc k shown as black squares in fig 3c comparison among k estimates in figs 3b and 3c showed that the k values estimated by inverse analyses of hpt3 data referred hereafter as hpt3 inverted k for group 1 in fig 3b shared a similar variation pattern as the k values in fig 3c when k values are larger than 1 0 10 5 m s for example k estimates at depths from 12 0 to 13 5 m and from 5 5 to 7 0 m in figs 3b and 3c all suggested the existence of high permeability zones although the intralayer variation of k values are smoother in fig 3c at these two depth ranges k estimates by the two approaches were both higher than those estimated by permeameter analyses we also found some obvious differences between values of hpt3 inverted k and hpt3 mc k mostly for the depth where the hpt3 mc k was assigned a fixed value of the lower bound 3 5 10 7 m s by the di viewer software using the mccall and christy 2010 s approach from 9 5 to 11 5 m and from 7 0 to 9 5 m above the bottom of the model domain hpt3 inverted k values in group 1 varied over a range of 1 0 10 7 m s 1 0 10 5 m s which revealed more information on k variability than hpt3 mc k values below 5 0 m compared to the overestimation of k values for this low permeability zone by the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 results obtained by the inverse modeling approach showed a lower k variation range centred around the segmental arithmetic mean k value for the bottom clay layer these results suggest that the inverse modeling approach could potentially provide more accurate k estimates for low permeability sediments than the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 despite the fact that the inverse analysis approach yielded poor model calibration results for group 2 data 3 4 relationship between the hpt inverted k and the qinj pc at ncrs the overestimation of k values by the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 in fig 3c suggested the need for developing a site specific model to relate the hpt measurements to k therefore the estimated k values in fig 3b were plotted against the qinj pc data figs 1c and 1d to generate an empirical relationship for the hpt survey at hpt3 conducted at the ncrs as shown in fig 4 liu et al 2012 pointed out that for high permeability sediments with k approximately above 60 m d 6 9 10 4 m s the injection rate would be too small to produce a measurable pressure response bohling et al 2016 thus proposed a plateau function to account for the upper threshold of the hpt technique in fig 4 we plotted this upper threshold as a dashed pink line with a k value of 6 9 10 4 m s in addition the lower k boundary with a k value of 3 5 10 7 m s defined by the empiricial relationship of mccall and christy 2010 was also plotted in fig 4 as a dashed green line it is very noteworthy that there is an excellent match of our hpt3 inverted k values with a maximum value of 6 1 10 4 m s in group 1 with the upper threshold value of 6 9 10 4 m s suggested by liu et al 2012 most of the k estimates in group 1 fall in the range of 3 5 10 7 m s 6 9 10 4 m s with only several outliers shown just below the value of 3 5 10 7 m s on fig 4 we also showed a gray shaded area defined by qinj pc 1 7 10 7 m2 s and k 3 5 10 7 m s based on hpt surveys and slug test data from multiple field sites in central united states mccall and christy 2010 developed the empirical model of k 21 14 ln qinj pc 41 71 where k qinj and pc have the units of ft day ml min and psi respectively this formula showed a minimum value of 1 7 10 7 m2 s of qinj pc for the field measurements to produce non negative k therefore we use the gray shaded area to indicate qinj pc values that may produce unreliable estimates of k for the hpt survey at the ncrs for the poorly calibrated group 2 data red squares k estimates showed a substantial variation when the ratio of qinj pc was below 1 0 10 7 m2 s most of the qinj pc ratios fall within the gray shaded area suggesting the corresponding qinj and pc measurements may not be trustworthy for k estimation which could also lead to the poor matches of δhcon for group 2 data in fig 2 to gain a thorough understanding of this topic more technical evaluations are needed to systematically evaluate the reliability of qinj and pc measurements for low permeability sediments such as the ncrs clay deposits given the fact that the data points in group 2 red squares were poorly simulated by the inverse modeling approach they were not selected for the development of the relationship between qinj pc and k for the ncrs fig 4 therefore only 538 pairs of log qinj pc and log k were fitted to a linear model the best fit model as well as the coefficient of determination r2 was plotted in fig 4 in addition to account for the upper threshold of the hpt technique an upper limit of 6 9 10 4 m s was defined as suggested by liu et al 2012 therefore the following function was adopted to represent the dependence of k on qinj pc at the ncrs for this study 4 log k 1 41 log q inj p c 4 25 q inj p c 5 5 10 6 m 2 s k 6 9 10 4 m s q inj p c 5 5 10 6 m 2 s to evaluate the validity of the above relationship data from the hpt6 2 survey and the collocated cmt3 well were selected to compute k values from the hpt data as shown in fig 5 we note that four dissipation tests were conducted at depths of 4 62 5 03 11 54 and 12 13 m for the hpt6 2 survey based on the pc profile of the hpt6 2 survey fig 5b three potentially high k zones were identified by the fuzzy clustering analysis approach in zhao and illman 2022a corresponding to sand and sandy silt layers shown in fig 5a for the cmt3 well in fig 5c there was a decrease in qinj near the bottom of model domain and qinj less than 10 ml min was also abandoned during the calculation of k values figs 5d and 5e showed the estimated k profiles using the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 and eq 4 respectively k estimates from permeameter tests on core samples collected at the cmt3 well were jointly plotted as black circles and a gray line generally we found that fig 5e showed an improved match between k estimates from hpt data with k values of the permeameter tests than the match in fig 5d specifically from 1 to 4 m above the bottom of the domain the downward decreasing trend in k values was better captured in fig 5e while k values at the same locations in fig 5d were estimated as a constant value of 3 5 10 7 m s by the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 from 6 0 to 9 5 m above the bottom of the domain eq 4 also represented the vertical variations of k in surrounding sediments better than those in fig 5d as suggested by variations in qinj values and relatively constant pc values these overall improved matches clearly showed that the site specific model eq 4 developed from the hpt3 inverted k values could provide reasonable estimates for subsurface heterogeneity in k at the highly heterogeneous ncrs 4 synthetic experiments 4 1 experimental setup 4 1 1 two dimensional synthetic aquifer the inverse modeling analysis of hpt3 data yielded promising high resolution k estimates however further evaluation of these data for its direct use in groundwater flow modeling or in aquifer characterization by ht will require an extremely fine computational grid for field studies at the ncrs therefore to fulfill the goals of the current study a small scale two dimensional synthetic aquifer was constructed to evaluate the usefulness of hpt inverted k values under controlled conditions the synthetic aquifer is 161 0 cm in length 76 5 cm in height and 10 2 cm in width with 18 layers of an inter fingering pattern identical to the structure of a real sandbox constructed for solute transport experiments by illman et al 2012 fig 6 a the synthetic aquifer was discretized into 5 508 elements and 11 336 nodes with a grid length in z direction of 1 5 cm to match the vertical resolution of hpt injection tests under this experimental setting there is no need to upscale the high resolution k to a coarser grid which will sacrifice the heterogeneity details in hpt inverted k profiles for the synthetic experimental study the two dimensional synthetic aquifer was assigned with k values with a range similar to typical estimates for the sandbox constructed by illman et al 2012 the reference k field of the synthetic aquifer as shown in fig 6a was generated through 1 constructing a layered mean ln k field using values listed in table s1 2 generating a set of normally distributed random numbers with a mean of zero and a variance of 0 10 representing the perturbations of ln k to the layered mean ln k field and 3 perturbations of ln k were added to the mean ln k field and then back transformed yielding a k field with both interlayer and intralayer variability the k values of the synthetic aquifer ranged from 3 76 10 3 cm s to 3 57 10 1 cm s with a variance σ2 ln k of 0 85 and a geometric mean value of 3 85 10 2 cm s additional geostatistical parameters of the reference k field were summarized in table 1 similar to the field case in an earlier section the ss field was assumed to be homogeneous for simplicity and a value of 1 0 10 4 m was assigned to the groundwater model we set the left and right sides and top boundaries as constant head while the bottom front and back boundaries of the sandbox were set as no flow boundaries 4 1 2 simulation of hpt injection tests seven injection tests were performed along different vertical profiles at x 14 25 38 25 57 75 80 25 102 75 123 75 and 147 75 cm in fig 6a along each profile 51 injection tests were sequentially conducted at a constant injection flow rate of 0 5 ml s with a fixed injection interval of 1 5 cm for an injection duration of one second simulations of continuous injection tests were also performed using the groundwater flow model hgs aquanty inc 2018 for each injection test the simulated pressure head change at time 1 s since the initiation of injection at the same element was selected as the observed data by hpt surveys during field hpt surveys water injection and probe advancement rates fluctuated due to changes in the permeability of surrounding sediments figs 1d and 5c these two kinds of measurements were treated to be constant values here and the impact of the probe including its geometry on the k field was also ignored to simplify the analysis unlike the field hpt survey where injection pressure was recorded we simulated the pressure head changes δh at the injection element to represent the pressure changes caused by continuous water injection the simulated δh logs for seven hpt surveys were plotted in fig s2 compared to injection rates and pressure data obtained at the ncrs a smaller injection rate was utilized resulting in induced pressure head changes that were less than 12 cm in the low k layers and less than 3 cm near the top and bottom boundaries figs 7 and s2 such an experimental setting on one hand was due to the small size of the synthetic aquifer and on the other hand was intended to reduce potential impacts of boundary conditions on simulated pressure head changes 4 1 3 hydraulic tomography surveys after generating the reference k field cross hole pumping tests were simulated at eight ports ports 2 5 14 17 26 29 44 and 47 in fig 6b with a constant withdrawal rate of 5 0 ml min for 200 min to simulate ht surveys during each pumping test steady state head data were obtained at 47 observation ports other than the pumping well two scenarios of different pumping and observation densities were considered for the ssht analyses as indicated in fig 6b showing the pumping and observation locations in scenario 1 eight pumping tests ports 2 5 14 17 26 29 44 and 47 each having 47 observation data were selected to show the results of ssht analysis with high data density in scenario 2 the number of pumping tests and observation data was reduced to four ports 14 17 26 and 29 and 23 respectively to show the impact of sparse data density on ssht these four pumping ports were located in the central area which were consistent with the pumping observation density setting in scenario 1 and less affected by the constant head boundaries prescribed at the top as well as left and right sides of the modeling domain in total 376 and 92 data points were selected for model calibrations respectively this large amount of data reduction will also require less financial efforts as well as less computational resources and equipment for field ht implementations meanwhile additional cross hole pumping tests were simulated at 16 locations as denoted in fig 6b to produce steady state pumping test data which will be utilized for model validation of reconstructed k tomograms by the ht analyses 4 2 calibration results of hpt injection tests 4 2 1 inverse modeling of hpt data calibrations of the sequential injection tests from seven hpt surveys in the synthetic aquifer were also performed by coupling hgs aquanty inc 2018 with pest doherty 2015 the run time was 4 7 h to 6 h for the sequential calibration of 51 injection tests of each hpt survey following the calibration approach introduced in section 3 2 the synthetic aquifer was also treated as homogeneous and isotropic during the inverse analysis of hpt injection test data the simulated versus observed head changes for the 357 injection tests were plotted in fig 7 and the linear fit results were also shown generally by calibrating k to one observation data from each injection test the head changes induced by water injections could be well simulated with both values of the slope of the linear model and the coefficient of determination r2 equalling 1 due to the use of noise free injection data for model calibration the k values estimated through the inverse modeling of different hpt surveys were plotted in fig 8 as blue squares while the values extracted from the reference k field fig 6a were jointly shown as black squares for comparisons in fig 8 we see that the estimated k values generally matched the reference profiles in terms of distribution patterns of the high and low values however the k estimates of the inverse modeling approach for the low k layers are overestimated such as along hpt1 hpt2 and hpt3 of fig 8 the estimated k values also showed no obvious intralayer variations for low k layers in addition matches between estimated and reference k values in low k layers were also less consistent than matches for high k layers the relatively smooth variations in k profiles could also be attributed to treating the synthetic aquifer as homogeneous for inverse modeling which ignored the impact of aquifer heterogeneity near the injection well on pressure head changes more quantitative assessments of the simulated and reference k values are discussed in subsequent sections 4 2 2 geostatistical analysis of hpt inverted k the geostatistical parameters of the 357 k estimates from the inverse modeling of seven hpt surveys was calculated for the 2d domain and compared to the reference k field 5 508 values as listed in table 1 the geometric means kg and variances σ 2 lnk were calculated directly from the raw dataset while the correlation lengths were estimated by fitting the experimental variogram to an exponential variogram model as shown in fig s3 compared to the geostatistical parameters of the reference k field estimated k values have a higher geometric mean and a lower σ 2 lnk suggesting the less accurate characterization of low k layers and insufficient characterization of k variability by the inverse modeling approach the estimated k values also had larger correlation lengths in x and z directions than the reference field the fitted variogram based on 357 point scale estimates of k from inverse modeling of hpt data was then utilized for kriging fig 9 using the same grid as the reference k field compared to the reference k field in fig 6a the kriged k field captured major features of k heterogeneity although the results were smoothed specifically the low and high k layer distribution patterns featured in fig 6a were generally captured by the kriged k field although the low k layers were not as clearly reconstructed as shown in the reference field meanwhile the sharp boundaries layer continuity and juxtapositional tendencies of low k layers were generally missing from the kriged field the performance of this kriged field was further evaluated as prior information for the ssht analysis which is described next 4 3 steady state hydraulic tomography ssht survey results 4 3 1 geostatistical inversion of ht data inverse modeling of steady state pumping test data from different ssht scenarios were performed with the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code xiang et al 2009 simsle is a geostatistics based code which treats the natural logarithm of k as a stochastic process groundwater flow in the saturated aquifer is modeled through the stochastic conditional mean approach e g yeh et al 1996 one important advantage of simsle is that data sets are used simultaneously instead of sequentially to constrain the inverse problem xiang et al 2009 simsle first uses cokriging based on available hydraulic property data and observed head data to generate an estimate of aquifer hydraulic properties during this step the unconditional mean and spatial covariance function of hydraulic parameters are assumed to be known a priori for cokriging purposes in this study we selected the exponential covariance model for the estimated parameter field this estimated parameter field is then updated iteratively by simsle using head differences between observed and simulated heads the iterative process continues until the difference between two consecutively estimated hydraulic parameter fields or the largest head difference between simulated and observed is smaller than a user specified tolerance for the inversion of ssht data simsle requires initial guesses of the estimated parameter as well as corresponding variances and correlation scales as inputs for the first cokriged parameter field the initial guesses were set as k 6 27 10 2 cm s σ2 lnk 0 6 λx 32 2 cm and λz 7 9 cm where all were obtained from the geostatistical analysis of hpt inverted k three cases were considered for the geostatistical inversions of ssht data to characterize the k field to show the impact of data density on the geostatistical inversion approach as well as the usefulness of hpt inverted k values in improving the characterization of the heterogeneous k field by ssht in case 1 we used the pressure head data selected from 8 pumping tests ports 2 5 14 17 26 29 44 and 47 with each having 47 observation data in case 2 pressure head data were selected from four pumping tests ports 14 17 26 and 29 and 23 observation ports for both cases 1 and 2 simsle started with a uniform k distribution as an initial guess in case 3 the dataset utilized for model calibration of ssht was kept the same as in case 2 while the estimated k field in fig 9 was used as the prior mean field for the ssht analysis 4 3 2 case 1 fig s4a showed the simulated versus observed drawdowns from case 1 that utilized eight pumping tests for model calibration with simsle we provide the corresponding linear model fit a 45 degree line and r2 values on each subplot examination of fig s4a revealed that the highly parameterized geostatistical model case 1 was calibrated quite well with a high r2 value of 0 997 with a small bias and scatter as indicated by low l1 and l2 values fig 10 a showed the distribution of estimated k tomogram for case 1 examination of fig 10a revealed that the six low k values featured in the reference k distribution fig 6a were well captured although the thicknesses as well as connectivity of each layer were different from those in fig 6a comparisons between the estimated and reference log10 k values showed an r2 of 0 514 fig 10d suggesting that the estimated tomogram was a reasonable estimate of the reference k field visual examination of the k tomogram fig 10a also revealed that high k values were better reconstructed than low k values as indicated by the general overestimation of low k values compared to fig 6a sharp boundaries clearly shown in fig 6a were smoothed in fig 10a suggesting for the need of further efforts to improve the characterization of low k zones with ht alone starting with a homogeneous k distribution as an initial guess 4 3 3 case 2 the issue of reducing the number of observation data as well as pumping locations has been previously investigated by cardiff et al 2013 and illman et al 2015 they found that as the number of pumping and observation locations was progressively reduced for ht surveys there was a significant loss of heterogeneity details in the reconstructed hydraulic parameter fields which subsequently led to the reduced performance in predicting independent pumping tests in case 2 the number of pumping and observation ports used for ssht analysis as shown in fig 10b was only one half of those in case 1 results shown in figs s3b 10b and 10e suggested that although four pumping tests were calibrated quite well several important features were missed in the estimated k tomogram for case 2 fig 10b specifically the low k layer as clearly shown in the lower left area of the reference k field fig 6a and partially reconstructed in case 1 fig 10a was completely missed due to the reduced pumping and observation data density the scatterplot of reference versus estimated log10 k also showed a lowered r2 value of 0 264 compared to performance metrics for case 1 fig 10d meanwhile the continuity and shape of high and low k layers in fig 10b also became less clear compared to those in figs 6a and 10a incorrect identification of these high and low k features would lead to biased predictions of solute plumes and transport paths which were found to be very sensitive to the presence of low k lenses as well as fast flow channels zheng et al 2011 bianchi and zheng 2016 4 3 4 case 3 the above presented two baseline ssht cases showing the impact of reducing data density on geostatistical inversion could potentially lower the efficiency of field implementations of ht techniques at environmental remediation sites cho et al 2020 in this regard the in situ information on k of surficial sediments provided by the hpt technique could be used as the complementary information for the high resolution characterization of k fields by ssht therefore to evaluate the potential benefits of integrating hpt inverted k profiles into ssht the k distribution obtained through kriging in fig 9 was used as the prior mean distribution for the ssht which was then calibrated by simsle to 92 observation pressure head data selected from four pumping tests fig s4c showed the simulated versus observed drawdowns for the calibration of four pumping tests the linear fit results were the same as those of case 2 in terms of the slope intercept and r2 while the l1 and l2 norms were slightly smaller for case 3 in fig s4c however the reconstructed k tomogram of case 3 fig 10c showed significant improvements compared to the one of case 2 fig 10b specifically the low k layers were more clearly captured in fig 10c than in fig 10b and the lower left low k layer has also emerged fig 10c the linear fit metrics in fig 10f between reference versus estimated log10 k values also significantly improved than those in fig 10e and are very close to those metrics in fig 10d which were obtained by ssht using observation data from eight pumping tests these results are quite encouraging as these improvements suggested the great potential of integrating hpt inverted k profiles in future ht surveys conducted in surficial aquifer systems we also plotted the kriged k values against the reference k values in fig 10f as gray solid squares to show the benefits of model calibration with ssht in fig 10f we observe that kriged k values showed obvious bias for both high and low k zones when comparing the interpolated versus reference values on a pixel by pixel basis after calibrating the initial k field to 92 pressure head data the over and under estimation of k values were significantly improved for example the high k zones shown in lower right region of fig 9 were more reasonably reconstructed in fig 10c these results suggested that although the kriged k field could provide useful information regarding the general pattern of k heterogeneity calibration by ssht analysis was necessary to reliably capture the fine scale details of heterogeneity in the k tomogram previously ht based on geostatistical inversion approaches had been extensively validated through field studies as an effective technique for high resolution site characterization of both porous e g bohling et al 2007 berg and illman 2011b cardiff et al 2013 zhao and illman 2018 luo et al 2022 and fractured geologic media zha et al 2016 wang et al 2016 fischer et al 2020 compared to the laborious well drilling installation and conducting pumping injection tests for ht analyses results from our synthetic experimental study has shown that the integration of hpt data to ssht analysis could be quite powerful for small scale site characterization purposes due to its high efficiency in hpt data collection 4 4 impact of integrating hpt inverted k values into ssht in order to further examine the impact of using fig 9 as the prior mean k field for ssht analyses k values were extracted from cases 1 3 figs 10a to 10c along seven locations where hpt surveys were conducted the corresponding reference k values were also jointly plotted on fig 11 as black squares to provide direct evaluation of all three cases as seen in fig 11 the calibration case 1 to eight pumping tests produced k values that closely followed the variation patterns of all seven profiles suggesting the robust performance of the ssht analysis based on the geostatistical inversion approach when relatively sufficient data were available by reducing the number of pumping and observation locations to one half of case 1 k profiles estimated by case 2 showed large differences compared to reference values as indicated by the red curves in fig 11 generally the red curves became smoother for nearly all seven profiles with larger mismatches to low k ranges for hpt3 and hpt6 or incorrectly estimated as high k values for low k layers in hpt1 hpt2 and hpt7 this loss of heterogeneity detail captured by ssht could be attributed to the sparse observation density in the vertical direction for case 2 these results are also in concert with the conclusion reached by wen et al 2020 that new observation well locations would bring additional non redundant information needed by model calibration of ht in order to reveal improved details of aquifer heterogeneity by using the kriged k field as a prior mean field for the ssht analysis we found that the correspondences between the estimated k profiles in case 3 green curves and reference k values were significantly improved fig 11 for example along hpt3 the estimated k profile green curve in case 3 matched to the low and high k values much better than the red curve in case 2 meanwhile we also found that the green curves showed more consistent matches with reference k values even than the blue curves of case 1 at some depths showing sharp changes in k values such as for those k values from 25 to 35 cm above the bottom of model domain along hpt1 and from 35 to 45 cm above the bottom of model domain along hpt4 although these improvements could have been potentially obtained through the use of denser observation locations in the field the centimeter resolution probing by the hpt would be a more cost effective and reliable option to provide this kind of complementary information mccall and christy 2010 borden et al 2021 we next assessed the performance of k fields estimated by three ssht cases in predicting pumping tests not used in model calibration efforts scatterplots in fig 12 showed that with a reduced number of pumping and observation data for model calibration case 2 obviously performed worse in drawdown predictions of independent pumping tests than those in case 1 and further integration of the kriged k field into simsle yielded improved prediction performances although not as good as those in fig 12a for case 1 overall our two dimensional synthetic study reveals that improvements to ssht analysis are obtained by including hpt inverted k as prior distributions for geostatistical inverse models when abundant drawdown data and pumping tests are not available 5 summary and conclusions high resolution characterization of k fields in surficial aquifers consisting of unconsolidated sediments through the direct push based hpt technique and geostatistically based ht have been conducted separately over the last two decades to provide improved understanding of subsurface heterogeneity however empirical models relating hpt measurements to k profiles were developed through upscaling the centimeter resolution hpt data to k estimates from collocated areas by other approaches if there were any mccall and christy 2010 liu et al 2012 otherwise empirical formulae developed for other sites may be used directly for convenience which can provide biased k estimates sun et al 2022 the performance of geostatistically based ht technique on the other hand will require a sufficient amount of pumping test data to satisfactorily reconstruct the heterogeneous hydraulic parameter fields to address these issues we have investigated the usefulness of the inverse modeling approach by coupling hgs aquanty inc 2018 with pest doherty 2015 to directly estimate k values from high resolution data of hpt surveys recently conducted at the highly heterogeneous aquifer aquitard system of the ncrs based on the estimated k values a site specific formula was developed and the new formula was validated with a separate hpt survey at the ncrs then numerical experiments in a two dimensional synthetic aquifer were conducted to evaluate the benefits of integrating hpt inverted k values for ssht analyses based on the geostatistical inversion approach the results of our study led to the following major findings and conclusions 1 through conceptualizing the hpt injection logging as continuous injection tests the inverse modeling approach by coupling hgs aquanty inc 2018 with pest doherty 2015 provided k values that matched better with vertical variation patterns of k estimates from permeameter tests than those computed with the empirical formula provided by mccall and christy 2010 2 the hpt injection logging profiles were well calibrated by the inverse modeling approach for data in relatively high permeability sediments such as silt sandy silt sand and sand and gravel whereas inverse modeling of hpt data measured from low permeability clay sediments yielded poor matches for pressure changes where the injection flow rates were less than 1 0 ml s despite these poor matching results hpt inverted k estimates showed improved matches with k measurements from permeameter tests for the bottom low permeability clay layer where k values exceeded the lower boundary defined for the empirical formula by mccall and christy 2010 3 a new power law relationship was developed for the ncrs through fitting the hpt inverted k values in the well calibrated dataset group 1 in fig 2 with corresponding ratios of qinj pc from the hpt3 survey which yielded a r2 value of 0 98 for the fitted model this new formula produced an improved correspondence between predicted k values for the hpt6 2 survey and the k estimates from permeameter tests for the collocated cmt3 well these results suggested the validity of the site specific formula when applied to a separate hpt survey at the ncrs further studies are necessary to examine whether this new formula will produce robust k estimates at other hpt survey locations throughout the ncrs 4 numerical experiments in a two dimensional synthetic aquifer showed that when injection logging data from a hpt survey were well calibrated the inverse modeling approach captured the vertical variation patterns of the reference k field while tending to overestimate k values for low k layers when the heterogeneous aquifer is treated to be homogeneous by integrating the inverted k values for the synthetic hpt surveys ssht analysis with low data density four pumping tests each with 23 observation data performed comparable to the case with high data density eight pumping tests each with 47 observation data in terms of reconstructing the reference k field as well as predictions of independent pumping tests used for validation more importantly the k field estimated through the integration of hpt inverted k into the ssht analysis better defined sharp layer boundaries of both low and high k units than ssht relying only on pressure head information 5 overall our results showed that the inverse modeling approach by coupling hgs aquanty inc 2018 with pest doherty 2015 could be a better approach of providing more reliable k estimates for the development of a site specific relationship for the hpt technique without using additional k measurements to upscale the centimeter resolution to a coarser scale by other approaches findings from our field and synthetic study are encouraging for the joint implementations of hpt and ssht in the future nevertheless additional research efforts are needed in developing an optimized spatial sampling strategy for ht when hpt information is provided as well as refining k estimates from hpt injection logging data in low permeability sediments lessoff et al 2010 händel dietrich 2012 such as for the clay layers at the ncrs with a mean k of 1 0 10 8 m s to gain a better understanding of the reliability of k estimates through the inverse modeling approach for hpt survey data credit authorship contribution statement zhanfeng zhao

3067,tidal analysis is an aquifer scale testing that is a low cost alternative to pumping tests for evaluating aquifer hydraulic parameters without groundwater extraction many analytical solutions may be used to assess aquifer head fluctuations in response to tidal fluctuations nonetheless they are rarely used in practice aside from that most analytical solutions are based on a conceptual model that typically consists of an unconfined aquifer and a confined aquifer separated by an aquitard where hydraulic head fluctuations in the unconfined aquifer part are commonly neglected additionally the frequent confined aquifer short response time to sea level fluctuations cannot rely on hydraulic connection of the confined aquifer to the sea through the aquitard as a consequence when analytical solutions are applied to real world cases the hydraulic diffusivity is overestimated in this study we investigate through different numerical simulations the fluctuations of the phreatic surface by considering the delayed yield numerical results demonstrate that the mechanical effect generated by the load over the sea bottom exerted by sea level fluctuations is a key factor when determining aquifer parameters we further show that in multilayer systems head fluctuations in various aquifer layers can cause interferences and consequently increased attenuation of the tidal signal resulting in an overestimation of the inferred hydraulic diffusivity our results provide guidance on how to properly reproduce tidal responses in coastal aquifers keywords coastal aquifer water table fluctuations tidal fluctuations aquifer characterization jacob ferris equation parameter estimation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as global population soars economic activities cause significant demand of freshwater resources and coastal aquifers overpumping worldwide which leads to seawater intrusion swi with major social and economic consequences controlling swi requires detailed characterization of the aquifer and its connection to the sea which is challenging and costly accurate aquifer characterization is essential to design sustainable management schemes and to control or limit the propagation of the seawater wedge werner et al 2013 traditional hydrogeological tools such as pumping tests hydrochemical analyses or geophysical methods can be used to characterize the coastal aquifers however a singular feature of coastal aquifers is that they respond to sea level fluctuations these can be wind driven or usually far more important caused by astronomical tides tides have been studied by humanity for centuries they are generated by the movement of celestial bodies notably the moon around the earth causing the rise and fall of sea level tidal response analysis consists of identifying the aquifer geometry and parameters that best explain the observed response to sea level fluctuations this response can be viewed as a hydraulic test which is appealing because of its low cost simply set sensors in coastal wells and the sea to monitor fluctuations and its large scale it may allow characterizing the whole coastal zone sea level h s fluctuations can be approximated as a sum of harmonics the response of any linear system to a harmonic stress will also be a harmonic therefore the aquifer response to every harmonic component of tides will be described fig 1 by i the amplitude damping a a 0 ratio of the amplitude observed in the well a to the sea level fluctuation amplitude a 0 and ii the time shift t s delay in time between the fluctuation recorded in the well and the sea level fluctuation tidal response analysis consists of deriving hydraulic parameters from the amplitude damping and time shift from the various tidal harmonics and the available observation points the simplest and reference tidal analysis is the one by jacob 1950 and ferris 1952 jf hereinafter who computed analytically the aquifer response to a harmonic fluctuation of the sea level by considering a homogeneous isotropic and confined aquifer with an infinite inland extent and a vertically connection to the sea at the coastline they prescribed head at the coast x 0 as a harmonic function with a tidal amplitude a 0 l and a tidal period τ 2 π ω t where ω t 1 is the frequency they found that the response in a well located at a distance x l from the coastline is h x t a 0 e x l c s i n ω t x l c l c is a characteristic length depending on transmissivity t l 2 t 1 and storativity s such as l c t τ π s that is the tidal amplitude decreases exponentially with distance whereas the time shift increases linearly therefore we can obtain l c from either the amplitude damping l n a a 0 x l c or the time shift t s ω x l c knowing l c one can obtain d h t s as 1 d h a x 2 π τ l n a a 0 2 2 d h t s x 2 τ 4 π t s 2 where d h a is the hydraulic diffusivity obtained from the amplitude damping and d h t s is the one obtained from the time shift the two estimates should be identical under the ideal jf assumptions note that tidal response analysis does not yield t and s separately but only their ratio the aquifer hydraulic diffusivity d h still d h is a good indicator of connectivity knudby carrera 2006 furthermore slooten et al 2010 showed that tidal response inland is most sensitive to hydraulic conductivity near the shore therefore by performing this analysis at many observation wells one can infer which areas are well connected to the sea i e those with high diffusivity which is relevant because a key issue in coastal aquifer management is where to pump and how much can be pumped tidal response has been coupled with pumping tests to derive spatially varying maps of transmissivity alcolea et al 2007 alcolea et al 2009 it is surprising that given the advantages of the method its practical application is scarce jiao tang 1999 liu 1996 nielsen 1990 van der kamp 1972 zhou et al 2016 we attribute this paradox to several factors first and foremost jf s assumptions may not be appropriate because d h a and d h s should be identical whereas in practice they are not this has prompted the derivation of numerous analytical solutions for more complex and realistic aquifer configurations such as confined aquifers connected to the sea far offshore guo et al 2010 guomin chongxi 1991 van der kamp 1972 coastal leaky confined aquifers chuang yeh 2008 jeng et al 2002 jiao tang 1999 li jiao 2001b 2002 coastal aquifers with sloping beaches li et al 2008b teo et al 2003 etc mechanical effects me hereinafter add a further complication to the interpretation of the aquifer response to sea level fluctuations a rise in sea level can be viewed as an increase in the load exerted by the sea on the seafloor according to terzaghi s terzaghi 1954 theory this load is initially absorbed by the water as an increase in water pressure the overpressure is slowly dissipated as water flows away inland where pressure has not increased and the load is taken up by the solid skeleton increase in effective stress whose porosity is reduced that is water is squeezed by the sea load acknowledging the mechanical effect has led to a large number of analytical solutions which require a leaky confined aquifers that extend below the sea and include the effect of the fluctuating load geng et al 2009 li et al 2008a li jiao 2001a 2003a 2003b li et al 2007 these solutions are integrated and generalized by guarracino et al 2012 the essential feature of these solutions is that i the amplitude observed in the aquifer at the coast is about one half of that in the sea van der kamp 1972 and ii the time shift can be significantly reduced because the squeezing effect of the load is proportional to the time derivative of the sea level which is largest one quarter of the period before the harmonic maximum guarracino et al 2012 li et al 2008a accounting for the mechanical effect is not particularly difficult but it represents an additional complication as a result modelers need to consider under which conditions this effect should be accounted for another feature of equations 1 and 2 is that large damping and time shift should be observed in unconfined aquifers where d h is small large storage coefficient s however significant head responses to tides have been observed several kilometers inland in shallow unconfined coastal aquifers such as in spain llobregat delta internal communication or argentona aquifer martínez pérez et al 2022 in hong kong jiao li 2004 merritt 2004 we attribute these observations to the slow mobilization of the storage the storage coefficient of unconfined aquifers consists of two components an elastic component associated with compression of the aquifer s s b and a specific yield s y component associated with pore dewatering meinzer 1932 himself pointed appreciable drainage may occur during a period of several weeks while discussing of field estimation of s y see dietrich et al 2018 and lv et al 2021 but the issue was not formalized until it became necessary for the interpretation of pumping wells when it was labeled delayed yield boulton 1954 1963 bouwer rice 1978 neuman 1972 delayed yield implies only a fraction of the full storage coefficient small s is actually mobilized during a tide period so that the unconfined aquifer reacts as if d h was larger than in reality yet none of the solutions described above acknowledge delayed yield in tidal response which we conjecture may be important in light of the above considerations the first relevant question when analyzing the tidal response is how to treat the phreatic surface of the unconfined aquifers a complementary key question is when the mechanical effect must be considered the study is aimed at addressing these questions to give guidance on the appropriate conceptual model for the tidal response method to this end we performed numerical simulations considering the hydro mechanical effect generated by tidal fluctuations our results aim at yielding new insights into the tidal method thus contributing to its application in complex coastal systems 2 methods 2 1 tidal method generalities 2 1 1 governing equations sea level fluctuations cause heads to fluctuate in coastal aquifers hydraulically connected to the sea fig 1 a aquifer heads also respond to the loading effect of sea level fluctuations on the seafloor according to terzaghi s 1954 theory an increase in loading is initially reflected as an increase in water pressure and dissipated as water flows away water is squeezed fig 1 b the mechanical effect can be included in the flow equation as a sink source term f proportional to the time derivative of the total stress bear 1972 for tidal fluctuations the induced mechanical effect is represented by a sink source term proportional to the time derivative of seawater level h s expressed as freshwater head i e h s is the actual sea level fluctuation multiplied by ρ s ρ f where ρ s and ρ f are the densities of seawater and freshwater respectively including this term fluid mass conservation is given by 3 s s h t k h f 4 f s s l e d h s dt where s s is specific storage l 1 h is aquifer head l and the source sink term f only on the offshore part x 0 f 0 l e the tidal loading efficiency van der kamp gale 1983 provide a full discussion of this equations and its associated parameters l e describe the formation pressure change caused by a distributed change of pressure at the bottom of the sea eq 5 defined by 5 l e α α ϕ β where α is the oedometric compressibility of the aquifer skeleton β is the compressibility of the pore water in the confined aquifer and ϕ porosity since coastal sediments are usually young they are a lot more compressible than water i e β therefore we will adopt l e 1 see li et al 2008a and li et al 2007 for a collection of values note that accounting for this term in numerical models simply requires adding a time varying sink source term given by equation 4 insight into the nature of this effect can be gained from the analytical solution of guarracino et al 2012 they express the tidal response observed in the confined aquifer h as the sum of three different components i h h the direct hydraulic connection where the aquifer opens the sea horizontal blue arrows at the left of fig 1 ii h h 1 the hydraulic component caused by the indirect connection through the aquitard vertical blue arrows in fig 1 and iii h m the mechanical component induced by tidal loading the red arrows in fig 1 compress the aquifer and squeeze water away thick blue arrows guarracino et al 2012 analyze them in detail the three components are shown in fig 2 for a specific case considering an aquitard with the following parameters aquitard thickness b 1 of 5 m hydraulic conductivity k 1 of 0 01 m d and a specific storage s s 1 of 5 10 1 m and a confined aquifer with the following parameters aquifer thickness b of 18 m hydraulic conductivity k of 10 m d and specific storage s s of 5 10 5 1 m results are shown at the coastline x 0 m note that for this example h m resembles h whereas the effect of leakage through the aquitard h h 1 is small however real world applications of the guarracino et al 2012 analytical solution remain complex and non trivial therefore to simplify the procedure in this study we use the principle of superposition over numerical simulations and consider only two hydraulic components of the head response 1 the hydraulic component considering h h and h h 1 together and 2 the mechanical contribution to this end we adopt a flow model described in section 1 2 which includes periodic elastic compressions and expansions of the aquitard and the confined aquifer similar to that of guarracino et al 2012 fig 3 2 1 2 phreatic surface and delayed yield when the specific yield is released instantaneously i e when water content in the unsaturated zone is reduced instantaneously in

surface also fluctuates with tides even far from the coast just like a confined aquifer this kind of observation has been largely documented for hydraulic tests batu 1998 boulton 1954 1963 neuman 1972 it explains the delayed water table response of unconfined aquifers during a pumping test three drawdown phases are observed 1 drawdown similar to a confined aquifer theis curve with small s explained by wellbore and the elastic storage then 2 it reaches a pseudo steady state hantush like and finally 3 water table decline again theis curve with large s from 3 the specific yield s y can be derived after a long pumping test in the case of tidal oscillations phase 1 is observed because it represents instantaneous mobilization of storage but whether phases 2 and 3 are mobilized depends on the tide period relative to the time it takes to mobilize the delayed yield the net result is that the unconfined aquifer acts like a semi confined so if not all the part of the storage is mobilized instantaneously eq 6 becomes eq 7 s y 0 h t i 1 n s y i h i t k z h z 7 a s y i d h i dt c i h h i 7 b where s y 0 is the instantaneous specific yield and the immobile or slowly yield zones are

boulton 1963 we solve the system of equation 7 assuming h a 0 sin ω t then equation 7b reads 8 d h f dt α a x sin ω t α h f it is easy to check that the long term solution to this equation is 9 h f a

yield effect can be obtained by observing that eqs 3 and 4 with bc s eq 7 is a linear system subject to a harmonic fluctuation forcing term therefore any output will also be a harmonic fluctuation with a damped amplitude and a time shift to generalize ferris solution h x t a 0 e x l c s i n ω t x l c we need to acknowledge that both the amplitude and the time shift will damp depending on x we have fitted s to reproduce the additional damping and found that a solution can be obtained by adopting 11 s dy s s b s y 1 e a τ t c z where b is the aquifer thickness l t c z 1 α is the vertical characteristic time and a 0 25 obtained from sensitivity analysis 2 2 numerical methodology in this section the numerical methodology is presented several sets of simulations were carried out to properly define aquifer characterization in coastal aquifers from the tidal method first we consider a fully homogeneous confined aquifer similar to the jf conceptual model additionally more complex geometries have been considered in order to i simulate properly delayed yield effects and ii include layered configurations commonly found in sedimentary systems 2 2 1 numerical model setup an idealized coastal aquifer represented by a 2d vertical section extended 250 m offshore and 750 m onshore is considered in this study the model domain was discretized into 15 643 triangular elements refined near the coast and the aquitard portions we simulate constant density water flow since previous research has shown that density differences have little effect on fluctuations ataie ashtiani et al 2001 slooten et al 2010 the following boundary conditions were adopted fig 3 a cauchy type boundary condition was imposed at the inland boundary considered infinite in the analytical solution thus the inflow outflow q α h h ext l 3 t 1 depends on the difference between the calculated head h l and the reference imposed head at the boundary h ext l which is taken as zero since we are only working with fluctuations and the leakage coefficient α l 2 t this boundary condition reduces the possible impact of boundaries because if the fluctuations reach the inland boundary then h becomes higher that h ext and water is expelled out of the domain two different boundaries red lines in fig 3 represent the seaward boundary where the tidal fluctuation of the sea level is assumed to be sinusoidal and simulated with a dirichlet boundary condition h s t a 0 sin ω t with a 0 the amplitude and ω the tidal angular velocity t 1 in the submerged portion the mechanical effect was applied through the source and sink terms included as a recharge f term in eq 3 models were run using the transin code medina and carrera 2003 medina carrera 1996 imposing tidal oscillations until the dynamic quasi steady state was reached the boundary conditions in this study differ from those of guarracino et al 2012 however the precision of the numerical model was tested and verified by comparing the results with conditions equal to those guarracino et al 2012 see details in supplementary materials we have simulated several variations of the base case model displayed in fig 3 to assess the impact of delayed yield and mechanical effect table 1 summarizes the base case parameters which correspond to a homogeneous confined aquifer fig 4 a we varied the geometry and parameters to analyze the impact of the mechanical effect and the delayed yield we simulated three sets of configurations single aquifer i e no aquitard double aquifer one aquitard and multi aquifer several aquitards systems for each of these three systems we considered three configurations they are summarized in fig 4 and explained in the following in all simulations aquifers and aquitards hydraulic parameters k and s s are conserved moreover they are both considered isotropic so that k x k z 2 3 single aquifer the effect of delayed yield to assess the effect of delayed yield we analyze three configurations varying the treatment of the phreatic surface a fully confined i e no specific yield fig 4a base case b free surface i e instantaneous yield fig 4b and c delayed yield fig 4c the confined aquifer a is simulated by setting a no flow boundary condition at the top of the aquifer for cases b and c we adopt the approach of carrera and neuman 1986 which requires a geometry modification in the inland part of the model including two thin layers at the top with a thickness of 1 m each in the additional layers the permeability is assumed to be anisotropic k x k z such that the main component of the flow is vertical if the hydraulic conductivity of these layers is high the aquifer behaves as unconfined otherwise yield is delayed with a characteristic time t cz s y l z k z where l z 2 m hydraulic parameters applied to the unconfined b and delayed yield c cases are presented in fig 4 a unique k x value is considered for these additional layers we considered four values for the vertical permeability k z to study the sensitivity of the delayed yield boundary condition directly affecting its characteristic time t c z the resulting values of t c z are 0 1 1 10 and 100 days 2 3 1 double aquifer system mechanical and delayed yield effects three configuration of a double aquifer system are considered by including an aquitard b 1 5 m between an upper unconfined aquifer and a lower confined actually semi confined aquifer while varying the simulation of phreatic surface of the upper aquifer fig 4 d to f this conceptual model is similar to the one presented by guarracino et al 2012 this aquifer configuration is considered to 1 assess the impact of the upper aquifer delayed yield on the deep aquifer and 2 examine the effectiveness of the mechanical component furthermore the simulation with the phreatic surface as delayed yield fig 4 f was duplicated with and without the mechanical effect by removing the recharge term applied offshore 2 3 2 multi aquifer system finally more realistic simulations are considered with three or more aquifer units separated by semi permeable layers fig 4 g to i multilayered aquifers are commonly observed in coastal aquifers due to sequential sedimentation for these simulations a vertical permeability of k z 0 01 m d is adopted for the delayed yield boundary so that the equivalent t c z is 10 days 3 results and discussion we simulate all the configurations described above by assuming that sea level fluctuates as a sinusoidal wave with a period of 23 9 days given the linearity of the system results are always a sinusoidal head damped and lagged with respect to the sea as shown in fig 1 therefore rather than showing the head evolution we will simply discuss amplitude damping and time shift in general tidal fluctuations will contain several harmonics i e sea level will be equal to the sum of several harmonics each with its own period but each will similarly to the one we discuss here 3 1 single aquifer the role of delayed yield fig 5 displays the hydraulic diffusivity one would obtain when using amplitude damping d h a eq 1 or time shift d h t s eq 2 as a reference we also display the true hydraulic diffusivity d h t s that is the one calculated using the parameters indicated in fig 4 for the delayed yield case not all storage is mobilized during a tidal cycle therefore diffusivity is computed using the apparent specific yield given by eq 10 the fact that the observation points are located at some depth implies that there will be some amplitude damping and time shift even close to the shore therefore equations 1 and 2 would yield zero diffusivity for x 0 to illustrate this point we show in fig 6 the velocities computed at the tidal maximum for a confined an unconfined and a delayed yield velocities only become horizontal i e according to dupuit s approximation in the confined case in order to address this vertical component of water flux we substitute x in equations 1 and 2 by x corr x 2 z 2 note that this correction helps somewhat near the shore but become irrelevant when x is much larger than z the estimated hydraulic diffusivities for the confined case are similar to the true ones see d h conf in fig 5 represented by dotted blue line only a bit smaller because of the vertical component of flux near the shore shown in fig 6 confined case this translates into a small damping in amplitude and shift in time at the deep observation well the additional energy dissipation caused by the vertical water flux causes the estimated d h to be slightly smaller than the true one these results confirm those of todd 1980 and erskine 1991 the two other cases unconfined and delayed yield are more shifted with respect to d h conf in fig 5 the effect of delayed yield is non trivial a long characteristic time implies that only a small fraction of storativity is mobilized as expected amplitude damping is only a bit larger than the confined case fig 5a t c z 100 d a y s and hydraulic diffusivity obtained from the amplitude damping is a bit smaller than the confined case this explains why a tidal response has been observed far inland in unconfined aquifers jha et al 2008 solórzano rivas et al 2021 vallejos et al 2015 however the result is opposite in terms of time shift t s delayed yield seems to accelerate the signal propagation while one would expect a lower amplitude to cause a higher t s including the delayed yield leads to smaller time shift compared to the confined case leading to d h values higher than d h conf fig 5 b this result highlights that diffusivities resulting from the time shift are less accurate than those obtained from the amplitude damping increasing the delayed yield vertical characteristic time t c z leads to values of d h a and d h t s that are close to d h conf similarly when a small t c z is applied the phreatic surface presents an unconfined behavior in all cases the approximation of equation 10 works reasonably well for the mobilized specific yield most analytical solutions neglect changes in the vertical dimension however the analysis of head responses at two different depths z 10 m and 24 m shows some vertical differences in the 3 cases thus strong vertical differences in the unconfined case are observed even at distance from the coast fig 5 these differences are more significant for the time shift fig 5b this effect has been described for aquifers placed below a confining layer that is connected to a free surface designated as capillary exposed surfaces bear 1972 3 2 double aquifer system mechanical effect hydraulic diffusivity results for the case in which the aquifer is split by one aquitard layer are presented in fig 7 these results are complemented with maps of the velocity fields fig 8 and a map of the amplitude damping factor a a 0 and the dimensionless time shift ω t s fig 9 hydraulic diffusivities of the upper aquifer derived from 10 m deep light color in fig 7 for z 10 m are smaller than for the single aquifer case in both estimations from damping and time shift that is the presence of the deep aquifer leads to additional damping and time shift note that the true d h for the confined case d h conf in fig 7 remains unchanged but a d h is underestimated by a factor of 4 for the confined case and 2 5 for the delayed yield case note that d h sy 10 d is reduced because transmissivity is proportional to thickness whereas the mobilized specific yield does not depend on thickness the unconfined case light green line in fig 7 is more interesting d h is slightly underestimated for short distances but becomes over estimated for distances larger than 0 4 l c recall that l c in fig 7 is the one corresponding to the confined aquifer or some 250 m so that 0 4 l c 3 l c u n c that is the distance where d h a and also d h t s starts increasing coincides with the distance where the response along the upper aquifer becomes negligible this suggests that the response observed is the one transferred from the deep aquifer i e interference moreover the break observed in the curve as well as the precision of d h after this distance cannot be considered since the fluctuations are almost completely attenuated 0 02 of a 0 numerically it would require a mesh refinement for better accuracy the mechanical effect is apparent in the maps of velocities a a 0 and ω t s fig 8 and fig 9 mechanically driven flux in the deep aquifer is relevant from an offshore distance of the order of l c when the mechanical effect is neglected flux is only relevant near the offshore portion of the deep aquifer therefore we must conclude that the observed flux is mechanically driven the impact of this flux in terms of time shift is moderate but it is large in terms of amplitude for the parameters of this example there is a positive time shift at the shore maximum response slightly delayed with respect to the sea level maximum recall that the shift was negative for the parameters of fig 2 also a a 0 is slightly smaller than 0 5 at the shore still for the computation is diffusivities in all deep observation wells we have divided the sea level amplitude by a factor of 2 to acknowledge the mechanical effect the results appear to be adequate in that the order of magnitude of the computed diffusivities is correct the velocities display several interesting features first they display a slight vertical downwards component in the offshore portion just below aquitard despite the fact that no flux is apparent in the upper aquifer they also display a slight upwards component deep inland in fact though hardly visible flow in the aquitard is vertical and away from the center which shows the squeezing effect second flux in the offshore portion of the aquifer is negligible when the mechanical effect is acknowledged but downwards when it is not this suggests that the hydraulic conductance effect caused by head fluctuations at the boundary is balanced by the squeezing effect loading causes all heads to fluctuate simultaneously the aquitard hinders vertical conductance of water across so that the dominant flux below is essentially mechanical an implication of this finding is that the mechanical effect should always be included in models nothing is lost when it is irrelevant in spite of the above complexities estimates of d h are not quite good d h a is some 3 times smaller than the confined aquifer d h virtually identical for the three cases conf unconf and delayed yield this similarity despite the above mentioned aquifer interference suggests that interference has a moderate effect there the signal is strong d h s is closer than d h a to the time value but the estimates are more sensitive to the upper aquifer conditions this implies that interference is more important for time shift than for amplitude damping two additional comments must be made first ignoring the mechanical effect does not affect d h a estimates in the upper aquifer but they do affect somewhat estimates of d h t s neglecting the mechanical effect in the deep aquifer is not acceptable 3 3 multilayered aquifer results for the multilayer cases are presented in fig 10 and complemented with velocity fields in fig 11 results for the shallow aquifers here represented by i two cases with a 10 m thick aquifer cases a and b and ii two cases with 1 m thick aquitard dividing these upper aquifer cases b and d when we observe at 5 m depth all the simulations present an underestimation of d h a with respect to the true d h which reflects that water flux into out of aquitards is more significant from the time shift d h t s is overestimated up to 1 order of magnitude moreover we observed differences at high distance between cases with the same shallow aquifer geometry the only difference in these cases is their deep aquifer geometry indicating the influence of deeper layers observations at 10 m depth presents some d h a values similar to results of deeper aquifers this is not the case in terms of time shift 4 in deep aquifers the considered cases are representing a large confined aquifer cases a and c with 18 m of aquifer thickness and a system with a 3 m aquitard diving two aquifers cases b and d we observed in deeper layers similar results as previously with value tending to d h conf for observation at 26 m depth these results are reflected in the velocity fields similar for all cases in the deeper aquifer fig 11 therefore the observation at 18 m cases b and d are largely underestimating this value indicating that fluctuations are rapidly damped confirmed by their velocity fields an interesting feature of the velocity fields is that water fluxes are much larger in the thin than in the thick aquifers this reflects the much higher specific storage of the aquitards which implies a significant squeezing flux this flux is reduced when distributed over a thick aquifer but can be large in thin aquifers larger than that in the upper aquifer where it results from direct hydraulic connection to the sea 5 conclusion recent research on tidal methods to characterize the hydrodynamic parameters and connectivity to the sea in coastal aquifers has provided a more complete understanding of the aquifer response to tidal fluctuations current findings suggest that various components must be considered such as the hydraulic part of the response combined with the mechanical effect due to loading and unloading on the submerged portion of the aquifer system however various open questions remained regarding the consideration of some part of the system unconfined aquifer or due to the vague and weak provisions about the mechanical effect more importantly delayed yield has been ignored in tidal response research these questions hinder applicability of tidal response methods to real cases in this study we have systematically analyzed the impact of the mechanical effect and delayed yield on the response to tidal fluctuations in coastal aquifers to this end different aquifer configurations and boundary conditions have been considered our results demonstrate that the order of magnitude of hydraulic diffusivity is well reproduced when using the jf equation based on amplitude damping provided that two precautions are adopted 1 near the shore the actual distance to the shore including the vertical component should be adopted 2 in deep aquifers where the response is mechanically controlled the sea level amplitude should be divided by two the time shift is affected by numerous factors interference depth phreatic surface and we have not found a way to account for them in an easy manner but even if an appropriate d h can be found the problem lies on its interpretation if the aquifer is unconfined and the modeler assume t d h s with s s s b s y then actual transmissivity can be overestimated by orders of magnitude because the effectively mobilized storativity can be far smaller than the specific yield which should be expected always this point highlights the need to perform relatively long pumping tests to complement tidal response analysis for robust identification of coastal aquifer parameters the mechanical effect must be acknowledged below aquitards deep aquifers react rapidly to tides even faster than the shallow aquifer the mechanical effect is relevant even in relatively thin aquitards moreover numerical results reveal the presence of interferences between layers in multi layered systems the result is that the behavior can be too complex for analytical solutions and implies the need for numerical modeling in fact the conclusion that tidal response interpretation is complicated by numerous factors implies that it contains information about all of them so that it is worth including tidal response data in any modeling effort while this may sound too complex modeling the mechanical effect only implies adding a relatively easy sink source term its simplicity leads us to recommend always including it as nothing is lost when the mechanical effect is irrelevant this study focused only on simple sinusoidal sea level fluctuations in coastal aquifers further analysis considering real aquifer geometries and real sea level fluctuations with multiple harmonics should be examined in future investigations credit authorship contribution statement tybaud goyetche conceptualization

3067,tidal analysis is an aquifer scale testing that is a low cost alternative to pumping tests for evaluating aquifer hydraulic parameters without groundwater extraction many analytical solutions may be used to assess aquifer head fluctuations in response to tidal fluctuations nonetheless they are rarely used in practice aside from that most analytical solutions are based on a conceptual model that typically consists of an unconfined aquifer and a confined aquifer separated by an aquitard where hydraulic head fluctuations in the unconfined aquifer part are commonly neglected additionally the frequent confined aquifer short response time to sea level fluctuations cannot rely on hydraulic connection of the confined aquifer to the sea through the aquitard as a consequence when analytical solutions are applied to real world cases the hydraulic diffusivity is overestimated in this study we investigate through different numerical simulations the fluctuations of the phreatic surface by considering the delayed yield numerical results demonstrate that the mechanical effect generated by the load over the sea bottom exerted by sea level fluctuations is a key factor when determining aquifer parameters we further show that in multilayer systems head fluctuations in various aquifer layers can cause interferences and consequently increased attenuation of the tidal signal resulting in an overestimation of the inferred hydraulic diffusivity our results provide guidance on how to properly reproduce tidal responses in coastal aquifers keywords coastal aquifer water table fluctuations tidal fluctuations aquifer characterization jacob ferris equation parameter estimation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as global population soars economic activities cause significant demand of freshwater resources and coastal aquifers overpumping worldwide which leads to seawater intrusion swi with major social and economic consequences controlling swi requires detailed characterization of the aquifer and its connection to the sea which is challenging and costly accurate aquifer characterization is essential to design sustainable management schemes and to control or limit the propagation of the seawater wedge werner et al 2013 traditional hydrogeological tools such as pumping tests hydrochemical analyses or geophysical methods can be used to characterize the coastal aquifers however a singular feature of coastal aquifers is that they respond to sea level fluctuations these can be wind driven or usually far more important caused by astronomical tides tides have been studied by humanity for centuries they are generated by the movement of celestial bodies notably the moon around the earth causing the rise and fall of sea level tidal response analysis consists of identifying the aquifer geometry and parameters that best explain the observed response to sea level fluctuations this response can be viewed as a hydraulic test which is appealing because of its low cost simply set sensors in coastal wells and the sea to monitor fluctuations and its large scale it may allow characterizing the whole coastal zone sea level h s fluctuations can be approximated as a sum of harmonics the response of any linear system to a harmonic stress will also be a harmonic therefore the aquifer response to every harmonic component of tides will be described fig 1 by i the amplitude damping a a 0 ratio of the amplitude observed in the well a to the sea level fluctuation amplitude a 0 and ii the time shift t s delay in time between the fluctuation recorded in the well and the sea level fluctuation tidal response analysis consists of deriving hydraulic parameters from the amplitude damping and time shift from the various tidal harmonics and the available observation points the simplest and reference tidal analysis is the one by jacob 1950 and ferris 1952 jf hereinafter who computed analytically the aquifer response to a harmonic fluctuation of the sea level by considering a homogeneous isotropic and confined aquifer with an infinite inland extent and a vertically connection to the sea at the coastline they prescribed head at the coast x 0 as a harmonic function with a tidal amplitude a 0 l and a tidal period τ 2 π ω t where ω t 1 is the frequency they found that the response in a well located at a distance x l from the coastline is h x t a 0 e x l c s i n ω t x l c l c is a characteristic length depending on transmissivity t l 2 t 1 and storativity s such as l c t τ π s that is the tidal amplitude decreases exponentially with distance whereas the time shift increases linearly therefore we can obtain l c from either the amplitude damping l n a a 0 x l c or the time shift t s ω x l c knowing l c one can obtain d h t s as 1 d h a x 2 π τ l n a a 0 2 2 d h t s x 2 τ 4 π t s 2 where d h a is the hydraulic diffusivity obtained from the amplitude damping and d h t s is the one obtained from the time shift the two estimates should be identical under the ideal jf assumptions note that tidal response analysis does not yield t and s separately but only their ratio the aquifer hydraulic diffusivity d h still d h is a good indicator of connectivity knudby carrera 2006 furthermore slooten et al 2010 showed that tidal response inland is most sensitive to hydraulic conductivity near the shore therefore by performing this analysis at many observation wells one can infer which areas are well connected to the sea i e those with high diffusivity which is relevant because a key issue in coastal aquifer management is where to pump and how much can be pumped tidal response has been coupled with pumping tests to derive spatially varying maps of transmissivity alcolea et al 2007 alcolea et al 2009 it is surprising that given the advantages of the method its practical application is scarce jiao tang 1999 liu 1996 nielsen 1990 van der kamp 1972 zhou et al 2016 we attribute this paradox to several factors first and foremost jf s assumptions may not be appropriate because d h a and d h s should be identical whereas in practice they are not this has prompted the derivation of numerous analytical solutions for more complex and realistic aquifer configurations such as confined aquifers connected to the sea far offshore guo et al 2010 guomin chongxi 1991 van der kamp 1972 coastal leaky confined aquifers chuang yeh 2008 jeng et al 2002 jiao tang 1999 li jiao 2001b 2002 coastal aquifers with sloping beaches li et al 2008b teo et al 2003 etc mechanical effects me hereinafter add a further complication to the interpretation of the aquifer response to sea level fluctuations a rise in sea level can be viewed as an increase in the load exerted by the sea on the seafloor according to terzaghi s terzaghi 1954 theory this load is initially absorbed by the water as an increase in water pressure the overpressure is slowly dissipated as water flows away inland where pressure has not increased and the load is taken up by the solid skeleton increase in effective stress whose porosity is reduced that is water is squeezed by the sea load acknowledging the mechanical effect has led to a large number of analytical solutions which require a leaky confined aquifers that extend below the sea and include the effect of the fluctuating load geng et al 2009 li et al 2008a li jiao 2001a 2003a 2003b li et al 2007 these solutions are integrated and generalized by guarracino et al 2012 the essential feature of these solutions is that i the amplitude observed in the aquifer at the coast is about one half of that in the sea van der kamp 1972 and ii the time shift can be significantly reduced because the squeezing effect of the load is proportional to the time derivative of the sea level which is largest one quarter of the period before the harmonic maximum guarracino et al 2012 li et al 2008a accounting for the mechanical effect is not particularly difficult but it represents an additional complication as a result modelers need to consider under which conditions this effect should be accounted for another feature of equations 1 and 2 is that large damping and time shift should be observed in unconfined aquifers where d h is small large storage coefficient s however significant head responses to tides have been observed several kilometers inland in shallow unconfined coastal aquifers such as in spain llobregat delta internal communication or argentona aquifer martínez pérez et al 2022 in hong kong jiao li 2004 merritt 2004 we attribute these observations to the slow mobilization of the storage the storage coefficient of unconfined aquifers consists of two components an elastic component associated with compression of the aquifer s s b and a specific yield s y component associated with pore dewatering meinzer 1932 himself pointed appreciable drainage may occur during a period of several weeks while discussing of field estimation of s y see dietrich et al 2018 and lv et al 2021 but the issue was not formalized until it became necessary for the interpretation of pumping wells when it was labeled delayed yield boulton 1954 1963 bouwer rice 1978 neuman 1972 delayed yield implies only a fraction of the full storage coefficient small s is actually mobilized during a tide period so that the unconfined aquifer reacts as if d h was larger than in reality yet none of the solutions described above acknowledge delayed yield in tidal response which we conjecture may be important in light of the above considerations the first relevant question when analyzing the tidal response is how to treat the phreatic surface of the unconfined aquifers a complementary key question is when the mechanical effect must be considered the study is aimed at addressing these questions to give guidance on the appropriate conceptual model for the tidal response method to this end we performed numerical simulations considering the hydro mechanical effect generated by tidal fluctuations our results aim at yielding new insights into the tidal method thus contributing to its application in complex coastal systems 2 methods 2 1 tidal method generalities 2 1 1 governing equations sea level fluctuations cause heads to fluctuate in coastal aquifers hydraulically connected to the sea fig 1 a aquifer heads also respond to the loading effect of sea level fluctuations on the seafloor according to terzaghi s 1954 theory an increase in loading is initially reflected as an increase in water pressure and dissipated as water flows away water is squeezed fig 1 b the mechanical effect can be included in the flow equation as a sink source term f proportional to the time derivative of the total stress bear 1972 for tidal fluctuations the induced mechanical effect is represented by a sink source term proportional to the time derivative of seawater level h s expressed as freshwater head i e h s is the actual sea level fluctuation multiplied by ρ s ρ f where ρ s and ρ f are the densities of seawater and freshwater respectively including this term fluid mass conservation is given by 3 s s h t k h f 4 f s s l e d h s dt where s s is specific storage l 1 h is aquifer head l and the source sink term f only on the offshore part x 0 f 0 l e the tidal loading efficiency van der kamp gale 1983 provide a full discussion of this equations and its associated parameters l e describe the formation pressure change caused by a distributed change of pressure at the bottom of the sea eq 5 defined by 5 l e α α ϕ β where α is the oedometric compressibility of the aquifer skeleton β is the compressibility of the pore water in the confined aquifer and ϕ porosity since coastal sediments are usually young they are a lot more compressible than water i e β therefore we will adopt l e 1 see li et al 2008a and li et al 2007 for a collection of values note that accounting for this term in numerical models simply requires adding a time varying sink source term given by equation 4 insight into the nature of this effect can be gained from the analytical solution of guarracino et al 2012 they express the tidal response observed in the confined aquifer h as the sum of three different components i h h the direct hydraulic connection where the aquifer opens the sea horizontal blue arrows at the left of fig 1 ii h h 1 the hydraulic component caused by the indirect connection through the aquitard vertical blue arrows in fig 1 and iii h m the mechanical component induced by tidal loading the red arrows in fig 1 compress the aquifer and squeeze water away thick blue arrows guarracino et al 2012 analyze them in detail the three components are shown in fig 2 for a specific case considering an aquitard with the following parameters aquitard thickness b 1 of 5 m hydraulic conductivity k 1 of 0 01 m d and a specific storage s s 1 of 5 10 1 m and a confined aquifer with the following parameters aquifer thickness b of 18 m hydraulic conductivity k of 10 m d and specific storage s s of 5 10 5 1 m results are shown at the coastline x 0 m note that for this example h m resembles h whereas the effect of leakage through the aquitard h h 1 is small however real world applications of the guarracino et al 2012 analytical solution remain complex and non trivial therefore to simplify the procedure in this study we use the principle of superposition over numerical simulations and consider only two hydraulic components of the head response 1 the hydraulic component considering h h and h h 1 together and 2 the mechanical contribution to this end we adopt a flow model described in section 1 2 which includes periodic elastic compressions and expansions of the aquitard and the confined aquifer similar to that of guarracino et al 2012 fig 3 2 1 2 phreatic surface and delayed yield when the specific yield is released instantaneously i e when water content in the unsaturated zone is reduced instantaneously in response to a drop in aquifer head the phreatic surface boundary condition fig 3 is described by 6 s y h t z h k z h z generally neglected in analytical solutions the unconfined aquifer phreatic surface also fluctuates with tides even far from the coast just like a confined aquifer this kind of observation has been largely documented for hydraulic tests batu 1998 boulton 1954 1963 neuman 1972 it explains the delayed water table response of unconfined aquifers during a pumping test three drawdown phases are observed 1 drawdown similar to a confined aquifer theis curve with small s explained by wellbore and the elastic storage then 2 it reaches a pseudo steady state hantush like and finally 3 water table decline again theis curve with large s from 3 the specific yield s y can be derived after a long pumping test in the case of tidal oscillations phase 1 is observed because it represents instantaneous mobilization of storage but whether phases 2 and 3 are mobilized depends on the tide period relative to the time it takes to mobilize the delayed yield the net result is that the unconfined aquifer acts like a semi confined so if not all the part of the storage is mobilized instantaneously eq 6 becomes eq 7 s y 0 h t i 1 n s y i h i t k z h z 7 a s y i d h i dt c i h h i 7 b where s y 0 is the instantaneous specific yield and the immobile or slowly yield zones are characterized by their specific yield s y i and conductance c i their characteristic time is 1 α i with α i c i s yi to simplify the analysis we neglect s y 0 and consider n 1 so that s y s y 1 boulton 1963 we solve the system of equation 7 assuming h a 0 sin ω t then equation 7b reads 8 d h f dt α a x sin ω t α h f it is easy to check that the long term solution to this equation is 9 h f a sy sin ω t φ sy where a sy a x α α 2 ω 2 φ sy cos 1 α α 2 ω 2 sin 1 ω α 2 ω 2 this solution points out that h f behaves both in terms of damping and time shift as if the fraction of specific yield

yield effect can be obtained by observing that eqs 3 and 4 with bc s eq 7 is a linear system subject to a harmonic fluctuation forcing term therefore any output will also be a harmonic fluctuation with a damped amplitude and a time shift to generalize ferris solution h x t a 0 e x l c s i n ω t x l c we need to acknowledge that both the amplitude and the time shift will damp depending on x we have fitted s to reproduce the additional damping and found that a solution can be obtained by adopting 11 s dy s s b s y 1 e a τ t c z where b is the aquifer thickness l t c z 1 α is the vertical characteristic time and a 0 25 obtained from sensitivity analysis 2 2 numerical methodology in this section the numerical methodology is presented several sets of simulations were carried out to properly define aquifer characterization in coastal aquifers from the tidal method first we consider a fully homogeneous confined aquifer similar to the jf conceptual model additionally more complex geometries have been considered in order to i simulate properly delayed yield effects and ii include layered configurations commonly found in sedimentary systems 2 2 1 numerical model setup an idealized coastal aquifer represented by a 2d vertical section extended 250 m offshore and 750 m onshore is considered in this study the model domain was discretized into 15 643 triangular elements refined near the coast and the aquitard portions we simulate constant density water flow since previous research has shown that density differences have little effect on fluctuations ataie ashtiani et al 2001 slooten et al 2010 the following boundary conditions were adopted fig 3 a cauchy type boundary condition was imposed at the inland boundary considered infinite in the analytical solution thus the inflow outflow q α h h ext l 3 t 1 depends on the difference between the calculated head h l and the reference imposed head at the boundary h ext l which is taken as zero since we are only working with fluctuations and the leakage coefficient α l 2 t this boundary condition reduces the possible impact of boundaries because if the fluctuations reach the inland boundary then h becomes higher that h ext and water is expelled out of the domain two different boundaries red lines in fig 3 represent the seaward boundary where the tidal fluctuation of the sea level is assumed to be sinusoidal and simulated with a dirichlet boundary condition h s t a 0 sin ω t with a 0 the amplitude and ω the tidal angular velocity t 1 in the submerged portion the mechanical effect was applied through the source and sink terms included as a recharge f term in eq 3 models were run using the transin code medina and carrera 2003 medina carrera 1996 imposing tidal oscillations until the dynamic quasi steady state was reached the boundary conditions in this study differ from those of guarracino et al 2012 however the precision of the numerical model was tested and verified by comparing the results with conditions equal to those guarracino et al 2012 see details in supplementary materials we have simulated several variations of the base case model displayed in fig 3 to assess the impact of delayed yield and mechanical effect table 1 summarizes the base case parameters which correspond to a homogeneous confined aquifer fig 4 a we varied the geometry and parameters to analyze the impact of the mechanical effect and the delayed yield we simulated three sets of configurations single aquifer i e no aquitard double aquifer one aquitard and multi aquifer several aquitards systems for each of these three systems we considered three configurations they are summarized in fig 4 and explained in the following in all simulations aquifers and aquitards hydraulic parameters k and s s are conserved moreover they are both considered isotropic so that k x k z 2 3 single aquifer the effect of delayed yield to assess the effect of delayed yield we analyze three configurations varying the treatment of the phreatic surface a fully confined i e no specific yield fig 4a base case b free surface i e instantaneous yield fig 4b and c delayed yield fig 4c the confined aquifer a is simulated by setting a no flow boundary condition at the top of the aquifer for cases b and c we adopt the approach of carrera and neuman 1986 which requires a geometry modification in the inland part of the model including two thin layers at the top with a thickness of 1 m each in the additional layers the permeability is assumed to be anisotropic k x k z such that the main component of the flow is vertical if the hydraulic conductivity of these layers is high the aquifer behaves as unconfined otherwise yield is delayed with a characteristic time t cz s y l z k z where l z 2 m hydraulic parameters applied to the unconfined b and delayed yield c cases are presented in fig 4 a unique k x value is considered for these additional layers we considered four values for the vertical permeability k z to study the sensitivity of the delayed yield boundary condition directly affecting its characteristic time t c z the resulting values of t c z are 0 1 1 10 and 100 days 2 3 1 double aquifer system mechanical and delayed yield effects three configuration of a double aquifer system are considered by including an aquitard b 1 5 m between an upper unconfined aquifer and a lower confined actually semi confined aquifer while varying the simulation of phreatic surface of the upper aquifer fig 4 d to f this conceptual model is similar to the one presented by guarracino et al 2012 this aquifer configuration is considered to 1 assess the impact of the upper aquifer delayed yield on the deep aquifer and 2 examine the effectiveness of the mechanical component furthermore the simulation with the phreatic surface as delayed yield fig 4 f was duplicated with and without the mechanical effect by removing the recharge term applied offshore 2 3 2 multi aquifer system finally more realistic simulations are considered with three or more aquifer units separated by semi permeable layers fig 4 g to i multilayered aquifers are commonly observed in coastal aquifers due to sequential sedimentation for these simulations a vertical permeability of k z 0 01 m d is adopted for the delayed yield boundary so that the equivalent t c z is 10 days 3 results and discussion we simulate all the configurations described above by assuming that sea level fluctuates as a sinusoidal wave with a period of 23 9 days given the linearity of the system results are always a sinusoidal head damped and lagged with respect to the sea as shown in fig 1 therefore rather than showing the head evolution we will simply discuss amplitude damping and time shift in general tidal fluctuations will contain several harmonics i e sea level will be equal to the sum of several harmonics each with its own period but each will similarly to the one we discuss here 3 1 single aquifer the role of delayed yield fig 5 displays the hydraulic diffusivity one would obtain when using amplitude damping d h a eq 1 or time shift d h t s eq 2 as a reference we also display the true hydraulic diffusivity d h t s that is the one calculated using the parameters indicated in fig 4 for the delayed yield case not all storage is mobilized during a tidal cycle therefore diffusivity is computed using the apparent specific yield given by eq 10 the fact that the observation points are located at some depth implies that there will be some amplitude damping and time shift even close to the shore therefore equations 1 and 2 would yield zero diffusivity for x 0 to illustrate this point we show in fig 6 the velocities computed at the tidal maximum for a confined an unconfined and a delayed yield velocities only become horizontal i e according to dupuit s approximation in the confined case in order to address this vertical component of water flux we substitute x in equations 1 and 2 by x corr x 2 z 2 note that this correction helps somewhat near the shore but become irrelevant when x is much larger than z the estimated hydraulic diffusivities for the confined case are similar to the true ones see d h conf in fig 5 represented by dotted blue line only a bit smaller because of the vertical component of flux near the shore shown in fig 6 confined case this translates into a small damping in amplitude and shift in time at the deep observation well the additional energy dissipation caused by the vertical water flux causes the estimated d h to be slightly smaller than the true one these results confirm those of todd 1980 and erskine 1991 the two other cases unconfined and delayed yield are more shifted with respect to d h conf in fig 5 the effect of delayed yield is non trivial a long characteristic time implies that only a small fraction of storativity is mobilized as expected amplitude damping is only a bit larger than the confined case fig 5a t c z 100 d a y s and hydraulic diffusivity obtained from the amplitude damping is a bit smaller than the confined case this explains why a tidal response has been observed far inland in unconfined aquifers jha et al 2008 solórzano rivas et al 2021 vallejos et al 2015 however the result is opposite in terms of time shift t s delayed yield seems to accelerate the signal propagation while one would expect a lower amplitude to cause a higher t s including the delayed yield leads to smaller time shift compared to the confined case leading to d h values higher than d h conf fig 5 b this result highlights that diffusivities resulting from the time shift are less accurate than those obtained from the amplitude damping increasing the delayed yield vertical characteristic time t c z leads to values of d h a and d h t s that are close to d h conf similarly when a small t c z is applied the phreatic surface presents an unconfined behavior in all cases the approximation of equation 10 works reasonably well for the mobilized specific yield most analytical solutions neglect changes in the vertical dimension however the analysis of head responses at two different depths z 10 m and 24 m shows some vertical differences in the 3 cases thus strong vertical differences in the unconfined case are observed even at distance from the coast fig 5 these differences are more significant for the time shift fig 5b this effect has been described for aquifers placed below a confining layer that is connected to a free surface designated as capillary exposed surfaces bear 1972 3 2 double aquifer system mechanical effect hydraulic diffusivity results for the case in which the aquifer is split by one aquitard layer are presented in fig 7 these results are complemented with maps of the velocity fields fig 8 and a map of the amplitude damping factor a a 0 and the dimensionless time shift ω t s fig 9 hydraulic diffusivities of the upper aquifer derived from 10 m deep light color in fig 7 for z 10 m are smaller than for the single aquifer case in both estimations from damping and time shift that is the presence of the deep aquifer leads to additional damping and time shift note that the true d h for the confined case d h conf in fig 7 remains unchanged but a d h is underestimated by a factor of 4 for the confined case and 2 5 for the delayed yield case note that d h sy 10 d is reduced because transmissivity is proportional to thickness whereas the mobilized specific yield does not depend on thickness the unconfined case light green line in fig 7 is more interesting d h is slightly underestimated for short distances but becomes over estimated for distances larger than 0 4 l c recall that l c in fig 7 is the one corresponding to the confined aquifer or some 250 m so that 0 4 l c 3 l c u n c that is the distance where d h a and also d h t s starts increasing coincides with the distance where the response along the upper aquifer becomes negligible this suggests that the response observed is the one transferred from the deep aquifer i e interference moreover the break observed in the curve as well as the precision of d h after this distance cannot be considered since the fluctuations are almost completely attenuated 0 02 of a 0 numerically it would require a mesh refinement for better accuracy the mechanical effect is apparent in the maps of velocities a a 0 and ω t s fig 8 and fig 9 mechanically driven flux in the deep aquifer is relevant from an offshore distance of the order of l c when the mechanical effect is neglected flux is only relevant near the offshore portion of the deep aquifer therefore we must conclude that the observed flux is mechanically driven the impact of this flux in terms of time shift is moderate but it is large in terms of amplitude for the parameters of this example there is a positive time shift at the shore maximum response slightly delayed with respect to the sea level maximum recall that the shift was negative for the parameters of fig 2 also a a 0 is slightly smaller than 0 5 at the shore still for the computation is diffusivities in all deep observation wells we have divided the sea level amplitude by a factor of 2 to acknowledge the mechanical effect the results appear to be adequate in that the order of magnitude of the computed diffusivities is correct the velocities display several interesting features first they display a slight vertical downwards component in the offshore portion just below aquitard despite the fact that no flux is apparent in the upper aquifer they also display a slight upwards component deep inland in fact though hardly visible flow in the aquitard is vertical and away from the center which shows the squeezing effect second flux in the offshore portion of the aquifer is negligible when the mechanical effect is acknowledged but downwards when it is not this suggests that the hydraulic conductance effect caused by head fluctuations at the boundary is balanced by the squeezing effect loading causes all heads to fluctuate simultaneously the aquitard hinders vertical conductance of water across so that the dominant flux below is essentially mechanical an implication of this finding is that the mechanical effect should always be included in models nothing is lost when it is irrelevant in spite of the above complexities estimates of d h are not quite good d h a is some 3 times smaller than the confined aquifer d h virtually identical for the three cases conf unconf and delayed yield this similarity despite the above mentioned aquifer interference suggests that interference has a moderate effect there the signal is strong d h s is closer than d h a to the time value but the estimates are more sensitive to the upper aquifer conditions this implies that interference is more important for time shift than for amplitude damping two additional comments must be made first ignoring the mechanical effect does not affect d h a estimates in the upper aquifer but they do affect somewhat estimates of d h t s neglecting the mechanical effect in the deep aquifer is not acceptable 3 3 multilayered aquifer results for the multilayer cases are presented in fig 10 and complemented with velocity fields in fig 11 results for the shallow aquifers here represented by i two cases with a 10 m thick aquifer cases a and b and ii two cases with 1 m thick aquitard dividing these upper aquifer cases b and d when we observe at 5 m depth all the simulations present an underestimation of d h a with respect to the true d h which reflects that water flux into out of aquitards is more significant from the time shift d h t s is overestimated up to 1 order of magnitude moreover we observed differences at high distance between cases with the same shallow aquifer geometry the only difference in these cases is their deep aquifer geometry indicating the influence of deeper layers observations at 10 m depth presents some d h a values similar to results of deeper aquifers this is not the case in terms of time shift 4 in deep aquifers the considered cases are representing a large confined aquifer cases a and c with 18 m of aquifer thickness and a system with a 3 m aquitard diving two aquifers cases b and d we observed in deeper layers similar results as previously with value tending to d h conf for observation at 26 m depth these results are reflected in the velocity fields similar for all cases in the deeper aquifer fig 11 therefore the observation at 18 m cases b and d are largely underestimating this value indicating that fluctuations are rapidly damped confirmed by their velocity fields an interesting feature of the velocity fields is that water fluxes are much larger in the thin than in the thick aquifers this reflects the much higher specific storage of the aquitards which implies a significant squeezing flux this flux is reduced when distributed over a thick aquifer but can be large in thin aquifers larger than that in the upper aquifer where it results from direct hydraulic connection to the sea 5 conclusion recent research on tidal methods to characterize the hydrodynamic parameters and connectivity to the sea in coastal aquifers has provided a more complete understanding of the aquifer response to tidal fluctuations current findings suggest that various components must be considered such as the hydraulic part of the response combined with the mechanical effect due to loading and unloading on the submerged portion of the aquifer system however various open questions remained regarding the consideration of some part of the system unconfined aquifer or due to the vague and weak provisions about the mechanical effect more importantly delayed yield has been ignored in tidal response research these questions hinder applicability of tidal response methods to real cases in this study we have systematically analyzed the impact of the mechanical effect and delayed yield on the response to tidal fluctuations in coastal aquifers to this end different aquifer configurations and boundary conditions have been considered our results demonstrate that the order of magnitude of hydraulic diffusivity is well reproduced when using the jf equation based on amplitude damping provided that two precautions are adopted 1 near the shore the actual distance to the shore including the vertical component should be adopted 2 in deep aquifers where the response is mechanically controlled the sea level amplitude should be divided by two the time shift is affected by numerous factors interference depth phreatic surface and we have not found a way to account for them in an easy manner but even if an appropriate d h can be found the problem lies on its interpretation if the aquifer is unconfined and the modeler assume t d h s with s s s b s y then actual transmissivity can be overestimated by orders of magnitude because the effectively mobilized storativity can be far smaller than the specific yield which should be expected always this point highlights the need to perform relatively long pumping tests to complement tidal response analysis for robust identification of coastal aquifer parameters the mechanical effect must be acknowledged below aquitards deep aquifers react rapidly to tides even faster than the shallow aquifer the mechanical effect is relevant even in relatively thin aquitards moreover numerical results reveal the presence of interferences between layers in multi layered systems the result is that the behavior can be too complex for analytical solutions and implies the need for numerical modeling in fact the conclusion that tidal response interpretation is complicated by numerous factors implies that it contains information about all of them so that it is worth including tidal response data in any modeling effort while this may sound too complex modeling the mechanical effect only implies adding a relatively easy sink source term its simplicity leads us to recommend always including it as nothing is lost when the mechanical effect is irrelevant this study focused only on simple sinusoidal sea level fluctuations in coastal aquifers further analysis considering real aquifer geometries and real sea level fluctuations with multiple harmonics should be examined in future investigations credit authorship contribution statement tybaud goyetche conceptualization

3068,transit times and the young water fraction fyw the proportion of the water younger than a certain age threshold τyw can help characterize the hydrological behaviors within a catchment previous studies of water age have concentrated on individual catchment hydrological components such as river water groundwater plant water or soil water which hinders the dynamic linking of various hydrological components in the critical zone in this study the isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water xylem water river water and groundwater in a subtropical catchment in china were continuously monitored for two years we found that the seasonal isotopic cycles of shallow soil water 0 60 cm xylem water and river water had different attenuations and phase shifts relative to those of precipitation there were no obvious seasonal isotopic cycles of deep soil water 60 130 cm and groundwater additionally the transit time distributions ttds of soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm xylem water and river water in the catchment varied between the wet year and normal year with increasing depth the mean transit times mtts of soil water increased and the fyw decreased for xylem water and soil water the mtts and fyw in the wet year were shorter and larger than those in the normal year respectively the river water consisted of a small proportion of fast flow components and a large proportion of slow flow components with the young water accounting for 16 in the wet year and 21 in the normal year our results contribute to an improved understanding of water ages flow paths and linkages of different hydrological components in the critical zone at the catchment scale keywords stable isotopes mean transit time young water fraction water age lag time seasonal cycle critical zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the time taken by water to pass through the catchment hydrological cycle and the critical zone i e water age has broad implications for the management of water resources in terms of both quantity and quality and thus it is of increasing interest in earth system science hu et al 2020 sprenger et al 2019 the mean transit time mtt an important parameter in a catchment can provide insights into hydrological processes and hence can help understand the heterogeneities of water flow paths and serve as a tool for the construction and assessment of hydrological models farrick and branfireun 2015 hu et al 2020 jung et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 tekleab et al 2014 the assessment of hydrologic transit times and streamflow components is becoming increasingly important as the focus of hydrological research has shifted from the quantitative estimation of water flux to the quantitative analysis of which specific water components are more mobile in discharge and which are less mobile in storage mcdonnell 2017 sprenger et al 2019 the mtt has an obvious physical interpretation the ratio of the stored mobile water volume to the average water flux leaving the system under steady state conditions bolin and rodhe 1973 kirchner 2016 however it is often difficult to quantify the storage volume and mean water flux in the hydrological components of a basin since very variable results are produced by the water balance approach sprenger et al 2019 given the limitations of this traditional method the estimation of mtt using isotopic techniques has received much attention mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 tekleab et al 2014 although comprising a small proportion in nature the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes 2h and 18o in water as conservative geochemical tracers are powerful tools for identifying water sources flow paths and hydrological processes on different spatial and temporal scales hu et al 2020 jasechko et al 2016 to estimate the mean transit time the transit time distribution function ttd of the hydrological component in a catchment should first be determined usually estimates of ttd are based on the relationship of seasonal tracer cycles between the input precipitation and the output river water soil water groundwater etc in the hydrological system with the input tracer signal being damped and shifted by mixing along different flow paths jung et al 2020 kirchner 2016 sprenger et al 2019 unfortunately in heterogeneous catchments determining ttd is very difficult and the estimation of mtt based on seasonal tracer cycles is susceptible to aggregation bias resulting in the underestimation of the true mtt kirchner 2016 jasechko et al 2016 however the young water fraction fyw the proportion of water younger than an age threshold can be reliably estimated using seasonal tracer cycles in heterogeneous catchments and therefore it is considered as an alternative indicator of the mtt of a hydrological component kirchner 2016 fyw differs from the proportion of new water in hydrograph separation which partitions the runoff into event water from the current storm and the stored pre event water klaus and mcdonnell 2013 additionally the event based new water cannot identify the water age during the non storm period jasechko et al 2016 following observations that the seasonal tracer cycles of different hydrological components in a catchment follow a sinusoidal curve there is increasing interest in the estimation of mtt assuming that the ttd is known and fyw using parameters such as the phase shift and amplitude damping calculated by sine wave fitting to seasonal isotopic variations in the input and output asano et al 2002 dewalle et al 1997 lee et al 2007 rusjan et al 2019 tekleab et al 2014 wang et al 2020 the major advantage of this approach is that it can be performed on isotopic datasets with sparse and irregular sampling farrick and branfireun 2015 kirchner 2016 tekleab et al 2014 although plant transpiration is one of the main factors controlling the global terrestrial hydrological cycle accounting for 80 of total terrestrial evapotranspiration jasechko et al 2013 and has been a subject of much concern in various disciplines there have been few studies of the mtt the time that a rainwater drop takes to travel through the soil atmosphere and soil plant interfaces and fyw for plant xylem water since xylem water is derived from soil water in the root zone replenished by precipitation the isotopic composition of xylem water may exhibit an obvious seasonal variation similar to that of precipitation this variation was observed in cinnamomum camphora dai et al 2020 and three coniferous plants yang et al 2015 in the east asian monsoon region china most studies of mtts and fyw have concentrated on individual hydrological components such as river water groundwater etc within a specific catchment in the past so it is difficult to identify the hydrological processes of an entire catchment system sprenger et al 2019 however a comparison of the mtt and fyw of different hydrological components within the same catchment is more helpful in characterizing the flow paths of hydrological components in the critical zone and the possible connectivity between them after atmospheric precipitation infiltrates into the vadose zone it is absorbed by plant roots for transpiration or photosynthesis and then returns to the atmosphere the foregoing raises the following specific questions how long does this process take on average what percentage of the young water can be rapidly returned to the atmosphere speeding up the regional hydrological cycle what percentage of old water remains stored within the vadose zone or is transported along the plant flow path atmosphere soil root stem leaf generally speaking the mtt and fyw of plant water are similar to those of the soil water in the root zone which helps determine whether a plant has a deep or shallow root system in addition the relationship between the water age of soil and soil depth helps increase our understanding of soil water movement for river water understanding the proportion of precipitation that rapidly replenishes river water by fast flow mainly young water and the proportion of precipitation replenishment of river water by slow flow mainly old water can serve to indicate the migration and enrichment of pollutants an additional question is whether we can determine the dynamic relationship between groundwater and river water by estimating mtt and fyw these important questions are addressed in the present study major progress has been made in determining water ages and source water contributions of hydrological components in humid subtropical catchments in china including for soil water springs and streams with a karst catchment in southwest china chen et al 2017 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 and river water and groundwater in the yongan watershed in southeastern china hu et al 2020 however the previous research concentrated on an individual catchment hydrological component and the results are insufficient for comprehensively estimating the transit times and young water fraction of each hydrological component within the critical zone at the catchment scale which contains the top of the vegetation and the bottom of the groundwater storage most previous studies considered the ttds of a catchment to be time invariant during the observation period bansah and ali 2019 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 lutz et al 2018 tekleab et al 2014 but some recent studies advocated the use of nonstationary ttds instead birkel et al 2016 harman 2015 whether the ttds are time varying in a subtropical catchment remains to be determined in the present study stable isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water plant xylem water river water and groundwater were continuously monitored for two years in the lower reaches of the xiangjiang river catchment one of the main tributaries of the yangtze river in china the seasonal isotopic cycles of hydrological components were analyzed in the catchment the objectives of the study were 1 to determine the ttds of various hydrological components and assess the interannual variability in ttds using the convolution integral model and 2 to estimate and compare the mtts and fyw of various hydrological components these findings are expected to gain insight into water ages flow paths and linkages of different hydrological components in the critical

rainy days additionally river water samples were collected at site 3 on the 1st 6th 11th 16th 21st and 26th of each month from 20 cm below the river surface to ensure that the sample was completely mixed and to avoid isotopic evaporative fractionation samples of precipitation river water and groundwater were sealed in polyethylene vials numbered and stored at a low temperature 4 c isotopic compositions of all water samples were analyzed using a cavity ring down spectroscopy isotopic water analyzer model 35ep los gatos research inc usa isotopic ratios δ2h and δ18o are expressed using the conventional delta notation δ δ sample r sample r v smow 1 1000 where r sample and r v smow are the isotope ratios 2h 1h 18o 16o of water samples and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow respectively the accuracy of the isotopic analysis is 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δ2h in this study methanol contamination was found only in xylem water samples which interfered with the isotopic analyses thus a correction was required for the original isotopic data from xylem water which is described in luo et al 2019 stockinger et al 2017 suggested that isotopes in precipitation are significantly fractionated during the process of water movement through the plant canopy to the ground which will potentially influence the estimation of stream water transit times we compared the δ2h δ18o and d excess d excess δ2h 8δ18o which is often used to infer the isotopic evaporative fractionation in hydrological components according to wu et al 2021 in the precipitation samples with those of the throughfall samples of site 1 to test the occurrence of isotopic fractionation in the study area fig s1 in the supplementary material throughfall samples were collected from 15 collectors from april 2018 to february 2019 21 rainfall events in total we found no significant difference in δ2h δ18o and d excess between precipitation and throughfall p 0 05 this indicates that canopy interception did not affect the isotopic tracer signal of precipitation at site 1 as shown in fig s1 there was also no significant isotopic difference between the precipitation samples collected from site 1 and those from site 2 from april 2018 to february 2019 p 0 05 additionally the magnitude of the precipitation events between site 1 and site 2 were very similar according to luo et al 2019 therefore the high frequency precipitation data collected at site 2 reliably represent the isotopic composition and amount of precipitation in the study area 2 3 sine wave fitting the isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water xylem water river water and groundwater sampled at a high frequency might exhibit a sinusoidal pattern of variations which was observed in previous studies jódar et al 2016 jung et al 2020 lee et al 2007 wang et al 2020 thus we used a sine wave fitting method to match seasonal isotopic cycles of different hydrological components to obtain critical parameters such as amplitude phase and vertical offset kirchner 2016 the sine wave is defined as 2 c t a sin 2π f t φ k here c t is the tracer signal δ2h or δ18o in hydrological components at time t and a f φ and k are the cycle amplitude and frequency f 365 d 1 phase and vertical offset respectively it should be noted that in this study only rainfall events with daily precipitation 3 7 mm were analyzed to improve the accuracy of the sine wave fitting which is shown in fig s2 of the supplementary material this is because in the case of small precipitation events daily precipitation 3 7 mm the precipitation contribution to soil moisture was very small due to forest canopy interception and litter retention and the heavy isotopes in precipitation were enriched by secondary evaporation dai et al 2020 in addition evaporation effects on various hydrological components were neglected due to the weak influence of evaporation on the isotopic composition of waters at the study site in a subtropical humid region which can be verified by the results of the isotopic ratios below the root mean square error rmse and the nash efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate the sine wave fitting for different hydrological components these two indicators are often used to estimate the goodness of fit of hydrological models gupta et al 2009 jung et al 2020 the equations are defined as 3 r m s e t 1 n y t obs y t sim 2 n 4 n s e 1 t 1 n y t obs y t sim 2 t 1 n y t obs y 2 here y t obs and y t sim are the observed and simulated values of isotopic compositions at time t respectively and y is the mean of the observed isotopic data in the interval 0 0 to inf the lower the rmse the better the model fit and in the interval inf to 1 0 the greater the nse the better the model fit in this study values between 0 5 and 1 0 are viewed as acceptable levels of performance moriasi et al 2007 2 4 mean transit times and the young water fraction as the major water source of a catchment precipitation mixes the hydrological components after they enter the hydrological system resulting in amplitude damping and a phase shift of the isotopic signals which may be retained for some time before exiting the hydrological system we assumed that the output tracer signal cout can be simulated through a convolution of the catchment s transit time distribution ttd also called the system response function with the tracer time series in the input cin asano et al 2002 kirchner 2016 the convolution integral models of different hydrologic years are expressed as 5a c out t 1 0 h τ 1 c in t 1 τ 1 d τ 1 5b c out t 2 0 h τ 2 c in t 2 τ 2 d τ 2 5c c out t 3 0 h τ 3 c in t 3 τ 3 d τ 3 where t1 t2 and t3 are the time t in wet year normal year and throughout the whole observation period respectively τ1 τ2 and τ3 are the transit times in wet year normal year and throughout the whole observation period respectively cout t is the isotopic composition of the hydrological components in the catchment at time t cin t τ is the isotopic composition of precipitation at any previous time t τ and h τ is the distribution of transit times τ within the system notably we only tried to identify the possible inter annual variation in ttds for different hydrological components of the catchment rather than intra annual variation kirchner 2016 suggested that the gamma family distribution can be used to describe the transit time distribution of a catchment reflecting the contributions of previous input signals to the current hydrological components and this distribution has been successfully applied to the modeling of transit times in contrasting catchments bansah and ali 2019 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 lutz et al 2018 therefore we assumed that the ttds of the various hydrologic subsystems of the catchment belonged to the gamma distribution 6 h τ τ α 1 β α γ α e τ β where α and β are the shape factor and scale factor respectively when α 1 the probability density decreases with increasing transit time when α 1 the gamma distribution is an exponential distribution which indicates that the hydrological components of the catchment can be described as the behavior of continuously mixed reservoirs and is widely used to predict water storage and mixing and when α 1 the probability density of ttds is unimodal we estimated the ttds of hydrological components using the sine wave fitting and convolution integral methods bansah and ali 2019 in different hydrologic years and throughout the whole observation period and then assessed the interannual variability in ttds according to their parameters birkel et al 2016 therefore the parameters of h τ namely ttd in eqs 5 and 6 might vary in different time periods by the gamma distribution s fourier transform kirchner 2016 the mtts are calculated as 7 a x a p 1 2 π f β 2 α 2 8 φ x φ p α arctan 2 π f β 9 mtt τ α β here f is the cycle frequency in eq 2 ax and φx are respectively the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal curves of isotopic compositions in outputs of the catchment and ap and φp are respectively the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal curve in precipitation the young water fraction fyw was calculated as the amplitude ratio of the hydrological component ax to precipitation ap which has been applied effectively to various catchments hu et al 2020 jasechko et al 2016 rusjan et al 2019 song et al 2017 stockinger et al 2017 the age threshold τyw of fyw is calculated as 10 f yw p τ τ yw γ τ yw α β τ 0 τ yw τ α 1 β α γ α e τ β d τ 2 5 statistical analyses the isotopic compositions of all hydrological components were averaged per half month for accurate calculation of the results since the observation frequency of soil plants and groundwater was twice per month on average the mean value of the isotopic composition of precipitation was the volume weighted average during the half month period and those of other hydrological components were taken as the arithmetic mean for the corresponding period because the goodness of the sine wave fitting based on δ2h is slightly better than that based on δ18o for most hydrological components δ2h in all hydrological components was used for the sine wave fitting and then the mtts and fyw were calculated only if the hydrological components had an acceptable fitting performance the uncertainty range of the parameters of ttd was calculated by the standard error of the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal curve and the uncertainty surrounding mtt estimates was quantified by multiplying α and β for each of the behavioral parameter sets and taking the range bansah and ali 2019 additionally the uncertainty in fyw estimates is expressed as a standard error by gaussian methods statistical analysis was conducted using origin 9 0 software originlab usa and spss 22 ibm usa the tukey hsd test in anova was used to analyze differences in isotopic compositions among different hydrological components and the differences in precipitation river water level soil water storage and evapotranspiration 3 results 3 1 isotopic compositions of different hydrological components temporal variations of daily precipitation the water level of xiangjiang river soil water storage and evapotranspiration in the sampling site are illustrated in fig 2 in the study area precipitation shows distinct interannual variation between 2017 from march 2017 to february 2018 and 2018 from march 2018 to february 2019 the accumulated precipitation in 2017 and 2018 is 1676 9 mm and 1377 7 mm respectively which are defined as the wet year and normal year in terms of the mean annual precipitation of 1447 0 mm the mean river water level in the wet year is 31 26 m and higher significantly p 0 05 than that in the normal year 30 78 m there is no significant interannual difference in the average soil water storage at the 0 100 cm soil layer p 0 05 and the average daily evapotranspiration at site 1 in the wet year is smaller significantly p 0 05 than that in the normal year the distributions of δ2h and δ18o values in precipitation soil water xylem water river water and groundwater in the study area are illustrated in fig 3 compared with other hydrological components the isotopic compositions of precipitation exhibit the most pronounced variations ranging from 88 0 to 1 7 for δ2h and from 12 0 to 1 7 for δ18o the volume weighted mean precipitation values mean 1sd for δ2h and δ18o are 43 4 24 0 and 7 1 2 7 respectively the linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o in precipitation lmml local meteoric water line is expressed as δ2h 8 88δ18o 19 94 r2 0 97 n 43 the data points of the dual isotope plot for soil water xylem water river water and groundwater are mainly below the lmwl additionally the data points of δ2h versus δ18o in groundwater are closest to the lmwl and part of the data distribution matches the lmwl the data points for xylem water match shallow soil water 0 60 cm both of which are further away from the lmwl than those for deep soil water 60 130 cm and river water the range of variation of isotopic composition in shallow soil water is larger than that in deep soil water fig 3 and the heavy isotopes in soil water are more depleted than those in other hydrological components the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in xylem water are 47 9 11 5 and 6 7 1 4 respectively the heavy isotopes in river water are the most enriched with the mean of 33 8 5 1 for δ2h and 5 6 0 5 for δ18o the isotopic compositions of groundwater have the smallest range of variation with the mean values of 36 0 2 0 for δ2h and 6 2 0 4 for δ18o 3 2 sine wave fitting of different hydrological components the sine wave fitting results vertical shift amplitude phase lag and accuracy evaluation indexes rmse and nse in different hydrological components are shown in table 1 during the wet year and throughout the whole observation period precipitation soil water at the depths of 0 40 cm xylem water and river water exhibit obvious seasonal isotopic cycles but the goodness of the sine wave fitting for soil water at the depths of 40 130 cm and groundwater are unsatisfactory with the nse 0 5 during the normal year only soil water at the depths of 60 130 cm and groundwater have no obvious sinusoidal variation the goodness of the sine wave fitting for soil water at the depths of 0 40 cm and xylem water in the wet year is higher than that in the normal year according to the sinusoidal curve δ2h in precipitation reaches its highest levels in march and the lowest levels in september during different hydrologic years and throughout the observation period fig 4 δ2h in precipitation exhibits the largest seasonal variation with the highest amplitude among all hydrological components and the sine waves for other hydrological components are damped to varying degrees compared with precipitation the variation for the same hydrological component in the wet year is larger than that in the normal year fig 4 except for soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm in the wet year the vertical offsets of the sinusoidal curves for various hydrological components approximately equal the observed mean isotopic values during different hydrologic years and throughout the whole observation period with the deviations of 2 table 1 implying that the estimation of the isotopic averages in a whole hydrological year with a vertical offset may be appropriate the amplitude of the sinusoidal curve in the wet year is larger than that in the normal year for the same hydrological component the amplitudes of the sinusoidal curves in soil water gradually decrease with depth additionally the lag time phase lag of the sinusoidal curve between a hydrological component and precipitation in the wet year is longer than that in the normal year for the same hydrological component except for soil water at the depths of 10 40 cm the lag times for soil water increase with depth for xylem water the amplitude and lag time are close to those for shallow soil water for river water the amplitude is smaller than that for shallow soil water while the lag time is close to that for soil water at the depths of 0 20 cm 3 3 distribution of transit times for different hydrological components the transit time distributions ttds for different hydrological components are shown in fig 5 calculated by δ2h for the same hydrological component there are some differences in the average probability density and cumulative distribution within a given transit time between the wet year and the normal year with increasing soil depth the flow paths of soil water gradually become longer and the probability density of water flowing out of the system in a short time becomes smaller as well as the cumulative distribution most of the moisture in the upper layer of soil is lost through evaporation plant root uptake seepage etc which occurs more rapidly than in the deeper layer of soil for instance 80 of the soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm is discharged in only 36 d in the wet year and 42 d in the normal year while that of soil water at the depth of 20 40 cm takes 147 d in the wet year and 168 d in the normal year similarly 80 of the xylem water is renewed within 187 d in the wet year and 324 d in the normal year the ttd of river water differs from that of xylem water in that only a small amount of water from the river rapidly exits the hydrological system but much of it flows slowly the ttd of each hydrological component is determined by a shape factor α and a scale factor β the values of α and β of the ttds in soil water at different depths xylem water and river water in the study area are listed in table 2 the values of α of soil water gradually increase with increasing soil depth the values of α in soil water vary from 0 34 to 1 06 and at the depths of 0 20 cm are 1 not so at other depths during two hydrologic years the values of α in xylem water are both 1 in the wet and normal years no matter what year the value of α in river water is the smallest and the value of β is the greatest 3 4 mean transit times and the young water fraction of different hydrological components the mtts of soil water increase with increasing depth which is shorter at the same depth in the wet year than that in the normal year table 2 the mtt of xylem water is 114 d in the wet year similar to that of soil water at the depth of 20 40 cm and is 205 d in the normal year similar to that of soil water at the depth of 40 60 cm the estimated mtt of river water in the catchment is unsatisfactory with a high degree of uncertainty fyw of soil water generally decreases with increasing depth the fyw of xylem water is 0 47 in the wet year and 0 45 in the normal year implying that the xylem water of c camphora contains similar proportion of the young water within the age threshold annually the fyw of river water in the normal year 0 21 is greater than that in the wet year 0 16 although the mtts and fyw of various hydrological components are different the age thresholds τyw of fyw are similar and are closely related to the shape factor α of the ttds fig 6 the τyw of soil water increases with increasing depth 0 40 cm with the range of 59 70 d in the wet year and 52 71 d in the normal year river water has the smallest τyw within the catchment the τyw of xylem water is between that of soil water and river water the τyw of the hydrological components in the catchment increases with increasing α and they have a significant quadratic polynomial relationship wet year τyw 18 69 69 16α 17 07α2 r2 0 99 p 0 001 normal year τyw 16 72 105 34α 52 81α2 r2 0 94 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 ttds of different hydrological components determining the ttds is essential for understanding the flow velocity and flow path of hydrological components in a catchment and they are often difficult to measure directly many studies in the past assumed that the ttd in a catchment is invariant in time bansah and ali 2019 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 lutz et al 2018 tekleab et al 2014 however the ttds of some hydrological components such as soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm xylem water and river water in the catchment varied between different hydrologic years with distinct curves and parameters of ttds in the wet year and normal year fig 5 and table 2 these hydrological components had smaller α 0 35 and larger β in the normal year than in the wet year which resulted in the larger probability density and cumulative distribution within short transit time however with the increase of transit time their probability density and cumulative distribution in the normal year were smaller than in the wet year fig 5 similar results of time variation of interannual ttds were also verified in humid tropical catchments birkel et al 2016 the time variation of ttds was attributed to the time varying precipitation input and the output fig 2 fig 4 and table 1 in this study the precipitation with more depleted heavy isotope in the wet year was 300 mm higher than in the normal year the distinct inter annual precipitation pattern directly affected the flow paths of the above hydrological components however the ttds of soil water at the depths of 10 40 cm were similar in the two hydrologic years indicating that these hydrological components were less affected by interannual precipitation patterns this might be due to the buffering of the surface soil 0 10 cm leading to the relatively lagging response of the lower soil to precipitation previous studies of the ttds of a catchment focused mainly on rivers jasechko et al 2016 however this is insufficient for a comprehensive exploration of the hydrological cycle of the entire critical zone which extends from the top of the vegetation canopy through the soil and down to fresh bedrock and the base of the groundwater grant and dietrich 2017 the various hydrological components are subsystems in the catchment and the water input tends to follow specific flow paths through them there were certain similarities and differences in the ttds among the hydrological components in the catchment the values of shape factor α in soil water at the depths of 0 20 cm xylem water and river water were both 1 0 in two hydrologic years and then the probability density decreased with increasing transit time indicating that they responded rapidly to the input signal which was verified by the short lag times of the sinusoidal curves table 1 however river water had a very large value of scale factor β and its ttd showed a long tailed distribution fig 5 the values of α in soil water ranged from 0 34 to 1 06 which was inconsistent with the results of lee et al 2007 and jung et al 2020 who assumed that the α value of soil water was 1 the values of α in soil water at different depths except for 10 cm depth were greater than that in soil water of pasture reported by dimitrova petrova et al 2020 which might be because their work was conducted on artificially disturbed soil where the transit times of the soil water were shorter than those of the soil in a natural environment the α value of the xylem water of c camphora was 0 34 in the normal year which was smaller than that of h elatus α 0 70 and c racemosa α 0 57 studied by evaristo et al 2019 suggesting that the ttds of transpiration might be species specific brinkmann et al 2018 showed that the age distributions of water taken up by picea abies and fagus sylvatica differed between the two species which might be due to the difference in root distribution between them 4 2 mean transit times of different hydrological components the mtts of soil water increased with increasing depth which was related to the flow path length and might also be related to the behavior of soil evaporation root water uptake and soil moisture movement when precipitation penetrates the soil part of the new water supplies the bound water in small soil pores and then seeps downwards in the form of piston flow other water rapidly enters the deep layer along large pore channels in the form of preferential flow with increasing soil depth the hydraulic conductivity usually decreases leading to the mtts of shallow soil water being typically shorter than those of deep soil water asano et al 2002 the mtt of soil water at the depth of 40 cm 91 104 d in the study area was longer than that reported in jung et al 2020 and lee et al 2007 jung et al 2020 reported that the estimated mtts of soil water collected using a suction cup lysimeter at the depth of 40 cm in a humid temperate headwater catchment was 73 d and lee et al 2007 found that the estimated mtts of soil water at the depth of 30 cm was 74 d however the mtt of soil water at the depth of 60 cm in the normal year was similar to that reported by lee et al 2007 as xylem water was a mixture of soil water with different depths and different mtts the mtt of xylem water was mainly influenced by plant water use sources sprenger et al 2019 the mtts of xylem water were 114 d and 205 d in the wet year and normal year respectively similar to those of shallow soil water that confirmed that c camphora mainly absorbed and utilized shallow soil water rather than deep soil water dai et al 2020 due to little seasonal variation of the isotope in deep soil water and the unsatisfactory sine wave fitting performance nse 0 5 in table 1 we can infer that their mtts are much longer than those of shallow soil water on the contrary there was a good sine fitting performance nse 0 5 for xylem water with shorter mtt the short mtt of xylem water indicated that precipitation travels rapidly to the xylem through the atmosphere soil and the soil root interfaces in the course of various physiological processes such as photosynthesis and transpiration under a water potential gradient soil water containing a precipitation isotopic signal flows through the soil root interface to the xylem and then flows through the blade atmosphere interface and moisture is then returned to the air in the form of water vapor an important output in the water cycle this occurs almost every day and consumes a large amount of soil water storage which may result in a short mtt of xylem water however we failed to estimate the mtts of river water and groundwater with a high degree of uncertainty the possible reason was that the river water samples were collected from the xiangjiang river it is the largest river in the dongting lake drainage system which comprises surface runoff including many tributaries of all levels and subsurface runoff including preferential soil flow lateral flow etc following precipitation events much of the water in the river had a lengthy renewal cycle due to the large storage with an average water level of 31 26 m throughout the observation period additionally the river water contained fast flow and slow flow components jasechko et al 2016 the fast flow components resulted in the time for precipitation to enter the river being relatively short field observation showed that the water level of the river continued to rise substantially after a storm event precipitation in the slow flow components passed through various complex hydrogeological systems and the isotopic signals persisted within the channel for a long time which was verified by the long tail of the river s ttd as a static reservoir groundwater was usually associated with deep soil water and the baseflow of river water the groundwater in the sampling site was difficult to be supplied during the observation period due to a deep water table depth of 18 m even in the wet year which resulted in no obvious seasonal isotopic cycle although it was a useful indicator the lag time of seasonal tracer cycles was often neglected in this study we concluded that the lag times can reflect the response times to input precipitation isotopic signals in different hydrological subsystems reference to fig 4 showed that the input signal would not be rapidly transferred to the hydrological system when the precipitation with the highest isotopic value was input to a system and the hydrological system still responded to the signal of several previous precipitation events the system eventually acquired the signal of precipitation events with the highest isotopic values the time from a signal acquisition was the phase shift of the sine wave between the input and output i e the lag time thus the mtt included not only the lag time but also the time of retention and discharge of the hydrological components in a catchment this explained why the estimated mtts were frequently longer than the lag times table 1 and table 2 which was similar to the results of several other studies asano et al 2002 jung et al 2020 lee et al 2007 therefore the combination of lag times and mtts provides an improved understanding of water ages for the hydrological components in a catchment 4 3 young water fraction of different hydrological components fyw is the proportion of the water younger than the age threshold τyw kirchner 2016 determined the relationship between the shape factor α and τyw τyw 34 64 38 87α 4 60α2 r2 0 99 in a catchment using a thought experiment this was applied in different catchments by gallart et al 2020 lutz et al 2018 song et al 2017 and stockinger et al 2017 however these studies only addressed fyw in a single hydrological component of the catchment river water the interesting thing is the quadratic polynomial relationship between the shape factor α and τyw also held for other hydrological components such as soil water at different depths and xylem water fig 6 and the result throughout the whole period was very similar to that reported by kirchner 2016 we also found a quadratic polynomial relationship between β and τyw for various hydrological components wet year r2 0 78 p 0 05 normal year r2 0 70 p 0 05 but β was far less important than α in explaining the variation of τyw therefore τyw was dominated by the shape factor of the ttd and this relationship can be applied to different hydrological components within the same catchment with the increase of soil depth fyw of soil water gradually decreased in two hydrologic years this could be attributed to the greater frequency of moisture exchange between the atmosphere and soil in the shallow layer compared to the deep layer such as evapotranspiration and precipitation recharge also the temporal variation in the soil water content of the shallow layer was usually more significant than in the deep layer dai et al 2020 although the fyw of xylem water was similar in the wet year 0 47 and normal year 0 45 the mtts of these two years showed distinct differences we cannot rule out the possibility that c camphor absorbed water from different depths and different mtts in the wet year and normal year it has been shown that three economic tree species consumed more deep soil water in a normal year than in a wet year due to the increased precipitation wu et al 2022 this might explain why the xylem water of c camphor had a shorter mtt in the wet year than in the normal year the fyw of river water was 0 16 in the wet year and 0 21 in the normal year which was within the range of fyw in global river reported by jasechko et al 2016 and smaller than the global average 0 26 and larger than that calculated by song et al 2017 the small fyw suggested that the river water consisted of a small proportion of fast flow components and a large proportion of slow flow components the young water was mainly the component of precipitation entering rivers via fast flow slope flow and underground lateral flow but not the slow flow component from underground water and deep flow with very old age hu et al 2020 the difference between these two components provides a basis for water resource management in the catchment for example several soluble pollutants are rapidly discharged into the surface water while other pollutants persist for a long time although we could not estimate the fyw of groundwater using the sine waving fitting method and convolution integral model in the catchment it could be speculated that the flow path of groundwater mainly comprised the slow flow components in the study area 4 4 uncertainty analyses and limitations in this study the mtts and fyw of various hydrological components in the critical zone of the catchment were considered based on two years of stable isotope data semi monthly time scale which provides a reference for understanding water age discharge and storage and contributes to identifying the renewal cycle of hydrological components the migration of pollutants and nutrients and the quantification of the fast flow path in a catchment notably it is very important to analyze the uncertainty in mtts and fyw estimates of hydrological components kirchner 2016 believed that in the river hydrological system of a catchment comprising multiple subsystems with strongly contrasting mtts the mtts were often underestimated based on seasonal tracer cycles due to aggregation bias while fyw was unaffected in this study we assumed that each hydrological component within the critical zone in the catchment is homogeneous and then their mtts can be estimated by sinusoidal fitting based on the seasonal isotopic cycles the uncertainties of the estimates of mtts and fyw were directly derived from seasonal variations in the isotopes of each hydrological component lutz et al 2018 and hu et al 2020 reported that a monthly sampling frequency for precipitation and river water was prone to missing extreme isotopic values which generally resulted in underestimation of the amplitude of the sinusoidal curve however we found that the amplitude of the sinusoidal curve in semi monthly precipitation was greater than that in daily precipitation fig s3 when we considered the isotopic signal of daily precipitation as input the mtts and fyw of each hydrological component could be overestimated and underestimated respectively with the decrease of the fyw of the hydrological component the degree of damping in isotopic signals of each hydrological component relative to that of precipitation gradually increased and the mtts and uncertainty ranges of each hydrological component also gradually increased but the uncertainty ranges of the corresponding fyw were usually unchanged table 2 this reflected the robustness of fyw as an alternative indicator of the water age of a hydrological component although the goodness of the sine wave fitting for river water was good with the nse value of 0 5 the mtt estimates showed a lot of uncertainty which might be attributed to the small proportion of young water components additionally there was unsatisfactory goodness of the sine wave fitting for deep soil water and groundwater nse 0 5 such hydrological subsystems were often hard to receive precipitation isotope signals and then release them within a certain time threshold that reflected the limitation of the use of conservative tracers in estimating the transit time of the hydrological components dominated by old water as stewart et al 2010 2012 reported stable isotope methods cannot see water older than 4 years although sine wave fitting can be performed on sparse irregularly sampled data sets not all hydrologic components have satisfactory goodness of the sine wave fitting in a catchment table 1 therefore the combination of a diverse range of methodologies and different tracers for water ages of hydrologic components within the critical zone will be the focus of our future research 5 conclusions continuous observations of the isotopic compositions of different hydrological components in the subtropical humid catchment revealed the occurrence of sinusoidal variations in different hydrologic years precipitation shallow soil water except for the depth of 40 60 cm in the wet year xylem water and river water showed obvious sinusoidal variations the seasonal isotopic cycles of various hydrological components had different attenuations and phase shifts relative to those of precipitation there were no obvious seasonal isotopic cycles for deep soil water and groundwater due to their long flow paths the inter annual variation of the ttds for various hydrological components in the catchment was identified distinct parameters of the ttds for soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm xylem water and river water between the wet year and normal year were found but the ttds for soil water at the depths of 10 40 cm were relative stable annually the mtts of soil water increased with increasing depth and the fyw decreased with increasing depth similar to the soil water in the root zone the fyw and mtt of xylem water in the wet year was larger and shorter than that in the normal year respectively the river water consisted of a small proportion of fast flow components and a large proportion of slow flow components with the young water accounting for 16 in the wet year and 21 in the normal year also the τyw of hydrological components in the catchment was mainly controlled by the shape factor of

3068,transit times and the young water fraction fyw the proportion of the water younger than a certain age threshold τyw can help characterize the hydrological behaviors within a catchment previous studies of water age have concentrated on individual catchment hydrological components such as river water groundwater plant water or soil water which hinders the dynamic linking of various hydrological components in the critical zone in this study the isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water xylem water river water and groundwater in a subtropical catchment in china were continuously monitored for two years we found that the seasonal isotopic cycles of shallow soil water 0 60 cm xylem water and river water had different attenuations and phase shifts relative to those of precipitation there were no obvious seasonal isotopic cycles of deep soil water 60 130 cm and groundwater additionally the transit time distributions ttds of soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm xylem water and river water in the catchment varied between the wet year and normal year with increasing depth the mean transit times mtts of soil water increased and the fyw decreased for xylem water and soil water the mtts and fyw in the wet year were shorter and larger than those in the normal year respectively the river water consisted of a small proportion of fast flow components and a large proportion of slow flow components with the young water accounting for 16 in the wet year and 21 in the normal year our results contribute to an improved understanding of water ages flow paths and linkages of different hydrological components in the critical zone at the catchment scale keywords stable isotopes mean transit time young water fraction water age lag time seasonal cycle critical zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the time taken by water to pass through the catchment hydrological cycle and the critical zone i e water age has broad implications for the management of water resources in terms of both quantity and quality and thus it is of increasing interest in earth system science hu et al 2020 sprenger et al 2019 the mean transit time mtt an important parameter in a catchment can provide insights into hydrological processes and hence can help understand the heterogeneities of water flow paths and serve as a tool for the construction and assessment of hydrological models farrick and branfireun 2015 hu et al 2020 jung et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 tekleab et al 2014 the assessment of hydrologic transit times and streamflow components is becoming increasingly important as the focus of hydrological research has shifted from the quantitative estimation of water flux to the quantitative analysis of which specific water components are more mobile in discharge and which are less mobile in storage mcdonnell 2017 sprenger et al 2019 the mtt has an obvious physical interpretation the ratio of the stored mobile water volume to the average water flux leaving the system under steady state conditions bolin and rodhe 1973 kirchner 2016 however it is often difficult to quantify the storage volume and mean water flux in the hydrological components of a basin since very variable results are produced by the water balance approach sprenger et al 2019 given the limitations of this traditional method the estimation of mtt using isotopic techniques has received much attention mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 tekleab et al 2014 although comprising a small proportion in nature the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes 2h and 18o in water as conservative geochemical tracers are powerful tools for identifying water sources flow paths and hydrological processes on different spatial and temporal scales hu et al 2020 jasechko et al 2016 to estimate the mean transit time the transit time distribution function ttd of the hydrological component in a catchment should first be determined usually estimates of ttd are based on the relationship of seasonal tracer cycles between the input precipitation and the output river water soil water groundwater etc in the hydrological system with the input tracer signal being damped and shifted by mixing along different flow paths jung et al 2020 kirchner 2016 sprenger et al 2019 unfortunately in heterogeneous catchments determining ttd is very difficult and the estimation of mtt based on seasonal tracer cycles is susceptible to aggregation bias resulting in the underestimation of the true mtt kirchner 2016 jasechko et al 2016 however the young water fraction fyw the proportion of water younger than an age threshold can be reliably estimated using seasonal tracer cycles in heterogeneous catchments and therefore it is considered as an alternative indicator of the mtt of a hydrological component kirchner 2016 fyw differs from the proportion of new water in hydrograph separation which partitions the runoff into event water from the current storm and the stored pre event water klaus and mcdonnell 2013 additionally the event based new water cannot identify the water age during the non storm period jasechko et al 2016 following observations that the seasonal tracer cycles of different hydrological components in a catchment follow a sinusoidal curve there is increasing interest in the estimation of mtt assuming that the ttd is known and fyw using parameters such as the phase shift and amplitude damping calculated by sine wave fitting to seasonal isotopic variations in the input and output asano et al 2002 dewalle et al 1997 lee et al 2007 rusjan et al 2019 tekleab et al 2014 wang et al 2020 the major advantage of this approach is that it can be performed on isotopic datasets with sparse and irregular sampling farrick and branfireun 2015 kirchner 2016 tekleab et al 2014 although plant transpiration is one of the main factors controlling the global terrestrial hydrological cycle accounting for 80 of total terrestrial evapotranspiration jasechko et al 2013 and has been a subject of much concern in various disciplines there have been few studies of the mtt the time that a rainwater drop takes to travel through the soil atmosphere and soil plant interfaces and fyw for plant xylem water since xylem water is derived from soil water in the root zone replenished by precipitation the isotopic composition of xylem water may exhibit an obvious seasonal variation similar to that of precipitation this variation was observed in cinnamomum camphora dai et al 2020 and three coniferous plants yang et al 2015 in the east asian monsoon region china most studies of mtts and fyw have concentrated on individual hydrological components such as river water groundwater etc within a specific catchment in the past so it is difficult to identify the hydrological processes of an entire catchment system sprenger et al 2019 however a comparison of the mtt and fyw of different hydrological components within the same catchment is more helpful in characterizing the flow paths of hydrological components in the critical zone and the possible connectivity between them after atmospheric precipitation infiltrates into the vadose zone it is absorbed by plant roots for transpiration or photosynthesis and then returns to the atmosphere the foregoing raises the following specific questions how long does this process take on average what percentage of the young water can be rapidly returned to the atmosphere speeding up the regional hydrological cycle what percentage of old water remains stored within the vadose zone or is transported along the plant flow path atmosphere soil root stem leaf generally speaking the mtt and fyw of plant water are similar to those of the soil water in the root zone which helps determine whether a plant has a deep or shallow root system in addition the relationship between the water age of soil and soil depth helps increase our understanding of soil water movement for river water understanding the proportion of precipitation that rapidly replenishes river water by fast flow mainly young water and the proportion of precipitation replenishment of river water by slow flow mainly old water can serve to indicate the migration and enrichment of pollutants an additional question is whether we can determine the dynamic relationship between groundwater and river water by estimating mtt and fyw these important questions are addressed in the present study major progress has been made in determining water ages and source water contributions of hydrological components in humid subtropical catchments in china including for soil water springs and streams with a karst catchment in southwest china chen et al 2017 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 and river water and groundwater in the yongan watershed in southeastern china hu et al 2020 however the previous research concentrated on an individual catchment hydrological component and the results are insufficient for comprehensively estimating the transit times and young water fraction of each hydrological component within the critical zone at the catchment scale which contains the top of the vegetation and the bottom of the groundwater storage most previous studies considered the ttds of a catchment to be time invariant during the observation period bansah and ali 2019 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 lutz et al 2018 tekleab et al 2014 but some recent studies advocated the use of nonstationary ttds instead birkel et al 2016 harman 2015 whether the ttds are time varying in a subtropical catchment remains to be determined in the present study stable isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water plant xylem water river water and groundwater were continuously monitored for two years in the lower reaches of the xiangjiang river catchment one of the main tributaries of the yangtze river in china the seasonal isotopic cycles of hydrological components were analyzed in the catchment the objectives of the study were 1 to determine the ttds of various hydrological components and assess the interannual variability in ttds using the convolution integral model and 2 to estimate and compare the mtts and fyw of various hydrological components these findings are expected to gain insight into water ages flow paths and linkages of different hydrological components in the critical zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the investigated catchment is part of the lower reaches of the xiangjiang river basin it is located in changsha hunan province china in the transition zone from the hills of central hunan to the plain of dongting lake cretaceous and quaternary strata are well developed and the bedrock is mainly cretaceous clastic rocks and sinian slates the terrain of the study area is mainly divided into denuded tectonic hills and river erosion accumulation the groundwater is mainly pore water and fissure water reflecting the porous substrate and abundance of loose rock the area has a subtropical monsoon climate characterized by hot and wet summers and cold and dry winters mean annual precipitation mean annual evaporation and annual mean temperature are 1447 mm 902 mm and 17 4 c respectively it should be noted that the annual mean evaporation was calculated from the daily observed evaporation at the local weather station site 2 in fig 1 from january 2015 to december 2017 using an evaporator e 601b the location of the study area and the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 site 1 an ecohydrological observation station is located in wangcheng district changsha 28 37 n 112 76 e 50 m a s l where throughfall soil water plant xylem water and groundwater samples were collected the sample plot is a low hillslope with a flat terrain slope 3 with red soil with a silty clay loam texture with increasing depth the soil bulk density increases from 1 16 to 1 40 g cm 3 and the soil porosity decreases from 56 2 to 47 2 the vegetation of the plot is dominated by cinnamomum camphora 90 with pinus massoniana and cunninghamia lanceolata and sparse herbaceous plants c camphora was selected for sampling in this study due to its widespread local distribution important ecological and economic function and weak drought tolerance it is very susceptible to the seasonal drought that is prone to occur in the area the average age and height of the sample trees are 13 yr and 9 m respectively roots are concentrated within the depth interval of 0 60 cm root weight density of 72 3 and lateral roots were well developed site 2 the weather station of hunan normal university is located in yuelu district changsha 28 19 n 112 94 e 59 m a s l continuous precipitation sampling for isotopic analysis has been conducted for 10 years site 3 juzizhou an alluvial sandbank in the downstream section of the xiangjiang river is located in yuelu district changsha 28 20 n 112 96 e 29 m a s l where river water samples were collected the sampling site is located in the center of the river channel where the flow is greater than in the margins so that the samples are representative xiangjiang river the largest river in the dongting lake system flows through changsha city from south to north and is the major river in the study area with a large discharge 2 2 sampling and measurements the soil volumetric water content swc cm3 cm 3 at 0 100 cm depth was monitored at 1 h intervals from february 2017 using fdr systems rwet 100 xi an saimorui environmental technology limited china at site 1 an area of 20 40 m2 the probes were located at 10 cm intervals to the depth of 100 cm and were calibrated by the oven drying method the soil water storage sws mm was calculated from swc and soil depth and the evapotranspiration at site 1 was calculated by the soil water balance method ma et al 2020 the soil water and xylem water of c camphora were sampled at site 1 from march 2017 to february 2019 with a high sampling frequency twice per month on average three replicate soil samples were taken from different cores using a soil corer driven by a percussion hammer christie engineering pty ltd australia soil samples were collected every 10 cm to the depth of 130 cm and were sealed in glass bottles for xylem samples lignified branches of c camphora 4 cm in length and 1 5 cm in diameter were cut from the south side of 3 4 actively growing trees located near the soil samples the bark was quickly removed before each sample was sealed in a glass bottle all samples were numbered and frozen 15 c until the water was extracted using an automatic cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica united technology ltd china for stable isotopic analysis from april 2017 to january 2019 groundwater was sampled from a domestic well located 30 m away from site 1 the well is 20 m deep and the groundwater level is 18 m which was measured by a nylon rope according to the elevation of the water level in the well relative to the ground surface the water in the well was pumped through the pipeline for 30 min flow rate of 1 m3 h 1 before water samples were collected and the sampling frequency was consistent with that used for the soil samples from march 2017 to february 2019 precipitation samples precipitation 0 1 mm were collected at 08 00 and 20 00 beijing time from a collector consisting of a modified siphon rain gauge at site 2 on rainy days additionally river water samples were collected at site 3 on the 1st 6th 11th 16th 21st and 26th of each month from 20 cm below the river surface to ensure that the sample was completely mixed and to avoid isotopic evaporative fractionation samples of precipitation river water and groundwater were sealed in polyethylene vials numbered and stored at a low temperature 4 c isotopic compositions of all water samples were analyzed using a cavity ring down spectroscopy isotopic water analyzer model 35ep los gatos research inc usa isotopic ratios δ2h and δ18o are expressed using the conventional delta notation δ δ sample r sample r v smow 1 1000 where r sample and r v smow are the isotope ratios 2h 1h 18o 16o of water samples and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow respectively the accuracy of the isotopic analysis is 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δ2h in this study methanol contamination was found only in xylem water samples which interfered with the isotopic analyses thus a correction was required for the original isotopic data from xylem water which is described in luo et al 2019 stockinger et al 2017 suggested that isotopes in precipitation are significantly fractionated during the process of water movement through the plant canopy to the ground which will potentially influence the estimation of stream water transit times we compared the δ2h δ18o and d excess d excess δ2h 8δ18o which is often used to infer the isotopic evaporative fractionation in hydrological components according to wu et al 2021 in the precipitation samples with those of the throughfall samples of site 1 to test the occurrence of isotopic fractionation in the study area fig s1 in the supplementary material throughfall samples were collected from 15 collectors from april 2018 to february 2019 21 rainfall events in total we found no significant difference in δ2h δ18o and d excess between precipitation and throughfall p 0 05 this indicates that canopy interception did not affect the isotopic tracer signal of precipitation at site 1 as shown in fig s1 there was also no significant isotopic difference between the precipitation samples collected from site 1 and those from site 2 from april 2018 to february 2019 p 0 05 additionally the magnitude of the precipitation events between site 1 and site 2 were very similar according to luo et al 2019 therefore the high frequency precipitation data collected at site 2 reliably represent the isotopic composition and amount of precipitation in the study area 2 3 sine wave fitting the isotopic compositions of precipitation soil water xylem water river water and groundwater sampled at a high frequency might exhibit a sinusoidal pattern of variations which was observed in previous studies jódar et al 2016 jung et al 2020 lee et al 2007 wang et al 2020 thus we used a sine wave fitting method to match seasonal isotopic cycles of different hydrological components to obtain critical parameters such as amplitude phase and vertical offset kirchner 2016 the sine wave is defined as 2 c t a sin 2π f t φ k here c t is the tracer signal δ2h or δ18o in hydrological components at time t and a f φ and k are the cycle amplitude and frequency f 365 d 1 phase and vertical offset respectively it should be noted that in this study only rainfall events with daily precipitation 3 7 mm were analyzed to improve the accuracy of the sine wave fitting which is shown in fig s2 of the supplementary material this is because in the case of small precipitation events daily precipitation 3 7 mm the precipitation contribution to soil moisture was very small due to forest canopy interception and litter retention and the heavy isotopes in precipitation were enriched by secondary evaporation dai et al 2020 in addition evaporation effects on various hydrological components were neglected due to the weak influence of evaporation on the isotopic composition of waters at the study site in a subtropical humid region which can be verified by the results of the isotopic ratios below the root mean square error rmse and the nash efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate the sine wave fitting for different hydrological components these two indicators are often used to estimate the goodness of fit of hydrological models gupta et al 2009 jung et al 2020 the equations are defined as 3 r m s e t 1 n y t obs y t sim 2 n 4 n s e 1 t 1 n y t obs y t sim 2 t 1 n y t obs y 2 here y t obs and y t sim are the observed and simulated values of isotopic compositions at time t respectively and y is the mean of the observed isotopic data in the interval 0 0 to inf the lower the rmse the better the model fit and in the interval inf to 1 0 the greater the nse the better the model fit in this study values between 0 5 and 1 0 are viewed as acceptable levels of performance moriasi et al 2007 2 4 mean transit times and the young water fraction as the major water source of a catchment precipitation mixes the hydrological components after they enter the hydrological system resulting in amplitude damping and a phase shift of the isotopic signals which may be retained for some time before exiting the hydrological system we assumed that the output tracer signal cout can be simulated through a convolution of the catchment s transit time distribution ttd also called the system response function with the tracer time series in the input cin asano et al 2002 kirchner 2016 the convolution integral models of different hydrologic years are expressed as 5a c out t 1 0 h τ 1 c in t 1 τ 1 d τ 1 5b c out t 2 0 h τ 2 c in t 2 τ 2 d τ 2 5c c out t 3 0 h τ 3 c in t 3 τ 3 d τ 3 where t1 t2 and t3 are the time t in wet year normal year and throughout the whole observation period respectively τ1 τ2 and τ3 are the transit times in wet year normal year and throughout the whole observation period respectively cout t is the isotopic composition of the hydrological components in the catchment at time t cin t τ is the isotopic composition of precipitation at any previous time t τ and h τ is the distribution of transit times τ within the system notably we only tried to identify the possible inter annual variation in ttds for different hydrological components of the catchment rather than intra annual variation kirchner 2016 suggested that the gamma family distribution can be used to describe the transit time distribution of a catchment reflecting the contributions of previous input signals to the current hydrological components and this distribution has been successfully applied to the modeling of transit times in contrasting catchments bansah and ali 2019 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 lutz et al 2018 therefore we assumed that the ttds of the various hydrologic subsystems of the catchment belonged to the gamma distribution 6 h τ τ α 1 β α γ α e τ β where α and β are the shape factor and scale factor respectively when α 1 the probability density decreases with increasing transit time when α 1 the gamma distribution is an exponential distribution which indicates that the hydrological components of the catchment can be described as the behavior of continuously mixed reservoirs and is widely used to predict water storage and mixing and when α 1 the probability density of ttds is unimodal we estimated the ttds of hydrological components using the sine wave fitting and convolution integral methods bansah and ali 2019 in different hydrologic years and throughout the whole observation period and then assessed the interannual variability in ttds according to their parameters birkel et al 2016 therefore the parameters of h τ namely ttd in eqs 5 and 6 might vary in different time periods by the gamma distribution s fourier transform kirchner 2016 the mtts are calculated as 7 a x a p 1 2 π f β 2 α 2 8 φ x φ p α arctan 2 π f β 9 mtt τ α β here f is the cycle frequency in eq 2 ax and φx are respectively the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal curves of isotopic compositions in outputs of the catchment and ap and φp are respectively the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal curve in precipitation the young water fraction fyw was calculated as the amplitude ratio of the hydrological component ax to precipitation ap which has been applied effectively to various catchments hu et al 2020 jasechko et al 2016 rusjan et al 2019 song et al 2017 stockinger et al 2017 the age threshold τyw of fyw is calculated as 10 f yw p τ τ yw γ τ yw α β τ 0 τ yw τ α 1 β α γ α e τ β d τ 2 5 statistical analyses the isotopic compositions of all hydrological components were averaged per half month for accurate calculation of the results since the observation frequency of soil plants and groundwater was twice per month on average the mean value of the isotopic composition of precipitation was the volume weighted average during the half month period and those of other hydrological components were taken as the arithmetic mean for the corresponding period because the goodness of the sine wave fitting based on δ2h is slightly better than that based on δ18o for most hydrological components δ2h in all hydrological components was used for the sine wave fitting and then the mtts and fyw were calculated only if the hydrological components had an acceptable fitting performance the uncertainty range of the parameters of ttd was calculated by the standard error of the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal curve and the uncertainty surrounding mtt estimates was quantified by multiplying α and β for each of the behavioral parameter sets and taking the range bansah and ali 2019 additionally the uncertainty in fyw estimates is expressed as a standard error by gaussian methods statistical analysis was conducted using origin 9 0 software originlab usa and spss 22 ibm usa the tukey hsd test in anova was used to analyze differences in isotopic compositions among different hydrological components and the differences in precipitation river water level soil water storage and evapotranspiration 3 results 3 1 isotopic compositions of different hydrological components temporal variations of daily precipitation the water level of xiangjiang river soil water storage and evapotranspiration in the sampling site are illustrated in fig 2 in the study area precipitation shows distinct interannual variation between 2017 from march 2017 to february 2018 and 2018 from march 2018 to february 2019 the accumulated precipitation in 2017 and 2018 is 1676 9 mm and 1377 7 mm respectively which are defined as the wet year and normal year in terms of the mean annual precipitation of 1447 0 mm the mean river water level in the wet year is 31 26 m and higher significantly p 0 05 than that in the normal year 30 78 m there is no significant interannual difference in the average soil water storage at the 0 100 cm soil layer p 0 05 and the average daily evapotranspiration at site 1 in the wet year is smaller significantly p 0 05 than that in the normal year the distributions of δ2h and δ18o values in precipitation soil water xylem water river water and groundwater in the study area are illustrated in fig 3 compared with other hydrological components the isotopic compositions of precipitation exhibit the most pronounced variations ranging from 88 0 to 1 7 for δ2h and from 12 0 to 1 7 for δ18o the volume weighted mean precipitation values mean 1sd for δ2h and δ18o are 43 4 24 0 and 7 1 2 7 respectively the linear relationship between δ2h and δ18o in precipitation lmml local meteoric water line is expressed as δ2h 8 88δ18o 19 94 r2 0 97 n 43 the data points of the dual isotope plot for soil water xylem water river water and groundwater are mainly below the lmwl additionally the data points of δ2h versus δ18o in groundwater are closest to the lmwl and part of the data distribution matches the lmwl the data points for xylem water match shallow soil water 0 60 cm both of which are further away from the lmwl than those for deep soil water 60 130 cm and river water the range of variation of isotopic composition in shallow soil water is larger than that in deep soil water fig 3 and the heavy isotopes in soil water are more depleted than those in other hydrological components the mean values of δ2h and δ18o in xylem water are 47 9 11 5 and 6 7 1 4 respectively the heavy isotopes in river water are the most enriched with the mean of 33 8 5 1 for δ2h and 5 6 0 5 for δ18o the isotopic compositions of groundwater have the smallest range of variation with the mean values of 36 0 2 0 for δ2h and 6 2 0 4 for δ18o 3 2 sine wave fitting of different hydrological components the sine wave fitting results vertical shift amplitude phase lag and accuracy evaluation indexes rmse and nse in different hydrological components are shown in table 1 during the wet year and throughout the whole observation period precipitation soil water at the depths of 0 40 cm xylem water and river water exhibit obvious seasonal isotopic cycles but the goodness of the sine wave fitting for soil water at the depths of 40 130 cm and groundwater are unsatisfactory with the nse 0 5 during the normal year only soil water at the depths of 60 130 cm and groundwater have no obvious sinusoidal variation the goodness of the sine wave fitting for soil water at the depths of 0 40 cm and xylem water in the wet year is higher than that in the normal year according to the sinusoidal curve δ2h in precipitation reaches its highest levels in march and the lowest levels in september during different hydrologic years and throughout the observation period fig 4 δ2h in precipitation exhibits the largest seasonal variation with the highest amplitude among all hydrological components and the sine waves for other hydrological components are damped to varying degrees compared with precipitation the variation for the same hydrological component in the wet year is larger than that in the normal year fig 4 except for soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm in the wet year the vertical offsets of the sinusoidal curves for various hydrological components approximately equal the observed mean isotopic values during different hydrologic years and throughout the whole observation period with the deviations of 2 table 1 implying that the estimation of the isotopic averages in a whole hydrological year with a vertical offset may be appropriate the amplitude of the sinusoidal curve in the wet year is larger than that in the normal year for the same hydrological component the amplitudes of the sinusoidal curves in soil water gradually decrease with depth additionally the lag time phase lag of the sinusoidal curve between a hydrological component and precipitation in the wet year is longer than that in the normal year for the same hydrological component except for soil water at the depths of 10 40 cm the lag times for soil water increase with depth for xylem water the amplitude and lag time are close to those for shallow soil water for river water the amplitude is smaller than that for shallow soil water while the lag time is close to that for soil water at the depths of 0 20 cm 3 3 distribution of transit times for different hydrological components the transit time distributions ttds for different hydrological components are shown in fig 5 calculated by δ2h for the same hydrological component there are some differences in the average probability density and cumulative distribution within a given transit time between the wet year and the normal year with increasing soil depth the flow paths of soil water gradually become longer and the probability density of water flowing out of the system in a short time becomes smaller as well as the cumulative distribution most of the moisture in the upper layer of soil is lost through evaporation plant root uptake seepage etc which occurs more rapidly than in the deeper layer of soil for instance 80 of the soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm is discharged in only 36 d in the wet year and 42 d in the normal year while that of soil water at the depth of 20 40 cm takes 147 d in the wet year and 168 d in the normal year similarly 80 of the xylem water is renewed within 187 d in the wet year and 324 d in the normal year the ttd of river water differs from that of xylem water in that only a small amount of water from the river rapidly exits the hydrological system but much of it flows slowly the ttd of each hydrological component is determined by a shape factor α and a scale factor β the values of α and β of the ttds in soil water at different depths xylem water and river water in the study area are listed in table 2 the values of α of soil water gradually increase with increasing soil depth the values of α in soil water vary from 0 34 to 1 06 and at the depths of 0 20 cm are 1 not so at other depths during two hydrologic years the values of α in xylem water are both 1 in the wet and normal years no matter what year the value of α in river water is the smallest and the value of β is the greatest 3 4 mean transit times and the young water fraction of different hydrological components the mtts of soil water increase with increasing depth which is shorter at the same depth in the wet year than that in the normal year table 2 the mtt of xylem water is 114 d in the wet year similar to that of soil water at the depth of 20 40 cm and is 205 d in the normal year similar to that of soil water at the depth of 40 60 cm the estimated mtt of river water in the catchment is unsatisfactory with a high degree of uncertainty fyw of soil water generally decreases with increasing depth the fyw of xylem water is 0 47 in the wet year and 0 45 in the normal year implying that the xylem water of c camphora contains similar proportion of the young water within the age threshold annually the fyw of river water in the normal year 0 21 is greater than that in the wet year 0 16 although the mtts and fyw of various hydrological components are different the age thresholds τyw of fyw are similar and are closely related to the shape factor α of the ttds fig 6 the τyw of soil water increases with increasing depth 0 40 cm with the range of 59 70 d in the wet year and 52 71 d in the normal year river water has the smallest τyw within the catchment the τyw of xylem water is between that of soil water and river water the τyw of the hydrological components in the catchment increases with increasing α and they have a significant quadratic polynomial relationship wet year τyw 18 69 69 16α 17 07α2 r2 0 99 p 0 001 normal year τyw 16 72 105 34α 52 81α2 r2 0 94 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 ttds of different hydrological components determining the ttds is essential for understanding the flow velocity and flow path of hydrological components in a catchment and they are often difficult to measure directly many studies in the past assumed that the ttd in a catchment is invariant in time bansah and ali 2019 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 lutz et al 2018 tekleab et al 2014 however the ttds of some hydrological components such as soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm xylem water and river water in the catchment varied between different hydrologic years with distinct curves and parameters of ttds in the wet year and normal year fig 5 and table 2 these hydrological components had smaller α 0 35 and larger β in the normal year than in the wet year which resulted in the larger probability density and cumulative distribution within short transit time however with the increase of transit time their probability density and cumulative distribution in the normal year were smaller than in the wet year fig 5 similar results of time variation of interannual ttds were also verified in humid tropical catchments birkel et al 2016 the time variation of ttds was attributed to the time varying precipitation input and the output fig 2 fig 4 and table 1 in this study the precipitation with more depleted heavy isotope in the wet year was 300 mm higher than in the normal year the distinct inter annual precipitation pattern directly affected the flow paths of the above hydrological components however the ttds of soil water at the depths of 10 40 cm were similar in the two hydrologic years indicating that these hydrological components were less affected by interannual precipitation patterns this might be due to the buffering of the surface soil 0 10 cm leading to the relatively lagging response of the lower soil to precipitation previous studies of the ttds of a catchment focused mainly on rivers jasechko et al 2016 however this is insufficient for a comprehensive exploration of the hydrological cycle of the entire critical zone which extends from the top of the vegetation canopy through the soil and down to fresh bedrock and the base of the groundwater grant and dietrich 2017 the various hydrological components are subsystems in the catchment and the water input tends to follow specific flow paths through them there were certain similarities and differences in the ttds among the hydrological components in the catchment the values of shape factor α in soil water at the depths of 0 20 cm xylem water and river water were both 1 0 in two hydrologic years and then the probability density decreased with increasing transit time indicating that they responded rapidly to the input signal which was verified by the short lag times of the sinusoidal curves table 1 however river water had a very large value of scale factor β and its ttd showed a long tailed distribution fig 5 the values of α in soil water ranged from 0 34 to 1 06 which was inconsistent with the results of lee et al 2007 and jung et al 2020 who assumed that the α value of soil water was 1 the values of α in soil water at different depths except for 10 cm depth were greater than that in soil water of pasture reported by dimitrova petrova et al 2020 which might be because their work was conducted on artificially disturbed soil where the transit times of the soil water were shorter than those of the soil in a natural environment the α value of the xylem water of c camphora was 0 34 in the normal year which was smaller than that of h elatus α 0 70 and c racemosa α 0 57 studied by evaristo et al 2019 suggesting that the ttds of transpiration might be species specific brinkmann et al 2018 showed that the age distributions of water taken up by picea abies and fagus sylvatica differed between the two species which might be due to the difference in root distribution between them 4 2 mean transit times of different hydrological components the mtts of soil water increased with increasing depth which was related to the flow path length and might also be related to the behavior of soil evaporation root water uptake and soil moisture movement when precipitation penetrates the soil part of the new water supplies the bound water in small soil pores and then seeps downwards in the form of piston flow other water rapidly enters the deep layer along large pore channels in the form of preferential flow with increasing soil depth the hydraulic conductivity usually decreases leading to the mtts of shallow soil water being typically shorter than those of deep soil water asano et al 2002 the mtt of soil water at the depth of 40 cm 91 104 d in the study area was longer than that reported in jung et al 2020 and lee et al 2007 jung et al 2020 reported that the estimated mtts of soil water collected using a suction cup lysimeter at the depth of 40 cm in a humid temperate headwater catchment was 73 d and lee et al 2007 found that the estimated mtts of soil water at the depth of 30 cm was 74 d however the mtt of soil water at the depth of 60 cm in the normal year was similar to that reported by lee et al 2007 as xylem water was a mixture of soil water with different depths and different mtts the mtt of xylem water was mainly influenced by plant water use sources sprenger et al 2019 the mtts of xylem water were 114 d and 205 d in the wet year and normal year respectively similar to those of shallow soil water that confirmed that c camphora mainly absorbed and utilized shallow soil water rather than deep soil water dai et al 2020 due to little seasonal variation of the isotope in deep soil water and the unsatisfactory sine wave fitting performance nse 0 5 in table 1 we can infer that their mtts are much longer than those of shallow soil water on the contrary there was a good sine fitting performance nse 0 5 for xylem water with shorter mtt the short mtt of xylem water indicated that precipitation travels rapidly to the xylem through the atmosphere soil and the soil root interfaces in the course of various physiological processes such as photosynthesis and transpiration under a water potential gradient soil water containing a precipitation isotopic signal flows through the soil root interface to the xylem and then flows through the blade atmosphere interface and moisture is then returned to the air in the form of water vapor an important output in the water cycle this occurs almost every day and consumes a large amount of soil water storage which may result in a short mtt of xylem water however we failed to estimate the mtts of river water and groundwater with a high degree of uncertainty the possible reason was that the river water samples were collected from the xiangjiang river it is the largest river in the dongting lake drainage system which comprises surface runoff including many tributaries of all levels and subsurface runoff including preferential soil flow lateral flow etc following precipitation events much of the water in the river had a lengthy renewal cycle due to the large storage with an average water level of 31 26 m throughout the observation period additionally the river water contained fast flow and slow flow components jasechko et al 2016 the fast flow components resulted in the time for precipitation to enter the river being relatively short field observation showed that the water level of the river continued to rise substantially after a storm event precipitation in the slow flow components passed through various complex hydrogeological systems and the isotopic signals persisted within the channel for a long time which was verified by the long tail of the river s ttd as a static reservoir groundwater was usually associated with deep soil water and the baseflow of river water the groundwater in the sampling site was difficult to be supplied during the observation period due to a deep water table depth of 18 m even in the wet year which resulted in no obvious seasonal isotopic cycle although it was a useful indicator the lag time of seasonal tracer cycles was often neglected in this study we concluded that the lag times can reflect the response times to input precipitation isotopic signals in different hydrological subsystems reference to fig 4 showed that the input signal would not be rapidly transferred to the hydrological system when the precipitation with the highest isotopic value was input to a system and the hydrological system still responded to the signal of several previous precipitation events the system eventually acquired the signal of precipitation events with the highest isotopic values the time from a signal acquisition was the phase shift of the sine wave between the input and output i e the lag time thus the mtt included not only the lag time but also the time of retention and discharge of the hydrological components in a catchment this explained why the estimated mtts were frequently longer than the lag times table 1 and table 2 which was similar to the results of several other studies asano et al 2002 jung et al 2020 lee et al 2007 therefore the combination of lag times and mtts provides an improved understanding of water ages for the hydrological components in a catchment 4 3 young water fraction of different hydrological components fyw is the proportion of the water younger than the age threshold τyw kirchner 2016 determined the relationship between the shape factor α and τyw τyw 34 64 38 87α 4 60α2 r2 0 99 in a catchment using a thought experiment this was applied in different catchments by gallart et al 2020 lutz et al 2018 song et al 2017 and stockinger et al 2017 however these studies only addressed fyw in a single hydrological component of the catchment river water the interesting thing is the quadratic polynomial relationship between the shape factor α and τyw also held for other hydrological components such as soil water at different depths and xylem water fig 6 and the result throughout the whole period was very similar to that reported by kirchner 2016 we also found a quadratic polynomial relationship between β and τyw for various hydrological components wet year r2 0 78 p 0 05 normal year r2 0 70 p 0 05 but β was far less important than α in explaining the variation of τyw therefore τyw was dominated by the shape factor of the ttd and this relationship can be applied to different hydrological components within the same catchment with the increase of soil depth fyw of soil water gradually decreased in two hydrologic years this could be attributed to the greater frequency of moisture exchange between the atmosphere and soil in the shallow layer compared to the deep layer such as evapotranspiration and precipitation recharge also the temporal variation in the soil water content of the shallow layer was usually more significant than in the deep layer dai et al 2020 although the fyw of xylem water was similar in the wet year 0 47 and normal year 0 45 the mtts of these two years showed distinct differences we cannot rule out the possibility that c camphor absorbed water from different depths and different mtts in the wet year and normal year it has been shown that three economic tree species consumed more deep soil water in a normal year than in a wet year due to the increased precipitation wu et al 2022 this might explain why the xylem water of c camphor had a shorter mtt in the wet year than in the normal year the fyw of river water was 0 16 in the wet year and 0 21 in the normal year which was within the range of fyw in global river reported by jasechko et al 2016 and smaller than the global average 0 26 and larger than that calculated by song et al 2017 the small fyw suggested that the river water consisted of a small proportion of fast flow components and a large proportion of slow flow components the young water was mainly the component of precipitation entering rivers via fast flow slope flow and underground lateral flow but not the slow flow component from underground water and deep flow with very old age hu et al 2020 the difference between these two components provides a basis for water resource management in the catchment for example several soluble pollutants are rapidly discharged into the surface water while other pollutants persist for a long time although we could not estimate the fyw of groundwater using the sine waving fitting method and convolution integral model in the catchment it could be speculated that the flow path of groundwater mainly comprised the slow flow components in the study area 4 4 uncertainty analyses and limitations in this study the mtts and fyw of various hydrological components in the critical zone of the catchment were considered based on two years of stable isotope data semi monthly time scale which provides a reference for understanding water age discharge and storage and contributes to identifying the renewal cycle of hydrological components the migration of pollutants and nutrients and the quantification of the fast flow path in a catchment notably it is very important to analyze the uncertainty in mtts and fyw estimates of hydrological components kirchner 2016 believed that in the river hydrological system of a catchment comprising multiple subsystems with strongly contrasting mtts the mtts were often underestimated based on seasonal tracer cycles due to aggregation bias while fyw was unaffected in this study we assumed that each hydrological component within the critical zone in the catchment is homogeneous and then their mtts can be estimated by sinusoidal fitting based on the seasonal isotopic cycles the uncertainties of the estimates of mtts and fyw were directly derived from seasonal variations in the isotopes of each hydrological component lutz et al 2018 and hu et al 2020 reported that a monthly sampling frequency for precipitation and river water was prone to missing extreme isotopic values which generally resulted in underestimation of the amplitude of the sinusoidal curve however we found that the amplitude of the sinusoidal curve in semi monthly precipitation was greater than that in daily precipitation fig s3 when we considered the isotopic signal of daily precipitation as input the mtts and fyw of each hydrological component could be overestimated and underestimated respectively with the decrease of the fyw of the hydrological component the degree of damping in isotopic signals of each hydrological component relative to that of precipitation gradually increased and the mtts and uncertainty ranges of each hydrological component also gradually increased but the uncertainty ranges of the corresponding fyw were usually unchanged table 2 this reflected the robustness of fyw as an alternative indicator of the water age of a hydrological component although the goodness of the sine wave fitting for river water was good with the nse value of 0 5 the mtt estimates showed a lot of uncertainty which might be attributed to the small proportion of young water components additionally there was unsatisfactory goodness of the sine wave fitting for deep soil water and groundwater nse 0 5 such hydrological subsystems were often hard to receive precipitation isotope signals and then release them within a certain time threshold that reflected the limitation of the use of conservative tracers in estimating the transit time of the hydrological components dominated by old water as stewart et al 2010 2012 reported stable isotope methods cannot see water older than 4 years although sine wave fitting can be performed on sparse irregularly sampled data sets not all hydrologic components have satisfactory goodness of the sine wave fitting in a catchment table 1 therefore the combination of a diverse range of methodologies and different tracers for water ages of hydrologic components within the critical zone will be the focus of our future research 5 conclusions continuous observations of the isotopic compositions of different hydrological components in the subtropical humid catchment revealed the occurrence of sinusoidal variations in different hydrologic years precipitation shallow soil water except for the depth of 40 60 cm in the wet year xylem water and river water showed obvious sinusoidal variations the seasonal isotopic cycles of various hydrological components had different attenuations and phase shifts relative to those of precipitation there were no obvious seasonal isotopic cycles for deep soil water and groundwater due to their long flow paths the inter annual variation of the ttds for various hydrological components in the catchment was identified distinct parameters of the ttds for soil water at the depth of 0 10 cm xylem water and river water between the wet year and normal year were found but the ttds for soil water at the depths of 10 40 cm were relative stable annually the mtts of soil water increased with increasing depth and the fyw decreased with increasing depth similar to the soil water in the root zone the fyw and mtt of xylem water in the wet year was larger and shorter than that in the normal year respectively the river water consisted of a small proportion of fast flow components and a large proportion of slow flow components with the young water accounting for 16 in the wet year and 21 in the normal year also the τyw of hydrological components in the catchment was mainly controlled by the shape factor of ttds and this relationship can be applied to different hydrological components within the same catchment our findings provide useful guidelines for understanding water ages flow paths source water

3069,the decline in aquifer water tables resulting from groundwater extraction and the impacts on spring ecosystems is a recurring management issue throughout the world this study from the great artesian basin in australia demonstrates how water extraction through uncapped open bores since the late nineteenth century has reduced aquifer pressure dewatering many natural springs flow rates to one spring complex at pelican creek also declined but an extraordinary array of endemic species have persisted at pelican creek an extremely rare endemic fish the red finned blue eye scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis is threatened with extinction from predation by an exotic fish gambusia gambusia holbrooki a government funded program to cap flowing bores and to replace the distribution of groundwater through open drains with polyethylene pipe has resulted in the partial restoration of aquifer pressure coinciding with the expansion of spring wetlands the restoration of springs enhances habitat for spring dependent endemic species but also makes the removal of gambusia more difficult and the opportunities for dispersal into the few remaining springs free of gambusia more likely the documentation of the decline in aquifer pressure and loss of springs followed by pressure recovery with aquifer management and local management of springs provides lessons for the parallel circumstances throughout the globe keywords australia great artesian basin groundwater springs management aquifer pressure 1 introduction aquifer pressure decline resulting from groundwater exploitation is a common issue around the globe edmunds 2004 hou et al 2016 voss and soliman 2014 with devastating impacts on natural spring ecosystems fensham et al 2016 powell and fensham 2016 however with judicious and efficient management of groundwater resources it may be possible to preserve and even restore aquifers and their dependent ecosystems the great artesian basin gab underlies one fifth of the australian continent and has been the subject of profligate exploitation since the late nineteenth century powell 2012 the gab is a cross jurisdictional resource underlying four australian states about 63 of the gab occurs within the state of queensland where this portion is managed under the framework of the water plan great artesian basin and other regional aquifers 2017 the plan seeks to guide future management of the gab water for sustainable use including the protection of groundwater flow to springs by conservative allocation regimes in the regions where springs occur the water released from the gab through bores fig 1 although only a tiny fraction of the volume held within the aquifer has had a substantial effect on aquifer pressure habermehl 2020 as a consequence of pressure decline 30 4 of spring complexes a collection or cluster of spring vents within a 6 km radius have become completely inactive and another 26 7 have inactive springs within the complex fensham et al 2016 after the discharge of groundwater through bores the pressure decline is relatively rapid welsh 2000 most bores were drilled before the middle of the twentieth century including near existing springs and most of the springs were rendered inactive during this early period while spring flows have diminished in response to pressure decline there is potential for increased flows with pressure restoration in addition to the water plan great artesian basin and other regional aquifers 2017 government subsidised programs to assist with the capping of flowing bores and replacing open bore drains with polyethylene pipe has been undertaken between 1977 and 2018 brake 2020 the latest iteration of these programs is the great artesian basin bore rehabilitation program gabbrp a joint federal and queensland government and landholder program with its predecessors and similar schemes in other states the program has required both private and public investment to rehabilitate bores and to provide an infrastructure of piping to replace the previous system of open drains while a primary rationale for these programs has been water conservation they also explicitly seek to preserve and enhance flows to groundwater dependent ecosystems the most obvious examples of which are spring wetlands brake 2020 it is estimated that in the period prior to this scheme total discharge from the gab was about 547 500 ml y 1 habermehl 1980 up to 2018 the bore capping and piping programs expended 250 m aud 190 m usd of public investment resulting in estimated savings of 70 of this discharge through replacement of thousands of kilometres of open drains with a network of polyethylene pipe through the gabrp initiative brake 2020 the savings come from a reduction in evaporation and seepage and do not diminish supply to livestock artesian spring wetlands fed by pressurised groundwater from confined aquifers can be distinguished from other permanent wetlands in the arid zone including outcrop springs fed by gravity waterholes in the stream channels and sheltered rock holes fensham et al 2011 individual springs are grouped in complexes and the regional clusters are referred to as supergroups of which there are twelve that include artesian springs fensham et al 2016 the artesian springs of the gab provide critical habitat for biodiversity including species that are only known from these habitats fensham et al 2011 a recent collation indicates that there are at least 12 plant and 83 animal species endemic to gab spring wetlands rossini et al 2018 these species are associated with artesian springs that provide relatively constant ancient and isolated water sources in dry landscapes fensham et al 2011 despite the substantial public expenditure there has been limited evaluation of the recovery of springs in response to the gabrp program this study focusses on a spring complex of extremely high conservation value within the gab it documents the history of aquifer exploitation and pressure decline through bore development and the subsequent decline of spring wetlands in the region the size of a spring wetland is recognised as a surrogate for groundwater flow rates from the spring vent fensham et al 2021a white and lewis 2011 williams and holmes 1978 high resolution satellite imagery has been used to map spring wetlands white and lewis 2011 in the current study field mapping is used to assess a clearly defined spring wetland area and is complemented by high resolution imagery to assess springs that were not visited the extraordinary high biodiversity values of the spring complex forming the focus of this study includes an endemic fish the red finned blue eye scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis this species is threatened by predation from the exotic fish gambusia gambusia holbrookii the consequences of increased pressure and enhanced flows to artesian springs is discussed in relation to the management of the high biodiversity values of the springs and particularly in relation to the threat of gambusia for the red finned blue eye 2 methods 2 1 study area the focus of the study are the springs in the area of pelican creek fig 2 but the analysis is conducted at a range of temporal and spatial scales to document the stages of groundwater exploitation capping and piping activities and response at the spring wetlands the study area is within the north eastern sector of the eromanga basin fig 2 the largest of the four loosely connected basins that form the great artesian basin habermehl 2020 in the north eastern part of the eromanga basin where pelican creek is located the hooray sandstone birkhead formation the adori sandstone the westbourne formation and the hutton sandstone are largely indivisible as distinct units and form a mainly quartzose aquifer sequence referred to collectively as ronlow beds burger and senior 1979 the pelican creek springs are part of a north south line of artesian spring complexes within the barcaldine supergroup fig 2 fensham et al 2016 the potentiometric surface is only above ground level in the western part of the area fig 4 and flowing bores are generally less than 6 l s 1 the aquifer sediments of the ronlow beds outcrop approximately 50 km east of the springs and dip to the west fig 4 the outcrop provides the recharge for the springs which occur where the aquitard formed by the wallumbilla formation has been thinned by erosion with or without associated faulting fig 4 to document groundwater use in the region information from the bores within 75 km of the pelican creek spring complex were collated fig 2 which includes the area encompassing most of the artesian springs within the barcaldine supergroup fig 2 2 2 water bore and groundwater pressure the queensland groundwater database queensland department of natural resources and mines 2020 was the source of information on bores and provided the standing water level measurements for each water bore in the study area the screened aquifer recorded on the queensland groundwater database was reviewed only those bores within the ronlow beds or equivalent were included in the analysis the status of water bores has changed through time reflecting changes to their hydraulic conditions and capping and piping activities this required the collation of available drilling dates whether they are capped or uncapped artesian bores or sub artesian bores and when capping and piping activities were completed this involved collation of unpublished records particularly determining when bores were capped and piped d larsen unpublished data that are not represented in the queensland groundwater database in some cases details were determined by enquiry with individual landholders artesian bores could become sub artesian fig 3 c but examples of sub artesian bores becoming artesian are not represented by the database some bores were capped with headworks in situ while others were plugged and a new bore was redrilled and capped nearby both situations were treated as the capping of an existing bore pressure or flow test measurements at individual bores was often recorded at the time of drilling and prior to capping and piping works being undertaken between these periods measurements were sporadically collected in this study 120 bores were identified within the units of the ronlow beds with a minimum of two standing water level measurements fig 2 one bore was excluded because two pressure measurements varied by 25 m within 5 years on average the number of measurements for individual bores varied from two to 15 with a median of three measurements to enable meaningful comparison between bores the trend in pressure needs to be calibrated to a uniform datum this is because individual bores are located at different elevation and represent points on the potentiometric surface but the surface is not uniform declining from east to west each standing water level measurement from a bore was subtracted from the average of all measurements from that bore the trend was determined for every year as the average slope between data points across all the available points spanning that year and is thus independent of any datum the lowest point of the average trend was set at zero for visualisation of the data fig 3 2 3 spring wetland flows and biological values monitoring the flows from springs directly can be difficult because 1 flows are typically less than a few litres per second 2 a discrete spring vent can be difficult to locate and discharge may be diffuse and 3 risks associated with affecting the habitat of the dependent fauna and flora with a gauging facility there is a significant relationship between spring flow and vegetated wetland area fatchen 2001 williams holmes 1978 and this is the foundation of the methodology applied in this study historical records mostly from the tour of government hydrologist j alfred griffiths in 1898 fairfax and fensham 2002 were compiled appendix 1 usually these historical records included estimates of flow rate but occasionally the size of spring wetlands was described to gain a consistent measure the latter were converted to flow rates using a function developed from flow gauges at 33 springs sampled a total of 169 times over 15 years for wetland areas up to 83 000 m2 log 10 f log 10 a 3 692 0 707 where f flow l s 1 a permanently wetted areas of spring wetland m2 r2 0 561 fatchen 2001 only springs with either historical estimates of flow rates or spring wetland area were included within each spring complex to determine a century scale assessment of spring flow decline the springs that were included were surveyed between 1998 and 2008 hereafter referred to as 2000 the wetland area of each spring was estimated and converted to flow rates using the fatchen formula to compare with the subset of springs with flow rates from 1898 fig 2 both the methods of estimation from 1898 and the rapid estimate of wetland area from 2000 are imprecise to provide a more precise procedure for mapping a spring wetland in the field and to define a target for mapping of spring wetland from satellite imagery the following method was developed over short time frames weeks and months spring flows fluctuate petus et al 2013 white and lewis 2011 this may not be a function of groundwater supply but is more likely due to environmental conditions including the soil moisture status of the regolith in the vicinity of the springs evaporation and evapotranspiration certainly the surface coverage of water expands and recedes in relation to seasonal variations fairfax et al 2007 rossini et al 2017 despite these fluctuations the area of perennial vegetation that characterises the spring wetlands is relatively constant with water spreading beyond the vegetated wetlands at cooler times of the year when temperatures and evaporation are low the principle behind monitoring spring flows through wetland area is that perennial wetland plants only grow where there is permanent water fensham et al 2021b with their distribution being independent of short term fluctuations if groundwater pressure declines or is enhanced it will result in changes to the area of permanent water and therefore perennial wetland vegetation there were four land cover categories that in combination formed the target spring wetland for mapping 1 target perennial plant species dependent on permanent wetland fensham et al 2021b were identified and distinguished from non target species associated with ephemeral wetted areas appendix 2 the areas where the combined cover of target species is more than 50 cover were included appendix 3 2 areas where target species would have had more than 50 cover prior to recent disturbance by pigs or livestock see appendix 3 were also included 3 areas of free water forming a spring pool that is contained within target wetland vegetation or accumulated sediment were included appendix 3 areas of free water as part of open ended drainage or water in gullies claypans that are enhanced by spring water flows were not included 4 excavated pools containing permanent spring water are also included provided the excavation has not altered drainage outflow appendix 3 following these criteria mapping of the spring wetlands in the pelican creek complex fig 2 was conducted between 2008 and 2019 with field survey in conjunction with high resolution satellite imagery across the study area there were substantial constraints in access and in some cases spring wetlands that were apparent on satellite imagery were overlooked in the field thus the spring wetlands were sometimes mapped in the field and sometimes only from the imagery the 2008 imagery 22 may 2008 and the 2013 imagery 16 august 2013 both are a combination of a panchromatic quickbird image longmont colorado at 0 5 m resolution and a 2 4 m resolution multispectral image the 2019 imagery is a superview multispectral image at 0 5 m resolution 4 july 2019 in 2008 the accuracy of hand held gps was insufficient to accurately map spring wetland boundaries and a preliminary map of the spring wetland was developed from the imagery using the optimal visual discrimination of target signatures band 4 band 3 and band 2 this draft linework was adjusted with field inspection to delineate the spring wetland areas these field verified polygons are regarded as high reliability mapping after 2008 and within 3 months of the satellite capture spring wetlands according to the above criteria were mapped using the track function of a hand held gps these polygons were overlain onto high resolution satellite imagery and are also regarded as high reliability mapping for springs that were not mapped in the field the spring wetland boundaries were interpreted from the imagery by the same person laffineur who performed the field mapping with the gps and were thus informed by the field based mapping this remote interpretation of wetland area without field verification provides low reliability mapping of spring wetlands fig 5 a some small springs could not be mapped through time usually because their area was obscured by trees big moon spring is channeled into a drain fig 5a that was established prior to 1888 appendix 1 and is regularly maintained today the drain directs spring outflow into pelican creek such that the flow of this spring combines with rainwater that forms pools in the seasonal stream thus the relationship between the flow of this spring and wetland area is affected by the influence of rainfall on the stream pool size and it was excluded from subsequent analysis the flow of each individual spring was interpreted from wetland area using the fatchen formula in order to evaluate the changes in wetland area in relation to moisture conditions in the regolith a one year running average of rainfall was prepared fig 5c the assessment of endemism conducted by rossini et al 2018 was used to highlight conservation values the distribution of the red finned blue eye and gambusia in the springs of the northern part of the pelican creek complex was compiled bush heritage australia unpublished data to demonstrate the management consequences of changes in wetland area 3 results 3 1 groundwater use the first bores in the region were sunk in the 1880s figs 1 and 2 and by the 1940s there were more than 98 bores flowing into open drains within 75 km of pelican creek fig 3 the number of flowing bores did not decline until the gabrp scheme commenced in the 1980s and by 2020 the number was reduced to 26 ten of which were capped but continued to flow into open drains fig 3 the averaged trend analysis indicates a dramatic decline of about 7 8 m in the standing water level of the aquifer between 1880 and 1900 followed by a steady decline of another 13 2 m until 1966 fig 3a between 1966 and 2000 pressure increased slightly with a rise in standing water level of 1 0 m between 2000 and 2020 the increase in pressure has been 5 3 m with a net result that the current standing water level is 14 7 m below the 1880 baseline fig 3 3 2 spring wetland flows and biological values there was a dramatic decline in the flow rate of springs during the period of groundwater exploitation between 1900 and 2000 table 1 of the nine spring complexes in the study area the aberfeldie springs and friendly springs have been dewatered and all springs in the complex are inactive another three atherton chiaras teardrop jersey have declined to less than 10 of their historical flow rates the historical record for the pelican creek springs indicates that flow rates in 2000 were 66 of historical flow rates at pelican creek the springs have nearly doubled in size between 2008 and 2019 fig 5b this difference in size is mostly represented by changes in springs mapped with high reliability and extensive ground truthing fig 5a and 3b this translates to a variation in flow from 11 21 l s 1 to 22 60 l s 1 the recovery of flow to the springs and expansion of wetland area occurred despite relatively dry times in the second half of the monitoring period fig 5c suggesting that the expansion of spring wetlands has been largely independent of local rainfall or moisture status in the regolith it is uncertain whether new springs appeared between 2008 and 2013 but eight new springs appeared between 2013 and 2019 with the largest having a spring wetland of 47 m2 the pelican creek springs provide habitat for an endemic biota only known from this location represented by two species of fish 12 snails one crustacean and three species of plant eight species of plants are known from locations beyond pelican creek but only from australian artesian springs the increase in wetland area will increase the habitat for the wetland dependent species the red finned blue eye persists in one natural population in the northern part of the pelican

3069,the decline in aquifer water tables resulting from groundwater extraction and the impacts on spring ecosystems is a recurring management issue throughout the world this study from the great artesian basin in australia demonstrates how water extraction through uncapped open bores since the late nineteenth century has reduced aquifer pressure dewatering many natural springs flow rates to one spring complex at pelican creek also declined but an extraordinary array of endemic species have persisted at pelican creek an extremely rare endemic fish the red finned blue eye scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis is threatened with extinction from predation by an exotic fish gambusia gambusia holbrooki a government funded program to cap flowing bores and to replace the distribution of groundwater through open drains with polyethylene pipe has resulted in the partial restoration of aquifer pressure coinciding with the expansion of spring wetlands the restoration of springs enhances habitat for spring dependent endemic species but also makes the removal of gambusia more difficult and the opportunities for dispersal into the few remaining springs free of gambusia more likely the documentation of the decline in aquifer pressure and loss of springs followed by pressure recovery with aquifer management and local management of springs provides lessons for the parallel circumstances throughout the globe keywords australia great artesian basin groundwater springs management aquifer pressure 1 introduction aquifer pressure decline resulting from groundwater exploitation is a common issue around the globe edmunds 2004 hou et al 2016 voss and soliman 2014 with devastating impacts on natural spring ecosystems fensham et al 2016 powell and fensham 2016 however with judicious and efficient management of groundwater resources it may be possible to preserve and even restore aquifers and their dependent ecosystems the great artesian basin gab underlies one fifth of the australian continent and has been the subject of profligate exploitation since the late nineteenth century powell 2012 the gab is a cross jurisdictional resource underlying four australian states about 63 of the gab occurs within the state of queensland where this portion is managed under the framework of the water plan great artesian basin and other regional aquifers 2017 the plan seeks to guide future management of the gab water for sustainable use including the protection of groundwater flow to springs by conservative allocation regimes in the regions where springs occur the water released from the gab through bores fig 1 although only a tiny fraction of the volume held within the aquifer has had a substantial effect on aquifer pressure habermehl 2020 as a consequence of pressure decline 30 4 of spring complexes a collection or cluster of spring vents within a 6 km radius have become completely inactive and another 26 7 have inactive springs within the complex fensham et al 2016 after the discharge of groundwater through bores the pressure decline is relatively rapid welsh 2000 most bores were drilled before the middle of the twentieth century including near existing springs and most of the springs were rendered inactive during this early period while spring flows have diminished in response to pressure decline there is potential for increased flows with pressure restoration in addition to the water plan great artesian basin and other regional aquifers 2017 government subsidised programs to assist with the capping of flowing bores and replacing open bore drains with polyethylene pipe has been undertaken between 1977 and 2018 brake 2020 the latest iteration of these programs is the great artesian basin bore rehabilitation program gabbrp a joint federal and queensland government and landholder program with its predecessors and similar schemes in other states the program has required both private and public investment to rehabilitate bores and to provide an infrastructure of piping to replace the previous system of open drains while a primary rationale for these programs has been water conservation they also explicitly seek to preserve and enhance flows to groundwater dependent ecosystems the most obvious examples of which are spring wetlands brake 2020 it is estimated that in the period prior to this scheme total discharge from the gab was about 547 500 ml y 1 habermehl 1980 up to 2018 the bore capping and piping programs expended 250 m aud 190 m usd of public investment resulting in estimated savings of 70 of this discharge through replacement of thousands of kilometres of open drains with a network of polyethylene pipe through the gabrp initiative brake 2020 the savings come from a reduction in evaporation and seepage and do not diminish supply to livestock artesian spring wetlands fed by pressurised groundwater from confined aquifers can be distinguished from other permanent wetlands in the arid zone including outcrop springs fed by gravity waterholes in the stream channels and sheltered rock holes fensham et al 2011 individual springs are grouped in complexes and the regional clusters are referred to as supergroups of which there are twelve that include artesian springs fensham et al 2016 the artesian springs of the gab provide critical habitat for biodiversity including species that are only known from these habitats fensham et al 2011 a recent collation indicates that there are at least 12 plant and 83 animal species endemic to gab spring wetlands rossini et al 2018 these species are associated with artesian springs that provide relatively constant ancient and isolated water sources in dry landscapes fensham et al 2011 despite the substantial public expenditure there has been limited evaluation of the recovery of springs in response to the gabrp program this study focusses on a spring complex of extremely high conservation value within the gab it documents the history of aquifer exploitation and pressure decline through bore development and the subsequent decline of spring wetlands in the region the size of a spring wetland is recognised as a surrogate for groundwater flow rates from the spring vent fensham et al 2021a white and lewis 2011 williams and holmes 1978 high resolution satellite imagery has been used to map spring wetlands white and lewis 2011 in the current study field mapping is used to assess a clearly defined spring wetland area and is complemented by high resolution imagery to assess springs that were not visited the extraordinary high biodiversity values of the spring complex forming the focus of this study includes an endemic fish the red finned blue eye scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis this species is threatened by predation from the exotic fish gambusia gambusia holbrookii the consequences of increased pressure and enhanced flows to artesian springs is discussed in relation to the management of the high biodiversity values of the springs and particularly in relation to the threat of gambusia for the red finned blue eye 2 methods 2 1 study area the focus of the study are the springs in the area of pelican creek fig 2 but the analysis is conducted at a range of temporal and spatial scales to document the stages of groundwater exploitation capping and piping activities and response at the spring wetlands the study area is within the north eastern sector of the eromanga basin fig 2 the largest of the four loosely connected basins that form the great artesian basin habermehl 2020 in the north eastern part of the eromanga basin where pelican creek is located the hooray sandstone birkhead formation the adori sandstone the westbourne formation and the hutton sandstone are largely indivisible as distinct units and form a mainly quartzose aquifer sequence referred to collectively as ronlow beds burger and senior 1979 the pelican creek springs are part of a north south line of artesian spring complexes within the barcaldine supergroup fig 2 fensham et al 2016 the potentiometric surface is only above ground level in the western part of the area fig 4 and flowing bores are generally less than 6 l s 1 the aquifer sediments of the ronlow beds outcrop approximately 50 km east of the springs and dip to the west fig 4 the outcrop provides the recharge for the springs which occur where the aquitard formed by the wallumbilla formation has been thinned by erosion with or without associated faulting fig 4 to document groundwater use in the region information from the bores within 75 km of the pelican creek spring complex were collated fig 2 which includes the area encompassing most of the artesian springs within the barcaldine supergroup fig 2 2 2 water bore and groundwater pressure the queensland groundwater database queensland department of natural resources and mines 2020 was the source of information on bores and provided the standing water level measurements for each water bore in the study area the screened aquifer recorded on the queensland groundwater database was reviewed only those bores within the ronlow beds or equivalent were included in the analysis the status of water bores has changed through time reflecting changes to their hydraulic conditions and capping and piping activities this required the collation of available drilling dates whether they are capped or uncapped artesian bores or sub artesian bores and when capping and piping activities were completed this involved collation of unpublished records particularly determining when bores were capped and piped d larsen unpublished data that are not represented in the queensland groundwater database in some cases details were determined by enquiry with individual landholders artesian bores could become sub artesian fig 3 c but examples of sub artesian bores becoming artesian are not represented by the database some bores were capped with headworks in situ while others were plugged and a new bore was redrilled and capped nearby both situations were treated as the capping of an existing bore pressure or flow test measurements at individual bores was often recorded at the time of drilling and prior to capping and piping works being undertaken between these periods measurements were sporadically collected in this study 120 bores were identified within the units of the ronlow beds with a minimum of two standing water level measurements fig 2 one bore was excluded because two pressure measurements varied by 25 m within 5 years on average the number of measurements for individual bores varied from two to 15 with a median of three measurements to enable meaningful comparison between bores the trend in pressure needs to be calibrated to a uniform datum this is because individual bores are located at different elevation and represent points on the potentiometric surface but the surface is not uniform declining from east to west each standing water level measurement from a bore was subtracted from the average of all measurements from that bore the trend was determined for every year as the average slope between data points across all the available points spanning that year and is thus independent of any datum the lowest point of the average trend was set at zero for visualisation of the data fig 3 2 3 spring wetland flows and biological values monitoring the flows from springs directly can be difficult because 1 flows are typically less than a few litres per second 2 a discrete spring vent can be difficult to locate and discharge may be diffuse and 3 risks associated with affecting the habitat of the dependent fauna and flora with a gauging facility there is a significant relationship between spring flow and vegetated wetland area fatchen 2001 williams holmes 1978 and this is the foundation of the methodology applied in this study historical records mostly from the tour of government hydrologist j alfred griffiths in 1898 fairfax and fensham 2002 were compiled appendix 1 usually these historical records included estimates of flow rate but occasionally the size of spring wetlands was described to gain a consistent measure the latter were converted to flow rates using a function developed from flow gauges at 33 springs sampled a total of 169 times over 15 years for wetland areas up to 83 000 m2 log 10 f log 10 a 3 692 0 707 where f flow l s 1 a permanently wetted areas of spring wetland m2 r2 0 561 fatchen 2001 only springs with either historical estimates of flow rates or spring wetland area were included within each spring complex to determine a century scale assessment of spring flow decline the springs that were included were surveyed between 1998 and 2008 hereafter referred to as 2000 the wetland area of each spring was estimated and converted to flow rates using the fatchen formula to compare with the subset of springs with flow rates from 1898 fig 2 both the methods of estimation from 1898 and the rapid estimate of wetland area from 2000 are imprecise to provide a more precise procedure for mapping a spring wetland in the field and to define a target for mapping of spring wetland from satellite imagery the following method was developed over short time frames weeks and months spring flows fluctuate petus et al 2013 white and lewis 2011 this may not be a function of groundwater supply but is more likely due to environmental conditions including the soil moisture status of the regolith in the vicinity of the springs evaporation and evapotranspiration certainly the surface coverage of water expands and recedes in relation to seasonal variations fairfax et al 2007 rossini et al 2017 despite these fluctuations the area of perennial vegetation that characterises the spring wetlands is relatively constant with water spreading beyond the vegetated wetlands at cooler times of the year when temperatures and evaporation are low the principle behind monitoring spring flows through wetland area is that perennial wetland plants only grow where there is permanent water fensham et al 2021b with their distribution being independent of short term fluctuations if groundwater pressure declines or is enhanced it will result in changes to the area of permanent water and therefore perennial wetland vegetation there were four land cover categories that in combination formed the target spring wetland for mapping 1 target perennial plant species dependent on permanent wetland fensham et al 2021b were identified and distinguished from non target species associated with ephemeral wetted areas appendix 2 the areas where the combined cover of target species is more than 50 cover were included appendix 3 2 areas where target species would have had more than 50 cover prior to recent disturbance by pigs or livestock see appendix 3 were also included 3 areas of free water forming a spring pool that is contained within target wetland vegetation or accumulated sediment were included appendix 3 areas of free water as part of open ended drainage or water in gullies claypans that are enhanced by spring water flows were not included 4 excavated pools containing permanent spring water are also included provided the excavation has not altered drainage outflow appendix 3 following these criteria mapping of the spring wetlands in the pelican creek complex fig 2 was conducted between 2008 and 2019 with field survey in conjunction with high resolution satellite imagery across the study area there were substantial constraints in access and in some cases spring wetlands that were apparent on satellite imagery were overlooked in the field thus the spring wetlands were sometimes mapped in the field and sometimes only from the imagery the 2008 imagery 22 may 2008 and the 2013 imagery 16 august 2013 both are a combination of a panchromatic quickbird image longmont colorado at 0 5 m resolution and a 2 4 m resolution multispectral image the 2019 imagery is a superview multispectral image at 0 5 m resolution 4 july 2019 in 2008 the accuracy of hand held gps was insufficient to accurately map spring wetland boundaries and a preliminary map of the spring wetland was developed from the imagery using the optimal visual discrimination of target signatures band 4 band 3 and band 2 this draft linework was adjusted with field inspection to delineate the spring wetland areas these field verified polygons are regarded as high reliability mapping after 2008 and within 3 months of the satellite capture spring wetlands according to the above criteria were mapped using the track function of a hand held gps these polygons were overlain onto high resolution satellite imagery and are also regarded as high reliability mapping for springs that were not mapped in the field the spring wetland boundaries were interpreted from the imagery by the same person laffineur who performed the field mapping with the gps and were thus informed by the field based mapping this remote interpretation of wetland area without field verification provides low reliability mapping of spring wetlands fig 5 a some small springs could not be mapped through time usually because their area was obscured by trees big moon spring is channeled into a drain fig 5a that was established prior to 1888 appendix 1 and is regularly maintained today the drain directs spring outflow into pelican creek such that the flow of this spring combines with rainwater that forms pools in the seasonal stream thus the relationship between the flow of this spring and wetland area is affected by the influence of rainfall on the stream pool size and it was excluded from subsequent analysis the flow of each individual spring was interpreted from wetland area using the fatchen formula in order to evaluate the changes in wetland area in relation to moisture conditions in the regolith a one year running average of rainfall was prepared fig 5c the assessment of endemism conducted by rossini et al 2018 was used to highlight conservation values the distribution of the red finned blue eye and gambusia in the springs of the northern part of the pelican creek complex was compiled bush heritage australia unpublished data to demonstrate the management consequences of changes in wetland area 3 results 3 1 groundwater use the first bores in the region were sunk in the 1880s figs 1 and 2 and by the 1940s there were more than 98 bores flowing into open drains within 75 km of pelican creek fig 3 the number of flowing bores did not decline until the gabrp scheme commenced in the 1980s and by 2020 the number was reduced to 26 ten of which were capped but continued to flow into open drains fig 3 the averaged trend analysis indicates a dramatic decline of about 7 8 m in the standing water level of the aquifer between 1880 and 1900 followed by a steady decline of another 13 2 m until 1966 fig 3a between 1966 and 2000 pressure increased slightly with a rise in standing water level of 1 0 m between 2000 and 2020 the increase in pressure has been 5 3 m with a net result that the current standing water level is 14 7 m below the 1880 baseline fig 3 3 2 spring wetland flows and biological values there was a dramatic decline in the flow rate of springs during the period of groundwater exploitation between 1900 and 2000 table 1 of the nine spring complexes in the study area the aberfeldie springs and friendly springs have been dewatered and all springs in the complex are inactive another three atherton chiaras teardrop jersey have declined to less than 10 of their historical flow rates the historical record for the pelican creek springs indicates that flow rates in 2000 were 66 of historical flow rates at pelican creek the springs have nearly doubled in size between 2008 and 2019 fig 5b this difference in size is mostly represented by changes in springs mapped with high reliability and extensive ground truthing fig 5a and 3b this translates to a variation in flow from 11 21 l s 1 to 22 60 l s 1 the recovery of flow to the springs and expansion of wetland area occurred despite relatively dry times in the second half of the monitoring period fig 5c suggesting that the expansion of spring wetlands has been largely independent of local rainfall or moisture status in the regolith it is uncertain whether new springs appeared between 2008 and 2013 but eight new springs appeared between 2013 and 2019 with the largest having a spring wetland of 47 m2 the pelican creek springs provide habitat for an endemic biota only known from this location represented by two species of fish 12 snails one crustacean and three species of plant eight species of plants are known from locations beyond pelican creek but only from australian artesian springs the increase in wetland area will increase the habitat for the wetland dependent species the red finned blue eye persists in one natural population in the northern part of the pelican creek spring complex but has also been translocated into other springs fig 6 gambusia now occur in many springs and have resulted in the extinction of red finned blue eye in some of these the springs where gambusia occur seem to be connected by small drainage lines fig 6 that provide a conduit for their invasion 4 discussion groundwater extraction through flowing bores between 1880 and 1960
