1985,as an important recharge source for lakes groundwater has become one of the dominant routes of nitrogen n input into lakes understanding the source and behaviour of n around plateau lakes is essential for improving groundwater and lake water quality this study used no3 stable isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 combined with hydrochemical data environmental parameters and a bayesian stable isotope mixing model siar to elaborate the no3 sources and contributions and n concentrations and cycling processes in groundwater n 476 from 8 plateau lake basins in regard to land uses and seasonal changes we found that multiple n form concentrations in the rainy season rs and cropland ca were higher than those in the dry season ds and residential area ra no3 n was the most dominant n form and 45 of groundwater samples exceeded the who no3 drinking water threshold the no3 isotopes and siar model revealed that soil n sn manure and sewage m s and n fertilizer nf were the main no3 sources in groundwater contributing 47 5 30 5 and 19 5 based on land uses and 39 0 37 5 and 20 0 based on seasonal changes respectively moreover denitrification was considered the primary n transformation process in the groundwater in the rs ca and ra but the n transformation process in the ds was dominated by nitrification these results indicated that n concentration and source varied with land use and seasonal changes and the cross distribution of ca and ra and difference in seasonal rainfall resulted in the difference in multiple n sources and source contributions in groundwater despite changes in land uses and seasons sn and m s remain the largest no3 contributors to groundwater which poses new challenges to control groundwater no3 pollution in the area around plateau lakes with a cross distribution of ca and ra therefore improving septic tanks and sewage networks and scientific soil n management are essential for controlling groundwater pollution keywords groundwater no3 isotopes no3 pollution n cycling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the world s largest distributed repository of high quality fresh water groundwater is widely used in daily life agriculture and industry groundwater accounts for 36 42 and 27 of water used in those applications respectively döll et al 2012 in china 70 of the drinking water supply comes from groundwater qiu 2011 however groundwater contamination has become a global environmental problem of widespread concern han et al 2016 ma et al 2020 for example 68 8 and 17 6 of groundwater samples from 10 171 monitoring wells across china were classified as poor ⅳ class and very poor ⅴ class mee 2021 respectively while increased nitrogen n discharges have become one of the culprits of all n forms higher no3 is a vital factor contributing to human health e g methemoglobinemia and aquatic ecosystem degradation e g eutrophication fan and steinberg 1996 wells et al 2018 groundwater no3 pollution sources include point and nonpoint sources yi et al 2020 the nonpoint sources mainly consist of soil n sn n fertilizer nf and atmospheric deposition ad xuan et al 2022 yang et al 2016 and the point sources are mainly derived from domestic sewage and industrial wastewater discharge leachate from livestock poultry farms and municipal landfills leakage from sanitary sewers and septic tank effluents pastén zapata et al 2014 moreover groundwater no3 concentrations and sources are also affected by multiple n transformations denk et al 2017 for example higher nh 4 n concentrations can promote nitrification and inhibit no3 removal by assimilation causing no3 accumulation in urbanized rivers xuan et al 2020 in general overusing nf in agricultural areas is generally considered the major source for groundwater no3 kaushal et al 2011 while point sources are considered the dominant no3 pollution source in urbanized areas peters et al 2020 however many studies have suggested that manure and sewage m s and sn are the predominant contributors to groundwater no3 pollution in agricultural regions ji et al 2017 kou et al 2021 which means that rapid urbanization development and agricultural activities are changing the groundwater n pollution sources and source contributions liu et al 2019 understanding the potential n sources and cycle processes and quantitatively estimating source apportionment are crucial to controlling and reducing different n sources in groundwater previous studies have found that most lakes and rivers depend on groundwater recharge vystavna et al 2021 therefore groundwater becomes an important transport medium for pollutants into lakes and rivers hu et al 2019 while groundwater n concentrations and sources strongly determine the degree of n pollution in lakes and rivers effectively controlling the groundwater n concentrations around lakes and rivers is critical in protecting surface water quality however the n sources and transformation processes and their contributions to groundwater are driven by multiple natural and anthropic factors such as land use wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 rainfall wang et al 2020b yue et al 2020 agricultural activities kim et al 2021 kou et al 2021 runoff xuan et al 2022 seasonal change cui et al 2020 peters et al 2020 and hydrochemistry castaldo et al 2021 these driving factors pose many challenges to elucidating and validating the sources and transformation processes of n in groundwater especially in lake basins with mixed land use areas where highly complex hydrological systems and agricultural and human activities further increase the uncertainty of n behaviour and source apportionment in groundwater no3 source largely reflects the n sources in groundwater associating land use types with water chemical compositions e g anions and cations is a traditional method to determine no3 sources and n cycle processes kim et al 2019 but the results obtained by traditional methods are inaccurate and unable to accurately evaluate the contribution of no3 sources thus the no3 stable isotope δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 method can be an efficient alternative or complementary tool and provide meaningful insight into no3 sources and n transformation processes due to different no3 sources showing unique isotopic characteristics kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 this approach has been successfully used to identify n sources and biogeochemical processes in groundwater and surface water in the past twenty years meanwhile the advantages of the no3 stable isotope method also include less requirements for auxiliary information high accuracy simple operation and direct identification of no3 source ji et al 2022 in general the δ15n no3 in m s and δ18o no3 in ad are highest and mineral fertilizer is the lowest δ15n no3 value followed by sn zhang et al 2020 these information are useful for tracing no3 sources in the water environment however the no3 dual isotope method alone does not always provide accurate information and quantify source contributions due to the overlap of no3 isotopes from different sources e g nf vs sn sn vs m s mixing of multiple no3 sources and no3 isotope fractionations during biogeochemical cycle processes wang et al 2017 xue et al 2009 hence many studies have attempted to identify no3 sources and transformation processes by using no3 isotopes combined with other isotopes e g δ34s so4 2 δ11b hydrochemical data e g cl na environmental parameters e g dissolved oxygen and multivariate statistical analysis e g redundancy analysis he et al 2022 ren et al 2022 importantly the bayesian stable isotope mixing model siar has recently been successfully used to provide quantitative information for the apportionment of no3 sources it overcomes the limitations of the linear isotopic mixing model no more than three sources and can evaluate the contributions of more than three no3 sources jani and toor 2018 ren et al 2022 there are complex hydrological systems and high intensity agricultural and human activities in 8 plateau lake basins in southwestern china groundwater rainfall and surface water are appreciable lake water recharge sources and villages and cropland around plateau lakes are scattered and surrounded by each other therefore plateau lake basins are typical mixed land use areas notably groundwater and lake water are frequently exchanged and recharged by each other with seasonal changes but groundwater n pollution is extremely serious in this area and mean n and no3 n concentrations reach 24 35 and 15 15 mg l 1 respectively li et al 2022 which poses a severe threat to lake water quality safety however few studies have focused on n sources transformations and contributions of n sources in groundwater in 8 plateau lake basins which makes it easy to overlook potentially dominant n sources and to attribute n pollution in lakes and groundwater to nf overuse given the above considerations this study collected groundwater samples from irrigation and drinking wells near approximately 8 plateau lakes and the physicochemical parameters and no3 isotopes in groundwater were measured the main objectives of this integrated analysis were to 1 identify the no3 sources and n cycle processes 2 quantify different no3 source contributions and 3 reveal the factors driving n concentration change in groundwater and propose suggestions for controlling groundwater n pollution this study provides valuable information for controlling n pollution in groundwater and lake water and effectively managing n in plateau lake basins with mixed land uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area eight plateau lake basins including dianchi lake dclb erhai lake ehlb fuxian lake fxlb xingyun lake xylb yangzonghai lake yzhlb yilong lake yllb qilu lake qllb and chenghai lake chlb are located on the yunnan guizhou plateau southwest china fig 1 and lie between 21 8 n to 29 15 n and 97 31 e to 106 11 e the total area of the 8 lake basins is approximately 7742 68 km2 and the lake area is more than 980 50 km2 with freshwater storage of nearly 5 277 09 108 m3 of china s freshwater resources table s1 the elevation in the study area ranges from 1414 to 2000 m mean 1748 m the area has a typical low latitude plateau subtropical monsoon climate the precipitation is relatively abundant with annual precipitation ranging from 756 to 1100 mm mean 932 mm but over 80 of the precipitation falls in the rainy season rs june to november and 20 falls in the dry season ds the average annual temperature ranges from 14 9 to 19 2 mean 16 7 land use types in the study area are dominated by cropland ca and residential areas ra located on the lacustrine plain above holocene lacustrine and fluvial mixed facies containing lacustrine and fluvial sediments fig s1 the major aquifer types contain pore water in loose rock aquifers fractured karst water in carbonate aquifers and some intrusive rock aquifers paddy soil and red soil are the main soil types in ca the total crop planting area in the 8 lake basins is approximately 149 130 hm2 table s2 and vegetables are the main crops accounting for 34 of the total crop planting area the average fertilization rates of chemical n fertilizer and organic fertilizer for crops per season are 276 kg hm 2 and 7830 kg hm 2 of organic fertilizer in the 8 lake basins respectively and chemical n fertilizer and organic fertilizer are the major sources of n fertilizer there are certain differences in fertilizer application due to different crops and planting ways in the 8 lake basins the cropland around dcl and yzhl is mainly planted with protected vegetables and flowers the cropland around fxl has been fallow since 2018 the cropland around other lakes is mainly planted with field crops and open vegetables protected flowers are planted throughout the year and the average multiple cropping index of protected vegetables open field vegetables and field crops is 5 times 3 times and 2 times throughout the year respectively organic fertilizer is mainly derived from livestock and poultry breeding and approximately 39 55 104 livestock and 968 45 104 poultry breeding in the 8 lake basins are farmed by scale farming and scattered farming table s3 which directly results in a large amount of n produced by livestock and poultry breeding moreover more than 2 32 million people live in approximately 3123 villages in the 8 lake basins table s1 and domestic sewage is mainly collected and treated through pipe networks or directly discharged without pipe networks villages are scattered and surrounded by cropland groundwater and lake water are the primary sources of drinking water however the quality of water environment is seriously threatened by high intensity agricultural activities intensive livestock farming and domestic sewage discharge such as eutrophication of lake water in different degrees table s1 2 2 sample collection we selected the typical representative months of the rs august and the ds april for groundwater sampling groundwater samples were collected from 238 wells in the 8 plateau lake basins fig 1 for physicochemical parameter analysis in august 2020 rs n 238 including 163 samples from ca and 75 samples from ra and april 2021 ds n 238 including 164 samples from ca and 74 samples from ra table s4 500 ml water sample collector plexiglass water collector yuheng china was used to collect groundwater samples approximately 50 cm from the groundwater surface and 100 ml of groundwater sample was collected and stored in a polyethylene bottle for n form analysis moreover a total of 343 samples including 174 samples from ds 107 samples from ca and 67 samples from ra and 169 samples from rs 107 samples from ca and 62 samples from ra were collected and filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose membranes and then stored in 100 ml polyethylene bottles for no3 isotope and chemical ion analysis all groundwater samples were stored in an incubator with ice packs immediately transferred to a 4 c refrigerator for storage in the laboratory and analyzed within a week 2 3 physicochemical parameters and isotope analysis the field monitoring parameters including ph temperature t oxidation reduction potential orp electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a handheld multiparameter equipment ysi proplus xylem usa and a steel tape measure was used to measure the groundwater depth the filtered and unfiltered groundwater samples were analyzed for total dissolved n tdn and total n tn by using a visible spectrophotometer t6 xinrui puxi china and measured no3 n and nh4 n using a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 seal germany particulate organic n pon tn tdn and dissolved organic n don tdn no3 n nh4 n anions cl so2 4 were measured using an ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 thermo fisher usa and hco3 were measured by volumetric titration method and cations k na ca2 and mg2 were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icap 7600 thermo fisher usa the detection limits and testing standards for all physicochemical parameters can be found in table s6 and quality control quality assurance were implemented based on the relevant testing standard of china no3 isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in groundwater were analyzed using the denitrifier method and an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 finnigan germany casciotti et al 2002 four international standards usgs32 usgs34 usgs35 and iaean3 were used to correct the obtained isotope values and the analytical precision was 0 2 for δ15n no3 and 0 4 for δ18o no3 the isotope ratios are expressed in δ values and per mil relative to air and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rstandard and rsample are the ratios of 15n 14n and 18o 16o of the standard and sample for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 respectively 2 4 methods for determining the source fate and source contribution of no3 four potential no3 sources including ad nf sn and m s were considered in this study the endmember values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of each no3 source were obtained from the literature table s5 and compared with δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in groundwater to determine the no3 sources no3 isotopes were used to identify biogeochemical cycle processes e g nitrification and denitrification the dominant no3 sources and fates were also determined by a combination of hydrochemical parameters and no3 isotopes to quantify the contributions of no3 four source siar was implemented based on no3 isotopes in groundwater ren et al 2022 yang and toor 2016 the basic algorithm of siar can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 2 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 ε ij n 0 σ j 2 where xij represents the isotope value j of the mixture i i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 j sjk is the source value k of the isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean value μjk and standard deviation ωjk pk represents the proportion of source k which can be estimated by siar cjk represents the isotope fractionation factor for the isotope j of source k and the mean value is λjk and the standard deviation is τjk and εij is the residual error which refers to the additional unquantified variation for the individual mixtures and follows a normal distribution with a mean value 0 and standard deviation σj the siar model was run by r package software and r platform version 4 1 0 the typical end member values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 from ad nf m s and sn used in the siar model were selected from the literature table 1 wang et al 2020a yin et al 2020 3 results 3 1 major ion compositions the anions and cations in most groundwater samples were dominated by hco3 and ca2 respectively fig 2 table s6 most groundwater samples contained the ca2 mg2 hco3 type the second dominant hydrochemical type in the ds rs and ca was the ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 type but it was the na k hco3 type in ra suggesting that land use was a vital reason for the difference in the dominant hydrochemical type and groundwater was polluted by agricultural activities anthropogenic activities and manure zhang et al 2020 moreover the na k cl so4 2 type was observed in groundwater which indicated that groundwater was affected by domestic sewage and chemical fertilizer richards et al 2016 xue et al 2009 3 2 the concentrations and compositions of n forms the concentrations of n forms in groundwater from different seasons and land uses are shown in fig 3 and table s6 the concentrations of tn no3 n nh4 n don and pon in groundwater from rs and ca were 23 05 mg l 1 15 71 mg l 1 0 68 mg l 1 4 14 mg l 1 2 23 mg l 1 and 27 47 mg l 1 16 54 mg l 1 0 95 mg l 1 5 89 mg l 1 2 69 mg l 1 respectively compared with n concentration in groundwater from rs the tn and no3 n concentrations in ds decreased by 8 and 21 respectively while the nh4 n don and pon concentrations increased by 15 28 and 6 respectively compared with n concentration in groundwater from ca the tn no3 n nh4 n don and pon concentrations in ra decreased by 65 61 48 70 and 52 respectively significantly p 0 05 higher no3 n levels in groundwater in the rs and ca were found compared to the ds and ra importantly each n form concentration in the ca p 0 05 was higher than those in the ra no3 n was the most dominant n form in groundwater accounting for 61 of tn and no3 n concentrations in 45 of the groundwater samples exceeded who s maximum pollution limit 10 mg n l 1 3 3 no3 isotope compositions the measured δ15n no3 values in groundwater in the ds and ra ranged from 11 99 to 43 21 and 10 98 to 34 54 with mean values of 10 34 and 9 66 in fig 4 respectively which were relatively higher than those in the rs 12 78 to 42 84 mean 5 40 and ca 12 78 to 43 21 mean 6 86 the δ18o no3 values in groundwater ranged from 24 61 to 81 60 in the ds mean 5 38 and 27 62 to 27 78 for ca mean 4 17 while relatively lower δ18o no3 values were observed during the rs 27 62 to 27 78 mean 1 77 and ra 24 61 to 81 60 mean 2 66 4 discussion 4 1 no3 source identification and source contribution in groundwater no3 sources and proportional contributions were identified and estimated by the no3 isotope cross plot diagram and siar model respectively fig 5 we found that no3 source contributions varied with seasonal changes and land uses which has also been extensively considered in previous studies cui et al 2020 wang et al 2017 xuan et al 2022 the values ranged from 12 78 to 43 21 for δ15n no3 and 27 62 to 81 60 for δ18o no3 in groundwater suggesting that there were multiple no3 sources and mixed n inputs the compositions of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 showed no3 sources derived from a mixture of sn m s and nf in fig 5 and most groundwater samples were distributed within sn and m s source windows which indicated that sn or m s were identified as potential primary no3 sources hydrochemical parameters are also an effective indicator of the main sources for no3 pollution he et al 2022 kendall et al 2007 for example cl and na are good indicators of pollution sources for human activities manure septic tank effluents and domestic sewage kim et al 2019 wang et al 2021 and k can be an indicator of chemical fertilizer zhang et al 2020 generally high cl concentrations mainly originate from m s and high no3 cl ratios are caused by agricultural activities li et al 2019 liu et al 2006 the lower no3 cl ratios and higher cl concentrations in the ds rs and ra indicated that m s may have contributed more significantly to no3 in groundwater than nf while nf may be more dominant in ca than in m s fig s2 moreover the ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 types in the ds rs and ca were the second dominant hydrochemical types fig 2 suggesting that groundwater has been contaminated by manure and septic tank effluents kim et al 2021 min et al 2002 but the second hydrochemical types in ra were dominated by na hco3 types and had relatively lower no3 na ratios but higher na concentrations figs 2 and s3 which indicated that groundwater was maximally affected by domestic sewage discharge than manure yang et al 2019 2020 notably δ15n no3 values from 55 47 and 44 of groundwater samples in the rs ca and ra were distributed within sn source windows 0 to 8 fig 5 respectively with most groundwater samples showing lower no3 cl ratios which may be seen as a signal that sn was the largest no3 contributor in groundwater xue et al 2009 jin et al 2018 in addition to sn m s and nf sources no3 sources may also originate from ad including no3 and nh4 from rainfall however nh4 concentrations in precipitation are lower and even below the detection limit ren et al 2022 zhan et al 2017 the no3 n concentrations are also low and usually enter directly into surface water and soil and only 1 of groundwater δ18o no3 fall within the expected value ranges of ad kendall et al 2007 thus ad is unlikely to contribute more no3 to groundwater the proportional contributions of potential n sources to groundwater no3 pollution were further quantitatively estimated by the siar model fig 5 the evaluation results of the siar model revealed that sn contributed the highest no3 to groundwater in the rs and ca accounting for 53 and 51 respectively followed by m s 23 and 20 respectively and nf 21 and 26 respectively while the maximal no3 contributor in groundwater in the ds was m s 52 sn 25 and nf 19 consisting of additional sources notably no3 sources in ra were dominated by sn 44 and m s 41 but nf only accounted for 13 as expected no groundwater samples fell in the ad source windows and only 2 to 4 of groundwater no3 sources were attributed to ad 4 2 n transformation processes in groundwater relatively higher δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were observed in the ds and ca than in the rs and ra indicating that the dominant n biogeochemistry processes changed in different seasons and land uses yue et al 2020 previous studies have revealed that the initial isotope values of different no3 sources can be modified by multiple n cycling processes such as nitrification and denitrification kendall and mcdonnell 2012 yang and toor 2016 while the no3 isotope method provides insights into the dominant n transformation processes in groundwater hu et al 2019 generally no3 is reduced to gaseous n by denitrification in anaerobic environments kuypers et al 2018 heterotrophic microbes preferentially use light isotopes i e 14n and 16o causing simultaneous enrichment of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in residual no3 and a decrease in no3 concentrations denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 and the ratios of residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 range from 2 1 to 1 1 during denitrification or assimilation processes böttcher et al 1990 kendall et al 2007 yue et al 2020 in this study the slopes between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the rs slope 0 98 r2 0 46 p 0 001 ca slope 0 65 r2 0 41 p 0 001 and ra slope 0 60 r2 0 28 p 0 001 were within the range of denitrification values fig 6 and a significant negative correlation between δ15n no3 and ln no3 in the rs slope 1 18 ca slope 0 61 and ra slope 0 50 was also found fig s4 these results indicated that denitrification may be the dominant n transformation process in groundwater in the rs ca and ra moreover we also ascribed the strong denitrification signal to anoxic or hypoxic environments facilitating denitrification archana et al 2018 ren et al 2022 and the groundwater do concentrations in the rs 1 57 mg l 1 ca 1 30 mg l 1 and ra 1 66 mg l 1 were consistent with the expected denitrification in table s6 2 mg l 1 rivett et al 2008 microbial nitrification is a multistep oxidation of ammonium compounds to no3 by multiple nitrifying bacteria denk et al 2017 ji et al 2017 and the newly produced δ18o no3 values can be determined due to one oxygen from atmospheric o2 and the remaining two oxygen are derived from h2o mayer et al 2001 thus the theoretical δ18o no3 value ranges derived from microbial nitrification processes were estimated by the equation δ18o no3 2 3 δ18o h2o 1 3 δ18o o2 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 and the estimated δ18o no3 values ranged from 6 23 to 9 97 in the study table s5 with greater than 67 of groundwater δ18o no3 values in the ds falling within the expected theoretical range for nitrification fig 5 meanwhile relatively high do levels fig s4 2 56 mg l 1 in groundwater in the ds were observed and were higher than the expected denitrification conditions 2 mg l 1 these results indicated the presence of nitrification in the ds and was the dominant n cycling process husic et al 2020 ren et al 2022 notably a small part of δ18o no3 values in groundwater samples in the ds exceeded or was below the expected theoretical range for nitrification with lower do concentrations also found which indicated that partial denitrification may occur in the ds partial nitrification cannot be excluded due to local aerobic conditions in certain groundwater samples in the rs ca and ra 4 3 effects of land use and seasonal changes on isotopic characteristics n sources and dynamics the δ15n no3 values in groundwater in the ds and ra were higher than those in the rs and ca and the δ18o no3 values in the ds and ca were relatively enriched than those in the rs and ra which were consistent with the results of our previous study cui et al 2020 many studies have found that land use and seasonal changes largely determined the no3 isotopic characteristics nejatijahromi et al 2019 pastén zapata et al 2014 xuan et al 2022 in general the higher δ15n no3 appeared in ra was mainly attributed to the discharge of domestic sewage and livestock manure as well as the higher population density and landfill leachate leakage ji et al 2022 choi et al 2017 compared with ra the lower δ15n no3 value was observed in ca mainly because sn and nf were the dominant no3 sources ji et al 2022 xuan et al 2022 while no3 isotopes enrichment in ds may be due to the increased fertilizer n consumption and the enhanced volatilization of livestock manure during this period pastén zapata et al 2014 as well as evaporation of leachate from landfills septic tanks and domestic waste at high temperatures but these pollutants would be washed and diluted by rain during the rs however the δ18o no3 values were mainly affected by microbial nitrification but not n sources and land use and seasonal changes barnes and raymond 2010 xuan et al 2022 our study found that no3 n was the dominant n form in groundwater accounting for up to 60 fig 3 which is a strong threat to groundwater quality and human health previous studies have reported that the sources and dynamics of n are driven by seasonal changes and land uses husic et al 2021 wang et al 2017 xuan et al 2022 rainfall is the vital driving force for the source and concentration changes of n in groundwater in the ds and rs and directly determines the sources and losses of n and the length and process of the transport path srivastava et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the groundwater table in the ds drops due to a lack of sufficient rainfall recharge and surface flow loses the hydraulic connection with groundwater after long rain free days so that n derived from sn and nf accumulates and is stored in the soil layer which greatly reduces the n form concentrations in groundwater resulting in lower n concentrations in the ds than those in the rs fig 3 thus no3 n sources in groundwater in the ds can be dominated by m s since the domestic sewage and wastewater discharge leakage from sanitary sewers and septic tank effluents are not greatly affected by seasonal changes pastén zapata et al 2014 this is also the cause of m s being the largest no3 contributor in ra however the accumulated sn and nf can find a transport path to reach groundwater once the soil is rewetted and the groundwater table rises again in the rs which greatly promotes the losses of sn and nf and exacerbates the inflow of domestic sewage and leachate into groundwater resulting in higher n concentrations and increasing sn and nf contributions to n in groundwater figs 3 and 5 meanwhile groundwater table fluctuation is a nonnegligible sn loss pathway chen et al 2022 cui et al 2022 especially in ca frequent groundwater table fluctuations and agricultural irrigation and heavy rainfall accelerate the sn migration into groundwater min et al 2022 yu et al 2021 therefore sn was the largest no3 contributor in groundwater from ca and it still had a higher contribution to groundwater no3 in ra our results revealed that m s was the important n contributor in ra which can be attributed to the dense villages and population promoting m s production and discharge table s1 while sewage pipe networks and septic systems are relatively absent in ra moreover we found that the contribution rate of nf and groundwater no3 n concentrations in ca were much higher than that in ra fig 5 which was mainly driven by intense agricultural intensification activities such as high nf application rates the difference of multiple cropping index of crops in the 8 lake basins was caused by different crops and planting methods resulting in a large difference in n fertilizer application the annual n application rate of protected vegetables and flowers is much higher than that of field crops and open vegetables our previous study also observed that due to different agricultural intensification intensity no3 n concentrations in different agricultural regions showed as follows facility agricultural region intensive agricultural region cropland fallow region cui et al 2023 while sn and nf contributions to no3 in groundwater were 44 and 13 in ra respectively and m s contributed 20 in ca suggesting that mixed n pollution occurred between ca and ra which can be explained by the scattered villages that are surrounded by cropland thereby promoting groundwater n flow between ca and ra however although no3 source contributions and concentrations varied with seasonal changes and land uses sn and m s remain the largest no3 contributors to groundwater suggesting that mixed n pollution from point and nonpoint sources occurred simultaneously in groundwater these results implied that controlling no3 in groundwater is facing a new challenge especially sn which is not easily controlled due to the strong influence of rainfall and groundwater table fluctuation previous studies have revealed that groundwater is an appreciable lake water recharge source vystavna et al 2021 and no3 concentrations in groundwater continue to increase along high elevation mountain areas to the lakeside in plateau lake basins wang et al 2020a hence groundwater n input is probably one of the foremost culprits of lake water deterioration in the study area 4 4 uncertainty analysis and implications for n pollution control in groundwater the initial isotopic composition of different no3 sources may be altered due to complex isotope fractionation produced by multiple n cycling processes e g denitrification nitrification and ammonia volatilization and mixing of multiple no3 sources from agricultural and anthropogenic activities kellman 2005 xue et al 2009 causing the identification of no3 sources in groundwater to be biased moreover the isotopic end member eigenvalues of no3 pollution sources are highly sensitive and closely related to no3 source apportionment estimated by the siar model ji et al 2022 however large spatiotemporal variations in no3 sources and isotope compositions are caused by land uses seasonal changes and isotope fractionation these factors lead to different degrees of uncertainty in no3 source identification and source contributions in our study ji et al 2022 thus it is necessary to obtain accurate isotopic end member eigenvalues of no3 sources and introduce isotopic fractionation factors into the siar model to reduce the uncertainty and improve the accuracy of source apportionment our results revealed the largest no3 contributions in groundwater from sn and m s while the local government s strategy of reducing fertilizer application has effectively reduced the contribution of nf to groundwater no3 pollution controlling exogenous nitrogen inputs remains the most straightforward and effective way to address alleviating groundwater n pollution therefore reducing no3 loading from sn and m s is crucial for controlling groundwater pollution specifically sewage pipe networks and septic systems should be established and improved in ra and efficiently centralized domestic sewage treatment and formulated high standard discharge requirements are needed agricultural strategies for improving sn retention capacity and reducing n loss in ca include alternative cropping systems autret et al 2019 the use of organic amendments bah et al 2020 the application of organic and biobased fertilizers liu et al 2021 sun et al 2020 and improved irrigation management notably it is important to regulate the groundwater table and increase groundwater residence times to mitigate sn loss and stacking animal manure or manure compost in a manure tank is an effective measure to avoid rainfall erosion and sewage leakage from manure in the rs finally strategies for enhancing the denitrification removal of groundwater no3 include increasing the microbially available carbon source taylor and townsend 2010 and artificial wetlands and cropland buffer zones should be established to efficiently reduce groundwater n input into lakes cui et al 2022 hansen et al 2018 5 conclusions this study traced the sources and transformation processes of groundwater n in plateau lake basins in the context of changes in season and land use using no3 stable isotopes combined with hydrochemical data environmental parameters and the siar model the results showed that n form concentrations in the rs and ca were higher than those in the ds and ra suggesting that the rs and ca are a critical time and zone respectively for controlling n loss the no3 pollution sources in the groundwater in the rs ca and ra were dominated by sn contributing 53 51 and 44 of no3 n respectively followed by m s 23 20 and 41 respectively and nf 21 26 and 13 respectively while m s contributed the highest no3 to groundwater in the ds accounting for 52 sn 25 and nf 19 as secondary sources denitrification was observed to be the dominant n transformation process within the rs ca and ra whereas nitrification occurred mainly in the groundwater during the ds this study highlighted that mixed land uses and seasonal variations altered no3 source apportionment and n concentrations in groundwater resulting in mixed pollution of multiple n sources however sn and m s were the highest no3 contributors in groundwater around plateau lakes which poses a major challenge for groundwater no3 control hence accelerating the construction of sewage networks and septic tanks and scientific sn management are necessary to improve groundwater quality credit authorship

1985,as an important recharge source for lakes groundwater has become one of the dominant routes of nitrogen n input into lakes understanding the source and behaviour of n around plateau lakes is essential for improving groundwater and lake water quality this study used no3 stable isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 combined with hydrochemical data environmental parameters and a bayesian stable isotope mixing model siar to elaborate the no3 sources and contributions and n concentrations and cycling processes in groundwater n 476 from 8 plateau lake basins in regard to land uses and seasonal changes we found that multiple n form concentrations in the rainy season rs and cropland ca were higher than those in the dry season ds and residential area ra no3 n was the most dominant n form and 45 of groundwater samples exceeded the who no3 drinking water threshold the no3 isotopes and siar model revealed that soil n sn manure and sewage m s and n fertilizer nf were the main no3 sources in groundwater contributing 47 5 30 5 and 19 5 based on land uses and 39 0 37 5 and 20 0 based on seasonal changes respectively moreover denitrification was considered the primary n transformation process in the groundwater in the rs ca and ra but the n transformation process in the ds was dominated by nitrification these results indicated that n concentration and source varied with land use and seasonal changes and the cross distribution of ca and ra and difference in seasonal rainfall resulted in the difference in multiple n sources and source contributions in groundwater despite changes in land uses and seasons sn and m s remain the largest no3 contributors to groundwater which poses new challenges to control groundwater no3 pollution in the area around plateau lakes with a cross distribution of ca and ra therefore improving septic tanks and sewage networks and scientific soil n management are essential for controlling groundwater pollution keywords groundwater no3 isotopes no3 pollution n cycling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the world s largest distributed repository of high quality fresh water groundwater is widely used in daily life agriculture and industry groundwater accounts for 36 42 and 27 of water used in those applications respectively döll et al 2012 in china 70 of the drinking water supply comes from groundwater qiu 2011 however groundwater contamination has become a global environmental problem of widespread concern han et al 2016 ma et al 2020 for example 68 8 and 17 6 of groundwater samples from 10 171 monitoring wells across china were classified as poor ⅳ class and very poor ⅴ class mee 2021 respectively while increased nitrogen n discharges have become one of the culprits of all n forms higher no3 is a vital factor contributing to human health e g methemoglobinemia and aquatic ecosystem degradation e g eutrophication fan and steinberg 1996 wells et al 2018 groundwater no3 pollution sources include point and nonpoint sources yi et al 2020 the nonpoint sources mainly consist of soil n sn n fertilizer nf and atmospheric deposition ad xuan et al 2022 yang et al 2016 and the point sources are mainly derived from domestic sewage and industrial wastewater discharge leachate from livestock poultry farms and municipal landfills leakage from sanitary sewers and septic tank effluents pastén zapata et al 2014 moreover groundwater no3 concentrations and sources are also affected by multiple n transformations denk et al 2017 for example higher nh 4 n concentrations can promote nitrification and inhibit no3 removal by assimilation causing no3 accumulation in urbanized rivers xuan et al 2020 in general overusing nf in agricultural areas is generally considered the major source for groundwater no3 kaushal et al 2011 while point sources are considered the dominant no3 pollution source in urbanized areas peters et al 2020 however many studies have suggested that manure and sewage m s and sn are the predominant contributors to groundwater no3 pollution in agricultural regions ji et al 2017 kou et al 2021 which means that rapid urbanization development and agricultural activities are changing the groundwater n pollution sources and source contributions liu et al 2019 understanding the potential n sources and cycle processes and quantitatively estimating source apportionment are crucial to controlling and reducing different n sources in groundwater previous studies have found that most lakes and rivers depend on groundwater recharge vystavna et al 2021 therefore groundwater becomes an important transport medium for pollutants into lakes and rivers hu et al 2019 while groundwater n concentrations and sources strongly determine the degree of n pollution in lakes and rivers effectively controlling the groundwater n concentrations around lakes and rivers is critical in protecting surface water quality however the n sources and transformation processes and their contributions to groundwater are driven by multiple natural and anthropic factors such as land use wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 rainfall wang et al 2020b yue et al 2020 agricultural activities kim et al 2021 kou et al 2021 runoff xuan et al 2022 seasonal change cui et al 2020 peters et al 2020 and hydrochemistry castaldo et al 2021 these driving factors pose many challenges to elucidating and validating the sources and transformation processes of n in groundwater especially in lake basins with mixed land use areas where highly complex hydrological systems and agricultural and human activities further increase the uncertainty of n behaviour and source apportionment in groundwater no3 source largely reflects the n sources in groundwater associating land use types with water chemical compositions e g anions and cations is a traditional method to determine no3 sources and n cycle processes kim et al 2019 but the results obtained by traditional methods are inaccurate and unable to accurately evaluate the contribution of no3 sources thus the no3 stable isotope δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 method can be an efficient alternative or complementary tool and provide meaningful insight into no3 sources and n transformation processes due to different no3 sources showing unique isotopic characteristics kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 this approach has been successfully used to identify n sources and biogeochemical processes in groundwater and surface water in the past twenty years meanwhile the advantages of the no3 stable isotope method also include less requirements for auxiliary information high accuracy simple operation and direct identification of no3 source ji et al 2022 in general the δ15n no3 in m s and δ18o no3 in ad are highest and mineral fertilizer is the lowest δ15n no3 value followed by sn zhang et al 2020 these information are useful for tracing no3 sources in the water environment however the no3 dual isotope method alone does not always provide accurate information and quantify source contributions due to the overlap of no3 isotopes from different sources e g nf vs sn sn vs m s mixing of multiple no3 sources and no3 isotope fractionations during biogeochemical cycle processes wang et al 2017 xue et al 2009 hence many studies have attempted to identify no3 sources and transformation processes by using no3 isotopes combined with other isotopes e g δ34s so4 2 δ11b hydrochemical data e g cl na environmental parameters e g dissolved oxygen and multivariate statistical analysis e g redundancy analysis he et al 2022 ren et al 2022 importantly the bayesian stable isotope mixing model siar has recently been successfully used to provide quantitative information for the apportionment of no3 sources it overcomes the limitations of the linear isotopic mixing model no more than three sources and can evaluate the contributions of more than three no3 sources jani and toor 2018 ren et al 2022 there are complex hydrological systems and high intensity agricultural and human activities in 8 plateau lake basins in southwestern china groundwater rainfall and surface water are appreciable lake water recharge sources and villages and cropland around plateau lakes are scattered and surrounded by each other therefore plateau lake basins are typical mixed land use areas notably groundwater and lake water are frequently exchanged and recharged by each other with seasonal changes but groundwater n pollution is extremely serious in this area and mean n and no3 n concentrations reach 24 35 and 15 15 mg l 1 respectively li et al 2022 which poses a severe threat to lake water quality safety however few studies have focused on n sources transformations and contributions of n sources in groundwater in 8 plateau lake basins which makes it easy to overlook potentially dominant n sources and to attribute n pollution in lakes and groundwater to nf overuse given the above considerations this study collected groundwater samples from irrigation and drinking wells near approximately 8 plateau lakes and the physicochemical parameters and no3 isotopes in groundwater were measured the main objectives of this integrated analysis were to 1 identify the no3 sources and n cycle processes 2 quantify different no3 source contributions and 3 reveal the factors driving n concentration change in groundwater and propose suggestions for controlling groundwater n pollution this study provides valuable information for controlling n pollution in groundwater and lake water and effectively managing n in plateau lake basins with mixed land uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area eight plateau lake basins including dianchi lake dclb erhai lake ehlb fuxian lake fxlb xingyun lake xylb yangzonghai lake yzhlb yilong lake yllb qilu lake qllb and chenghai lake chlb are located on the yunnan guizhou plateau southwest china fig 1 and lie between 21 8 n to 29 15 n and 97 31 e to 106 11 e the total area of the 8 lake basins is approximately 7742 68 km2 and the lake area is more than 980 50 km2 with freshwater storage of nearly 5 277 09 108 m3 of china s freshwater resources table s1 the elevation in the study area ranges from 1414 to 2000 m mean 1748 m the area has a typical low latitude plateau subtropical monsoon climate the precipitation is relatively abundant with annual precipitation ranging from 756 to 1100 mm mean 932 mm but over 80 of the precipitation falls in the rainy season rs june to november and 20 falls in the dry season ds the average annual temperature ranges from 14 9 to 19 2 mean 16 7 land use types in the study area are dominated by cropland ca and residential areas ra located on the lacustrine plain above holocene lacustrine and fluvial mixed facies containing lacustrine and fluvial sediments fig s1 the major aquifer types contain pore water in loose rock aquifers fractured karst water in carbonate aquifers and some intrusive rock aquifers paddy soil and red soil are the main soil types in ca the total crop planting area in the 8 lake basins is approximately 149 130 hm2 table s2 and vegetables are the main crops accounting for 34 of the total crop planting area the average fertilization rates of chemical n fertilizer and organic fertilizer for crops per season are 276 kg hm 2 and 7830 kg hm 2 of organic fertilizer in the 8 lake basins respectively and chemical n fertilizer and organic fertilizer are the major sources of n fertilizer there are certain differences in fertilizer application due to different crops and planting ways in the 8 lake basins the cropland around dcl and yzhl is mainly planted with protected vegetables and flowers the cropland around fxl has been fallow since 2018 the cropland around other lakes is mainly planted with field crops and open vegetables protected flowers are planted throughout the year and the average multiple cropping index of protected vegetables open field vegetables and field crops is 5 times 3 times and 2 times throughout the year respectively organic fertilizer is mainly derived from livestock and poultry breeding and approximately 39 55 104 livestock and 968 45 104 poultry breeding in the 8 lake basins are farmed by scale farming and scattered farming table s3 which directly results in a large amount of n produced by livestock and poultry breeding moreover more than 2 32 million people live in approximately 3123 villages in the 8 lake basins table s1 and domestic sewage is mainly collected and treated through pipe networks or directly discharged without pipe networks villages are scattered and surrounded by cropland groundwater and lake water are the primary sources of drinking water however the quality of water environment is seriously threatened by high intensity agricultural activities intensive livestock farming and domestic sewage discharge such as eutrophication of lake water in different degrees table s1 2 2 sample collection we selected the typical representative months of the rs august and the ds april for groundwater sampling groundwater samples were collected from 238 wells in the 8 plateau lake basins fig 1 for physicochemical parameter analysis in august 2020 rs n 238 including 163 samples from ca and 75 samples from ra and april 2021 ds n 238 including 164 samples from ca and 74 samples from ra table s4 500 ml water sample collector plexiglass water collector yuheng china was used to collect groundwater samples approximately 50 cm from the groundwater surface and 100 ml of groundwater sample was collected and stored in a polyethylene bottle for n form analysis moreover a total of 343 samples including 174 samples from ds 107 samples from ca and 67 samples from ra and 169 samples from rs 107 samples from ca and 62 samples from ra were collected and filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose membranes and then stored in 100 ml polyethylene bottles for no3 isotope and chemical ion analysis all groundwater samples were stored in an incubator with ice packs immediately transferred to a 4 c refrigerator for storage in the laboratory and analyzed within a week 2 3 physicochemical parameters and isotope analysis the field monitoring parameters including ph temperature t oxidation reduction potential orp electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a handheld multiparameter equipment ysi proplus xylem usa and a steel tape measure was used to measure the groundwater depth the filtered and unfiltered groundwater samples were analyzed for total dissolved n tdn and total n tn by using a visible spectrophotometer t6 xinrui puxi china and measured no3 n and nh4 n using a continuous flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 seal germany particulate organic n pon tn tdn and dissolved organic n don tdn no3 n nh4 n anions cl so2 4 were measured using an ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 thermo fisher usa and hco3 were measured by volumetric titration method and cations k na ca2 and mg2 were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icap 7600 thermo fisher usa the detection limits and testing standards for all physicochemical parameters can be found in table s6 and quality control quality assurance were implemented based on the relevant testing standard of china no3 isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in groundwater were analyzed using the denitrifier method and an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 finnigan germany casciotti et al 2002 four international standards usgs32 usgs34 usgs35 and iaean3 were used to correct the obtained isotope values and the analytical precision was 0 2 for δ15n no3 and 0 4 for δ18o no3 the isotope ratios are expressed in δ values and per mil relative to air and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rstandard and rsample are the ratios of 15n 14n and 18o 16o of the standard and sample for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 respectively 2 4 methods for determining the source fate and source contribution of no3 four potential no3 sources including ad nf sn and m s were considered in this study the endmember values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of each no3 source were obtained from the literature table s5 and compared with δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in groundwater to determine the no3 sources no3 isotopes were used to identify biogeochemical cycle processes e g nitrification and denitrification the dominant no3 sources and fates were also determined by a combination of hydrochemical parameters and no3 isotopes to quantify the contributions of no3 four source siar was implemented based on no3 isotopes in groundwater ren et al 2022 yang and toor 2016 the basic algorithm of siar can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 2 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 ε ij n 0 σ j 2 where xij represents the isotope value j of the mixture i i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 j sjk is the source value k of the isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean value μjk and standard deviation ωjk pk represents the proportion of source k which can be estimated by siar cjk represents the isotope fractionation factor for the isotope j of source k and the mean value is λjk and the standard deviation is τjk and εij is the residual error which refers to the additional unquantified variation for the individual mixtures and follows a normal distribution with a mean value 0 and standard deviation σj the siar model was run by r package software and r platform version 4 1 0 the typical end member values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 from ad nf m s and sn used in the siar model were selected from the literature table 1 wang et al 2020a yin et al 2020 3 results 3 1 major ion compositions the anions and cations in most groundwater samples were dominated by hco3 and ca2 respectively fig 2 table s6 most groundwater samples contained the ca2 mg2 hco3 type the second dominant hydrochemical type in the ds rs and ca was the ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 type but it was the na k hco3 type in ra suggesting that land use was a vital reason for the difference in the dominant hydrochemical type and groundwater was polluted by agricultural activities anthropogenic activities and manure zhang et al 2020 moreover the na k cl so4 2 type was observed in groundwater which indicated that groundwater was affected by domestic sewage and chemical fertilizer richards et al 2016 xue et al 2009 3 2 the concentrations and compositions of n forms the concentrations of n forms in groundwater from different seasons and land uses are shown in fig 3 and table s6 the concentrations of tn no3 n nh4 n don and pon in groundwater from rs and ca were 23 05 mg l 1 15 71 mg l 1 0 68 mg l 1 4 14 mg l 1 2 23 mg l 1 and 27 47 mg l 1 16 54 mg l 1 0 95 mg l 1 5 89 mg l 1 2 69 mg l 1 respectively compared with n concentration in groundwater from rs the tn and no3 n concentrations in ds decreased by 8 and 21 respectively while the nh4 n don and pon concentrations increased by 15 28 and 6 respectively compared with n concentration in groundwater from ca the tn no3 n nh4 n don and pon concentrations in ra decreased by 65 61 48 70 and 52 respectively significantly p 0 05 higher no3 n levels in groundwater in the rs and ca were found compared to the ds and ra importantly each n form concentration in the ca p 0 05 was higher than those in the ra no3 n was the most dominant n form in groundwater accounting for 61 of tn and no3 n concentrations in 45 of the groundwater samples exceeded who s maximum pollution limit 10 mg n l 1 3 3 no3 isotope compositions the measured δ15n no3 values in groundwater in the ds and ra ranged from 11 99 to 43 21 and 10 98 to 34 54 with mean values of 10 34 and 9 66 in fig 4 respectively which were relatively higher than those in the rs 12 78 to 42 84 mean 5 40 and ca 12 78 to 43 21 mean 6 86 the δ18o no3 values in groundwater ranged from 24 61 to 81 60 in the ds mean 5 38 and 27 62 to 27 78 for ca mean 4 17 while relatively lower δ18o no3 values were observed during the rs 27 62 to 27 78 mean 1 77 and ra 24 61 to 81 60 mean 2 66 4 discussion 4 1 no3 source identification and source contribution in groundwater no3 sources and proportional contributions were identified and estimated by the no3 isotope cross plot diagram and siar model respectively fig 5 we found that no3 source contributions varied with seasonal changes and land uses which has also been extensively considered in previous studies cui et al 2020 wang et al 2017 xuan et al 2022 the values ranged from 12 78 to 43 21 for δ15n no3 and 27 62 to 81 60 for δ18o no3 in groundwater suggesting that there were multiple no3 sources and mixed n inputs the compositions of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 showed no3 sources derived from a mixture of sn m s and nf in fig 5 and most groundwater samples were distributed within sn and m s source windows which indicated that sn or m s were identified as potential primary no3 sources hydrochemical parameters are also an effective indicator of the main sources for no3 pollution he et al 2022 kendall et al 2007 for example cl and na are good indicators of pollution sources for human activities manure septic tank effluents and domestic sewage kim et al 2019 wang et al 2021 and k can be an indicator of chemical fertilizer zhang et al 2020 generally high cl concentrations mainly originate from m s and high no3 cl ratios are caused by agricultural activities li et al 2019 liu et al 2006 the lower no3 cl ratios and higher cl concentrations in the ds rs and ra indicated that m s may have contributed more significantly to no3 in groundwater than nf while nf may be more dominant in ca than in m s fig s2 moreover the ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 types in the ds rs and ca were the second dominant hydrochemical types fig 2 suggesting that groundwater has been contaminated by manure and septic tank effluents kim et al 2021 min et al 2002 but the second hydrochemical types in ra were dominated by na hco3 types and had relatively lower no3 na ratios but higher na concentrations figs 2 and s3 which indicated that groundwater was maximally affected by domestic sewage discharge than manure yang et al 2019 2020 notably δ15n no3 values from 55 47 and 44 of groundwater samples in the rs ca and ra were distributed within sn source windows 0 to 8 fig 5 respectively with most groundwater samples showing lower no3 cl ratios which may be seen as a signal that sn was the largest no3 contributor in groundwater xue et al 2009 jin et al 2018 in addition to sn m s and nf sources no3 sources may also originate from ad including no3 and nh4 from rainfall however nh4 concentrations in precipitation are lower and even below the detection limit ren et al 2022 zhan et al 2017 the no3 n concentrations are also low and usually enter directly into surface water and soil and only 1 of groundwater δ18o no3 fall within the expected value ranges of ad kendall et al 2007 thus ad is unlikely to contribute more no3 to groundwater the proportional contributions of potential n sources to groundwater no3 pollution were further quantitatively estimated by the siar model fig 5 the evaluation results of the siar model revealed that sn contributed the highest no3 to groundwater in the rs and ca accounting for 53 and 51 respectively followed by m s 23 and 20 respectively and nf 21 and 26 respectively while the maximal no3 contributor in groundwater in the ds was m s 52 sn 25 and nf 19 consisting of additional sources notably no3 sources in ra were dominated by sn 44 and m s 41 but nf only accounted for 13 as expected no groundwater samples fell in the ad source windows and only 2 to 4 of groundwater no3 sources were attributed to ad 4 2 n transformation processes in groundwater relatively higher δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were observed in the ds and ca than in the rs and ra indicating that the dominant n biogeochemistry processes changed in different seasons and land uses yue et al 2020 previous studies have revealed that the initial isotope values of different no3 sources can be modified by multiple n cycling processes such as nitrification and denitrification kendall and mcdonnell 2012 yang and toor 2016 while the no3 isotope method provides insights into the dominant n transformation processes in groundwater hu et al 2019 generally no3 is reduced to gaseous n by denitrification in anaerobic environments kuypers et al 2018 heterotrophic microbes preferentially use light isotopes i e 14n and 16o causing simultaneous enrichment of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in residual no3 and a decrease in no3 concentrations denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 and the ratios of residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 range from 2 1 to 1 1 during denitrification or assimilation processes böttcher et al 1990 kendall et al 2007 yue et al 2020 in this study the slopes between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the rs slope 0 98 r2 0 46 p 0 001 ca slope 0 65 r2 0 41 p 0 001 and ra slope 0 60 r2 0 28 p 0 001 were within the range of denitrification values fig 6 and a significant negative correlation between δ15n no3 and ln no3 in the rs slope 1 18 ca slope 0 61 and ra slope 0 50 was also found fig s4 these results indicated that denitrification may be the dominant n transformation process in groundwater in the rs ca and ra moreover we also ascribed the strong denitrification signal to anoxic or hypoxic environments facilitating denitrification archana et al 2018 ren et al 2022 and the groundwater do concentrations in the rs 1 57 mg l 1 ca 1 30 mg l 1 and ra 1 66 mg l 1 were consistent with the expected denitrification in table s6 2 mg l 1 rivett et al 2008 microbial nitrification is a multistep oxidation of ammonium compounds to no3 by multiple nitrifying bacteria denk et al 2017 ji et al 2017 and the newly produced δ18o no3 values can be determined due to one oxygen from atmospheric o2 and the remaining two oxygen are derived from h2o mayer et al 2001 thus the theoretical δ18o no3 value ranges derived from microbial nitrification processes were estimated by the equation δ18o no3 2 3 δ18o h2o 1 3 δ18o o2 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 and the estimated δ18o no3 values ranged from 6 23 to 9 97 in the study table s5 with greater than 67 of groundwater δ18o no3 values in the ds falling within the expected theoretical range for nitrification fig 5 meanwhile relatively high do levels fig s4 2 56 mg l 1 in groundwater in the ds were observed and were higher than the expected denitrification conditions 2 mg l 1 these results indicated the presence of nitrification in the ds and was the dominant n cycling process husic et al 2020 ren et al 2022 notably a small part of δ18o no3 values in groundwater samples in the ds exceeded or was below the expected theoretical range for nitrification with lower do concentrations also found which indicated that partial denitrification may occur in the ds partial nitrification cannot be excluded due to local aerobic conditions in certain groundwater samples in the rs ca and ra 4 3 effects of land use and seasonal changes on isotopic characteristics n sources and dynamics the δ15n no3 values in groundwater in the ds and ra were higher than those in the rs and ca and the δ18o no3 values in the ds and ca were relatively enriched than those in the rs and ra which were consistent with the results of our previous study cui et al 2020 many studies have found that land use and seasonal changes largely determined the no3 isotopic characteristics nejatijahromi et al 2019 pastén zapata et al 2014 xuan et al 2022 in general the higher δ15n no3 appeared in ra was mainly attributed to the discharge of domestic sewage and livestock manure as well as the higher population density and landfill leachate leakage ji et al 2022 choi et al 2017 compared with ra the lower δ15n no3 value was observed in ca mainly because sn and nf were the dominant no3 sources ji et al 2022 xuan et al 2022 while no3 isotopes enrichment in ds may be due to the increased fertilizer n consumption and the enhanced volatilization of livestock manure during this period pastén zapata et al 2014 as well as evaporation of leachate from landfills septic tanks and domestic waste at high temperatures but these pollutants would be washed and diluted by rain during the rs however the δ18o no3 values were mainly affected by microbial nitrification but not n sources and land use and seasonal changes barnes and raymond 2010 xuan et al 2022 our study found that no3 n was the dominant n form in groundwater accounting for up to 60 fig 3 which is a strong threat to groundwater quality and human health previous studies have reported that the sources and dynamics of n are driven by seasonal changes and land uses husic et al 2021 wang et al 2017 xuan et al 2022 rainfall is the vital driving force for the source and concentration changes of n in groundwater in the ds and rs and directly determines the sources and losses of n and the length and process of the transport path srivastava et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the groundwater table in the ds drops due to a lack of sufficient rainfall recharge and surface flow loses the hydraulic connection with groundwater after long rain free days so that n derived from sn and nf accumulates and is stored in the soil layer which greatly reduces the n form concentrations in groundwater resulting in lower n concentrations in the ds than those in the rs fig 3 thus no3 n sources in groundwater in the ds can be dominated by m s since the domestic sewage and wastewater discharge leakage from sanitary sewers and septic tank effluents are not greatly affected by seasonal changes pastén zapata et al 2014 this is also the cause of m s being the largest no3 contributor in ra however the accumulated sn and nf can find a transport path to reach groundwater once the soil is rewetted and the groundwater table rises again in the rs which greatly promotes the losses of sn and nf and exacerbates the inflow of domestic sewage and leachate into groundwater resulting in higher n concentrations and increasing sn and nf contributions to n in groundwater figs 3 and 5 meanwhile groundwater table fluctuation is a nonnegligible sn loss pathway chen et al 2022 cui et al 2022 especially in ca frequent groundwater table fluctuations and agricultural irrigation and heavy rainfall accelerate the sn migration into groundwater min et al 2022 yu et al 2021 therefore sn was the largest no3 contributor in groundwater from ca and it still had a higher contribution to groundwater no3 in ra our results revealed that m s was the important n contributor in ra which can be attributed to the dense villages and population promoting m s production and discharge table s1 while sewage pipe networks and septic systems are relatively absent in ra moreover we found that the contribution rate of nf and groundwater no3 n concentrations in ca were much higher than that in ra fig 5 which was mainly driven by intense agricultural intensification activities such as high nf application rates the difference of multiple cropping index of crops in the 8 lake basins was caused by different crops and planting methods resulting in a large difference in n fertilizer application the annual n application rate of protected vegetables and flowers is much higher than that of field crops and open vegetables our previous study also observed that due to different agricultural intensification intensity no3 n concentrations in different agricultural regions showed as follows facility agricultural region intensive agricultural region cropland fallow region cui et al 2023 while sn and nf contributions to no3 in groundwater were 44 and 13 in ra respectively and m s contributed 20 in ca suggesting that mixed n pollution occurred between ca and ra which can be explained by the scattered villages that are surrounded by cropland thereby promoting groundwater n flow between ca and ra however although no3 source contributions and concentrations varied with seasonal changes and land uses sn and m s remain the largest no3 contributors to groundwater suggesting that mixed n pollution from point and nonpoint sources occurred simultaneously in groundwater these results implied that controlling no3 in groundwater is facing a new challenge especially sn which is not easily controlled due to the strong influence of rainfall and groundwater table fluctuation previous studies have revealed that groundwater is an appreciable lake water recharge source vystavna et al 2021 and no3 concentrations in groundwater continue to increase along high elevation mountain areas to the lakeside in plateau lake basins wang et al 2020a hence groundwater n input is probably one of the foremost culprits of lake water deterioration in the study area 4 4 uncertainty analysis and implications for n pollution control in groundwater the initial isotopic composition of different no3 sources may be altered due to complex isotope fractionation produced by multiple n cycling processes e g denitrification nitrification and ammonia volatilization and mixing of multiple no3 sources from agricultural and anthropogenic activities kellman 2005 xue et al 2009 causing the identification of no3 sources in groundwater to be biased moreover the isotopic end member eigenvalues of no3 pollution sources are highly sensitive and closely related to no3 source apportionment estimated by the siar model ji et al 2022 however large spatiotemporal variations in no3 sources and isotope compositions are caused by land uses seasonal changes and isotope fractionation these factors lead to different degrees of uncertainty in no3 source identification and source contributions in our study ji et al 2022 thus it is necessary to obtain accurate isotopic end member eigenvalues of no3 sources and introduce isotopic fractionation factors into the siar model to reduce the uncertainty and improve the accuracy of source apportionment our results revealed the largest no3 contributions in groundwater from sn and m s while the local government s strategy of reducing fertilizer application has effectively reduced the contribution of nf to groundwater no3 pollution controlling exogenous nitrogen inputs remains the most straightforward and effective way to address alleviating groundwater n pollution therefore reducing no3 loading from sn and m s is crucial for controlling groundwater pollution specifically sewage pipe networks and septic systems should be established and improved in ra and efficiently centralized domestic sewage treatment and formulated high standard discharge requirements are needed agricultural strategies for improving sn retention capacity and reducing n loss in ca include alternative cropping systems autret et al 2019 the use of organic amendments bah et al 2020 the application of organic and biobased fertilizers liu et al 2021 sun et al 2020 and improved irrigation management notably it is important to regulate the groundwater table and increase groundwater residence times to mitigate sn loss and stacking animal manure or manure compost in a manure tank is an effective measure to avoid rainfall erosion and sewage leakage from manure in the rs finally strategies for enhancing the denitrification removal of groundwater no3 include increasing the microbially available carbon source taylor and townsend 2010 and artificial wetlands and cropland buffer zones should be established to efficiently reduce groundwater n input into lakes cui et al 2022 hansen et al 2018 5 conclusions this study traced the sources and transformation processes of groundwater n in plateau lake basins in the context of changes in season and land use using no3 stable isotopes combined with hydrochemical data environmental parameters and the siar model the results showed that n form concentrations in the rs and ca were higher than those in the ds and ra suggesting that the rs and ca are a critical time and zone respectively for controlling n loss the no3 pollution sources in the groundwater in the rs ca and ra were dominated by sn contributing 53 51 and 44 of no3 n respectively followed by m s 23 20 and 41 respectively and nf 21 26 and 13 respectively while m s contributed the highest no3 to groundwater in the ds accounting for 52 sn 25 and nf 19 as secondary sources denitrification was observed to be the dominant n transformation process within the rs ca and ra whereas nitrification occurred mainly in the groundwater during the ds this study highlighted that mixed land uses and seasonal variations altered no3 source apportionment and n concentrations in groundwater resulting in mixed pollution of multiple n sources however sn and m s were the highest no3 contributors in groundwater around plateau lakes which poses a major challenge for groundwater no3 control hence accelerating the construction of sewage networks and septic tanks and scientific sn management are necessary to improve groundwater quality credit authorship

1986,the process of erosion characterised by the loss of soil water and nutrients is the main cause of soil degradation and has numerous consequences for the agricultural sector and the environment the aim of the present study was to evaluate the loss of soil water and nutrients and the chemical attributes of the soil in an area with and without fertilisation with chicken litter under simulated rainfall in different rainfall patterns in addition to the financial impact resulting from the loss of nutrients using the infiasper simulator rainfall with advanced av intermediate in delayed dl and constant ct patterns were simulated in an area of a dystric acrisol following a randomised block design in a 2 4 factorial scheme totalling eight treatments with four replications the treatments comprised the areas with wcl and without ncl the surface application of chicken litter and subjected to the four rainfall patterns giving a total of 32 experimental units rainfall was applied for 40 min at an average intensity of 45 mm h 1 the mean values of the runoff depths did not vary as a function of fertilisation however there were differences in soil loss between the ncl and wcl treatments with the dl 10 55 and 34 98 g m 2 and ct 7 22 and 15 88 g m 2 patterns the greatest nutrient loss in the wcl treatments irrespective of the rainfall pattern is related to the presence of chicken litter in the wcl treatments the in pattern afforded the greatest loss of n 26 76 g kg 1 and p 14 58 g kg 1 while the ad pattern gave the greatest value for k 8 42 g kg 1 in the wcl plots the mean value for total organic carbon loss was 202 01 g kg 1 in wcl areas the greatest financial losses were seen for p2o5 reaching us 12 86 ha 1 in baixada fluminense for sowing transplanting in april and 3 7 times greater in the serrana region of the state of rio de janeiro in january in ncl areas n presented greater financial loss it can be concluded that in an area with the surface application of chicken litter the rainfall pattern interferes with the loss of n p and k and that financial losses from the loss of nutrients caused by water erosion can be even more marked when considering areas of greater slope keywords water erosion rain simulator organic fertiliser dystric acrisol financial loss rio de janeiro data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water erosion has a large impact on the environment especially in areas of high rainfall lima et al 2013 and is responsible for the degradation of approximately 56 of the agricultural areas in the world correa et al 2016 as a result annual soil loss in brazil is estimated at 1 18 billion tons giving a total cost annually of usd 5 2 billion simply to replace the nutrients lost in agricultural areas simões and ferraz 2019 the erosion process starts with raindrops impacting on the ground causing the soil particles to detach and then be transported and deposited in nearby locations panachuki et al 2006 as a consequence there is a loss of nutrients organic matter water and sediment as well as contamination of the soil and water bertol et al 2003 gilles et al 2009 wang et al 2014 bramorski et al 2015 which become more intense in cultivated areas with steep slopes santos et al 2020 and high intensity orographic rainfall carvalho et al 2005 soil and nutrient losses occur due to surface runoff which when heavy can transport both soluble nutrients and the nutrients adsorbed on entrained sediment bertol et al 2017 as such the nutrient concentration of the sediment and of the water drained by water erosion varies mainly as a function of the nutrient concentration in the soil and the type of soil management and fertilisation employed hernani et al 1999 bertol et al 2011 mineral or organic fertilisers used in agricultural areas are nutrient sources that are incorporated into the soil due to the growth of poultry farming many producers specially in the state of rio de janeiro brazil have been using chicken litter in fertilization because it is low cost and has good agronomic characteristics macedo et al 2023 this material has great potential as an organic fertiliser blum et al 2003 santos dalólio et al 2017 in the production of different crops particularly vegetables according to mitchell and tu 2006 chicken litter is an organic source with high levels of nutrients especially n p and k the use of rainfall simulators in studies related to water erosion is widespread with the aim of obtaining quick results for dealing with the problem oliveira et al 2010 carvalho et al 2015 panachuki et al 2015 almeida et al 2016 almeida et al 2018 simulators are pieces of equipment with different characteristics that allow experiments to be reproduced eliminating the variability unpredictability and irregularity of natural rainfall events boulange et al 2019 saber et al 2019 among portable models the infiasper alves sobrinho et al 2008 is the most used in brazil and has been employed in studies of water erosion under different conditions of soil management and land use carvalho et al 2022 as natural rainfall events show variations in precipitation intensity pi throughout their duration alavinia et al 2019 dunkerley 2021 simulators can better represent a natural event if they have mechanisms that allow instantaneous variation of the intensity during tests reproducing different rainfall patterns in this respect macedo et al 2021 proposed a new control panel for the infiasper simulator that allows the pi to be varied automatically by selecting pre defined rainfall patterns according to flanagan et al 1988 the patterns are classified according to the moment of occurrence of the precipitation peak in relation to the rainfall duration which may influence the erosion process in the delayed pattern for example the pi peak occurs in the final third of the rainfall when the surface layer of the soil has a high water content favoring greater runoff using rainfall simulators the effects of rainfall patterns on runoff and soil losses have been evaluated across different classes land use and management oliveira et al 2010 carvalho et al 2012 gao et al 2018 carvalho et al 2022 but little information is available regarding associated nutrient losses in the present study rainfall with different patterns was related to fertilisation with chicken litter with the aim of evaluating the loss of nutrients and organic carbon in eroded sediment and evaluating the chemical attributes of the soil after applying simulated rainfall using the infiasper simulator the aim of the present study therefore was to evaluate the effect of rainfall patterns on the loss of soil water and nutrients including changes in the chemical attributes of the soil after simulated rainfall in an area with and without fertilisation using chicken litter and the financial impact resulting from the loss of nutrients 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization of the experimental area the experiment was carried out from august to september 2021 in an experimental area located in the state of rio de janeiro brazil 22 76083 s 43 69760 w and average altitude of 33 m with an average slope of 0 09 m m 1 the predominant soil in the experimental area is a dystric acrisol with a loamy sand texture 0 0 0 34 m according to the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2022 which is equivalent to an argissolo vermelho amarelo distrófico típico according to the brazilian soil classification system santos et al 2018 the physical and chemical attributes of the soil were evaluated as per the methods of soil analysis handbook teixeira et al 2017 and are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively up to the ab horizon corresponding to a depth of 41 cm in addition to the chemical characterisation of the profile sampling was carried out at 10 random points in the arable layer 0 0 20 m of the experimental area to characterise the chemical attributes teixeira et al 2017 5 82 ph h2o 2 48 cmolc kg 1h al 3 1 40 cmolc dm 3 ca 2 0 40 cmolc dm 3 mg 2 59 mg dm 3 k 5 mg dm 3p and quantify the soil organic carbon soc via wet oxidation with potassium dichromate walkley and black 1934 25 82 g kg 1 the soil in the experimental area was ploughed once and harrowed twice in the direction of the terrain contour curves and kept without vegetation cover during the experiment 2 2 rainfall simulator characteristics and soil erosion evaluation the infiasper rainfall simulator alves sobrinho et al 2008 was used fig 1 a operating with 1 0 hp motor pump dancor w48j and a circular experimental plot of 0 8 m diameter 0 5 m2 fig 1b built of galvanized steel sheet according to moraes et al 2018 rainfall simulations on areas smaller than 1 5 m2 have been used to study surface sealing interrill and splash erosion the simulator model is a rotating disk and operates with two veejet 80 150 nozzles installed at a height of 2 3 m above the ground and with a service pressure of 35 6 kpa almeida et al 2021 operating under these conditions infiasper has shown an average drop diameter ranging from 1 45 to 2 20 mm simulating the kinetic energy of natural rain from 73 8 to 88 0 depending on the rotation of the disk macedo et al 2021 once installed the plots were pre wetted in order to standardise the soil moisture and favour the occurrence of surface runoff cogo et al 1984 surface runoff and sediment loss were assessed by collecting the runoff volume in each plot at 1 minute intervals from the onset of runoff the volume was quantified with the aid of a 1000 ml graduated test tube and the runoff depth was calculated from the ratio between its volume and the area of the experimental plot carvalho et al 2022 2 3 experimental design and soil erosion evaluation the experimental design was of randomised blocks in a 2 4 factorial scheme with four replications the treatments comprised plots with wcl and without ncl chicken litter and four rainfall patterns advanced av intermediate in delayed dl and constant ct fig 2 giving a total of 32 experimental units in the plots that received fertilisation wcl 165 50 g of chicken litter 100 kg of n ha 1 were applied directly to the experimental plot after pre wetting the chemical characterisation brasil 2017 of the fertilizer indicated 7 60 ph h2o 4 30 k2o 3 17 ca 2

patterns considering an average pi of 45 mm h 1 a depth of 30 mm duration of 40 min and maximum ri of 110 mm h 1 fig 2 from collected runoff soil loss was estimated by determining the weight of the entrained sediment per sample after oven drying the material at 60 c oliveira et al 2010 all the sediment from the runoff was then removed with the aid of a brush and stored in plastic containers for later analysis of the n p k and soc in analysing the n p and k 0 20 g of the material from the wcl treatments and 0 50 g of the material from the ncl treatments were used to analyse the soc 0 25 g were used for each sample p and k in the sediment were determined by spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively following nitric digestion as per tedesco et al 1995 the total n was determined using the kjeldahl digestion and distillation method teixeira et al 2017 the amount of n p k and soc g kg 1 in the sediment from the runoff from each plot was multiplied by the total loss of sediment g m 2 and later converted into kg ha 1 following the simulated rainfall soil samples were collected from each experimental plot using a 0 0 20 m soil auger and the ph ca mg al h al na k p and soc were determined as per teixeira et al 2017 2 4 experimental design and statistical analyses the data were submitted to the shapiro wilk test to verify the normality of the residuals to an analysis of variance anova and tukey s test at 5 probability to compare the mean values using the sisvar 5 6 software ferreira 2011 2 5 simplified financial analysis a simplified financial analysis relativeto the loss of n p2o5 and k2o by water erosion was performed considering the rainfall in the baixada fluminense where the field study was carried out and in the serrana region of the state of rio de janeiro rj an important hub for vegetable production in the state santos et al 2020 therefore rainfall indices from 1981 to 2010 and from 1991 to 2020 were used relative to stations located in the cities of seropédica rj code 83741 22 80 s 43 68 w altitude 33 0 m and teresópolis rj code 83744 22 42 s 42 97 w altitude 874 2 m respectively as per the normais climatológicas do brasil brazilian climatological standards inmet 2022 the cost estimate of nutrient losses was performed for the months corresponding to the sowing or transplanting of vegetables when they do not absorb significant amounts of nutrients and their aerial parts still do not influence the impact of raindrops on the soil therefore the price of mineral fertilisers and chicken litter available at the rio de janeiro supply centre ceasa were used these were us 126 75 us 69 24 us 160 00 and us 14 67 for each 100 kg of urea simple superphosphate potassium chloride and chicken litter respectively n was expressed based on the price of one kg of n in the form of urea 45 n p based on the price of one kg of p2o5 in the form of single superphosphate 18 p2o5 and k based on the price of one kg of k2o in the form of potassium chloride 60 k2o resulting in values per kg of us 2 82 n us 3 46 p2o5 and us 2 67 k2o for the chicken litter the values of the nutrients were us 0 57 us 0 70 and us 0 54 per kg of n p2o5 and k2o respectively considering the chemical characterisation due to the characteristics of the climate the sowing time or transplanting of species such of cauliflower broccoli beetroot tomato okra and cabbage among other vegetables that use both mineral fertilisers and chicken litter takes place from april to august in the baixada fluminense and from october to february in the serrana region the average monthly rainfall during the respective periods is 76 3 63 8 38 6 37 7 and28 9 mm apr aug and 106 4 231 5 277 4 285 1 and179 1 mm oct feb to estimate the financial losses from the loss of n p and k the respective losses in kg ha 1 were transformed into kg ha 1 mm 1 of simulated rainfall and then multiplied by the monthly rainfall corresponding to each region considering the percentage of the advanced 60 0 intermediate 24 0 and delayed 16 0 rainfall patterns as determined by carvalho et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil loss and surface runoff precipitation patterns influenced runoff and soil loss in plots without chicken litter application ncl table 3 despite being widely used in rainfall simulation studies the constant pattern ct does not represent the characteristics of rainfall dunkerley 2012 thus not reproducing the natural process of soil loss nielsen et al 2019 in this conditions runoff and soil loss were 1 8 and 3 0 times lower than in advanced av and intermediate in patterns with av the pi peak occurs 8 to 10 min after the onset of rain promoting greater accumulation of water at the outlet of the collecting plot with the application of chicken litter wcl soil loss were affected by the rainfall pattern in this condition the sediment present in the runoff contained fertilizer residues providing greater loss in relation to the ncl especially in the dl and ct patterns this increase in sediment loss is possibly due to the impact of raindrops in the soil surface mohamadi and kavian 2015 associated with the translocation of fine particles of the chicken litter in the upper soil layers as a consequence pore clogging may occur promoting greater accumulation of water on the soil surface during the final phase of the tests as the erosion process is the result of a combination of factors related to the soil type and management amore et al 2004 characteristics of the simulator such as diameter and kinetic energy of drops mhaske et al 2019 size and shape of the collecting plot kinnell 2016 among others results found in the literature are not often possible to compare when evaluating surface runoff in experimental stands with two types of soil and a slope of 0 5 alavinia et al 2019 found no significant differences in the mean values of the runoff depth considering different rainfall patterns according to tao et al 2017 the onset of surface runoff is related to the moment of peak rainfall however rainfall patterns have little effect on total runoff studies that evaluate water and sediment loss under simulated rainfall with different rainfall patterns both with and without the application of organic fertilisers are scarce in the literature gilles et al 2009 verified that the form of soil preparation had a greater influence on water losses compared to the type of fertilizer used chicken litter as an organic fertilizer urea and triple superphosphate as a mineral fertilizer the study was carried out in an area of a typic dystrophic red argisol with a sandy loam texture in the surface layer and an average slope of 0 13 m m 1 applying simulated rainfall for 90 min at a constant intensity of 64 mm h 1 mecabô júnior et al 2014 evaluated the effect of applying liquid swine manure on water erosion under a rainfall of 75 min and precipitation intensity of 65 mm h 1 applied by a swanson rainfall simulator soil and water loss was not affected by the doses of manure and the authors attributed the similarity of the results to the effect of the moisture content of the soil prior to applying the rainfall 3 2 nutrient loss with the exception of k2o in the dl pattern the mean concentrations of n p2o5 k2o and soc in entrained sediment differed between the ncl and wcl treatments for the four rainfall patterns table 4 these results confirm that a large part of the entrained material came from the chicken litter and show that in agricultural areas the use of this organic fertiliser increases the nutrient levels in the entrained material mishra et al 2006 when evaluating the use of chicken litter to improve the physical attributes of the soil valadão et al 2011 found a chemical composition of 243 g kg 1 of oc 40 g kg 1 of n 37 7 g kg 1 of p and 32 g kg 1 of k in contrast bolan et al 2010 found concentrations of 25 7 6 7 and 10 1 kg mg 1 for n p and k respectively this variability in the chemical composition of chicken litter is related to several factors such as the origin of the material and the efficiency of the feed among others avila et al 2008 there was no difference in the concentrations of n p2o5 and k2o in the sediment present in the runoff measured in the ncl plots due to the low content of these elements in the soil the simulated rainfall does not provide energy in sufficient amounts to differ between the rainfall patterns with the application of chicken litter wcl however differences in nutrient loss were seen as a function of the rainfall pattern the greater n and p2o5 concentrations in the sediment from the in pattern in relation to the other patterns may be due to its greater solubility and also to the moment of occurrence of the pi peak allowing the application of a greater depth until the end of the test similar reasoning applies to k2o however as it is more soluble than n and p2o5 the highest concentrations occurred with the av pattern this pattern provided greater solubilisation at the start of the test and runoff continuing until the end but with a lower pi tao et al 2017 reported that rainfall with intensity peaks during the early stages of the event favours the entrainment of nutrients that are available on the soil surface the increase in nutrient and soc losses due to the application of chicken litter corroborate quinton et al 2010 who evaluated the impact of erosion in agricultural soils on the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles the highest measured nutrient loss was p2o5 when compared to the range of values in the ncl and wcl plots which can be explained by its high concentration in the chicken litter the type mineral or organic and amount of fertilizer applied to the soil lead to the distinction of soil nutrients affecting nitrogen and phosphorus losses du et al 2021 a high potential for p contamination of the surface runoff water was also seen by lemos et al 2020 when evaluating the loss of p k ca and mg with simulated rainfall under conventional management and direct planting systems using swine manure as organic fertiliser the moment of occurrence of pi peak did not influence the soc losses in both the ncl and wcl treatments this is possibly due to the short duration of the simulated rainfall 40 min and the applied depth 30 mm not being enough to entrain different amounts of sediment between patterns especially in the wcl treatment table 3 even with an pi of 110 mm h 1 when evaluating soil organic carbon loss and selective transport under field simulated rainfall events with 60 min duration nie et al 2014 observed greater losses in the pi of 82 8 mm h 1 compared to 31 8 mm h 1 in no tillage system it is well known that higher precipitation intensities lead to greater erosion damage however the soc loss is rarely portrayed in the literature when the pi variation occurs in the same simulated rainfall event we observed the loss of nutrients in g kg 1 had been influenced by rainfall pattern depending on its availabity table 4 however when n p2o5 k2o and soc losses were expressed in kg ha 1 mm 1 table 5 it was not observe significant differences between the evaluated patterns in some situations there were differences between the ncl and wcl treatments within each pattern in general losses were higher when applying chicken litter albeit without differing statistically from the ncl treatment for some rainfall patterns due to the high variability of the measured values a result normally observed in studies of this nature ma et al 2016 reported that the loss of nutrients is associated by the runoff volume and amount of eroded soil thus there are many variables that influence these losses such as rainfall intensity terrain slope soil class physical properties and soil use and management wang et al 2013 kuma et al 2022 the in and dl patterns had a greater potential for dissolution and incorporation of nutrients and soc however the great variability of values makes any consistent conclusion difficult but anyway it is possible to infer that rainfall with different patterns influence the loss of nutrients specially those transporting in the sediment dai et al 2018 3 3 nutrients in soil following the simulated rain after the application of simulated rainfall the soil chemical attributes analyzed in the 0 0 0 20 m layer showed small variations depending on the chicken little application and the rainfall pattern evaluated table 6 these results are related to the short period of permanence of poultry manure on the soil surface there is no time for its mineralization as the rains were applied soon after the fertilizer was distributed the results show that turning the soil by ploughing once and harrowing twice and the process of simulating rainfall promoted an increase in the p content of the soil compared to the content before these activities 5 0 mg dm 3 the reduction in p content with the ad pattern infers that this rainfall which was more intense at the start of the event caused greater loss by surface runoff which is confirmed by the higher p2o5 content in the ncl treatment with the ad pattern when evaluating the sediment concentration in g kg 1 table 4 although the difference is only numerical as the values are relatively low for each of the four rainfall patterns in the wcl treatments the p concentration with the ct rainfall pattern differed from the other patterns as the ct pattern does not show the peak rainfall intensity the applied depth may have influenced the greater p concentration in the soil the reduction in the k content of the soil in the wcl treatment for the in and dl patterns may be associated with the pi peak occurring during the most central part of the event in at 22 min and dl at 33 min and to the high solubility and mobility of k in the soil solution ernani et al 2007 this favours its leaching beyond the depth of 0 20 m since the k concentration in the entrained sediment with these same rainfall patterns was also lower than the values seen with the ad and ct patterns table 4 the similar levels of organic carbon between the rainfall patterns both in the entrained sediment and in the soil after the simulated rainfall event are probably a result of the cured state of the chicken litter used in the test and of the soil texture the sandy texture 820 g kg 1 total sand from a depth of 0 0 to 0 34 m possibly favoured water infiltration and accumulation of organic matter in the surface layer of the soil irrespective of the rainfall pattern 3 4 financial analysis of nutrient loss considering the rainfall regime the estimated financial losses of nutrients were more expressive when sowing transplanting takes place in april baixada fluminense and january serranaregion the greatest financial losses were seen for p2o5 followed by n and k2o with the use of chicken litter reaching us 12 86 ha 1 and us 48 06 ha 1 respectively in baixada fluminense fig 3 a and serrana region fig 3b the greater loss of p2o5 relative to n and k2o can be explained by the high p concentration in the chicken litter compared to the concentrations of n and k in total the estimated financial loss reached us 25 58 ha 1 and us 95 56 ha 1 respectively in baixada fluminense and serrana region on the other hand n presented greater financial loss in area without fertilization of chicken litter with us 12 88 ha 1 and us 48 11 ha 1 respectively in baixada fluminense fig 4 a and serrana region fig 4b thus depending on the market prices of the evaluated fertilizers it is observed that n becomes more expensive in mineral fertilizers than in organic fertilizers chicken litter for the baixada fluminense fig 3a and 4a the smallest losses are seen in august while in the serrana region fig 3b and4b these values occur in october in areas without chicken litter fertilization the total financial loss was estimated at us 23 72 ha 1 and us 88 64 ha 1 respectively in baixada fluminense and serrana region as nutrient loss was calculated based on the cost per hectare per millimetre of rainfall us ha 1 mm 1 the variation between the highest and lowest losses for each region occurred as a function of the variation in the respective rainfall indices and sowing transplanting month which is more intense during the spring summer in the serrana rainy period and during the autumn winter in the baixada fluminense period of low rainfall in addition to the cost of the nutrient in the evaluated fertilizer as already mentioned when evaluating nutrient loss from surface runoff under a direct planting system with mineral and organic fertilisation bertol et al 2011 found total k concentration in the sediment from the runoff 120 higher when rainfall of 120 mm h 1 was applied compared to rainfall with intensities of 60 and 70 mm h 1 it is important to point out that the experiment with simulated rainfall was conducted on uncovered soil which is why the financial loss was evaluated only considering the month of sowing or transplanting the vegetables despite being a simplified analysis the results found indicate the financial impact on farmers which reach even higher values when considering the complete cycle of cultivation however it is necessary to consider that plants play an important role in reducing the erosion process consequently in nutrient losses when assessing the impacts of soil management practices and sugarcane saccharum sp fertilizers on nutrients and sediments in surface runoff from simulated rainfall melland et al 2022 concluded that maintaining soil cover in sugarcane reduced the suspension of total solids n and p in runoff water during rainfall almeida et al 2016 found reduction in soil losses with the increase in vegetation cover provided by the soybean crop grown in a typic hapludalf when applying rainfall of 60 mm h 1 using the infiasper simulator in 6 times throughout the cultivation cycle even with the effect of ground cover it is worth mentioningthat the areas generally occupied with vegetable crops in the serrana region have steep slopes schultz et al 2020 well above the slope of the experimental area where the tests with simulated rainfall were carried out 0 09 m m 1 and that vegetables are grown in the region during the period of more intense and frequent rainfall the financial losses from the loss of soil water and nutrients may be even greater than those found in the present study 4 conclusion fertilising with chicken litter reduces the differences in surface runoff and sediment loss between different rainfall patterns in the absence of fertilisation with chicken litter the ad in and dl rainfall patterns have the same potential for promoting surface runoff but with fertilisation

1986,the process of erosion characterised by the loss of soil water and nutrients is the main cause of soil degradation and has numerous consequences for the agricultural sector and the environment the aim of the present study was to evaluate the loss of soil water and nutrients and the chemical attributes of the soil in an area with and without fertilisation with chicken litter under simulated rainfall in different rainfall patterns in addition to the financial impact resulting from the loss of nutrients using the infiasper simulator rainfall with advanced av intermediate in delayed dl and constant ct patterns were simulated in an area of a dystric acrisol following a randomised block design in a 2 4 factorial scheme totalling eight treatments with four replications the treatments comprised the areas with wcl and without ncl the surface application of chicken litter and subjected to the four rainfall patterns giving a total of 32 experimental units rainfall was applied for 40 min at an average intensity of 45 mm h 1 the mean values of the runoff depths did not vary as a function of fertilisation however there were differences in soil loss between the ncl and wcl treatments with the dl 10 55 and 34 98 g m 2 and ct 7 22 and 15 88 g m 2 patterns the greatest nutrient loss in the wcl treatments irrespective of the rainfall pattern is related to the presence of chicken litter in the wcl treatments the in pattern afforded the greatest loss of n 26 76 g kg 1 and p 14 58 g kg 1 while the ad pattern gave the greatest value for k 8 42 g kg 1 in the wcl plots the mean value for total organic carbon loss was 202 01 g kg 1 in wcl areas the greatest financial losses were seen for p2o5 reaching us 12 86 ha 1 in baixada fluminense for sowing transplanting in april and 3 7 times greater in the serrana region of the state of rio de janeiro in january in ncl areas n presented greater financial loss it can be concluded that in an area with the surface application of chicken litter the rainfall pattern interferes with the loss of n p and k and that financial losses from the loss of nutrients caused by water erosion can be even more marked when considering areas of greater slope keywords water erosion rain simulator organic fertiliser dystric acrisol financial loss rio de janeiro data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water erosion has a large impact on the environment especially in areas of high rainfall lima et al 2013 and is responsible for the degradation of approximately 56 of the agricultural areas in the world correa et al 2016 as a result annual soil loss in brazil is estimated at 1 18 billion tons giving a total cost annually of usd 5 2 billion simply to replace the nutrients lost in agricultural areas simões and ferraz 2019 the erosion process starts with raindrops impacting on the ground causing the soil particles to detach and then be transported and deposited in nearby locations panachuki et al 2006 as a consequence there is a loss of nutrients organic matter water and sediment as well as contamination of the soil and water bertol et al 2003 gilles et al 2009 wang et al 2014 bramorski et al 2015 which become more intense in cultivated areas with steep slopes santos et al 2020 and high intensity orographic rainfall carvalho et al 2005 soil and nutrient losses occur due to surface runoff which when heavy can transport both soluble nutrients and the nutrients adsorbed on entrained sediment bertol et al 2017 as such the nutrient concentration of the sediment and of the water drained by water erosion varies mainly as a function of the nutrient concentration in the soil and the type of soil management and fertilisation employed hernani et al 1999 bertol et al 2011 mineral or organic fertilisers used in agricultural areas are nutrient sources that are incorporated into the soil due to the growth of poultry farming many producers specially in the state of rio de janeiro brazil have been using chicken litter in fertilization because it is low cost and has good agronomic characteristics macedo et al 2023 this material has great potential as an organic fertiliser blum et al 2003 santos dalólio et al 2017 in the production of different crops particularly vegetables according to mitchell and tu 2006 chicken litter is an organic source with high levels of nutrients especially n p and k the use of rainfall simulators in studies related to water erosion is widespread with the aim of obtaining quick results for dealing with the problem oliveira et al 2010 carvalho et al 2015 panachuki et al 2015 almeida et al 2016 almeida et al 2018 simulators are pieces of equipment with different characteristics that allow experiments to be reproduced eliminating the variability unpredictability and irregularity of natural rainfall events boulange et al 2019 saber et al 2019 among portable models the infiasper alves sobrinho et al 2008 is the most used in brazil and has been employed in studies of water erosion under different conditions of soil management and land use carvalho et al 2022 as natural rainfall events show variations in precipitation intensity pi throughout their duration alavinia et al 2019 dunkerley 2021 simulators can better represent a natural event if they have mechanisms that allow instantaneous variation of the intensity during tests reproducing different rainfall patterns in this respect macedo et al 2021 proposed a new control panel for the infiasper simulator that allows the pi to be varied automatically by selecting pre defined rainfall patterns according to flanagan et al 1988 the patterns are classified according to the moment of occurrence of the precipitation peak in relation to the rainfall duration which may influence the erosion process in the delayed pattern for example the pi peak occurs in the final third of the rainfall when the surface layer of the soil has a high water content favoring greater runoff using rainfall simulators the effects of rainfall patterns on runoff and soil losses have been evaluated across different classes land use and management oliveira et al 2010 carvalho et al 2012 gao et al 2018 carvalho et al 2022 but little information is available regarding associated nutrient losses in the present study rainfall with different patterns was related to fertilisation with chicken litter with the aim of evaluating the loss of nutrients and organic carbon in eroded sediment and evaluating the chemical attributes of the soil after applying simulated rainfall using the infiasper simulator the aim of the present study therefore was to evaluate the effect of rainfall patterns on the loss of soil water and nutrients including changes in the chemical attributes of the soil after simulated rainfall in an area with and without fertilisation using chicken litter and the financial impact resulting from the loss of nutrients 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization of the experimental area the experiment was carried out from august to september 2021 in an experimental area located in the state of rio de janeiro brazil 22 76083 s 43 69760 w and average altitude of 33 m with an average slope of 0 09 m m 1 the predominant soil in the experimental area is a dystric acrisol with a loamy sand texture 0 0 0 34 m according to the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2022 which is equivalent to an argissolo vermelho amarelo distrófico típico according to the brazilian soil classification system santos et al 2018 the physical and chemical attributes of the soil were evaluated as per the methods of soil analysis handbook teixeira et al 2017 and are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively up to the ab horizon corresponding to a depth of 41 cm in addition to the chemical characterisation of the profile sampling was carried out at 10 random points in the arable layer 0 0 20 m of the experimental area to characterise the chemical attributes teixeira et al 2017 5 82 ph h2o 2 48 cmolc kg 1h al 3 1 40 cmolc dm 3 ca 2 0 40 cmolc dm 3 mg 2 59 mg dm 3 k 5 mg dm 3p and quantify the soil organic carbon soc via wet oxidation with potassium dichromate walkley and black 1934 25 82 g kg 1 the soil in the experimental area was ploughed once and harrowed twice in the direction of the terrain contour curves and kept without vegetation cover during the experiment 2 2 rainfall simulator characteristics and soil erosion evaluation the infiasper rainfall simulator alves sobrinho et al 2008 was used fig 1 a operating with 1 0 hp motor pump dancor w48j and a circular experimental plot of 0 8 m diameter 0 5 m2 fig 1b built of galvanized steel sheet according to moraes et al 2018 rainfall simulations on areas smaller than 1 5 m2 have been used to study surface sealing interrill and splash erosion the simulator model is a rotating disk and operates with two veejet 80 150 nozzles installed at a height of 2 3 m above the ground and with a service pressure of 35 6 kpa almeida et al 2021 operating under these conditions infiasper has shown an average drop diameter ranging from 1 45 to 2 20 mm simulating the kinetic energy of natural rain from 73 8 to 88 0 depending on the rotation of the disk macedo et al 2021 once installed the plots were pre wetted in order to standardise the soil moisture and favour the occurrence of surface runoff cogo et al 1984 surface runoff and sediment loss were assessed by collecting the runoff volume in each plot at 1 minute intervals from the onset of runoff the volume was quantified with the aid of a 1000 ml graduated test tube and the runoff depth was calculated from the ratio between its volume and the area of the experimental plot carvalho et al 2022 2 3 experimental design and soil erosion evaluation the experimental design was of randomised blocks in a 2 4 factorial scheme with four replications the treatments comprised plots with wcl and without ncl chicken litter and four rainfall patterns advanced av intermediate in delayed dl and constant ct fig 2 giving a total of 32 experimental units in the plots that received fertilisation wcl 165 50 g of chicken litter 100 kg of n ha 1 were applied directly to the experimental plot after pre wetting the chemical characterisation brasil 2017 of the fertilizer indicated 7 60 ph h2o 4 30 k2o 3 17 ca 2 0 67 mg 2 0 64 na 2 15 11 p2o5 3 20 n and 59 17 organic matter om based on the method presented by carvalho et al 2022 the infiasper was programmed to simulate rainfall with the different rainfall patterns considering an average pi of 45 mm h 1 a depth of 30 mm duration of 40 min and maximum ri of 110 mm h 1 fig 2 from collected runoff soil loss was estimated by determining the weight of the entrained sediment per sample after oven drying the material at 60 c oliveira et al 2010 all the sediment from the runoff was then removed with the aid of a brush and stored in plastic containers for later analysis of the n p k and soc in analysing the n p and k 0 20 g of the material from the wcl treatments and 0 50 g of the material from the ncl treatments were used to analyse the soc 0 25 g were used for each sample p and k in the sediment were determined by spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively following nitric digestion as per tedesco et al 1995 the total n was determined using the kjeldahl digestion and distillation method teixeira et al 2017 the amount of n p k and soc g kg 1 in the sediment from the runoff from each plot was multiplied by the total loss of sediment g m 2 and later converted into kg ha 1 following the simulated rainfall soil samples were collected from each experimental plot using a 0 0 20 m soil auger and the ph ca mg al h al na k p and soc were determined as per teixeira et al 2017 2 4 experimental design and statistical analyses the data were submitted to the shapiro wilk test to verify the normality of the residuals to an analysis of variance anova and tukey s test at 5 probability to compare the mean values using the sisvar 5 6 software ferreira 2011 2 5 simplified financial analysis a simplified financial analysis relativeto the loss of n p2o5 and k2o by water erosion was performed considering the rainfall in the baixada fluminense where the field study was carried out and in the serrana region of the state of rio de janeiro rj an important hub for vegetable production in the state santos et al 2020 therefore rainfall indices from 1981 to 2010 and from 1991 to 2020 were used relative to stations located in the cities of seropédica rj code 83741 22 80 s 43 68 w altitude 33 0 m and teresópolis rj code 83744 22 42 s 42 97 w altitude 874 2 m respectively as per the normais climatológicas do brasil brazilian climatological standards inmet 2022 the cost estimate of nutrient losses was performed for the months corresponding to the sowing or transplanting of vegetables when they do not absorb significant amounts of nutrients and their aerial parts still do not influence the impact of raindrops on the soil therefore the price of mineral fertilisers and chicken litter available at the rio de janeiro supply centre ceasa were used these were us 126 75 us 69 24 us 160 00 and us 14 67 for each 100 kg of urea simple superphosphate potassium chloride and chicken litter respectively n was expressed based on the price of one kg of n in the form of urea 45 n p based on the price of one kg of p2o5 in the form of single superphosphate 18 p2o5 and k based on the price of one kg of k2o in the form of potassium chloride 60 k2o resulting in values per kg of us 2 82 n us 3 46 p2o5 and us 2 67 k2o for the chicken litter the values of the nutrients were us 0 57 us 0 70 and us 0 54 per kg of n p2o5 and k2o respectively considering the chemical characterisation due to the characteristics of the climate the sowing time or transplanting of species such of cauliflower broccoli beetroot tomato okra and cabbage among other vegetables that use both mineral fertilisers and chicken litter takes place from april to august in the baixada fluminense and from october to february in the serrana region the average monthly rainfall during the respective periods is 76 3 63 8 38 6 37 7 and28 9 mm apr aug and 106 4 231 5 277 4 285 1 and179 1 mm oct feb to estimate the financial losses from the loss of n p and k the respective losses in kg ha 1 were transformed into kg ha 1 mm 1 of simulated rainfall and then multiplied by the monthly rainfall corresponding to each region considering the percentage of the advanced 60 0 intermediate 24 0 and delayed 16 0 rainfall patterns as determined by carvalho et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil loss and surface runoff precipitation patterns influenced runoff and soil loss in plots without chicken litter application ncl table 3 despite being widely used in rainfall simulation studies the constant pattern ct does not represent the characteristics of rainfall dunkerley 2012 thus not reproducing the natural process of soil loss nielsen et al 2019 in this conditions runoff and soil loss were 1 8 and 3 0 times lower than in advanced av and intermediate in patterns with av the pi peak occurs 8 to 10 min after the onset of rain promoting greater accumulation of water at the outlet of the collecting plot with the application of chicken litter wcl soil loss were affected by the rainfall pattern in this condition the sediment present in the runoff contained fertilizer residues providing greater loss in relation to the ncl especially in the dl and ct patterns this increase in sediment loss is possibly due to the impact of raindrops in the soil surface mohamadi and kavian 2015 associated with the translocation of fine particles of the chicken litter in the upper soil layers as a consequence pore clogging may occur promoting greater accumulation of water on the soil surface during the final phase of the tests as the erosion process is the result of a combination of factors related to the soil type and management amore et al 2004 characteristics of the simulator such as diameter and kinetic energy of drops mhaske et al 2019 size and shape of the collecting plot kinnell 2016 among others results found in the literature are not often possible to compare when evaluating surface runoff in experimental stands with two types of soil and a slope of 0 5 alavinia et al 2019 found no significant differences in the mean values of the runoff depth considering different rainfall patterns according to tao et al 2017 the onset of surface runoff is related to the moment of peak rainfall however rainfall patterns have little effect on total runoff studies that evaluate water and sediment loss under simulated rainfall with different rainfall patterns both with and without the application of organic fertilisers are scarce in the literature gilles et al 2009 verified that the form of soil preparation had a greater influence on water losses compared to the type of fertilizer used chicken litter as an organic fertilizer urea and triple superphosphate as a mineral fertilizer the study was carried out in an area of a typic dystrophic red argisol with a sandy loam texture in the surface layer and an average slope of 0 13 m m 1 applying simulated rainfall for 90 min at a constant intensity of 64 mm h 1 mecabô júnior et al 2014 evaluated the effect of applying liquid swine manure on water erosion under a rainfall of 75 min and precipitation intensity of 65 mm h 1 applied by a swanson rainfall simulator soil and water loss was not affected by the doses of manure and the authors attributed the similarity of the results to the effect of the moisture content of the soil prior to applying the rainfall 3 2 nutrient loss with the exception of k2o in the dl pattern the mean concentrations of n p2o5 k2o and soc in entrained sediment differed between the ncl and wcl treatments for the four rainfall patterns table 4 these results confirm that a large part of the entrained material came from the chicken litter and show that in agricultural areas the use of this organic fertiliser increases the nutrient levels in the entrained material mishra et al 2006 when evaluating the use of chicken litter to improve the physical attributes of the soil valadão et al 2011 found a chemical composition of 243 g kg 1 of oc 40 g kg 1 of n 37 7 g kg 1 of p and 32 g kg 1 of k in contrast bolan et al 2010 found concentrations of 25 7 6 7 and 10 1 kg mg 1 for n p and k respectively this variability in the chemical composition of chicken litter is related to several factors such as the origin of the material and the efficiency of the feed among others avila et al 2008 there was no difference in the concentrations of n p2o5 and k2o in the sediment present in the runoff measured in the ncl plots due to the low content of these elements in the soil the simulated rainfall does not provide energy in sufficient amounts to differ between the rainfall patterns with the application of chicken litter wcl however differences in nutrient loss were seen as a function of the rainfall pattern the greater n and p2o5 concentrations in the sediment from the in pattern in relation to the other patterns may be due to its greater solubility and also to the moment of occurrence of the pi peak allowing the application of a greater depth until the end of the test similar reasoning applies to k2o however as it is more soluble than n and p2o5 the highest concentrations occurred with the av pattern this pattern provided greater solubilisation at the start of the test and runoff continuing until the end but with a lower pi tao et al 2017 reported that rainfall with intensity peaks during the early stages of the event favours the entrainment of nutrients that are available on the soil surface the increase in nutrient and soc losses due to the application of chicken litter corroborate quinton et al 2010 who evaluated the impact of erosion in agricultural soils on the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles the highest measured nutrient loss was p2o5 when compared to the range of values in the ncl and wcl plots which can be explained by its high concentration in the chicken litter the type mineral or organic and amount of fertilizer applied to the soil lead to the distinction of soil nutrients affecting nitrogen and phosphorus losses du et al 2021 a high potential for p contamination of the surface runoff water was also seen by lemos et al 2020 when evaluating the loss of p k ca and mg with simulated rainfall under conventional management and direct planting systems using swine manure as organic fertiliser the moment of occurrence of pi peak did not influence the soc losses in both the ncl and wcl treatments this is possibly due to the short duration of the simulated rainfall 40 min and the applied depth 30 mm not being enough to entrain different amounts of sediment between patterns especially in the wcl treatment table 3 even with an pi of 110 mm h 1 when evaluating soil organic carbon loss and selective transport under field simulated rainfall events with 60 min duration nie et al 2014 observed greater losses in the pi of 82 8 mm h 1 compared to 31 8 mm h 1 in no tillage system it is well known that higher precipitation intensities lead to greater erosion damage however the soc loss is rarely portrayed in the literature when the pi variation occurs in the same simulated rainfall event we observed the loss of nutrients in g kg 1 had been influenced by rainfall pattern depending on its availabity table 4 however when n p2o5 k2o and soc losses were expressed in kg ha 1 mm 1 table 5 it was not observe significant differences between the evaluated patterns in some situations there were differences between the ncl and wcl treatments within each pattern in general losses were higher when applying chicken litter albeit without differing statistically from the ncl treatment for some rainfall patterns due to the high variability of the measured values a result normally observed in studies of this nature ma et al 2016 reported that the loss of nutrients is associated by the runoff volume and amount of eroded soil thus there are many variables that influence these losses such as rainfall intensity terrain slope soil class physical properties and soil use and management wang et al 2013 kuma et al 2022 the in and dl patterns had a greater potential for dissolution and incorporation of nutrients and soc however the great variability of values makes any consistent conclusion difficult but anyway it is possible to infer that rainfall with different patterns influence the loss of nutrients specially those transporting in the sediment dai et al 2018 3 3 nutrients in soil following the simulated rain after the application of simulated rainfall the soil chemical attributes analyzed in the 0 0 0 20 m layer showed small variations depending on the chicken little application and the rainfall pattern evaluated table 6 these results are related to the short period of permanence of poultry manure on the soil surface there is no time for its mineralization as the rains were applied soon after the fertilizer was distributed the results show that turning the soil by ploughing once and harrowing twice and the process of simulating rainfall promoted an increase in the p content of the soil compared to the content before these activities 5 0 mg dm 3 the reduction in p content with the ad pattern infers that this rainfall which was more intense at the start of the event caused greater loss by surface runoff which is confirmed by the higher p2o5 content in the ncl treatment with the ad pattern when evaluating the sediment concentration in g kg 1 table 4 although the difference is only numerical as the values are relatively low for each of the four rainfall patterns in the wcl treatments the p concentration with the ct rainfall pattern differed from the other patterns as the ct pattern does not show the peak rainfall intensity the applied depth may have influenced the greater p concentration in the soil the reduction in the k content of the soil in the wcl treatment for the in and dl patterns may be associated with the pi peak occurring during the most central part of the event in at 22 min and dl at 33 min and to the high solubility and mobility of k in the soil solution ernani et al 2007 this favours its leaching beyond the depth of 0 20 m since the k concentration in the entrained sediment with these same rainfall patterns was also lower than the values seen with the ad and ct patterns table 4 the similar levels of organic carbon between the rainfall patterns both in the entrained sediment and in the soil after the simulated rainfall event are probably a result of the cured state of the chicken litter used in the test and of the soil texture the sandy texture 820 g kg 1 total sand from a depth of 0 0 to 0 34 m possibly favoured water infiltration and accumulation of organic matter in the surface layer of the soil irrespective of the rainfall pattern 3 4 financial analysis of nutrient loss considering the rainfall regime the estimated financial losses of nutrients were more expressive when sowing transplanting takes place in april baixada fluminense and january serranaregion the greatest financial losses were seen for p2o5 followed by n and k2o with the use of chicken litter reaching us 12 86 ha 1 and us 48 06 ha 1 respectively in baixada fluminense fig 3 a and serrana region fig 3b the greater loss of p2o5 relative to n and k2o can be explained by the high p concentration in the chicken litter compared to the concentrations of n and k in total the estimated financial loss reached us 25 58 ha 1 and us 95 56 ha 1 respectively in baixada fluminense and serrana region on the other hand n presented greater financial loss in area without fertilization of chicken litter with us 12 88 ha 1 and us 48 11 ha 1 respectively in baixada fluminense fig 4 a and serrana region fig 4b thus depending on the market prices of the evaluated fertilizers it is observed that n becomes more expensive in mineral fertilizers than in organic fertilizers chicken litter for the baixada fluminense fig 3a and 4a the smallest losses are seen in august while in the serrana region fig 3b and4b these values occur in october in areas without chicken litter fertilization the total financial loss was estimated at us 23 72 ha 1 and us 88 64 ha 1 respectively in baixada fluminense and serrana region as nutrient loss was calculated based on the cost per hectare per millimetre of rainfall us ha 1 mm 1 the variation between the highest and lowest losses for each region occurred as a function of the variation in the respective rainfall indices and sowing transplanting month which is more intense during the spring summer in the serrana rainy period and during the autumn winter in the baixada fluminense period of low rainfall in addition to the cost of the nutrient in the evaluated fertilizer as already mentioned when evaluating nutrient loss from surface runoff under a direct planting system with mineral and organic fertilisation bertol et al 2011 found total k concentration in the sediment from the runoff 120 higher when rainfall of 120 mm h 1 was applied compared to rainfall with intensities of 60 and 70 mm h 1 it is important to point out that the experiment with simulated rainfall was conducted on uncovered soil which is why the financial loss was evaluated only considering the month of sowing or transplanting the vegetables despite being a simplified analysis the results found indicate the financial impact on farmers which reach even higher values when considering the complete cycle of cultivation however it is necessary to consider that plants play an important role in reducing the erosion process consequently in nutrient losses when assessing the impacts of soil management practices and sugarcane saccharum sp fertilizers on nutrients and sediments in surface runoff from simulated rainfall melland et al 2022 concluded that maintaining soil cover in sugarcane reduced the suspension of total solids n and p in runoff water during rainfall almeida et al 2016 found reduction in soil losses with the increase in vegetation cover provided by the soybean crop grown in a typic hapludalf when applying rainfall of 60 mm h 1 using the infiasper simulator in 6 times throughout the cultivation cycle even with the effect of ground cover it is worth mentioningthat the areas generally occupied with vegetable crops in the serrana region have steep slopes schultz et al 2020 well above the slope of the experimental area where the tests with simulated rainfall were carried out 0 09 m m 1 and that vegetables are grown in the region during the period of more intense and frequent rainfall the financial losses from the loss of soil water and nutrients may be even greater than those found in the present study 4 conclusion fertilising with chicken litter reduces the differences in surface runoff and sediment loss between different rainfall patterns in the absence of fertilisation with chicken litter the ad in and dl rainfall patterns have the same potential for promoting surface runoff but with fertilisation wcl the dl and ct patterns promote an increase in sediment loss regardless of the rainfall pattern applying chicken litter increases the concentrations of n p k and soc in the entrained sediment and consequently financial losses and environmental damage however after simulated rainfall applying chicken litter promotes no changes in ph or in the levels of ca mg al and h al in the soil applying chicken litter promotes an increase in the soc content of the soil after simulated rainfall in the four rainfall patterns as well as in the p and k content with the ad and ct patterns and na with the ad dl and ct patterns the greatest financial losses are associated with p followed by n and k credit authorship contribution statement amanda sales alves conceptualization methodology investigation

1987,shale gas development has greatly contributed to the world s energy supply pressure transient analysis pta has extremely helped the development of shale gas in this paper a three dimensional numerical model for transient pressure analysis of multi stage fractured horizontal wells mfhws in shale gas reservoirs was proposed which was based on the embedded discrete fracture model edfm the adsorption effect of shale gas stress sensitivity of shale reservoir and high velocity non darcy flow in fractures were considered in this model and the model was solved by matlab reservoir simulation tool mrst the discrete process of governing equations is described in detail the typical mfhw pressure transient response curve of a shale gas reservoir was obtained different flow regimes were divided and three dimensional pressure distribution profile of different flow stages were drawn to clearly understand the flow states of shale gas in the reservoir the effects of different flow mechanisms and fracture properties on the log log curves of the mfhw pressure transient response were analyzed in detail the numerical pta model proposed in this paper not only considers a variety of complex flow mechanisms of shale gas but also accurately describes the characteristics of complex fracture network of shale reservoirs in three dimensional conditions through edfm in addition the problems of the incomplete description of shale gas flow stages by conventional analytical methods and semi analytical methods were avoided through the numerical solution the pressure response

resources in recent years shale gas resources are attracting more and more attention tan et al 2015 dong et al 2016 wang et al 2018 as a classical reservoir analysis method pta plays a significant role in the development stage of shale reservoirs with the extremely low porosity and permeability of shale gas reservoirs mfhws are extremely necessary in development of shale gas zhou et al 2012 hydraulic fractures hfs and natural fractures nfs will form a staggered fracture network after the reservoir is fractured which makes the pta of shale reservoirs more complicated than conventional reservoirs liu et al 2021 in addition the pore structure of shale and mechanisms of fluid flow is quite different from conventional reservoirs which further enhances the difficulty of pta in shale reservoirs medeiros et al 2008 clarkson et al 2011 guo et al 2012 wang et al 2013 in the research of pta on shale reservoirs the study of the shale gas migration mechanism is a crucial part the flow mechanisms of shale gas are diverse mainly including slippage diffusion adsorption and non darcy flow xiao et al 2023 langmuir 1918 masters 1979 roy et al 2003 javadpour et al 2007 javadpour 2009 accurate pressure transient response is obtained by correctly describing the flow of fluid kucuk and sawyer 1980 established the pta model of shale reservoirs for the first time but this model didn t consider the influence of desorption and diffusion of shale gas guo et al 2012 established the mfhw pressure transient analysis model of shale gas reservoir which considered shale gas diffusion and adsorption still the stress sensitive effect of the reservoir was ignored in their model liu et al 2015 also proposed a model that considered the adsorption desorption of shale gas and the stress sensitivity of fractures unfortunately the high velocity non darcy flow bear 1975 zeng and grigg 2006 was ignored by the above models which will lead to the deviation between the results of pressure transient analysis and the real situation in addition how to accurately characterize the fracture network morphology and establish a suitable fracture network flow model is the focus and difficulty of shale gas reservoirs pta dual porosity models were adopted in most pta models which did not consider the different physical parameters of the original reservoir area and fracturing reconstruction area dual porosity models cannot completely and correctly characterize the flow of gas in the complex fracture network brown et al 2011 established a trilinear flow model that is the linear flow of shale gas from the original reservoir to the stimulated reservoir volume srv the linear flow of srv to the main fracturing fractures and the linear flow in the hfs and obtained the bottom hole pressure bhp response function by analytical method later based on the trilinear flow model the researchers put forward more complex five linear flow model and seven linear flow model to predict the change of bhp with the consideration of geostress distribution reservoir heterogeneity non darcy flow and stress sensitivity effect stalgorova and mattar 2012 yuan et al 2015 the analytical model is fast to calculate but it ignores the pseudo radial flow stage and the mutual interference between fractures which leads to the incomplete description of the shale gas flow stage when using the analytical model zhao et al 2014 proposed a composite model that considered srv and obtained a semianalytical solution of the bottom pressure response of mfhws the pressure transient equation for fractures with random shapes was solved by chen et al 2018 using a semianalytical model in addition scholars guo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 treated the srv region as oval and a semianalytical model of mfhws was presented to analyze the bhp characteristic of shale gas reservoirs the semianalytical method has high accuracy but the calculation is complicated and it is difficult to describe the flow characteristics of the fluid under the irregular fracture network both the analytical method and semianalytical method are based on the continuous medium hypothesis still the nfs in actual reservoirs are usually discrete and irregular so this kind of problem can be solved well by the numerical discrete solution method wu et al 2014 and liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b established the mfhw composite model of shale gas reservoirs based on an orthogonal grid and finite difference method however the orthogonal grid needs local grid refinement around the fractures in addition this method has poor flexibility in dealing with complex boundary conditions the flow of multiscale shale gas was simulated by li et al 2014 based on the pebi grid and finite difference numerical calculation method and the bhp response was obtained the calculation accuracy of the pebi method is slightly lacking but it provides a new idea for pta in multi stage fractured unconventional gas reservoirs edfm is a variant of the discrete fracture model it decomposes the fractures into independent units and establishes the non neighbor connections nncs relationship and conductivity to simulate the fluid flow xu 2015 yu et al 2017 liu et al 2021 geng et al 2023 edfm not only has high calculation accuracy but also can overcome the limitations of grid refinement or unstructured grids in addition edfm can simulate any complex fracture efficiently and accurately in this paper aiming at the limitations of the conventional pta model for shale reservoirs and considering the three dimensional flow of mfhws a three dimensional pta model for mfhws was established by using edfm which comprehensively considers shale gas adsorption and desorption stress sensitivity of shale reservoirs and high velocity non darcy flow in fractures the model is solved by the open source software mrst then the effect of different factors on the pressure behavior of mfhws is analyzed in detail the proposed model enriches the existing pta models of shale reservoirs provides the theoretical basis for the analysis of shale reservoir pressure characteristics and reduces the uncertainty of shale reservoir development 2 methodology 2 1 physical model the physical model of the mhfw in the shale reservoir is shown in fig 1 which has the following assumptions 1 only shale gas exists in shale reservoirs and the gas flow is isothermal 2 both fluid and rock are compressible and the gravity of a gas is ignored 3 hfs and nfs co exist in the reservoir and the matrix and fractures are connected 4 the adsorption of shale gas only exists in the matrix the stress sensitive phenomenon occurs in the matrix and fractures 5 the gas flow in the matrix is darcy flow and the gas flow in the fracture is high velocity non darcy flow 6 the shale reservoir is heterogeneous and anisotropic the initial pressure of the shale reservoir is p 0 2 2 mathematical model 2 2 1 governing equation the equation of isothermal one component

the change of effective stress cammarata et al 2007 cao and lei 2019 stress sensitivity makes reservoir permeability no longer a constant but a function of effective stress feder 2020 so the stress sensitivity correction factor is introduced to correct the permeability 6 η 1 e γ p p 0 where p 0 pa is the initial reservoir pressure γ p a 1 is the permeability modulus of shale which is defined as yilmaz et al 2006 7 γ k k p the value of γ is only affected by the physical properties of the reservoir and will not change with the pressure of the reservoir ozkan et al 2010 clarkson et al 2013 cao et al 2016 tabatabaie et al 2016 2 2 4 high velocity non darcy flow when shale gas flows in some hydraulic fractures the gas velocity is very fast because of the high conductivity of hydraulic fractures at this time the fluid flux and hydraulic gradient are no longer linearly related and darcy s law is no longer applicable bear 1975 zeng et al 2006 here the forchheimer equation is used to correct the flow of fluid in the fracture liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b 8 p f μ k f v nd f β ρ v nd f v nd f where v nd f m s is the fluid velocity in the fractures affected by the high velocity non

v 0 f η 2 k f μ p f where η 2 is the correction factor of high velocity non darcy flow which can be defined as 12 η 2 2 1 1 4 ρ β k f μ 2 p f where β is the empirical coefficient of forchheimer which can be calculated by the following equation rubin 2010 13 β 3 2808 1 485 10 9 k 0 10 15 1 021 2 3 discretization of the equations the finite volume method s two point flux approximation tpfa is used to discretize the convection term in the governing equation firstly a single cell ω i in the discrete grid is used as the control volume and then the convection term of the control equation is displayed in integral form 14 ω i v α n d s ω i q d x ρ in equation 14 is eliminated where α is equal to m or f for matrix and fracture respectively and the flux between the two neighboring cells i and j can then be written as 15 v i j α γ i j v α n d s where γ i j is called half face which is associated with a unit ω i and has a normal vector n i k as shown in fig 2 and γ i j have a twin half face γ j i they have the same area that is a i j a j i m 2 but their normal vectors are in opposite directions that is n i j n j i if the midpoint rule approximates the integral over the half face equation 14 can be rewritten by the corrected darcy formula as follow 16 v i j α a i j v α x i j n i j a i j π a n η a k α p x i j n i j where x i j is the centroid of half face γ i j k is the permeability tensor in order to represent the pressure gradient between the centroid of half face and a point inside the cell we assume that the pressure inside each cell is linear or constant and use the one sided refined difference to calculate 17 v i j α a i j π a n η a k i α p i α π i k α c i k c i k 2 n i j t i j α π a n η a p i α π i k α where π i k α pa denotes the pressure of centroid of half face c i k m is the vector from the cell centroid to the half face centroid t i j α m 3 is the one sided transmissibility related to a single cell can be written as 18 t i j α a i j k i α c i k n i j c i k 2 because the fluxes on all faces is continuous there is v i j α v j i α v ij α for unit i and unit j and as well as the continuity of face pressures π i k α π k i α π ik α therefore the following relationship is obtained 19 p i α π i k α v ij α t i j α 1 π a n η a 1 20 p j α π j k α v ij α t i j α 1 π a n η a 1 combining equations 19 and 20 the face pressure is eliminated and the following tpfa is obtained 21 v ij α t i j α t j i α t i j α t j i α π a η a p i α p j α t ij α π a η a p i α p j α where p i pa and p j pa are the average pressures of cell i and cell j respectively t ij α m 3 is the transmissibility between the two cells 22 t ij α t i j α t j i α t i j α t j i α for the matrix system n 1 so the convection term in the matrix governing equation can be discretized as 23 ρ v m j ρ η 1 t ij m μ 1 p i m p j m for the fracture system n 2 so the flux between fracture cell i and fracture cell j can be expressed by tpfa as 24 v ij f t ij f η 1 η 2 p i f p j f for the discretization of high velocity non darcy flow correction factor η 2 combined with equation 21 η 2 between fracture cell i and fracture cell j becomes 25 η 2 2 1 1 4 ρ β k f μ λ t ij f p i f p j f combining equations 24 and 25 the convection term of fracture governing equation can be discretized as 26 ρ v f j ρ η 1 η 2 t ij f μ 1 p i f p j f in edfm the matrix grids and the fracture grids are mismatched as shown in fig 3 there are three nncs in the edfm model 1 fracture matrix nnc 2 fracture fracture nnc two different fractures 3 fracture well nnc when a matrix cell intersects with a fracture cell connection node a in fig 3 the flux between the matrix cell and the fracture cell can be discretized as 27 q ik m f t i k m f μ 1 p i m p k f where t i k m f m 3 is transmissibility between matrix cell i and fracture cell k which is obtained by the following equation 28 t i k m f a ik k mf d ik where a ik m 2 is the area of the intersection k mf m 2 is the harmonic average of fracture and matrix permeabilities based on cell volume d ik m is the volume average normal distance between the matrix cell and the fracture plane and its calculation method is as follows xu 2015 29 d ik d ik d v v i when a fracture cell intersects with another fracture cell connecting node b in the fig 3 the flux between the fracture cell f i and fracture cell f k can be discretized as 30 q f f t f f μ 1 p i f p k f where t f f m 3 is transmissibility between two different fracture cells which can be given by the following formula karimi fard et al 2004 xu et al 2017 31 t f f t i f t j f t i f t j f 32 t i f k i f δ i f l i j f d i f t j f k j f δ j f l j i f d j f where k i f m 2 and k j f m 2 are the permeability of fracture cell i and fracture cell j respectively δ i f m and δ j f m denote aperture of fracture cell i and fracture cell j respectively l i j f m indicates the intersection length of two fractures in the cell and l i j f l j i f d i f m and d j f m respectively represent the volume average normal distance from the centroid of two fracture cells to the intersection line and its calculation method is the same as equation 29 when the vertical fracture intersects the horizontal well connecting node c in fig 3 fluid flow resistance between fracture and wellbore is not only the resistance between grids but more the resistance caused by high velocity non darcy flow at this time the following equation is satisfied between the fracture cell and wellbore peaceman 1983 xu et al 2017 33 p f w μ k f q f w a δ f d r ρ β q f w ah 2 d r integrating

pressure when the various complex flow mechanisms of shale gas are considered the whole equation is nonlinear it is very difficult to solve the nonlinear equation directly our research is based on edfm which skillfully transforms the nonlinear flow equation into the linear flow equation in the solution process the influence of various complex flow mechanisms on the fluid was transformed into the influence on the grid conductivity and then a correction coefficient was added to the flow equation which could be obtained by calculated easily before each iteration finally the linear equation is solved the open source reservoir numerical simulation tool mrst was used for the entire solution process 3 model validation the edfm wtm developed by liu et al 2021 is used to verify the reliability of the pta model of shale proposed in this paper in their work fractures are also described by edfm and the basic parameters of reservoirs fractures and fluids used for simulation are shown in table 1 in fig 4 the log log curves of the two models pressure difference dp and pressure difference derivative dpd are compared the comparison result shows that the calculation results of the two models are in good agreement therefore the numerical pta model for mfhws in shale gas reservoirs proposed in this paper is reliable 4 results and discussions 4 1 typical curve analysis on the basis of model verification we reset the model parameters see table 2 to make the model closer to the real shale reservoir to obtain a more realistic bhp transient response of mhfws in shale gas reservoirs the change in pressure derivative is usually more sensitive than the change in pressure we can identify the fluid flow regime in mfhw through the dp curve fig 5 shows the typical log log curve of dp and dpd of fractured horizontal wells in which each flow regime is divided and marked in detail fig 6 shows the corresponding pressure distribution in each flow regime and fig 7 shows the three dimensional pressure distribution in different flow regime the following seven flow states of mfhws in shale reservoirs can be divided from the log log curve and pressure response profile 1 wellbore storage stage this stage is the earliest stage of all flow regimes and the slopes of dp and dpd curves are 1 this phenomenon reflects the storage capacity of the wellbore which is determined by a combination of fluid compressibility and wellbore size if the wellbore s storage capacity is strong this stage s duration will be longer 2 skin effect and transition flow the phenomenon of additional pressure drop required for gas well production due to reservoir damage is called the skin effect at this stage the dp and dpd curves begin to separate skin factor s dramatically affects the shape of the curves the dpd curve exhibits a distinct hump characteristic if s is positive the hump becomes invisible when s gets a negative value e g the dpd curve of a fractured well 3 bilinear flow blf this stage is the bilinear flow of fluid flowing from the reservoir into the fracture and from the fracture into the wellbore the slope of the dp and dpd curves is 1 4 fig 6a 4 fracture linear flow flf in this stage the fluid in the reservoir flows into the fracture linearly and the fluid flow occurs only in the fracture network the dp and dpd curves are parallel and their slopes are 1 2 fig 6b fig 7a 5 transitional flow at this stage the fluid is replenished from nfs to hfs while the fluid in the matrix is replenished to nfs and hfs the dpd curve drops to form a groove and the degree of drop reflects the strength of supply fig 6c fig 7b 6 pseudo boundary dominated flow pbdf the gas is mainly supplied by the matrix at this stage and the fracture acts as a channel for fluid flow the slope of the dpd curve increases to approximately 1 fig 6d fig 7c and the emergence of the pbdf is caused by the significant difference of physical properties between the external non stimulated and internal stimulated areas 7 pseudo radial flow prf at this stage the slope of the dpd curve is 0 which is the typical pseudo radial flow which is caused by the infinite shale reservoir or the pressure does not reach the boundary fig 6e fig 7d to sum up among the seven flow regimes flow stages 3 and 4 are the fracture dominated flow stages which show as the finite fracture conductivity model or infinite fracture conductivity model under the influence of the interstitial materials in the fractures the slope of the dpd curve is usually 1 4 or 1 2 and all the changes related to the flow in the fracture exist in these two regimes the flow stages 6 and 7 are the matrix dominated flow stages and the curve shape of this stage is influenced by reservoir physical properties and seepage mechanisms in the matrix the flow stage 5 is the transitional flow between the matrix and fractures and the curve shape of this stage is influenced by the matrix and nfs 4 2 impacts of flow mechanisms 4 2 1 adsorption shale gas exists in reservoirs in both free and adsorbed states the current research results show that free gas mainly exists in larger micron pores and fractures while adsorbed gas mainly exists in organic matter and solid surfaces as an essential part of shale gas the adsorbed gas accounts for 20 85 of the total shale gas the adsorption effect of gas in shale reservoirs greatly influences the fluid flow in shale reservoirs fig 8 shows the impact of shale gas adsorption effect on pressure transient response the adsorption effect of shale gas mainly affects the transitional flow and pbdf the increase of adsorption capacity langmuir volume will lead to a deeper groove less pressure loss and later prf the reason is the gas adsorbed in the shale reservoir can be desorbed in the matrix gas supply stage to replenish the formation energy in time which makes the pressure loss smaller in our model the adsorption effect occurs in the matrix therefore the adsorption effect only affects the transition flow and the matrix dominated flow while the dp and dpd curves at different adsorption indexes in other flow stages are almost overlapping 4 2 2 stress sensitivity of the matrix the reservoir pressure of the shale gas reservoir will inevitably decrease during development leading to an increase in net stress under the action of effective stress rocks will be deformed porosity and permeability will also change which results in stress sensitivity fig 9 shows the influence of stress sensitivity in the shale matrix on pressure transient response the stress sensitivity of the shale matrix mainly affects the later pbdf and prf as the stress sensitivity coefficient γ becomes larger the slope of the dpd curve in the pbdf stage will increase and prf will appear later the reason is stress sensitivity will damage the permeability of the reservoir and increase the pressure consumption of gas flowing what s more when the value of γ increases to 1 8 e 7 p a 1 the dpd curve will be warped and closed with the dp curve and the prf will disappear 4 2 3 stress sensitivity of fracture nfs and hfs are more seriously affected by effective stress fig 10 shows the influence of stress sensitivity of shale fracture on pressure transient response under the influence of effective stress the performance of fractures will deteriorate or even close as a result the gas seepage capacity is significantly weakened the pressure loss required for fluid flow is increased and the dp and dpd curves shift upward affected by the stress sensitivity of fracture the period of the wellbore storage stage is prolonged and it directly enters the transitional flow after the skin stage which leads to blf and flf being covered up in addition the existence of fracture stress sensitivity will lead to the warping of the dpd curve in the pbdf stage and the delay of the prf stage 4 2 4 high velocity non darcy flow many studies have proved that non darcy flow caused by inertia will happen when the velocity is too high i e the fluid velocity is no longer directly proportional to the pressure gradient this phenomenon usually occurs in media with high permeability such as nfs and hfs non darcy flow makes it more difficult to evaluate the productivity of gas wells which significantly increases the uncertainty in the development of gas reservoirs therefore it is necessary to study the influence of high velocity non darcy flow on fluid flow in mfhw the pressure transient response curves of darcy flow and high velocity non darcy flow are compared in fig 11 it is not difficult to see that the dpd curve moves up in the fracture dominated flow stage due to the existence of high velocity non darcy flow from the second stage skin stage the additional pressure loss caused by high velocity non darcy flow changes into rate dependent pseudo skin which leads to the upward translation of the high velocity non darcy flow pressure response curve at the same time in blf and flf stages the additional pressure loss caused by inertia increases the pressure needed to produce the same amount of gas which in turn leads to the upward shift of the pressure response curve in this stage in addition in the subsequent matrix dominated flow stage the influence of high velocity non darcy flow is weakened and the pressure curves of darcy flow and high velocity non darcy flow overlap 4 3 impacts of fractures properties 4 3 1 natural fracture the existence of natural fractures in shale reservoir is of great significance to the development of shale gas li et al 2023 natural fractures have arbitrary shapes and are randomly distributed in various positions of the reservoir natural fractures are intertwined with other natural fractures hydraulic fractures and matrix forming a complex fracture network which has a significant impact on fluid flow afagwu et al 2020 unfortunately although the existing analytical methods and semi analytical methods can consider the complex flow mechanisms of shale gas zhao et al 2013 they are still difficult to accurately describe the complex fracture network in shale reservoirs in addition almost all the problems of fluid flow solved by analytical method are two dimensional but the gas flow in horizontal wells is three dimensional and the existence of natural fractures is also three dimensional therefore in this section the numerical model proposed in this paper was used to describe the complex interlacing of fractures in three dimensional shale reservoirs as shown in fig 12 and the influence of natural fractures on fluid flow was analyzed fig 13 shows the influence of the existence of nf in shale reservoirs on the pressure transient response the existence of nfs can form a complex fracture network and provide more channels for fluid seepage which shortens the duration of flf stage in the transitional flow stage fluid will be replenished from nfs to hfs which makes the groove of the dpd curve in the transitional flow stage is deeper however in the matrix dominant flow stage the number of dp and dpd curves of different nfs almost overlap 4 3 2 hydraulic fractures number the influence of different hfs number on pressure transient response is shown in fig 14 there are obvious effects of hfs number on dp and dpd curves more hfs provides more low resistance flow channels and at the same time the influence range of hfs is increased which greatly reduces the flow resistance of shale gas as a result the pressure loss required for gas flowing is less from the wellbore storage stage to pbdf when entering the prf stage the pressure response curves tend to overlap 4 3 3 hydraulic fracture spacing the influence of different hfs spacing on pressure transient response is shown in fig 15 the hfs spacing mainly affects the matrix dominated flow stage with the increase of hfs spacing the slope of the dpd curve in the pbdf stage will be smaller the prf stage will appear later and less pressure loss in these stages the larger hfs spacing expands the influence range of hfs which leads to the hfs can be replenished by a wider range of matrix during the matrix gas supply stage however at other stages the pressure response curves affected by different hfs spacing almost overlap 4 3 4 hydraulic fracture half length fig 16 shows the comparison results of dp and dpd curves under different hf half lengths hf half length mainly affects the middle and late stages of flow with the increase of hf half length the appearance time of flf will be delayed the duration of the flf stage will be shortened and the pressure loss will be lower in the middle and late stages of flow these results reflect that the longer hf is the larger the volume affected by the hfs the shorter the time required for formation fluid to flow into the fractures and the smaller the flow resistance in addition in the matrix dominated flow stages more reservoirs are stimulated by longer fractures which results in less pressure loss required for matrix supply to fractures however the effect of hf half length disappears and the curves tend to overlap when entering the prf stage 4 3 5 hydraulic fracture conductivity as shown in fig 17 dp and dpd curves under different hf conductivity are compared hf conductivity mainly affects the fracture dominated flow stages with the increase of hf conductivity the duration of the wellbore storage stage and skin stage will be shortened which means that the bigger the fracture conductivity the faster fracture fluid can replenish the wellbore in addition the increased hf conductivity will make the blf stage end earlier and less the pressure loss because the bigger the hf conductivity the smaller the fluid flow resistance and the faster the flow velocity which leads to the shortening of the linear flow duration however the dp and dpd curves almost overlap in the later matrix dominated flow stages 4 3 6 hydraulic fracture inclination angle the influence of different hf inclination angle on pressure transient response is shown in fig 18 it is not difficult to see that hf inclination angle and hf half length have similar effects on the log log curve which indicates that they both affect the gas flow by changing the stimulated reservoir volume however hf half length mainly affects the stimulated reservoir volume in the horizontal direction while hf inclination angle affects that in the vertical direction when hf hight is consistent the bigger the hf inclination angle the farther the hf extends in the vertical direction and the larger the stimulated reservoir volume which leads to the lower pressure loss required for fluid flow in the fracture dominated flow stages however in the matrix dominated flow stages the influence of hf inclination angle is weakened and the pressure response curves tend to overlap 5 conclusions to understand the flow mechanisms of shale gas in the reservoir more accurately a three dimensional pta model of mfhw is proposed comprehensively considering various flow mechanisms and complex fracture networks in shale gas reservoirs mrst obtains the numerical solution of the model typical pta curves and the main features of mfhw are identified the main factors affecting shale gas flow on pta curves are analyzed in detail the main work and conclusions are as follows 1 considering the shale gas adsorption stress sensitivity of shale reservoir and high velocity non darcy flow in fractures a flow model of shale gas was proposed based on the flow model the three dimensional numerical model of mfhws pressure transient analysis in shale gas reservoir was established and the governing equations discrete process is described in detail the model is solved by mrst programming compared with the model proposed by hui the model s reliability is proved 2 based on this model the pressure transient response characteristics of shale reservoir mfhws are studied by analyzing the log log curves of dp and dpd the shale gas flow process is divided into seven flow regimes a wellbore storage stage b skin effect and transition flow c bilinear flow blf d fracture linear flow flf e transitional flow f pseudo boundary dominated flow pbdf g pseudo radial flow prf 3 the adsorbed gas in the shale reservoir can replenish the formation energy which reduces the pressure loss in the transitional flow stage and pbdf stage stress sensitivity will lead to additional pressure loss stress sensitivity in the matrix will increase the slope of the dpd curve in the pbdf stage and stress sensitivity in fracture will lead to the blf stage and flf stage in the early stage being hidden the high velocity non darcy flow in fractures will increase the gas flow resistance resulting in more pressure loss in the blf and flf stages 4 nfs can activate more fractures and form a fracture network reducing the gas flow resistance with the increase of fracture conductivity the wellbore can be replenished faster by fluid in fracture which leads to the early entry of the blf stage and less pressure loss both hf half lengths and hf inclination angle influence the fluid seepage by changing the stimulated reservoir volume the larger the stimulated reservoir volume the lower the pressure loss is required for fluid flow the more hfs there are the less pressure loss is needed for shale gas development credit authorship

1987,shale gas development has greatly contributed to the world s energy supply pressure transient analysis pta has extremely helped the development of shale gas in this paper a three dimensional numerical model for transient pressure analysis of multi stage fractured horizontal wells mfhws in shale gas reservoirs was proposed which was based on the embedded discrete fracture model edfm the adsorption effect of shale gas stress sensitivity of shale reservoir and high velocity non darcy flow in fractures were considered in this model and the model was solved by matlab reservoir simulation tool mrst the discrete process of governing equations is described in detail the typical mfhw pressure transient response curve of a shale gas reservoir was obtained different flow regimes were divided and three dimensional pressure distribution profile of different flow stages were drawn to clearly understand the flow states of shale gas in the reservoir the effects of different flow mechanisms and fracture properties on the log log curves of the mfhw pressure transient response were analyzed in detail the numerical pta model proposed in this paper not only considers a variety of complex flow mechanisms of shale gas but also accurately describes the characteristics of complex fracture network of shale reservoirs in three dimensional conditions through edfm in addition the problems of the incomplete description of shale gas flow stages by conventional analytical methods and semi analytical methods were avoided through the numerical solution the pressure response

resources in recent years shale gas resources are attracting more and more attention tan et al 2015 dong et al 2016 wang et al 2018 as a classical reservoir analysis method pta plays a significant role in the development stage of shale reservoirs with the extremely low porosity and permeability of shale gas reservoirs mfhws are extremely necessary in development of shale gas zhou et al 2012 hydraulic fractures hfs and natural fractures nfs will form a staggered fracture network after the reservoir is fractured which makes the pta of shale reservoirs more complicated than conventional reservoirs liu et al 2021 in addition the pore structure of shale and mechanisms of fluid flow is quite different from conventional reservoirs which further enhances the difficulty of pta in shale reservoirs medeiros et al 2008 clarkson et al 2011 guo et al 2012 wang et al 2013 in the research of pta on shale reservoirs the study of the shale gas migration mechanism is a crucial part the flow mechanisms of shale gas are diverse mainly including slippage diffusion adsorption and non darcy flow xiao et al 2023 langmuir 1918 masters 1979 roy et al 2003 javadpour et al 2007 javadpour 2009 accurate pressure transient response is obtained by correctly describing the flow of fluid kucuk and sawyer 1980 established the pta model of shale reservoirs for the first time but this model didn t consider the influence of desorption and diffusion of shale gas guo et al 2012 established the mfhw pressure transient analysis model of shale gas reservoir which considered shale gas diffusion and adsorption still the stress sensitive effect of the reservoir was ignored in their model liu et al 2015 also proposed a model that considered the adsorption desorption of shale gas and the stress sensitivity of fractures unfortunately the high velocity non darcy flow bear 1975 zeng and grigg 2006 was ignored by the above models which will lead to the deviation between the results of pressure transient analysis and the real situation in addition how to accurately characterize the fracture network morphology and establish a suitable fracture network flow model is the focus and difficulty of shale gas reservoirs pta dual porosity models were adopted in most pta models which did not consider the different physical parameters of the original reservoir area and fracturing reconstruction area dual porosity models cannot completely and correctly characterize the flow of gas in the complex fracture network brown et al 2011 established a trilinear flow model that is the linear flow of shale gas from the original reservoir to the stimulated reservoir volume srv the linear flow of srv to the main fracturing fractures and the linear flow in the hfs and obtained the bottom hole pressure bhp response function by analytical method later based on the trilinear flow model the researchers put forward more complex five linear flow model and seven linear flow model to predict the change of bhp with the consideration of geostress distribution reservoir heterogeneity non darcy flow and stress sensitivity effect stalgorova and mattar 2012 yuan et al 2015 the analytical model is fast to calculate but it ignores the pseudo radial flow stage and the mutual interference between fractures which leads to the incomplete description of the shale gas flow stage when using the analytical model zhao et al 2014 proposed a composite model that considered srv and obtained a semianalytical solution of the bottom pressure response of mfhws the pressure transient equation for fractures with random shapes was solved by chen et al 2018 using a semianalytical model in addition scholars guo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 treated the srv region as oval and a semianalytical model of mfhws was presented to analyze the bhp characteristic of shale gas reservoirs the semianalytical method has high accuracy but the calculation is complicated and it is difficult to describe the flow characteristics of the fluid under the irregular fracture network both the analytical method and semianalytical method are based on the continuous medium hypothesis still the nfs in actual reservoirs are usually discrete and irregular so this kind of problem can be solved well by the numerical discrete solution method wu et al 2014 and liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b established the mfhw composite model of shale gas reservoirs based on an orthogonal grid and finite difference method however the orthogonal grid needs local grid refinement around the fractures in addition this method has poor flexibility in dealing with complex boundary conditions the flow of multiscale shale gas was simulated by li et al 2014 based on the pebi grid and finite difference numerical calculation method and the bhp response was obtained the calculation accuracy of the pebi method is slightly lacking but it provides a new idea for pta in multi stage fractured unconventional gas reservoirs edfm is a variant of the discrete fracture model it decomposes the fractures into independent units and establishes the non neighbor connections nncs relationship and conductivity to simulate the fluid flow xu 2015 yu et al 2017 liu et al 2021 geng et al 2023 edfm not only has high calculation accuracy but also can overcome the limitations of grid refinement or unstructured grids in addition edfm can simulate any complex fracture efficiently and accurately in this paper aiming at the limitations of the conventional pta model for shale reservoirs and considering the three dimensional flow of mfhws a three dimensional pta model for mfhws was established by using edfm which comprehensively considers shale gas adsorption and desorption stress sensitivity of shale reservoirs and high velocity non darcy flow in fractures the model is solved by the open source software mrst then the effect of different factors on the pressure behavior of mfhws is analyzed in detail the proposed model enriches the existing pta models of shale reservoirs provides the theoretical basis for the analysis of shale reservoir pressure characteristics and reduces the uncertainty of shale reservoir development 2 methodology 2 1 physical model the physical model of the mhfw in the shale reservoir is shown in fig 1 which has the following assumptions 1 only shale gas exists in shale reservoirs and the gas flow is isothermal 2 both fluid and rock are compressible and the gravity of a gas is ignored 3 hfs and nfs co exist in the reservoir and the matrix and fractures are connected 4 the adsorption of shale gas only exists in the matrix the stress sensitive phenomenon occurs in the matrix and fractures 5 the gas flow in the matrix is darcy flow and the gas flow in the fracture is high velocity non darcy flow 6 the shale reservoir is heterogeneous and anisotropic the initial pressure of the shale reservoir is p 0 2 2 mathematical model 2 2 1 governing equation the equation of isothermal one component gas flow in the matrix is 1 t ρ ϕ m 1 ϕ m m a ρ v m ρ q m w ρ q m f the equation of isothermal one component gas flow in fractures is 2 ρ ϕ f t ρ v f ρ q f w ρ q m f ρ q f f where t s is time ϕ m and

shale reservoir η 2 is the permeability correction factor of high velocity non darcy flow in fracture a detailed report of the correction factors will be given below 2 2 2 adsorption single layer langmuir isotherm can be used to calculate of gas adsorption capacity yu et al 2016 5 m a ρ s ρ 0 p v l p p l where v l m 3 k g is langmuir volume i e the volume of the maximum adsorbed gas under

3 is the density of shale gas under standard temperature and pressure 2 2 3 stress sensitivity in the production process the physical properties of shale reservoirs will be irreversibly damaged with the change of effective stress cammarata et al 2007 cao and lei 2019 stress sensitivity makes reservoir permeability no longer a constant but a function of effective stress feder 2020 so the stress sensitivity correction factor is introduced to correct the permeability 6 η 1 e γ p p 0 where p 0 pa is the initial reservoir pressure γ p a 1 is the permeability modulus of shale which is defined as yilmaz et al 2006 7 γ k k p the value of γ is only affected by the physical properties of the reservoir and will not change with the pressure of the reservoir ozkan et al 2010 clarkson et al 2013 cao et al 2016 tabatabaie et al 2016 2 2 4 high velocity non darcy flow when shale gas flows in some hydraulic fractures the gas velocity is very fast because of the high conductivity of hydraulic fractures at this time the fluid flux and hydraulic gradient are no longer linearly related and darcy s law is no longer applicable bear 1975 zeng et al 2006 here the forchheimer equation is used to correct the flow of fluid in the fracture liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b 8 p f μ k f v nd f β ρ v nd f v nd f where v nd f m s is the fluid velocity in the fractures affected by the high velocity non darcy flow which can be obtained by solving equation 8 9 v nd f μ k f μ k f 2 4 β ρ p f 2 β ρ simplify equation 9 10 v nd f 2 1 1 4 ρ β k 0 f μ 2 p f v 0 f so v nd f can be rewritten as 11 v nd f η 2 v 0 f η 2 k f μ p f where η 2 is the correction factor of high velocity non darcy flow which can be defined as 12 η 2 2 1 1 4 ρ β k f μ 2 p f where β is the empirical coefficient of forchheimer which can be calculated by the following equation rubin 2010 13 β 3 2808 1 485 10 9 k 0 10 15 1 021 2 3 discretization of the equations the finite volume method s two point flux approximation tpfa is used to discretize the convection term in the governing equation firstly a single cell ω i in the discrete grid is used as the control volume and then the convection term of the control equation is displayed in integral form 14 ω i v α n d s ω i q d x ρ in equation 14 is eliminated where α is equal to m or f for matrix and fracture respectively and the flux between the two neighboring cells i and j can then be written as 15 v i j α γ i j v α n d s where γ i j is called half face which is associated with a unit ω i and has a normal vector n i k as shown in fig 2 and γ i j have a twin half face γ j i they have the same area that is a i j a j i m 2 but their normal vectors are in opposite directions that is n i j n j i if the midpoint rule approximates the integral over the half face equation 14 can be rewritten by the corrected darcy formula as follow 16 v i j α a i j v α x i j n i j a i j π a n η a k α p x i j n i j where x i j is the centroid of half face γ i j k is the permeability tensor in order to represent the pressure gradient between the centroid of half face and a point inside the cell we assume that the pressure inside each cell is linear or constant and use the one sided refined difference to calculate 17 v i j α a i j π a n η a k i α p i α π i k α c i k c i k 2 n i j t i j α π a n η a p i α π i k α where π i k α pa denotes the pressure of centroid of half face c i k m is the vector from the cell centroid to the half face centroid t i j α m 3 is the one sided transmissibility related to a single cell can be written as 18 t i j α a i j k i α c i k n i j c i k 2 because the fluxes on all faces is continuous there is v i j α v j i α v ij α for unit i and unit j and as well as the continuity of face pressures π i k α π k i α π ik α therefore the following relationship is obtained 19 p i α π i k α v ij α t i j α 1 π a n η a 1 20 p j α π j k α v ij α t i j α 1 π a n η a 1 combining equations 19 and 20 the face pressure is eliminated and the following tpfa is obtained 21 v ij α t i j α t j i α t i j α t j i α π a η a p i α p j α t ij α π a η a p i α p j α where p i pa and p j pa are the average pressures of cell i and cell j respectively t ij α m 3 is the transmissibility between the two cells 22 t ij α t i j α t j i α t i j α t j i α for the matrix system n 1 so the convection term in the matrix governing equation can be discretized as 23 ρ v m j ρ η 1 t ij m μ 1 p i m p j m for the fracture system n 2 so the flux between fracture cell i and fracture cell j can be expressed by tpfa as 24 v ij f t ij f η 1 η 2 p i f p j f for the discretization of high velocity non darcy flow correction factor η 2 combined with equation 21 η 2 between fracture cell i and fracture cell j becomes 25 η 2 2 1 1 4 ρ β k f μ λ t ij f p i f p j f combining equations 24 and 25 the convection term of fracture governing equation can be discretized as 26 ρ v f j ρ η 1 η 2 t ij f μ 1 p i f p j f in edfm the matrix grids and the fracture grids are mismatched as shown in fig 3 there are three nncs in the edfm model 1 fracture matrix nnc 2 fracture fracture nnc two different fractures 3 fracture well nnc when a matrix cell intersects with a fracture cell connection node a in fig 3 the flux between the matrix cell and the fracture cell can be discretized as 27 q ik m f t i k m f μ 1 p i m p k f where t i k m f m 3 is transmissibility between matrix cell i and fracture cell k which is obtained by the following equation 28 t i k m f a ik k mf d ik where a ik m 2 is the area of the intersection k mf m 2 is the harmonic average of fracture and matrix permeabilities based on cell volume d ik m is the volume average normal distance between the matrix cell and the fracture plane and its calculation method is as follows xu 2015 29 d ik d ik d v v i when a fracture cell intersects with another fracture cell connecting node b in the fig 3 the flux between the fracture cell f i and fracture cell f k can be discretized as 30 q f f t f f μ 1 p i f p k f where t f f m 3 is transmissibility between two different fracture cells which can be given by the following formula karimi fard et al 2004 xu et al 2017 31 t f f t i f t j f t i f t j f 32 t i f k i f δ i f l i j f d i f t j f k j f δ j f l j i f d j f where k i f m 2 and k j f m 2 are the permeability of fracture cell i and fracture cell j respectively δ i f m and δ j f m denote aperture of fracture cell i and fracture cell j respectively l i j f m indicates the intersection length of two fractures in the cell and l i j f l j i f d i f m and d j f m respectively represent the volume average normal distance from the centroid of two fracture cells to the intersection line and its calculation method is the same as equation 29 when the vertical fracture intersects the horizontal well connecting node c in fig 3 fluid flow resistance between fracture and wellbore is not only the resistance between grids but more the resistance caused by high velocity non darcy flow at this time the following equation is satisfied between the fracture cell and wellbore peaceman 1983 xu et al 2017 33 p f w μ k f q f w a δ f d r ρ β q f w ah 2 d r integrating

skin produced by the high speed non darcy flow l f m and h f m denote the length and height of the fracture respectively therefore when the fracture cell i intersects the well the flux between them

pressure when the various complex flow mechanisms of shale gas are considered the whole equation is nonlinear it is very difficult to solve the nonlinear equation directly our research is based on edfm which skillfully transforms the nonlinear flow equation into the linear flow equation in the solution process the influence of various complex flow mechanisms on the fluid was transformed into the influence on the grid conductivity and then a correction coefficient was added to the flow equation which could be obtained by calculated easily before each iteration finally the linear equation is solved the open source reservoir numerical simulation tool mrst was used for the entire solution process 3 model validation the edfm wtm developed by liu et al 2021 is used to verify the reliability of the pta model of shale proposed in this paper in their work fractures are also described by edfm and the basic parameters of reservoirs fractures and fluids used for simulation are shown in table 1 in fig 4 the log log curves of the two models pressure difference dp and pressure difference derivative dpd are compared the comparison result shows that the calculation results of the two models are in good agreement therefore the numerical pta model for mfhws in shale gas reservoirs proposed in this paper is reliable 4 results and discussions 4 1 typical curve analysis on the basis of model verification we reset the model parameters see table 2 to make the model closer to the real shale reservoir to obtain a more realistic bhp transient response of mhfws in shale gas reservoirs the change in pressure derivative is usually more sensitive than the change in pressure we can identify the fluid flow regime in mfhw through the dp curve fig 5 shows the typical log log curve of dp and dpd of fractured horizontal wells in which each flow regime is divided and marked in detail fig 6 shows the corresponding pressure distribution in each flow regime and fig 7 shows the three dimensional pressure distribution in different flow regime the following seven flow states of mfhws in shale reservoirs can be divided from the log log curve and pressure response profile 1 wellbore storage stage this stage is the earliest stage of all flow regimes and the slopes of dp and dpd curves are 1 this phenomenon reflects the storage capacity of the wellbore which is determined by a combination of fluid compressibility and wellbore size if the wellbore s storage capacity is strong this stage s duration will be longer 2 skin effect and transition flow the phenomenon of additional pressure drop required for gas well production due to reservoir damage is called the skin effect at this stage the dp and dpd curves begin to separate skin factor s dramatically affects the shape of the curves the dpd curve exhibits a distinct hump characteristic if s is positive the hump becomes invisible when s gets a negative value e g the dpd curve of a fractured well 3 bilinear flow blf this stage is the bilinear flow of fluid flowing from the reservoir into the fracture and from the fracture into the wellbore the slope of the dp and dpd curves is 1 4 fig 6a 4 fracture linear flow flf in this stage the fluid in the reservoir flows into the fracture linearly and the fluid flow occurs only in the fracture network the dp and dpd curves are parallel and their slopes are 1 2 fig 6b fig 7a 5 transitional flow at this stage the fluid is replenished from nfs to hfs while the fluid in the matrix is replenished to nfs and hfs the dpd curve drops to form a groove and the degree of drop reflects the strength of supply fig 6c fig 7b 6 pseudo boundary dominated flow pbdf the gas is mainly supplied by the matrix at this stage and the fracture acts as a channel for fluid flow the slope of the dpd curve increases to approximately 1 fig 6d fig 7c and the emergence of the pbdf is caused by the significant difference of physical properties between the external non stimulated and internal stimulated areas 7 pseudo radial flow prf at this stage the slope of the dpd curve is 0 which is the typical pseudo radial flow which is caused by the infinite shale reservoir or the pressure does not reach the boundary fig 6e fig 7d to sum up among the seven flow regimes flow stages 3 and 4 are the fracture dominated flow stages which show as the finite fracture conductivity model or infinite fracture conductivity model under the influence of the interstitial materials in the fractures the slope of the dpd curve is usually 1 4 or 1 2 and all the changes related to the flow in the fracture exist in these two regimes the flow stages 6 and 7 are the matrix dominated flow stages and the curve shape of this stage is influenced by reservoir physical properties and seepage mechanisms in the matrix the flow stage 5 is the transitional flow between the matrix and fractures and the curve shape of this stage is influenced by the matrix and nfs 4 2 impacts of flow mechanisms 4 2 1 adsorption shale gas exists in reservoirs in both free and adsorbed states the current research results show that free gas mainly exists in larger micron pores and fractures while adsorbed gas mainly exists in organic matter and solid surfaces as an essential part of shale gas the adsorbed gas accounts for 20 85 of the total shale gas the adsorption effect of gas in shale reservoirs greatly influences the fluid flow in shale reservoirs fig 8 shows the impact of shale gas adsorption effect on pressure transient response the adsorption effect of shale gas mainly affects the transitional flow and pbdf the increase of adsorption capacity langmuir volume will lead to a deeper groove less pressure loss and later prf the reason is the gas adsorbed in the shale reservoir can be desorbed in the matrix gas supply stage to replenish the formation energy in time which makes the pressure loss smaller in our model the adsorption effect occurs in the matrix therefore the adsorption effect only affects the transition flow and the matrix dominated flow while the dp and dpd curves at different adsorption indexes in other flow stages are almost overlapping 4 2 2 stress sensitivity of the matrix the reservoir pressure of the shale gas reservoir will inevitably decrease during development leading to an increase in net stress under the action of effective stress rocks will be deformed porosity and permeability will also change which results in stress sensitivity fig 9 shows the influence of stress sensitivity in the shale matrix on pressure transient response the stress sensitivity of the shale matrix mainly affects the later pbdf and prf as the stress sensitivity coefficient γ becomes larger the slope of the dpd curve in the pbdf stage will increase and prf will appear later the reason is stress sensitivity will damage the permeability of the reservoir and increase the pressure consumption of gas flowing what s more when the value of γ increases to 1 8 e 7 p a 1 the dpd curve will be warped and closed with the dp curve and the prf will disappear 4 2 3 stress sensitivity of fracture nfs and hfs are more seriously affected by effective stress fig 10 shows the influence of stress sensitivity of shale fracture on pressure transient response under the influence of effective stress the performance of fractures will deteriorate or even close as a result the gas seepage capacity is significantly weakened the pressure loss required for fluid flow is increased and the dp and dpd curves shift upward affected by the stress sensitivity of fracture the period of the wellbore storage stage is prolonged and it directly enters the transitional flow after the skin stage which leads to blf and flf being covered up in addition the existence of fracture stress sensitivity will lead to the warping of the dpd curve in the pbdf stage and the delay of the prf stage 4 2 4 high velocity non darcy flow many studies have proved that non darcy flow caused by inertia will happen when the velocity is too high i e the fluid velocity is no longer directly proportional to the pressure gradient this phenomenon usually occurs in media with high permeability such as nfs and hfs non darcy flow makes it more difficult to evaluate the productivity of gas wells which significantly increases the uncertainty in the development of gas reservoirs therefore it is necessary to study the influence of high velocity non darcy flow on fluid flow in mfhw the pressure transient response curves of darcy flow and high velocity non darcy flow are compared in fig 11 it is not difficult to see that the dpd curve moves up in the fracture dominated flow stage due to the existence of high velocity non darcy flow from the second stage skin stage the additional pressure loss caused by high velocity non darcy flow changes into rate dependent pseudo skin which leads to the upward translation of the high velocity non darcy flow pressure response curve at the same time in blf and flf stages the additional pressure loss caused by inertia increases the pressure needed to produce the same amount of gas which in turn leads to the upward shift of the pressure response curve in this stage in addition in the subsequent matrix dominated flow stage the influence of high velocity non darcy flow is weakened and the pressure curves of darcy flow and high velocity non darcy flow overlap 4 3 impacts of fractures properties 4 3 1 natural fracture the existence of natural fractures in shale reservoir is of great significance to the development of shale gas li et al 2023 natural fractures have arbitrary shapes and are randomly distributed in various positions of the reservoir natural fractures are intertwined with other natural fractures hydraulic fractures and matrix forming a complex fracture network which has a significant impact on fluid flow afagwu et al 2020 unfortunately although the existing analytical methods and semi analytical methods can consider the complex flow mechanisms of shale gas zhao et al 2013 they are still difficult to accurately describe the complex fracture network in shale reservoirs in addition almost all the problems of fluid flow solved by analytical method are two dimensional but the gas flow in horizontal wells is three dimensional and the existence of natural fractures is also three dimensional therefore in this section the numerical model proposed in this paper was used to describe the complex interlacing of fractures in three dimensional shale reservoirs as shown in fig 12 and the influence of natural fractures on fluid flow was analyzed fig 13 shows the influence of the existence of nf in shale reservoirs on the pressure transient response the existence of nfs can form a complex fracture network and provide more channels for fluid seepage which shortens the duration of flf stage in the transitional flow stage fluid will be replenished from nfs to hfs which makes the groove of the dpd curve in the transitional flow stage is deeper however in the matrix dominant flow stage the number of dp and dpd curves of different nfs almost overlap 4 3 2 hydraulic fractures number the influence of different hfs number on pressure transient response is shown in fig 14 there are obvious effects of hfs number on dp and dpd curves more hfs provides more low resistance flow channels and at the same time the influence range of hfs is increased which greatly reduces the flow resistance of shale gas as a result the pressure loss required for gas flowing is less from the wellbore storage stage to pbdf when entering the prf stage the pressure response curves tend to overlap 4 3 3 hydraulic fracture spacing the influence of different hfs spacing on pressure transient response is shown in fig 15 the hfs spacing mainly affects the matrix dominated flow stage with the increase of hfs spacing the slope of the dpd curve in the pbdf stage will be smaller the prf stage will appear later and less pressure loss in these stages the larger hfs spacing expands the influence range of hfs which leads to the hfs can be replenished by a wider range of matrix during the matrix gas supply stage however at other stages the pressure response curves affected by different hfs spacing almost overlap 4 3 4 hydraulic fracture half length fig 16 shows the comparison results of dp and dpd curves under different hf half lengths hf half length mainly affects the middle and late stages of flow with the increase of hf half length the appearance time of flf will be delayed the duration of the flf stage will be shortened and the pressure loss will be lower in the middle and late stages of flow these results reflect that the longer hf is the larger the volume affected by the hfs the shorter the time required for formation fluid to flow into the fractures and the smaller the flow resistance in addition in the matrix dominated flow stages more reservoirs are stimulated by longer fractures which results in less pressure loss required for matrix supply to fractures however the effect of hf half length disappears and the curves tend to overlap when entering the prf stage 4 3 5 hydraulic fracture conductivity as shown in fig 17 dp and dpd curves under different hf conductivity are compared hf conductivity mainly affects the fracture dominated flow stages with the increase of hf conductivity the duration of the wellbore storage stage and skin stage will be shortened which means that the bigger the fracture conductivity the faster fracture fluid can replenish the wellbore in addition the increased hf conductivity will make the blf stage end earlier and less the pressure loss because the bigger the hf conductivity the smaller the fluid flow resistance and the faster the flow velocity which leads to the shortening of the linear flow duration however the dp and dpd curves almost overlap in the later matrix dominated flow stages 4 3 6 hydraulic fracture inclination angle the influence of different hf inclination angle on pressure transient response is shown in fig 18 it is not difficult to see that hf inclination angle and hf half length have similar effects on the log log curve which indicates that they both affect the gas flow by changing the stimulated reservoir volume however hf half length mainly affects the stimulated reservoir volume in the horizontal direction while hf inclination angle affects that in the vertical direction when hf hight is consistent the bigger the hf inclination angle the farther the hf extends in the vertical direction and the larger the stimulated reservoir volume which leads to the lower pressure loss required for fluid flow in the fracture dominated flow stages however in the matrix dominated flow stages the influence of hf inclination angle is weakened and the pressure response curves tend to overlap 5 conclusions to understand the flow mechanisms of shale gas in the reservoir more accurately a three dimensional pta model of mfhw is proposed comprehensively considering various flow mechanisms and complex fracture networks in shale gas reservoirs mrst obtains the numerical solution of the model typical pta curves and the main features of mfhw are identified the main factors affecting shale gas flow on pta curves are analyzed in detail the main work and conclusions are as follows 1 considering the shale gas adsorption stress sensitivity of shale reservoir and high velocity non darcy flow in fractures a flow model of shale gas was proposed based on the flow model the three dimensional numerical model of mfhws pressure transient analysis in shale gas reservoir was established and the governing equations discrete process is described in detail the model is solved by mrst programming compared with the model proposed by hui the model s reliability is proved 2 based on this model the pressure transient response characteristics of shale reservoir mfhws are studied by analyzing the log log curves of dp and dpd the shale gas flow process is divided into seven flow regimes a wellbore storage stage b skin effect and transition flow c bilinear flow blf d fracture linear flow flf e transitional flow f pseudo boundary dominated flow pbdf g pseudo radial flow prf 3 the adsorbed gas in the shale reservoir can replenish the formation energy which reduces the pressure loss in the transitional flow stage and pbdf stage stress sensitivity will lead to additional pressure loss stress sensitivity in the matrix will increase the slope of the dpd curve in the pbdf stage and stress sensitivity in fracture will lead to the blf stage and flf stage in the early stage being hidden the high velocity non darcy flow in fractures will increase the gas flow resistance resulting in more pressure loss in the blf and flf stages 4 nfs can activate more fractures and form a fracture network reducing the gas flow resistance with the increase of fracture conductivity the wellbore can be replenished faster by fluid in fracture which leads to the early entry of the blf stage and less pressure loss both hf half lengths and hf inclination angle influence the fluid seepage by changing the stimulated reservoir volume the larger the stimulated reservoir volume the lower the pressure loss is required for fluid flow the more hfs there are the less pressure loss is needed for shale gas development credit authorship

1988,nutrient loss from the topsoil reduces agricultural productivity and contributes to the eutrophication of water bodies like rivers and lakes to reduce agricultural non point source pollution ongoing efforts must be made to develop mathematical models that can accurately forecast the process of nutrient loss and provide a theoretical foundation for developing prevention and control strategies in this study the concept of an equivalent exchange layer eel which consists of an equivalent runoff layer and an equivalent infiltration layer was proposed the equivalent exchange model eem which describes nutrient migration from upper soil to runoff was developed on this basis the eem was validated and its parameters were calibrated using 12 sets of k loss data on bare slopes and 30 sets of nh4 n loss data on six vegetation growths overall eem exhibited good accuracy in forecasting the process by which the of k and nh4 n concentrations changed and as the total amount of k and nh4 n in the runoff r2 0 713 rmse 2 373 mg l nse 0 701 compared to the model developed by shao et al 2021 eem outperformed in terms of simulation performance when predicting the total amount of nutrient loss r2 0 963 nse 0 911 effectively resolving the problem that the total amount of nutrient loss is overestimated a single parameter perturbation simulation and a global sensitivity analysis revealed that the raindrop induced nutrient transfer rate e r and the depth of the equivalent exchange layer eed were the primary variables controlling nutrient loss while the initial ratio of the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer to the equivalent exchange layer α 0 and index m were the secondary variables accurately predicting nutrient content in the stable runoff stage this research contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying nutrient transfer on slopes keywords non point source pollution nutrient transfer model rainfall runoff mathematical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfall induced soil erosion significantly contributes to soil degradation on hillslopes verity and anderson 1990 shi et al 2022 valentin et al 2005 over 33 per cent of the world s soil is harmed by erosion bongiovanni and lobartini 2006 poesen et al 2003 tao et al 2018 in addition to increasing the likelihood of runoff and sediment transport soil erosion causes the loss of soil microorganisms nutrients and organic carbon aksoy et al 2012 assouline and mualem 2006 yang et al 2022 shao et al 2022a 2023a 2023b this nutrient enrichment severely harms the water s natural environment and the resulting rapid growth of phytoplankton biomass fu et al 2016 armenise et al 2018 for example the loess plateau region of china loses about 1 6 billion tonnes of soil and 38 million tonnes of nutrients each year translating to a surface soil thickness of 1 0 cm tao et al 2018 ao et al 2019 in order to fracture the soil aggregate structure and allow the soluble nutrients to be lost with runoff raindrop splashing is typically used as the primary erosion force during erosion conditions ao et al 2019 2020 shao et al 2020 however it is not clear how nutrients from the soil are delivered to runoff yang et al 2022 therefore determining how soluble nutrients are transported from the upper soil to runoff is crucial for the scientific advancement of agricultural management techniques bryan 2000 gispert et al 2017 borrelli et al 2020 li et al 2017 it is practical to investigate the route of soluble nutrients at the water soil interface by combining theoretical research and a mathematical model donigian et al 1977 bruce et al 1975 gao et al 2004 shao et al 2022b numerous academics put much effort into this project and achieved specific results ahuja and lehman 1983 havis et al 1992 wallach et al 1988 wallach and van genuchten 1990 walter et al 2007 existing nutrient transport models can be divided into three groups based on the presumptive theory of nutrient transfer at the soil water interface the raindrop diffusion model the mixing layer model and the empirical model steenhuis and walter 1980 ahuja and lehman 1983 walter et al 2007 because of their precise physical mechanisms the mixing layer model of ahuja and lehman 1983 and the raindrop splashing diffusion model of gao et al 2004 are frequently used the mixing layer theory that ahuja and lehman 1983 proposed assumed that rainwater and soil water mixed rapidly and uniformly the rates at which nutrients from the mixing layer enter the runoff layer and the deeper soil are independent values however the incomplete mixing model had lower prediction accuracy in the loess plateau application dong et al 2013 wang et al 1999 reported an equivalent mixing theory based on nutrient transfer characteristics in the chinese loess plateau however the nutrient concentration in the mixing layer was assumed to decay with a power function in this theory dong et al 2013 the equivalent mixing model was semi empirical so despite its high prediction accuracy it could not reveal the intrinsic mechanism of nutrient transfer based on this gao et al 2004 proposed an exchange layer theory similar to the mixing layer theory in which nutrients are transferred at the water soil interface via the splashing and diffusion of raindrops although the model performs well in laboratory experiments with a fixed water depth the calculation accuracy of this model is very low in the loess plateau slope rainfall test under unsaturated infiltration conditions shao et al 2020 both the models developed by gao et al 2004 and ahuja and lehman 1983 all underestimated nutrient concentrations to varying degrees during the stable runoff stage to solve this problem shao et al 2021 2022b tong and ye 2020 and yang et al 2016a proposed the time varying mixing layer theory which states that the depth of the mixing layer is a variable that increases with runoff time however these models overestimate the depth of the mixing layer or the exchange layer as a result some parameters of these models have lost their original physical meaning consequently the mathematical model of nutrient transport on slopes under unsaturated conditions must be further improved the nutrient transport mechanism at the water soil interface must be clarified assuming the model parameters are accurate moreover existing studies have only evaluated these models on slopes devoid of vegetation and few studies have validated the models regarding vegetation types and plant growth processes ao et al 2020 huang et al 2021 li et al 2017 shao et al 2021 teixeira and misra 2005 tong and ye 2020 yang et al 2016a 2016b consequently it is necessary to develop nutrient loss prediction models suitable for bare slopes and vegetation covered slopes in chinese loess plateau based on the transport characteristics of nutrients in unsaturated soil and ponding water interfaces the exchange layer theory was improved in this study the primary objectives of the study were to 1 develop an equivalent exchange model eem for predicting raindrop induced nutrient ejection from soil to overland flow using an equivalent exchange layer 2 quantitatively characterise the eem and environmental factors 3 quantitatively evaluate the relationship between eem and vegetation growth time and establish equivalent growth estimation parameters for different plants under normalised growth days 4 and assess the contribution of parameters to the eem using the single parameter disturbance simulation test and the sobol s method the eem has a clear physical significance and reasonable parameter settings which solves the problem of existing mathematical models based on mixing layer theory and nutrient exchange layer theory overestimating nutrient loss in the chinese loess plateau dong et al 2013 yang et al 2016a shao et al 2021 moreover this study extends the application scenario of eem to vegetation growth conditions providing theoretical support for regional non point source pollution prevention and control and the carbon neutrality objective 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 model improvement motivation and rationale in previous work shao et al 2020 used the model developed by gao et al 2004 to predict the loss rates of no3 n and nh4 n whereas the model developed gao et al 2004 significantly underestimated the rate of nutrient loss in the stable phase it discovered that when the diffusion is disregarded the possibility of nutrients in the exchange layer being transferred to the ponding water by raindrop splashing or infiltration into deeper soil is considered equal similar to the complete mixing theory of ahuja and lehman 1983 it does not apply to predicting nutrient transfer on slopes under unsaturated conditions therefore in this study the exchange layer theory was further perfected while the nutrient balance equation in the exchange layer established by gao et al 2004 was improved as elaborated in section 2 2 the hydrodynamic process of rainfall water entering the surface during rainfall can typically be broken down into three subprocesses a raindrops strike the surface soil and disperse soil particles b rainwater infiltrates the soil c rainwater over the soil infiltration capacity is converted into runoff water raindrop splashing and infiltration play the most significant roles in nutrient migration in these three subprocesses the raindrop strikes the structure of the soil particles and transfers nutrient ions attached to the surface of the soil particles into the runoff water on the other hand during infiltration water passes through the soil pore and nutrients attached to soil particles will be dissolved and transported deeper into the soil nutrient migration is attributed to mass transfer without considering diffusion to clarify the physical mechanism of the model in the exchange layer only raindrop splashing and infiltration are considered mass transfer modes of nutrient transport consequently the following hypotheses are proposed h1 raindrop splashing is the only mass transfer pathway for nutrient ions to migrate from upper soil to runoff h2 only nutrient ions in the superficial thin layer have the exchange capacity into the runoff and lower soil this layer is referred to as the equivalent exchange layer i e eel additionally it is hypothesised that nutrients entering runoff and infiltration into the subsoil originated from two distinct layers fig 1 hence the eel has upper and lower parts with the reduction of nutrient ions in the upper layer equivalent to those entering the runoff layer due to raindrop splashing similarly the decrease in subsoil nutrients is equal to the amount of nutrients that have infiltrated the subsoil these two layers are called the equivalent runoff layer and the equivalent infiltration layer respectively 2 2 improved nutrient loss model according to the mass conservation theory the nutrient balance equation in eel can be expressed as follows gao et al 2004 1 d k a ρ s θ s e e d c e t dt 1 α e r c e t α i t c e t where θs is the soil saturated moisture content cm3 cm 3 ρs is the soil bulk density g cm 3 ka is the soil adsorption coefficient cm3 g 1 eed is the depth of the eel cm ce t is the nutrient concentration in the eel cm min 1 α is the ratio of the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer to the depth of eel t is the rainfall duration min er is the raindrop induced nutrient transfer rate cm min 1 and i t is the infiltration rate cm min 1 the nutrient content of the ponding runoff can be expressed as follows wang et al 1999 2 m r t e r 1 α c e t where mr t is the nutrient ions transfer rate at a time t mg min 1 similarly the nutrient concentration in ponding runoff water can also be expressed as shao et al 2022b 3 m r t q t c e t where q t is the flow velocity cm min 1 the water balance equation in shao et al 2022b 2023a expresses the flow velocity and unit discharge during a rainfall event as follows 4 q l t tanh 2 3 2 k r i t sc t t p r i t w l 5 q t tanh 2 3 2 k r i t sc t t p r i t where q l t is the discharge cm3 min 1 sc is the slope topographic synthesis coefficient k is the shape coefficient of the ponding water profile tp is the time of initial flow generation min r is the rainfall intensity cm min 1 w is the width of slope cm and l is the length of slope cm soil infiltration process is described by the philip model mclsaac et al 1991 philip 1954 shao et al 2022b 6 i t r t t p i t 1 2 s t t 0 1 2 t t p where s is the soil sorptivity cm min 0 5 and t 0 s 2 4r 2 combining eqs 1 and 6 the nutrient concentration in the eel can be expressed as follows 7 c e t c m exp e r α 1 t t p α s t t 0 0 5 t p t 0 0 5 β e e d where cm is the nutrient content in the eel at tp mg l 1 in this case 8 c m c s k a ρ s θ s r t p k a ρ s θ 0 9 β k a ρ s θ s where cs is the nutrient concentration in the original soil mg g 1 combining eqs 2 3 5 6 and 7 nutrient concentration in the runoff can be expressed as follows 10 c r t 1 α e r c m tanh 2 3 2 k r i t sc t t p r i t exp e r α 1 t t p α s t t 0 0 5 t p t 0 0 5 β e e d where cr is the nutrient concentration in the runoff mg l 1 existing research has demonstrated that as the runoff process advances the effect of runoff scouring increases resulting in a deeper soil layer involved in the runoff exchange yang et al 2016a ao et al 2020 dong et al 2013 as a result infiltrated water s ability to carry nutrients is constantly decreasing in other words the depth of equivalent infiltration layer decreases while the depth of equivalent runoff layer increases as runoff duration increases thus the following hypothesis is made h3 the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer is reduced by an exponential function the ratio of the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer to the depth of eel can be expressed as follows 11 α α 0 exp m t t 0 where α 0 is the initial ratio of the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer to the depth of the eel and m is the index combining eqs 1 6 and 11 the nutrient concentration in the eel can be expressed as follows 12a c e t c m exp 2 e r a 1 α 0 s a 2 2 β e e d 12b a 1 α 0 exp m t p t 0 α 0 exp m t t 0 m t t p m 12c a 2 π 0 5 e r f m 0 5 t t 0 0 5 e r f m 0 5 t p t 0 0 5 m 0 5 furthermore nutrient concentration and total nutrient loss in the runoff can be expressed as follows 13 c r t 1 α e r c m 1 α 0 exp m t t 0 tanh 2 3 2 k r i t sc t t p r i t exp 2 e r a 1 α 0 s a 2 2 β e e d 14 tn t p t c r t q l t d t where tn represents the total nutrients mg 2 3 a comparison of the simulation results obtained when the α is a fixed value versus a time varying function in fig 2 the simulation curves of eqs 10 and 13 are plotted apparently the simulated value of eq 13 is greater than that of eq 10 moreover when α is a time varying function the simulation curve is gentler in the stable loss stage it demonstrates that α as a time varying function can slow down the rate of nutrient concentration decay section 4 will examine whether the assumption that α is a time varying function is consistent with the actual situation 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources this study is an expansion of shao et al 2021 and shao et al 2022b and the data used for model validation are from yang et al 2016b and li 2018 the eem was validated using nutrient loss data from 42 rainfall events we present data on k loss in runoff from 12 simulated rainfall events in three scenarios i e scenario 1 rainfall intensity scenario 2 initial moisture content scenario 3 slope the rainfall simulation plot of the key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland agriculture on the loess plateau was used to conduct these simulated rainfall experiments yang et al 2016b six vegetations i e soybean wheat millet coronilla varia vicia villosa red clover were planted with runoff nh4 n loss data from 30 simulated rainfall events under five distinct growth times these simulated rainfall experiments were undertaken in the field rainfall plot of changwu state key agro ecological experimental station of the loess plateau li 2018 yang et al 2016b provided the basic data tp for the simulated rainfall experiment and shao et al 2022b provided the soil sorptivity s slope topographic synthesis coefficient sc shape coefficient of the ponding water profile k and others 3 2 model evaluation indicators the correlation coefficient r2 root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was calculated and defined to evaluate the consistency of the simulated and measured data tao et al 2018 shao et al 2023a shao et al 2023b 15 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 16 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 17 nse 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where yi is the ith measured data y is the average value xi is the ith simulated data and n represents the number of measured data 3 3 global sensitivity analysis sobol s method apportions the component variances of the overall variance of all parameters into distinct parameter actions and interactions sobol 1993 shao et al 2022b in this study the first order index represents the effect of a parameter change on the variance of model performance the second order index reflects the impact of two parameter changes on the variance of model operation finally the total order index reflects the cumulative effect of all parameter changes on the operating variance of the model 18 fi v i v 19 si v ij v 20 ti 1 v i v where fi is the contribution of the ith factor as the main control factor vi is the calculated disturbance of the ith factor v is the total disturbance si is the contribution jointly influenced by the ith and jth factors and ti is the major contribution of the ith factor and the total contribution of its interaction with the other factors 3 4 parameter estimation the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method shao et al 2021 was used for parameter estimation and to establish the corresponding models 4 model evaluation and parameter analysis 4 1 contribution of rainfall intensity initial moisture content and slope to k loss 4 1 1 k concentration in runoff k concentrations in runoff from 12 rainfall events were used to evaluate the eem essential parameters like cs rainfall intensity r soil initial moisture content θ 0 and slope slp are listed in table 1 by nonlinearly fitting the observed k concentration eed er m and α 0 were calculated table 1 fig 3 depicts the variation curve of k concentration calculated by eem under different conditions and the measured data points the calculated curve of eem accurately represented the measured k concentration in the runoff the evaluation indices r2 0 713 rmse 1 132 mg l and nse 0 701 indicate that eem has achieved high calculation accuracy eem performed worse than the other three rainfall intensities when the rainfall intensity was 0 200 cm min within 10 35 min eem underestimated the k concentration and overestimated it after 50 min fig 3a this may be because the initial runoff time is only 1 28 min at 0 200 cm min and the eel is not fully saturated after the runoff which led to the overestimation of cm calculated according to eq 8 thereby overestimating the k concentrations calculated by eem for a period of time after the runoff furthermore eem is based on an exponential function consequently the model in this paper cannot attain the accuracy of the model proposed by wang et al 1999 under initial soil moisture content conditions eem accurately predicted the k concentration change process fig 3b the eem performs excellent specifically in the stable loss stage after 20 min this is because the depth of the equivalent runoff layer in eem is defined as a variable that increases over time it effectively resolves the problem that to varying degrees the traditional models of gao et al 2004 and ahuja and lehman 1983 underestimate nutrient concentration in the stable phase the prediction of the change process of k concentration at a 30 slope by eem is unsatisfactory fig 3c demonstrates that the k concentration is underestimated before 13 min while the k concentration is overestimated after 13 min we speculated that this was because the surface soil particles to fall off at the initial runoff stage when the slope was steep under the runoff shear force resulting in the k attached to the surface of the soil particles was continuously transferred to the runoff which caused a high loss rate of k concentration at the initial stage the k concentration in the upper soil decreases continuously over time and consequently the k concentration in the runoff stable stage also decreases rapidly however eem considers raindrop splashing as the only method for k in the soil to enter runoff and the contribution of runoff scouring to k is ignored shao et al 2022b as a result eem predicts the 30 slope with less accuracy than the other three slopes overall eem accurately predicts the process of k concentration change it demonstrates that eem predicts nutrient loss during hillside rainfall with high computational accuracy 4 1 2 total loss of k in runoff the total nutrient loss during a rainfall event is an essential metric for evaluating the fertility of farmland and the level of water pollution the eq 14 in eem was used to calculate the total loss of k from runoff the relationship between the total loss of k measured in 12 groups of rainfall tests and the total loss of k calculated by the eem is shown in fig 4 as can be seen these data points are very close to the 1 1 line it demonstrates that eem correctly predicted total loss of k during rainfall the linear regression equation was used to calibrate the deviation between the simulated and observed values resulting in r2 0 950 the regression line is nearly identical to the 1 1 line indicating that eem is reasonably accurate at predicting total k loss 4 2 contribution of vegetation growth to nh4 n loss 4 2 1 nh4 n concentration in runoff fig 5 depicts the nutrient loss data and eem calculation curve for three industrial crops namely soybean wheat and millet and three green manure plants namely coronilla varia vicia villosa and red clover during simulated rainfall at various growth times overall eem accurately predicted the nh4 loss process of six plants at five growth times r2 0 732 rmse 2 373 mg l nse 0 702 three industrial crops soybean wheat and millet have higher prediction accuracy than three green manure plants coronilla variegata vicia villosa and red clover further analysis revealed that during the first rainfall event eem overestimated the nh4 n loss process of millet coronilla varia vicia villosa and red clover it may be due to the short window between the first rainfall event and the planting of the seeds the structure of topsoil will become loose and connected macropores will form due to factors like cultivation and plant root growth delaying the time to enter the stable loss stage however eem failed to account for this change causing the predicted change process of nh4 n concentration to enter a stable phase prematurely the topsoil however gradually becomes denser due to vegetation growth consequently eem accurately predicted nh4 n concentration in the other four rainfall events excluding the initial rainfall event comparing the change process of nh4 n concentration at various vegetation growth times reveals that the initial nutrient loss time of the six vegetation is significantly delayed with the increase of their growth time and the nh4 n concentration at the stable stage also decreases it is due to the gradual increase in canopy interception capacity with plant growth the interception of plant leaves reduces the ability of rainwater to splash on the upper soil some rainwater flows into the soil along with the plant stems increasing the retention time of rainfall water on the topsoil the growth of plant roots improve the stability of soil aggregates and the number of pores these factors have effectively increased the soil capacity for infiltration and decreased the rate of nh4 n transfer from the soil to surface runoff the concentration of nh4 n decreased as growth time increased it is satisfactory that eem accurately captures these changes 4 2 2 total loss of nh4 n in runoff to evaluate the effect of eem on the total loss of nh4 during vegetation growth the total loss of nh4 n in runoff was calculated using eq 14 in eem fig 6 depicts the relationship between the total nh4 n loss measure from 30 rainfall tests and that calculated by the eem these data points are very close to the 1 1 line the deviation between the calculated and measured values is corrected by a linear regression equation resulting in r2 0 978 the slope of the regression line is 0 984 indicating that eem is quite accurate at predicting the total loss of nh4 n 4 3 quantitative analysis of the parameters 4 3 1 change of rainfall intensity initial moisture content and slope on eed er α0 and m eed er α 0 and m are the four critical parameters in eem eed er and α 0 were derived inversely by fitting the measured k concentrations with the mcmc method table 1 to reduce calculation errors caused by parameter fluctuations and ensure that all parameters are not distorted and kept within a reasonable range of values the recommended values of parameter m for k to 0 25 eed er and α 0 increased as rainfall intensity and initial water content increased but decreased as the slope increased eed characterises the depth of the eel ao et al 2020 its value represents the amount of nutrients that can be exchanged shao et al 2021 eed increased from 0 80 to 0 95 cm with an increase in rainfall intensity increased from 0 83 to 0 92 cm with an increase in initial water content and decreased from 0 88 to 0 80 cm with an increase in slope in eem er is defined as the only way for nutrients to be transferred from the equivalent runoff layer into the runoff shao et al 2022b er increased from 0 0010 to 0 0028 cm min as rainfall intensity increased increased from 0 0012 to 0 0021 cm min as initial water content increased and decreased from 0 0017 to 0 0010 cm min as the slope increased α 0 increased from 0 28 to 0 41 as rainfall intensity increased increased from 0 30 to 0 39 as initial water content increased and decreased from 0 39 to 0 31 as the slope increased it is because heavy rainfall increases raindrop splashing and significantly reduces the initial runoff time thereby increasing the potential erodibility of the topsoil and the likelihood of nutrients entering the runoff yang et al 2016b soil infiltration capacity decreases as the initial water content increases and the time required for the surface soil to enter the saturated state is significantly reduced thereby increasing the depth of the eel wang et al 1999 as the slope of the hillside increases the effective rainfall bearing area continuously decreases which significantly reduces the splash kinetic energy of raindrops and thus the transfer ability of nutrients into the runoff dong et al 2013 parameter estimation models based on r θ 0 and slp were developed to predict eed er and α 0 respectively improve the general applicability of eem and simplify the calculation method of those parameters these estimation models are illustrated in eqs 21 22 and 23 and the model evaluation index r2 is greater than 0 912 fig 7 depicts the relationship between the parameters of eem inversion and the parameter curves calculated by the estimation model thus allowing the visual assessment of the degree of fit between the parameters as predicted by the estimation model and the parameters of eem inversion the accuracy of the parameters calculated by the estimation models is er α 0 eed r2 0 917 meanwhile the calculation accuracy of the three parameters is as follows r θ 0 slp under different initial conditions 21 eed 2 305 r 0 2465 θ 0 0 1251 s l p 0 086 r 2 0 917 n 12 22 e r 0 0578 r 1 481 exp 4 6835 θ 0 s l p 0 486 r 2 0 995 n 12 23 α 0 3 4216 r 0 5407 θ 0 0 3124 s l p 0 215 r 2 0 962 n 12 in general parameter estimation models calculate these parameters more precisely as a result these estimation models can be combined with eem to predict nutrient loss of course we only tested it on the chinese loess plateau it should be noted that soil hydraulic properties vary greatly based on soil texture and land use conditions therefore it is recommended that these parameters be recalibrated in other soil texture situations eem can be used to assess nutrient loss on hillside slopes in arid and semiarid climates 4 3 2 change of vegetation growth on eed er α0 and m it is crucial to analyse the contribution of vegetation types and growth days to the model parameters and understand how vegetation affects nutrient loss the recommended values of parameter m for nh4 n to 0 40 parameters eed er and α 0 of the growth of six vegetation decrease as growth time increases fig 8 this demonstrates that depth of the equivalent exchange layer raindrop splash kinetic energy and nutrient transfer capacity from topsoil to runoff are all decreased with vegetation growth in the same growth stage the reduction of eed er and α 0 by three industrial crops was less than that of three green manure plants throughout the entire growth period the parameters eed er and α 0 of vicia villosa remained low it may be because the vicia villosa has developed roots and a high leaf area index which effectively reduces the ability of raindrops to splash the ground thereby controlling nutrient loss under all vegetation growth the power function can describe the change in eed er and α 0 with growth time the influence of vegetation growth on model parameters was thoroughly evaluated and a quantitative relationship between model parameters and growth time was established the selected wheat had a maximum growth period of 60 days while the other five vegetation types had a maximum growth period of 140 days the growth days of six different vegetation were standardised after normalising the parameter data the power function fits these data fig 8 it can be observed that the power function can comprehensively predict the change process of parameters eed er and α 0 under varied relative growth days of vegetation to some extent resulting in r2 0 528 4 4 comparison of simulation performance with the model developed by shao et al 2021 the accuracy of the eem was assessed using the measured data of total k loss under four rainfall intensities and the measured data of total nh4 n loss under five different soybean growth times the simulated data of the eem and the model developed by shao et al 2021 and the measured data are plotted in fig 9 the model developed by shao et al 2021 overestimates the total amount of nutrient loss in general this is because the model developed by shao et al 2021 overestimates the nutrient concentration in the initial runoff stage to accurately predict the nutrient concentration in the stable runoff stage encouragingly eem has achieved better simulation performance r2 0 963 rmse 139 48 mg nse 0 911 than the model developed by shao et al 2021 these results indicate that eem is appropriate for predicting the characteristics of nutrient loss in the chinese loess plateau it is important to note that based on previous studies yang et al 2016b shao et al 2021 2022b vegetation growth scenarios were added to this work to validate eem thereby enhancing the application scenarios of eem 4 5 sensitivity analysis 4 5 1 simulated test of single parameter disturbance four parameters of the eem established in this study were selected eed er α 0 and m each parameter is set to five values with equal intervals to investigate the contribution of a single disturbance of different parameters to the simulation curve calculated by the eem these simulation curves are shown in fig 10 when er is increased from 0 0005 to 0 0025 cm min the nutrient concentration calculated by eem continuously increases in the initial runoff from 5 2 mg l to about 27 1 mg l then maintains a concentration of approximately 5 0 mg l in the stable runoff stage fig 10a when eed increased from 0 20 cm to 1 00 cm the difference in the nutrient concentration curve calculated by eem was small in the early rapid loss stage however the nutrient concentration increased continuously in the stable runoff stage fig 10b the stable loss stage is reached earlier when eed is 1 00 cm versus 0 20 cm and the increasing trend of the nutrient concentration decreases as eed rises the variation law of α 0 is opposite to that of er with an increase of α 0 the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer increases while the depth of the equivalent runoff layer decreases it implies fewer nutrients can flow into the runoff consequently the entire simulation curve decreases with increased α 0 fig 10c m represents the rate of decrease and increase of the equivalent infiltration layer the change rule for m is consistent with eed when m is increased from 0 20 to 1 00 the effect on the simulation curve is comparable to eed but the amplitude of the curve change is smaller fig 10d based on the above results the contribution levels of the parameters to eem are arranged as follows er eed α 0 m α 0 and m are less sensitive to the eem than er and eed but they are essential for predicting nutrient concentrations at the stable loss stage 4 5 2 global sensitivity analysis the contribution of a single parameter to eem has been studied but the contribution of two or more parameters combined to eem is unknown therefore it is crucial to evaluate the global sensitivity of eem shao et al 2022b to obtain an analysis sample set sobol s method must employ a quasi monte carlo method that generates n 2d 2 sample quantity where n is the number of monte carlo samples and d is the number of parameters involved in a global sensitivity analysis the calculation result can converge when n 210 in this study n 217 was selected based on operation speed and accuracy four most important parameters for eem were eed er α 0 and m making d 4 therefore the value ranges of these four parameters are simultaneously constrained to 0 1 fig 11 depicts the relationship curves of the first order index fi second order index si and total order index ti when four main parameters are perturbed over rainfall time in fig 11a the fi of er rapidly decreased and then slowly increased the fi of α 0 and m decreased from approximately 0 05 and the fi of eed rapidly increased and then slowly decreased overall the fi values of er and eed are larger further investigation revealed that the fi of er was the greatest within the first seven minutes that of eed was greatest between 7 and 36 min and that of er began to be greater than the eed after 36 min it suggests that er significantly impacts the nutrient content of runoff during the initial runoff period ao et al 2020 the sum of the first order index sumfi slowly fluctuates then decreases indicating that the interaction between the four parameters will continue in fig 11b the si of the interaction between er and eed fluctuated and increased while the si between other parameters remained constant at approximately 0 01 in fig 11c ti with er as the main effect and the interaction of eed α 0 and m exhibits a rapid decrease initially before a slow increase while in ti with eed as the main effect and the interaction of er α 0 and m exhibits a rapid increase initially before a slow decrease consistent with the change law of fi according to the preceding analysis eem was most sensitive to eed and er and less to α 0 and m 5 discussion we reviewed previous work shao et al 2021 2022b and proposed the concept of an equivalent exchange layer which is divided into an equivalent runoff layer and an equivalent infiltration layer in this study on this basis a mathematical model describing nutrient migration from topsoil to runoff equivalent exchange model abbreviated as eem was developed and validated in general eem has accurately predicted the change process of k and nh4 n concentration in the runoff and their total amounts with high accuracy as previously stated the theory of equivalent exchange layer is proposed in this study the concept of equivalent exchange layer is fundamentally based on the mixing layer and the exchange layer wang et al 1999 demonstrated that traditional models ahuja and lehman 1983 gao et al 2004 could not accurately simulate the nutrient transport process in the hillslope particularly during the stable phase and that these models frequently underestimated nutrient concentration although shao et al 2021 improved the conventional model and obtained better simulation results by increasing the depth of the mixing layer we found that all of these improved models achieved sufficient model computational accuracy at the expense of overestimating the depth of the mixing layer and that the value of the parameter er as computed by the model of shao et al 2022b was overestimated as a result the exchange layer or mixing layer in the traditional model is redefined as the equivalent exchange layer i e eel in eem in this research the eed is constant in this study while the nutrient distribution in the eel was quantified fundamentally by adjusting the proportions of the depth of the equivalent runoff layer and the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer in the eel the nutrient balance equation in the eel integrates the nutrient transfer theory in the mixing layer ahuja and lehman 1983 and the raindrop induced nutrient transport mechanism gao et al 2004 providing a more explicit physical meaning for eem than those improved models established by shao et al 2022b and yang et al 2016b moreover the applicability of eem was verified using k loss experiments in 12 simulated rainfall events and nh4 n loss experiments in 30 simulated rainfall events it contributes to the theory of the transport mechanism of dissolved nutrients from soil to runoff through the inversion of the measured k and nh4 n loss processes it is discovered that the calculated curve of eem can accurately capture the migration process of k and nh4 n in the runoff at the hillside scale parameter estimation models were developed based on critical environmental factors such as rain intensity initial water content and slope to simplify obtaining main parameters in the meantime the normalised growth days were used to develop the parameter estimation formula for six plants i e soybean wheat millet coronilla varia vicia villosa and red clover even though eem has only been validated in a few simulated rainfall experiments it s clear physical significance and simple parameter acquisition methods make it a promising candidate for watershed scale pollutant transport investigations in conjunction with watershed water models similarly the simulation results of the eem and the model developed by shao et al 2021 under different rain intensities and soybean growth times demonstrate that eem has a more reasonable model structure and better simulation performance than the model developed by shao et al 2021 it further indicates that the equivalent exchange theory in this study is more suitable for nutrient loss characteristics in the loess plateau compared to the mixed layer theory nevertheless eem still requires further improvement in future work since the trapping effect of vegetation and the dispersive effect of plant leaves on the kinetic energy of raindrops are not considered 6 conclusions the equivalent exchange model abbreviated as eem is a mathematical model that describes nutrient migration from soil to runoff eem is predicated on the following h1 raindrop splashing is the only mass transfer pathway for nutrient ions to migrate from upper soil to runoff h2 only nutrient ions in the superficial thin layer have the exchange capacity into the runoff and lower soil this layer is referred to as the equivalent exchange layer i e eel the eel is composed of the equivalent runoff layer and the equivalent infiltration layer the eem was validated using k loss data from 12 simulated rainfall tests and nh4 n loss data from 30 simulated rainfall tests the parameter estimation models under bare slope were established using rainfall intensity initial water content and slope in the meantime the normalised growth days were used to develop the parameter estimation formula for six plants i e soybean wheat millet coronilla varia vicia villosa and red clover the results demonstrate that the eem developed in this paper can accurately simulate k and nh4 n concentrations and total amounts the parameter estimation models simplify the parameter acquisition method a single parameter disturbance simulation and a global sensitivity analysis revealed that er and eed were the most critical factors in nutrient loss control although α 0 and m were less sensitive to the eem they were nonetheless critical for an accurate prediction of nutrient concentration in the stable stage eem can accurately predict nutrient migration processes on the hillsides however whether this study also applies to longer slope lengths remains to be confirmed as we suspected rill erosion caused by runoff erosion on longer hillsides may significantly contribute nutrients from the soil to runoff to make the eem more applicable in a broader range of situations in future studies we should try to incorporate the nutrient transfer modes of raindrop splashing and runoff scouring into the eem of course eem produces superior results which provides theoretical support for farmland fertiliser management and agricultural environmental governance credit authorship contribution statement fanfan shao

1988,nutrient loss from the topsoil reduces agricultural productivity and contributes to the eutrophication of water bodies like rivers and lakes to reduce agricultural non point source pollution ongoing efforts must be made to develop mathematical models that can accurately forecast the process of nutrient loss and provide a theoretical foundation for developing prevention and control strategies in this study the concept of an equivalent exchange layer eel which consists of an equivalent runoff layer and an equivalent infiltration layer was proposed the equivalent exchange model eem which describes nutrient migration from upper soil to runoff was developed on this basis the eem was validated and its parameters were calibrated using 12 sets of k loss data on bare slopes and 30 sets of nh4 n loss data on six vegetation growths overall eem exhibited good accuracy in forecasting the process by which the of k and nh4 n concentrations changed and as the total amount of k and nh4 n in the runoff r2 0 713 rmse 2 373 mg l nse 0 701 compared to the model developed by shao et al 2021 eem outperformed in terms of simulation performance when predicting the total amount of nutrient loss r2 0 963 nse 0 911 effectively resolving the problem that the total amount of nutrient loss is overestimated a single parameter perturbation simulation and a global sensitivity analysis revealed that the raindrop induced nutrient transfer rate e r and the depth of the equivalent exchange layer eed were the primary variables controlling nutrient loss while the initial ratio of the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer to the equivalent exchange layer α 0 and index m were the secondary variables accurately predicting nutrient content in the stable runoff stage this research contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying nutrient transfer on slopes keywords non point source pollution nutrient transfer model rainfall runoff mathematical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfall induced soil erosion significantly contributes to soil degradation on hillslopes verity and anderson 1990 shi et al 2022 valentin et al 2005 over 33 per cent of the world s soil is harmed by erosion bongiovanni and lobartini 2006 poesen et al 2003 tao et al 2018 in addition to increasing the likelihood of runoff and sediment transport soil erosion causes the loss of soil microorganisms nutrients and organic carbon aksoy et al 2012 assouline and mualem 2006 yang et al 2022 shao et al 2022a 2023a 2023b this nutrient enrichment severely harms the water s natural environment and the resulting rapid growth of phytoplankton biomass fu et al 2016 armenise et al 2018 for example the loess plateau region of china loses about 1 6 billion tonnes of soil and 38 million tonnes of nutrients each year translating to a surface soil thickness of 1 0 cm tao et al 2018 ao et al 2019 in order to fracture the soil aggregate structure and allow the soluble nutrients to be lost with runoff raindrop splashing is typically used as the primary erosion force during erosion conditions ao et al 2019 2020 shao et al 2020 however it is not clear how nutrients from the soil are delivered to runoff yang et al 2022 therefore determining how soluble nutrients are transported from the upper soil to runoff is crucial for the scientific advancement of agricultural management techniques bryan 2000 gispert et al 2017 borrelli et al 2020 li et al 2017 it is practical to investigate the route of soluble nutrients at the water soil interface by combining theoretical research and a mathematical model donigian et al 1977 bruce et al 1975 gao et al 2004 shao et al 2022b numerous academics put much effort into this project and achieved specific results ahuja and lehman 1983 havis et al 1992 wallach et al 1988 wallach and van genuchten 1990 walter et al 2007 existing nutrient transport models can be divided into three groups based on the presumptive theory of nutrient transfer at the soil water interface the raindrop diffusion model the mixing layer model and the empirical model steenhuis and walter 1980 ahuja and lehman 1983 walter et al 2007 because of their precise physical mechanisms the mixing layer model of ahuja and lehman 1983 and the raindrop splashing diffusion model of gao et al 2004 are frequently used the mixing layer theory that ahuja and lehman 1983 proposed assumed that rainwater and soil water mixed rapidly and uniformly the rates at which nutrients from the mixing layer enter the runoff layer and the deeper soil are independent values however the incomplete mixing model had lower prediction accuracy in the loess plateau application dong et al 2013 wang et al 1999 reported an equivalent mixing theory based on nutrient transfer characteristics in the chinese loess plateau however the nutrient concentration in the mixing layer was assumed to decay with a power function in this theory dong et al 2013 the equivalent mixing model was semi empirical so despite its high prediction accuracy it could not reveal the intrinsic mechanism of nutrient transfer based on this gao et al 2004 proposed an exchange layer theory similar to the mixing layer theory in which nutrients are transferred at the water soil interface via the splashing and diffusion of raindrops although the model performs well in laboratory experiments with a fixed water depth the calculation accuracy of this model is very low in the loess plateau slope rainfall test under unsaturated infiltration conditions shao et al 2020 both the models developed by gao et al 2004 and ahuja and lehman 1983 all underestimated nutrient concentrations to varying degrees during the stable runoff stage to solve this problem shao et al 2021 2022b tong and ye 2020 and yang et al 2016a proposed the time varying mixing layer theory which states that the depth of the mixing layer is a variable that increases with runoff time however these models overestimate the depth of the mixing layer or the exchange layer as a result some parameters of these models have lost their original physical meaning consequently the mathematical model of nutrient transport on slopes under unsaturated conditions must be further improved the nutrient transport mechanism at the water soil interface must be clarified assuming the model parameters are accurate moreover existing studies have only evaluated these models on slopes devoid of vegetation and few studies have validated the models regarding vegetation types and plant growth processes ao et al 2020 huang et al 2021 li et al 2017 shao et al 2021 teixeira and misra 2005 tong and ye 2020 yang et al 2016a 2016b consequently it is necessary to develop nutrient loss prediction models suitable for bare slopes and vegetation covered slopes in chinese loess plateau based on the transport characteristics of nutrients in unsaturated soil and ponding water interfaces the exchange layer theory was improved in this study the primary objectives of the study were to 1 develop an equivalent exchange model eem for predicting raindrop induced nutrient ejection from soil to overland flow using an equivalent exchange layer 2 quantitatively characterise the eem and environmental factors 3 quantitatively evaluate the relationship between eem and vegetation growth time and establish equivalent growth estimation parameters for different plants under normalised growth days 4 and assess the contribution of parameters to the eem using the single parameter disturbance simulation test and the sobol s method the eem has a clear physical significance and reasonable parameter settings which solves the problem of existing mathematical models based on mixing layer theory and nutrient exchange layer theory overestimating nutrient loss in the chinese loess plateau dong et al 2013 yang et al 2016a shao et al 2021 moreover this study extends the application scenario of eem to vegetation growth conditions providing theoretical support for regional non point source pollution prevention and control and the carbon neutrality objective 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 model improvement motivation and rationale in previous work shao et al 2020 used the model developed by gao et al 2004 to predict the loss rates of no3 n and nh4 n whereas the model developed gao et al 2004 significantly underestimated the rate of nutrient loss in the stable phase it discovered that when the diffusion is disregarded the possibility of nutrients in the exchange layer being transferred to the ponding water by raindrop splashing or infiltration into deeper soil is considered equal similar to the complete mixing theory of ahuja and lehman 1983 it does not apply to predicting nutrient transfer on slopes under unsaturated conditions therefore in this study the exchange layer theory was further perfected while the nutrient balance equation in the exchange layer established by gao et al 2004 was improved as elaborated in section 2 2 the hydrodynamic process of rainfall water entering the surface during rainfall can typically be broken down into three subprocesses a raindrops strike the surface soil and disperse soil particles b rainwater infiltrates the soil c rainwater over the soil infiltration capacity is converted into runoff water raindrop splashing and infiltration play the most significant roles in nutrient migration in these three subprocesses the raindrop strikes the structure of the soil particles and transfers nutrient ions attached to the surface of the soil particles into the runoff water on the other hand during infiltration water passes through the soil pore and nutrients attached to soil particles will be dissolved and transported deeper into the soil nutrient migration is attributed to mass transfer without considering diffusion to clarify the physical mechanism of the model in the exchange layer only raindrop splashing and infiltration are considered mass transfer modes of nutrient transport consequently the following hypotheses are proposed h1 raindrop splashing is the only mass transfer pathway for nutrient ions to migrate from upper soil to runoff h2 only nutrient ions in the superficial thin layer have the exchange capacity into the runoff and lower soil this layer is referred to as the equivalent exchange layer i e eel additionally it is hypothesised that nutrients entering runoff and infiltration into the subsoil originated from two distinct layers fig 1 hence the eel has upper and lower parts with the reduction of nutrient ions in the upper layer equivalent to those entering the runoff layer due to raindrop splashing similarly the decrease in subsoil nutrients is equal to the amount of nutrients that have infiltrated the subsoil these two layers are called the equivalent runoff layer and the equivalent infiltration layer respectively 2 2 improved nutrient loss model according to the mass conservation theory the nutrient balance equation in eel can be expressed as follows gao et al 2004 1 d k a ρ s θ s e e d c e t dt 1 α e r c e t α i t c e t where θs is the soil saturated moisture content cm3 cm 3 ρs is the soil bulk density g cm 3 ka is the soil adsorption coefficient cm3 g 1 eed is the depth of the eel cm ce t is the nutrient concentration in the eel cm min 1 α is the ratio of the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer to the depth of eel t is the rainfall duration min er is the raindrop induced nutrient transfer rate cm min 1 and i t is the infiltration rate cm min 1 the nutrient content of the ponding runoff can be expressed as follows wang et al 1999 2 m r t e r 1 α c e t where mr t is the nutrient ions transfer rate at a time t mg min 1 similarly the nutrient concentration in ponding runoff water can also be expressed as shao et al 2022b 3 m r t q t c e t where q t is the flow velocity cm min 1 the water balance equation in shao et al 2022b 2023a expresses the flow velocity and unit discharge during a rainfall event as follows 4 q l t tanh 2 3 2 k r i t sc t t p r i t w l 5 q t tanh 2 3 2 k r i t sc t t p r i t where q l t is the discharge cm3 min 1 sc is the

the soil sorptivity cm min 0 5 and t 0 s 2 4r 2 combining eqs 1 and 6 the nutrient concentration in the eel can be expressed as follows 7 c e t c m exp e r α 1 t t p α s t t 0 0 5 t p t 0 0 5 β e e d where cm is the nutrient content in the eel at tp mg l 1 in this case 8 c m c s k a ρ s θ s r t p k a ρ s θ 0 9 β k a ρ s θ s where cs is the nutrient concentration in the original soil mg g 1 combining eqs 2 3 5 6 and 7 nutrient concentration in the runoff can be expressed as follows 10 c r t 1 α e r c m tanh 2 3 2 k r i t sc t t p r i t exp e r α 1 t t p α s t t 0 0 5 t p t 0 0 5 β e e d where cr is the nutrient concentration in the runoff mg l 1 existing research has demonstrated that as the runoff process advances the effect of runoff scouring increases resulting in a deeper soil layer involved in the runoff exchange yang et al 2016a ao et al 2020 dong et al 2013 as a result infiltrated water s ability to carry nutrients is constantly decreasing in other words the depth of equivalent infiltration layer decreases while the depth of equivalent runoff layer increases as runoff duration increases thus the following hypothesis is made h3 the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer is reduced by an exponential function the ratio of the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer to the depth of eel can be expressed as follows 11 α α 0 exp m t t 0 where α 0 is the initial ratio of the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer to the depth of the eel and m is the index combining eqs 1 6 and 11 the nutrient concentration in the eel can be expressed as follows 12a c e t c m exp 2 e r a 1 α 0 s a 2 2 β e e d 12b a 1 α 0 exp m t p t 0 α 0 exp m t t 0 m t t p m 12c a 2 π 0 5 e r f m 0 5 t t 0 0 5 e r f m 0 5 t p t 0 0 5 m 0 5 furthermore nutrient

r t q l t d t where tn represents the total nutrients mg 2 3 a comparison of the simulation results obtained when the α is a fixed value versus a time varying function in fig 2 the simulation curves of eqs 10 and 13 are plotted apparently the simulated value of eq 13 is greater than that of eq 10 moreover when α is a time varying function the simulation curve is gentler in the stable loss stage it demonstrates that α as a time varying function can slow down the rate of nutrient concentration decay section 4 will examine whether the assumption that α is a time varying function is consistent with the actual situation 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sources this study is an expansion of shao et al 2021 and shao et al 2022b and the data used for model validation are from yang et al 2016b and li 2018 the eem was validated using nutrient loss data from 42 rainfall events we present data on k loss in runoff from 12 simulated rainfall events in three scenarios i e scenario 1 rainfall intensity scenario 2 initial moisture content scenario 3 slope the rainfall simulation plot of the key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland agriculture on the loess plateau was used to conduct these simulated rainfall experiments yang et al 2016b six vegetations i e soybean wheat millet coronilla varia vicia villosa red clover were planted with runoff nh4 n loss data from 30 simulated rainfall events under five distinct growth times these simulated rainfall experiments were undertaken in the field rainfall plot of changwu state key agro ecological experimental station of the loess plateau li 2018 yang et al 2016b provided the basic data tp for the simulated rainfall experiment and shao et al 2022b provided the soil sorptivity s slope topographic synthesis coefficient sc shape coefficient of the ponding water profile k and others 3 2 model evaluation indicators the correlation coefficient r2 root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was calculated and defined to evaluate the consistency of the simulated and measured data tao et al 2018 shao et al 2023a shao et al 2023b 15 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 16 rmse i

sensitivity analysis sobol s method apportions the component variances of the overall variance of all parameters into distinct parameter actions and interactions sobol 1993 shao et al 2022b in this study the first order index represents the effect of a parameter change on the variance of model performance the second order index reflects the impact of two parameter changes on the variance of model operation finally the total order index reflects the cumulative effect of all parameter changes on the operating variance of the model 18 fi v i v 19 si v ij v 20 ti 1 v i v where fi is the contribution of the ith factor as the main control factor vi is the calculated disturbance of the ith factor v is the total disturbance si is the contribution jointly influenced by the ith and jth factors and ti is the major contribution of the ith factor and the total contribution of its interaction with the other factors 3 4 parameter estimation the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method shao et al 2021 was used for parameter estimation and to establish the corresponding models 4 model evaluation and parameter analysis 4 1 contribution of rainfall intensity initial moisture content and slope to k loss 4 1 1 k concentration in runoff k concentrations in runoff from 12 rainfall events were used to evaluate the eem essential parameters like cs rainfall intensity r soil initial moisture content θ 0 and slope slp are listed in table 1 by nonlinearly fitting the observed k concentration eed er m and α 0 were calculated table 1 fig 3 depicts the variation curve of k concentration calculated by eem under different conditions and the measured data points the calculated curve of eem accurately represented the measured k concentration in the runoff the evaluation indices r2 0 713 rmse 1 132 mg l and nse 0 701 indicate that eem has achieved high calculation accuracy eem performed worse than the other three rainfall intensities when the rainfall intensity was 0 200 cm min within 10 35 min eem underestimated the k concentration and overestimated it after 50 min fig 3a this may be because the initial runoff time is only 1 28 min at 0 200 cm min and the eel is not fully saturated after the runoff which led to the overestimation of cm calculated according to eq 8 thereby overestimating the k concentrations calculated by eem for a period of time after the runoff furthermore eem is based on an exponential function consequently the model in this paper cannot attain the accuracy of the model proposed by wang et al 1999 under initial soil moisture content conditions eem accurately predicted the k concentration change process fig 3b the eem performs excellent specifically in the stable loss stage after 20 min this is because the depth of the equivalent runoff layer in eem is defined as a variable that increases over time it effectively resolves the problem that to varying degrees the traditional models of gao et al 2004 and ahuja and lehman 1983 underestimate nutrient concentration in the stable phase the prediction of the change process of k concentration at a 30 slope by eem is unsatisfactory fig 3c demonstrates that the k concentration is underestimated before 13 min while the k concentration is overestimated after 13 min we speculated that this was because the surface soil particles to fall off at the initial runoff stage when the slope was steep under the runoff shear force resulting in the k attached to the surface of the soil particles was continuously transferred to the runoff which caused a high loss rate of k concentration at the initial stage the k concentration in the upper soil decreases continuously over time and consequently the k concentration in the runoff stable stage also decreases rapidly however eem considers raindrop splashing as the only method for k in the soil to enter runoff and the contribution of runoff scouring to k is ignored shao et al 2022b as a result eem predicts the 30 slope with less accuracy than the other three slopes overall eem accurately predicts the process of k concentration change it demonstrates that eem predicts nutrient loss during hillside rainfall with high computational accuracy 4 1 2 total loss of k in runoff the total nutrient loss during a rainfall event is an essential metric for evaluating the fertility of farmland and the level of water pollution the eq 14 in eem was used to calculate the total loss of k from runoff the relationship between the total loss of k measured in 12 groups of rainfall tests and the total loss of k calculated by the eem is shown in fig 4 as can be seen these data points are very close to the 1 1 line it demonstrates that eem correctly predicted total loss of k during rainfall the linear regression equation was used to calibrate the deviation between the simulated and observed values resulting in r2 0 950 the regression line is nearly identical to the 1 1 line indicating that eem is reasonably accurate at predicting total k loss 4 2 contribution of vegetation growth to nh4 n loss 4 2 1 nh4 n concentration in runoff fig 5 depicts the nutrient loss data and eem calculation curve for three industrial crops namely soybean wheat and millet and three green manure plants namely coronilla varia vicia villosa and red clover during simulated rainfall at various growth times overall eem accurately predicted the nh4 loss process of six plants at five growth times r2 0 732 rmse 2 373 mg l nse 0 702 three industrial crops soybean wheat and millet have higher prediction accuracy than three green manure plants coronilla variegata vicia villosa and red clover further analysis revealed that during the first rainfall event eem overestimated the nh4 n loss process of millet coronilla varia vicia villosa and red clover it may be due to the short window between the first rainfall event and the planting of the seeds the structure of topsoil will become loose and connected macropores will form due to factors like cultivation and plant root growth delaying the time to enter the stable loss stage however eem failed to account for this change causing the predicted change process of nh4 n concentration to enter a stable phase prematurely the topsoil however gradually becomes denser due to vegetation growth consequently eem accurately predicted nh4 n concentration in the other four rainfall events excluding the initial rainfall event comparing the change process of nh4 n concentration at various vegetation growth times reveals that the initial nutrient loss time of the six vegetation is significantly delayed with the increase of their growth time and the nh4 n concentration at the stable stage also decreases it is due to the gradual increase in canopy interception capacity with plant growth the interception of plant leaves reduces the ability of rainwater to splash on the upper soil some rainwater flows into the soil along with the plant stems increasing the retention time of rainfall water on the topsoil the growth of plant roots improve the stability of soil aggregates and the number of pores these factors have effectively increased the soil capacity for infiltration and decreased the rate of nh4 n transfer from the soil to surface runoff the concentration of nh4 n decreased as growth time increased it is satisfactory that eem accurately captures these changes 4 2 2 total loss of nh4 n in runoff to evaluate the effect of eem on the total loss of nh4 during vegetation growth the total loss of nh4 n in runoff was calculated using eq 14 in eem fig 6 depicts the relationship between the total nh4 n loss measure from 30 rainfall tests and that calculated by the eem these data points are very close to the 1 1 line the deviation between the calculated and measured values is corrected by a linear regression equation resulting in r2 0 978 the slope of the regression line is 0 984 indicating that eem is quite accurate at predicting the total loss of nh4 n 4 3 quantitative analysis of the parameters 4 3 1 change of rainfall intensity initial moisture content and slope on eed er α0 and m eed er α 0 and m are the four critical parameters in eem eed er and α 0 were derived inversely by fitting the measured k concentrations with the mcmc method table 1 to reduce calculation errors caused by parameter fluctuations and ensure that all parameters are not distorted and kept within a reasonable range of values the recommended values of parameter m for k to 0 25 eed er and α 0 increased as rainfall intensity and initial water content increased but decreased as the slope increased eed characterises the depth of the eel ao et al 2020 its value represents the amount of nutrients that can be exchanged shao et al 2021 eed increased from 0 80 to 0 95 cm with an increase in rainfall intensity increased from 0 83 to 0 92 cm with an increase in initial water content and decreased from 0 88 to 0 80 cm with an increase in slope in eem er is defined as the only way for nutrients to be transferred from the equivalent runoff layer into the runoff shao et al 2022b er increased from 0 0010 to 0 0028 cm min as rainfall intensity increased increased from 0 0012 to 0 0021 cm min as initial water content increased and decreased from 0 0017 to 0 0010 cm min as the slope increased α 0 increased from 0 28 to 0 41 as rainfall intensity increased increased from 0 30 to 0 39 as initial water content increased and decreased from 0 39 to 0 31 as the slope increased it is because heavy rainfall increases raindrop splashing and significantly reduces the initial runoff time thereby increasing the potential erodibility of the topsoil and the likelihood of nutrients entering the runoff yang et al 2016b soil infiltration capacity decreases as the initial water content increases and the time required for the surface soil to enter the saturated state is significantly reduced thereby increasing the depth of the eel wang et al 1999 as the slope of the hillside increases the effective rainfall bearing area continuously decreases which significantly reduces the splash kinetic energy of raindrops and thus the transfer ability of nutrients into the runoff dong et al 2013 parameter estimation models based on r θ 0 and slp were developed to predict eed er and α 0 respectively improve the general applicability of eem and simplify the calculation method of those parameters these estimation models are illustrated in eqs 21 22 and 23 and the model evaluation index r2 is greater than 0 912 fig 7 depicts the relationship between the parameters of eem inversion and the parameter curves calculated by the estimation model thus allowing the visual assessment of the degree of fit between the parameters as predicted by the estimation model and the parameters of eem inversion the accuracy of the parameters calculated by the estimation models is er α 0 eed r2 0 917 meanwhile the calculation accuracy of the three parameters is as follows r θ 0 slp under different initial conditions 21 eed 2 305 r 0 2465 θ 0 0 1251 s l p 0 086 r 2 0 917 n 12 22 e r 0 0578 r 1 481 exp 4 6835 θ 0 s l p 0 486 r 2 0 995 n 12 23 α 0 3 4216 r 0 5407 θ 0 0 3124 s l p 0 215 r 2 0 962 n 12 in general parameter estimation models calculate these parameters more precisely as a result these estimation models can be combined with eem to predict nutrient loss of course we only tested it on the chinese loess plateau it should be noted that soil hydraulic properties vary greatly based on soil texture and land use conditions therefore it is recommended that these parameters be recalibrated in other soil texture situations eem can be used to assess nutrient loss on hillside slopes in arid and semiarid climates 4 3 2 change of vegetation growth on eed er α0 and m it is crucial to analyse the contribution of vegetation types and growth days to the model parameters and understand how vegetation affects nutrient loss the recommended values of parameter m for nh4 n to 0 40 parameters eed er and α 0 of the growth of six vegetation decrease as growth time increases fig 8 this demonstrates that depth of the equivalent exchange layer raindrop splash kinetic energy and nutrient transfer capacity from topsoil to runoff are all decreased with vegetation growth in the same growth stage the reduction of eed er and α 0 by three industrial crops was less than that of three green manure plants throughout the entire growth period the parameters eed er and α 0 of vicia villosa remained low it may be because the vicia villosa has developed roots and a high leaf area index which effectively reduces the ability of raindrops to splash the ground thereby controlling nutrient loss under all vegetation growth the power function can describe the change in eed er and α 0 with growth time the influence of vegetation growth on model parameters was thoroughly evaluated and a quantitative relationship between model parameters and growth time was established the selected wheat had a maximum growth period of 60 days while the other five vegetation types had a maximum growth period of 140 days the growth days of six different vegetation were standardised after normalising the parameter data the power function fits these data fig 8 it can be observed that the power function can comprehensively predict the change process of parameters eed er and α 0 under varied relative growth days of vegetation to some extent resulting in r2 0 528 4 4 comparison of simulation performance with the model developed by shao et al 2021 the accuracy of the eem was assessed using the measured data of total k loss under four rainfall intensities and the measured data of total nh4 n loss under five different soybean growth times the simulated data of the eem and the model developed by shao et al 2021 and the measured data are plotted in fig 9 the model developed by shao et al 2021 overestimates the total amount of nutrient loss in general this is because the model developed by shao et al 2021 overestimates the nutrient concentration in the initial runoff stage to accurately predict the nutrient concentration in the stable runoff stage encouragingly eem has achieved better simulation performance r2 0 963 rmse 139 48 mg nse 0 911 than the model developed by shao et al 2021 these results indicate that eem is appropriate for predicting the characteristics of nutrient loss in the chinese loess plateau it is important to note that based on previous studies yang et al 2016b shao et al 2021 2022b vegetation growth scenarios were added to this work to validate eem thereby enhancing the application scenarios of eem 4 5 sensitivity analysis 4 5 1 simulated test of single parameter disturbance four parameters of the eem established in this study were selected eed er α 0 and m each parameter is set to five values with equal intervals to investigate the contribution of a single disturbance of different parameters to the simulation curve calculated by the eem these simulation curves are shown in fig 10 when er is increased from 0 0005 to 0 0025 cm min the nutrient concentration calculated by eem continuously increases in the initial runoff from 5 2 mg l to about 27 1 mg l then maintains a concentration of approximately 5 0 mg l in the stable runoff stage fig 10a when eed increased from 0 20 cm to 1 00 cm the difference in the nutrient concentration curve calculated by eem was small in the early rapid loss stage however the nutrient concentration increased continuously in the stable runoff stage fig 10b the stable loss stage is reached earlier when eed is 1 00 cm versus 0 20 cm and the increasing trend of the nutrient concentration decreases as eed rises the variation law of α 0 is opposite to that of er with an increase of α 0 the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer increases while the depth of the equivalent runoff layer decreases it implies fewer nutrients can flow into the runoff consequently the entire simulation curve decreases with increased α 0 fig 10c m represents the rate of decrease and increase of the equivalent infiltration layer the change rule for m is consistent with eed when m is increased from 0 20 to 1 00 the effect on the simulation curve is comparable to eed but the amplitude of the curve change is smaller fig 10d based on the above results the contribution levels of the parameters to eem are arranged as follows er eed α 0 m α 0 and m are less sensitive to the eem than er and eed but they are essential for predicting nutrient concentrations at the stable loss stage 4 5 2 global sensitivity analysis the contribution of a single parameter to eem has been studied but the contribution of two or more parameters combined to eem is unknown therefore it is crucial to evaluate the global sensitivity of eem shao et al 2022b to obtain an analysis sample set sobol s method must employ a quasi monte carlo method that generates n 2d 2 sample quantity where n is the number of monte carlo samples and d is the number of parameters involved in a global sensitivity analysis the calculation result can converge when n 210 in this study n 217 was selected based on operation speed and accuracy four most important parameters for eem were eed er α 0 and m making d 4 therefore the value ranges of these four parameters are simultaneously constrained to 0 1 fig 11 depicts the relationship curves of the first order index fi second order index si and total order index ti when four main parameters are perturbed over rainfall time in fig 11a the fi of er rapidly decreased and then slowly increased the fi of α 0 and m decreased from approximately 0 05 and the fi of eed rapidly increased and then slowly decreased overall the fi values of er and eed are larger further investigation revealed that the fi of er was the greatest within the first seven minutes that of eed was greatest between 7 and 36 min and that of er began to be greater than the eed after 36 min it suggests that er significantly impacts the nutrient content of runoff during the initial runoff period ao et al 2020 the sum of the first order index sumfi slowly fluctuates then decreases indicating that the interaction between the four parameters will continue in fig 11b the si of the interaction between er and eed fluctuated and increased while the si between other parameters remained constant at approximately 0 01 in fig 11c ti with er as the main effect and the interaction of eed α 0 and m exhibits a rapid decrease initially before a slow increase while in ti with eed as the main effect and the interaction of er α 0 and m exhibits a rapid increase initially before a slow decrease consistent with the change law of fi according to the preceding analysis eem was most sensitive to eed and er and less to α 0 and m 5 discussion we reviewed previous work shao et al 2021 2022b and proposed the concept of an equivalent exchange layer which is divided into an equivalent runoff layer and an equivalent infiltration layer in this study on this basis a mathematical model describing nutrient migration from topsoil to runoff equivalent exchange model abbreviated as eem was developed and validated in general eem has accurately predicted the change process of k and nh4 n concentration in the runoff and their total amounts with high accuracy as previously stated the theory of equivalent exchange layer is proposed in this study the concept of equivalent exchange layer is fundamentally based on the mixing layer and the exchange layer wang et al 1999 demonstrated that traditional models ahuja and lehman 1983 gao et al 2004 could not accurately simulate the nutrient transport process in the hillslope particularly during the stable phase and that these models frequently underestimated nutrient concentration although shao et al 2021 improved the conventional model and obtained better simulation results by increasing the depth of the mixing layer we found that all of these improved models achieved sufficient model computational accuracy at the expense of overestimating the depth of the mixing layer and that the value of the parameter er as computed by the model of shao et al 2022b was overestimated as a result the exchange layer or mixing layer in the traditional model is redefined as the equivalent exchange layer i e eel in eem in this research the eed is constant in this study while the nutrient distribution in the eel was quantified fundamentally by adjusting the proportions of the depth of the equivalent runoff layer and the depth of the equivalent infiltration layer in the eel the nutrient balance equation in the eel integrates the nutrient transfer theory in the mixing layer ahuja and lehman 1983 and the raindrop induced nutrient transport mechanism gao et al 2004 providing a more explicit physical meaning for eem than those improved models established by shao et al 2022b and yang et al 2016b moreover the applicability of eem was verified using k loss experiments in 12 simulated rainfall events and nh4 n loss experiments in 30 simulated rainfall events it contributes to the theory of the transport mechanism of dissolved nutrients from soil to runoff through the inversion of the measured k and nh4 n loss processes it is discovered that the calculated curve of eem can accurately capture the migration process of k and nh4 n in the runoff at the hillside scale parameter estimation models were developed based on critical environmental factors such as rain intensity initial water content and slope to simplify obtaining main parameters in the meantime the normalised growth days were used to develop the parameter estimation formula for six plants i e soybean wheat millet coronilla varia vicia villosa and red clover even though eem has only been validated in a few simulated rainfall experiments it s clear physical significance and simple parameter acquisition methods make it a promising candidate for watershed scale pollutant transport investigations in conjunction with watershed water models similarly the simulation results of the eem and the model developed by shao et al 2021 under different rain intensities and soybean growth times demonstrate that eem has a more reasonable model structure and better simulation performance than the model developed by shao et al 2021 it further indicates that the equivalent exchange theory in this study is more suitable for nutrient loss characteristics in the loess plateau compared to the mixed layer theory nevertheless eem still requires further improvement in future work since the trapping effect of vegetation and the dispersive effect of plant leaves on the kinetic energy of raindrops are not considered 6 conclusions the equivalent exchange model abbreviated as eem is a mathematical model that describes nutrient migration from soil to runoff eem is predicated on the following h1 raindrop splashing is the only mass transfer pathway for nutrient ions to migrate from upper soil to runoff h2 only nutrient ions in the superficial thin layer have the exchange capacity into the runoff and lower soil this layer is referred to as the equivalent exchange layer i e eel the eel is composed of the equivalent runoff layer and the equivalent infiltration layer the eem was validated using k loss data from 12 simulated rainfall tests and nh4 n loss data from 30 simulated rainfall tests the parameter estimation models under bare slope were established using rainfall intensity initial water content and slope in the meantime the normalised growth days were used to develop the parameter estimation formula for six plants i e soybean wheat millet coronilla varia vicia villosa and red clover the results demonstrate that the eem developed in this paper can accurately simulate k and nh4 n concentrations and total amounts the parameter estimation models simplify the parameter acquisition method a single parameter disturbance simulation and a global sensitivity analysis revealed that er and eed were the most critical factors in nutrient loss control although α 0 and m were less sensitive to the eem they were nonetheless critical for an accurate prediction of nutrient concentration in the stable stage eem can accurately predict nutrient migration processes on the hillsides however whether this study also applies to longer slope lengths remains to be confirmed as we suspected rill erosion caused by runoff erosion on longer hillsides may significantly contribute nutrients from the soil to runoff to make the eem more applicable in a broader range of situations in future studies we should try to incorporate the nutrient transfer modes of raindrop splashing and runoff scouring into the eem of course eem produces superior results which provides theoretical support for farmland fertiliser management and agricultural environmental governance credit authorship contribution statement fanfan shao

1989,the single well push pull swpp test has been extensively used in parameter estimation models numerous analytical solutions to the problem are available all of which consider solute transport in a non uniform flow field from steady radial flow created by the swpp test however the non uniform flow velocity is based on the thiem equation and varies in a spatial manner rather than a temporal manner no analytical solution has been previously described for the solute transport equation of swpp under fully transient flow in this study the generalized integral transform technique gitt was used to develop a new semi analytical solution for solute transport in the swpp test under fully transient flow four phases of the swpp test were included injection chaser rest and extraction with the proposed solution the differences between a transient flow swpp model solution and a piecewise steady state flow swpp model solution were non negligible such differences increased with decreases in the dimensionless parameter related to aquifer flow properties which is proportional to transmissivity aquifer thickness and porosity but inversely proportional to the storage coefficient and pumping rate additionally long tails of btcs are characteristic of type curves under the transient flow model the long tails of btcs under transient flow could result in overestimation of dispersivity if the swpp model uses piecewise steady state flow rather than transient flow for parameter estimation the proposed semi analytical solution provides a useful tool for curve fitting during parameter estimation when the effects of transient flow are significant the proposed solution can also serve as a performance comparison for testing numerical solutions to the swpp test keywords generalized integral transform technique gitt long tailed type curve semi analytical solution single well push pull swpp test transient flow condition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the single well push pull swpp test has been extensively used to estimate transport parameters such as porosity dispersivity and reaction rates gelhar and collins 1971 hall et al 1991 istok et al 1997 1999 schroth et al 1998 2001 schroth and istok 2006 cassiani et al 2005 haggerty et al 1998 snodgrass and kitanidis 1998 mcguire et al 2002 boisson et al 2013 kruisdijk and van breukelen 2021 this test involves the injection of a tracer followed by push drift and pumping of a single well the parameters can be obtained by fitting the observed breakthrough curves btcs to type curves that are calculated using a mathematical model when accurate parameter estimates are sought there is a need for an accurate analytical model that considers important processes associated with the swpp test there are many analytical and numerical solutions for the swpp test for example huang et al 2010 obtained an exact analytical solution to the swpp test by considering a partially penetrating well in a homogeneous confined aquifer whereas gelhar and collins 1971 and chen et al 2017 developed an analytical solution for the swpp test in a fully penetrated well wang et al 2018 and shi et al 2020 developed a new semi analytical solution by considering the wellbore mixing effect during both the injection and extraction phases wang et al 2020 derived a new semi analytical solution that considers both mixing and aquitard effects in four stages injection chaser rest and extraction notably all of these analytical solutions have been developed under the assumption that the flow field is non uniform and steady radial flow occurs during the swpp test here the non uniform flow velocity is based on the thiem equation where the flow velocity is inversely proportional to radial distance from the well and varies in a spatial manner rather than a temporal manner although such an assumption has been extensively used to describe solute transport in the swpp test gelhar and collins 1971 schroth and istok 2005 huang et al 2010 jung and pruess 2012 chen et al 2017 wang et al 2018 shi et al 2020 it may be valid only under specific circumstances wang et al 2018 2017 suk et al 2022 this limitation emerges because transient flow effects are inevitable when switching from the injection phase to the extraction phase when aquifer hydraulic diffusivities are not sufficiently large and at the beginning of the injection and extraction phases in particular wang et al 2017 reported that a non negligible difference in btcs between an swpp model based on fully transient flow i e a transient flow swpp model and an swpp model using piecewise steady state radial flow i e a piecewise steady state flow swpp model they found that this difference increased with increases in specific storage in the piecewise steady state flow model flow velocity does not gradually change over time during each phase of the swpp instead the flow velocity changes instantaneously without delay at each between phase transition thus the piecewise steady state flow swpp model presumes that the flow velocity is instantaneously established at a new steady state flow rate during each swpp phase in the piecewise steady state flow swpp model the flow velocity v r t can be expressed as q t 2 π r b θ gelhar and collins 1971 where q t is the injection chaser rest and extraction rate r is the distance from the well b is the aquifer thickness and θ is porosity during the injection and chaser phases the flow velocity v r becomes q 2 π r b θ because the injection rate q t is set to a constant value q which is the injection and chaser rate here without loss of generality the injection and chaser rates are assumed to be equal in this case the flow velocity at any location r is simply inversely proportional to r and proportional to a constant a q 2 π b θ next during the rest period q t 0 and thus the flow velocity v suddenly becomes 0 across the entire domain with no gradual change in velocity over time at the transition from the chaser period to the rest period finally during the extraction phase of q t q the flow velocity v r suddenly changes to q 2 π r b θ accordingly the flow velocity at any location r is inversely proportional to r and proportional to a new constant a q 2 π b θ with no gradual change in velocity over time therefore the flow velocity of the steady state flow swpp model is established for each new steady state flow rate during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases however the actual flow velocity gradually changes over time rather than instantaneously and suddenly when a transition from one phase to another occurs in the swpp no analytical solution has been previously described for the solute transport equation of swpp under fully transient flow piecewise steady state flow has been assumed in existing numerical models of swpp such as the models based on comsol li et al 2019 modflow mt3dms huang et al 2010 wang et al 2018 stomp istok et al 1999 schroth et al 2001 cassiani et al 2005 and pptest phanikumar and mcguire 2010 as well as the finite difference model established by hellerich et al 2003 notably few studies have developed finite difference models to simulate transport in the swpp test under a transient flow field vandenbohede et al 2008a b wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and vandenbohede et al 2008a b developed finite difference models for the swpp test under transient flow conditions however finite difference models might produce non negligible numerical errors particularly under advection dominated conditions the velocity distribution around the well shows that advection velocity is highest at the wellbore aquifer interface and decreases with increases in radial distance from the well although the numerical error could be decreased to a negligible level by increasing the grid resolution to achieve high resolution numerical simulation this process requires excessive computational effort accordingly accurate interpretation of swpp test results requires a more computationally efficient analytical solution rather than the numerical solution that considers a transient flow effect accurate interpretation also requires accurate parameter estimates for the swpp test under transient flow conditions which can be used as a reference to verify the numerical code in this study the swpp test contains four phases illustrated in fig 1 injection of a tracer into an aquifer at a constant injection rate q and constant injected concentration c i injection of a chaser at a constant injection rate q and constant injected concentration c c which is generally much smaller than c i the rest phase when the well is closed and the extraction phase with a constant extraction rate q and extracted concentration c t that varies over time but cannot be determined in advance first at the beginning of the injection phase of the test hydraulic head around the well increases from the initial head which is assumed to be constant fig 1a the tracer spreads in a radial manner around the well second the transition from the injection phase to the chaser phase further increases hydraulic head around the well until a quasi steady state is reached fig 1b here the chaser is used to push the tracer into the aquifer therefore the chaser c c is generally injected at a much lower concentration than the tracer c i and thus the chaser concentration around the well rapidly decreases third when transitioning from the chaser phase to the rest phase i e closing the well hydraulic head around the well decreases until the initial constant hydraulic head is reached fig 1c tracer and chaser around the well drift along a transient groundwater flow path fourth when transitioning from the rest phase to the extraction phase the hydraulic head around the well decreases prior to reaching a new quasi steady state fig 1d in the present study the concentration c t extracted from the aquifer during the extraction phase varies over time but cannot be determined in advance thus this concentration is treated as an unknown variable this study was performed with the assumption that no regional groundwater flow occurs moreover the injection well was assumed to fully penetrate a horizontal homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer of constant thickness accordingly heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifers and partially penetrating wells were not considered in this study an additional limitation was that the study did not consider skin effects around the well wellbore storage or the effect of mixing within the well however a major strength of the study was the ability of the proposed semi analytical solution to consider spatially and temporally variable radial flow induced by a constant injection chaser or extraction rate during the injection phase chaser phase or extraction phase respectively for the calculation of btcs or spatial concentration distributions in contrast previous analytical studies have solely considered spatially variable radial flow without temporal variation using a piecewise steady state groundwater flow assumption the purpose of this study was to develop a new semi analytical solution for solute transport in the swpp test under transient flow conditions without arbitrary assumptions regarding flow velocity thus facilitating the investigation of conditions under which the piecewise steady state flow swpp model causes erroneous btc or spatial concentration distributions in a transient flow state which may impact parameter estimation this semi analytical solution for solute transport in the swpp test is derived using the generalized integral transform technique gitt based on a transient groundwater flow equation that is solved according to the theis method rather than the steady state thiem method here the analytical solution to the transient groundwater flow equation for the swpp test was obtained through expansion of the generalized fourier series using the eigenfunction from a homogeneous helmholtz equation assuming eigenfunction orthogonality the verification of flow distribution was performed by comparison with an existing analytical solution kinzelbach 1986 constructed via superposition of the theis solution considering the change in flow velocity over time during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases at a single well the spatial concentration distributions determined using the new semi analytical solution were verified by comparison with the numerical solutions established by wang et al 2017 after disregarding the non darcian flow and the wellbore storage considered by wang et al 2017 the effects of aquifer flow properties and solute transport parameters on the btc during the extraction phase were investigated using the newly developed semi analytical solution in addition the comparison problem was included to show the superiority of the proposed semi analytical solution over the numerical solution of wang et al 2017 numerical errors tend to occur in highly heterogeneous media and strongly transient situations nevertheless very few analytical solutions are available to verify the numerical results for these complex situations tabrizinejadas et al 2020 a semi analytical solution was proposed for such complex situations furthermore using the proposed solution an attempt was made to explain the long tails of btcs in the transient flow field long tails of btcs have been observed in many tracer tests goldscheider et al 2003 goldscheider 2008 however the type curves of steady state flow models cannot explain why the observed btcs had long tails birk et al 2005 massei et al 2006 geyer et al 2007 göppert and goldscheider 2008 in this study the long tail of btcs were explained using a flow velocity field that gradually changed due to the aquifer storage in the transient flow 2 mathematical formulation to solve the radial advection dispersion reaction for solute transport during the swpp test in a transient state first the transient axisymmetric groundwater flow from the well in a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer system was determined 2 1

solve the radial advection dispersion reaction equation for solute transport during the swpp test in a transient flow state transient axisymmetric groundwater flow from the well was first solved to obtain the head distribution subsequently the advection velocity was calculated from the head distribution using darcy s law and the dispersion coefficient was obtained finally the advection velocity and dispersion coefficient were incorporated into eq 12a therefore the analytical solution of flow should be verified first followed by verification of the proposed semi analytical solution to solute transport in the swpp expressed in eq 22 for the first verification process derived analytical solutions for flow were compared with the analytical solution constructed over time for the injection chaser rest and extraction phases via superposition of the theis solution kinzelbach 1986 as demonstrated in eq 23 23 h r t h 0 1 4 π t i 1 3 q i q i 1 w s r 2 4 t t t i where h 0 is the initial head q i is the i the well discharge rate q 0 q 2 0 q 1 q q 3 q t 1 0 t 2 t c t 3 t r and w s r 2 4 t t t i is the well function of the theis solution to compare the proposed solution with the analytical solution constructed via superposition it is necessary to decide the appropriate domain length l to make sure that the proposed solution was obtained without boundary effect of dirichlet boundary condition the domain length l is recommended to be 2 25 t t e s kinzelbach 1986 in the second verification process the new semi analytical solution to solute transport was compared with the numerical solution of the one dimensional finite difference method 1dfdm described in supplementary section s2 because the exact analytical solution has not been obtained for solute transport during swpp testing under transient flow additionally the numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 was used to verify the proposed semi analytical solution of solute transport under transient flow after disregarding the non darcian flow and wellbore storage considered by wang et al 2017 3 1 comparison of the proposed solution with existing analytical and numerical solutions for the hydraulic head to verify the proposed analytical solution for groundwater flow described in eq 10 the following values were specified s 0 01 t 0 5 m2 day b 10 m θ 0 1 h 0 50 m q 1 m3 day t i 0 314 days t c 0 628 days t r 2 512 days t e 2 826 days and l 18 m the input conditions for the numerical simulation are specified as a well radius of r w 0 01 m δ t 1 0 10 8 6 3 10 3 days δ r 1 0 10 7 5 2 10 2 m and peclet number 1 0 10 7 5 2 10 2 the injection chaser rest and extraction schedule of the swpp test is provided in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the injection rates during the injection and chaser periods were maintained at 1 m3 day during the rest period injection was stopped during the extraction period the extraction rate was constant at 1 m3 day the analytical results for hydraulic head obtained using the proposed analytical solution were compared with the results of the existing analytical solution and numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 at various times as shown in fig 3 which depicts transient axisymmetric groundwater flow during an swpp test in a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer hydraulic head around the well rapidly increased after injection t 0 031 days from a constant initial head of 50 m then further increased from the end of the injection phase t 0 314 days to the end of the chaser phase t 0 628 days before reaching steady state flow based on the injection rate however after the rest phase hydraulic head greatly decreased around the well and continued to decrease until the end of the rest phase t 2 512 days before returning to the constant initial head value when the extraction phase began hydraulic head decreased around the well and continued to decrease until the end of the extraction phase t 2 826 days after which it reached a new steady state flow based on the extraction rate fig 3 illustrates groundwater flow changes over time during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases in contrast the spatial head distribution obtained under the piecewise steady state flow assumption during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases did not reflect such temporally varying flow behavior as shown in fig 3 notably fig 3 illustrates that the proposed analytical solution perfectly matches the analytical solution obtained via superposition moreover the proposed analytical solution shows good agreement with the numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 3 2 comparison of the proposed semi analytical solution with numerical solutions for solute transport to verify the proposed semi analytical solution for solute transport during the swpp the numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 and the numerical solution of 1dfdm described in supplementary section s2 were used a verification example was designed to describe solute transport during an swpp test under transient axisymmetric groundwater flow from a single well in a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer system as described in section 3 1 therefore all input parameters listed in section 3 1 are used here additional input parameters for the verification of solute transport are as follows k 0 4 days 1 r 1 α l 1 0 m c i 1 0 ppm and c c 0 01 ppm as shown in fig 4 from the injected concentration c i during the injection phase the solute concentration around the well continued to increase over time until the end of the injection phase t 0 314 d a y s however during the chaser phase the injected concentration c c was set to a value 100 fold smaller than c i resulting in a significant decrease in solute concentration around the well additionally the peak concentration migrated away from the injection well into the aquifer t 0 628 days because of the use of a chaser that pushed the tracer into the aquifer when injection was stopped during the rest period the solute concentration around the well continued to decrease until the end of the rest period t 2 512 days during the extraction period the solute migrated toward the extraction well such that the peak concentration moved toward the extraction well until the end of the extraction phase t 2 826 days as shown in fig 4 the spatial concentration distributions obtained using the proposed method showed good agreement with the numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 and the numerical solution of the 1dfdm over time during all phases injection chaser rest and extraction 4 results and discussion 4 1 differences between breakthrough curves under transient and piecewise steady state flow conditions to analyze radial transport behavior driven by advection dispersion and reaction in a radial flow field that diverges and converges via transient flow during the swpp test many researchers have used the groundwater flow fields described by simplified piecewise steady state equations to calculate the advection and dispersion terms in an advection dispersion reaction equation in contrast the differing impacts of transient flow on transport behavior were investigated during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases and compared with piecewise steady state flow using the mathematical model of groundwater flow presented in eq 4 both the transmissivity and storage coefficient can affect the flow field during the swpp test the flow field is also affected by the pumping rate and aquifer thickness in addition porosity affects pore velocity to illustrate all aquifer flow properties that affect the flow field using one dimensionless parameter suk et al 2022 introduced the dimensionless flow parameter β d π t θ b s q which is proportional to transmissivity aquifer thickness and porosity β d is inversely proportional to the storage coefficient and pumping rate as shown in eq 6 wang et al 2017 and suk et al 2022 found that the difference in btcs between a transient flow swpp model and a piecewise steady state flow swpp model increased with an increase in the storage coefficient because the storage coefficient is inversely proportional to β d suk et al 2022 found that a small value of the dimensionless parameter β d in eq 6 led to a large difference in btcs when obtained under conditions of steady state flow and conditions of transient flow in a diverging tracer test accordingly in this swpp study β d was used in a parametric analysis of the influence of transient flow on transport compared with piecewise steady state flow to determine the range of β d the hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient and porosity values of various aquifer media were summarized i e gravel sand silt clay sedimentary rock and crystalline rock domenico and schwartz 1990 heath 1983 morris and johnson 1967 and then the plausible range of β d was estimated to be 0 003 5 000 suk et al 2022 for this investigation values of β d 3 14 6 28 31 4 and 3 140 were used to illustrate various transient flow regimes according to the work of suk et al 2022 larger β d values represent conditions closer to steady state flow whereas smaller β d values indicate transient flow conditions the input parameters were as follows s 0 1 0 05 0 01 and 0 0001 t 0 5 m2 day b 2 m θ 0 1 k 0 4 days 1 α l 0 1 m c i 1 0 ppm c c 0 01 ppm q 1 m3 day t i 0 7 days t c 0 8 days t r 2 0 days t e 7 0 days and l 9 m fig 5 shows btcs at the extraction well r 0 01 m during the extraction phase for various values of β d for comparison the piecewise steady state flow swpp model used by wang et al 2017 is presented in fig 5 here wang et al 2017 obtained a piecewise steady state flow swpp model by inputting the velocities of steady state flow during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases rather than the transient flow velocities fig 5 shows that the btc of β d 3 140 is equal to the btc of piecewise steady state flow whereas the curves of β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 deviate from piecewise steady state flow the difference in btcs between the transient flow and piecewise steady state flow swpp tests was non negligible and increased with decreases in β d as β d decreases the peak concentration decreases and the plume slowly reaches the extraction well thus the rising limb of the btc becomes gentler and the receding limb drops more gently with decreases in β d this pattern can be explained based on the change in the flow velocity field at r 0 7 m from the pumping well over time as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the variations in flow velocity over time at r 0 7 m for various values of β d for comparison the analytical flow velocity in the piecewise steady state model is shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the flow velocity under piecewise steady state flow β d 3 140 instantaneously and suddenly changes in a stair step pattern whereas the flow velocities under transient flow β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 gradually change over time in particular as β d decreases the change in flow velocity over time becomes more gradual therefore the magnitude of flow velocity under piecewise steady state flow β d 3 140 is greatest during the injection chaser and extraction phases whereas it is smallest during the rest phase in contrast the magnitude of flow velocity under transient flow β d 3 14 is smallest during the injection chaser and extraction phases whereas it is largest in the rest phase in summary the magnitude of flow velocity is smaller at β d 3 14 than at β d 3 140 during the injection chaser and extraction phases but it is greater during the rest phase the differences in velocity between β d 3 14 and β d 3 140 lead to differences in plume migration between piecewise steady state flow and transient flow conditions moreover the differences in btcs between transient flow and piecewise steady state flow as shown in fig 5 can be explained in greater detail based on the differences in plume migration shown in fig 7 fig 7a d shows spatial concentration distributions during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases under various values of β d for comparison the spatial concentration distributions obtained from the piecewise steady state swpp model used by wang et al 2017 are shown in fig 7a d as shown in fig 7a the plume under steady state flow β d 3 140 migrates farther in the flow direction during the injection phase compared with plumes under transient flow conditions β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 this trend results from the achievement of peak flow velocity magnitude under steady state flow β d 3 140 during the injection phase as shown in fig 6 during the chaser phase the peak concentration under steady state flow is lower and the plume migrates farther in the flow direction compared with transient flow conditions as shown in fig 7b because of the above described flow velocity characteristics under steady state flow here the concentrations around the well significantly decreased because the concentration injected was 100 fold lower during the chaser phase than during the injection phase however in contrast to the injection and chaser phases during the rest phase the peak concentrations under transient flow β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 are lower and the plumes migrate farther in the flow direction than under steady state flow β d 3 140 as shown in fig 7c this difference emerges because the magnitudes of flow velocities are larger under transient flow conditions than under piecewise steady state flow during the rest phase as shown in fig 6 accordingly plumes under transient flows β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 migrate farther in the flow direction and are more dispersed reaching lower peak concentrations than under steady state flow β d 3 140 in the rest phase finally during the extraction phase the flow converges at the extraction well because the magnitude of velocity under piecewise steady state flow β d 3 140 is higher than the magnitudes of velocity under transient flows β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 as shown in fig 6 the plume with the higher peak concentration under piecewise steady state flow reaches the extraction well earlier whereas plumes with lower peak concentrations under transient flow conditions arrive later fig 7d generally as shown in fig 5 the peak of the btc is higher under piecewise steady state flow than under transient flow and the plume reaches the extraction well faster under piecewise steady state flow than under transient flow in summary as illustrated in fig 5 increases in β d cause the increasing and decreasing trends in btcs to become steeper therefore during the extraction phase the differences in btcs between piecewise steady state flow and transient flow conditions are non negligible when β d is small to quantify the error that could occur when using the piecewise steady state flow swpp model instead of the transient swpp model for parameter estimation the differences between the steady state flow btc of wang et al 2017 and transient flow btcs of the proposed semi analytical solution according to β d are summarized in table 1 as shown in table 1 the normalized root mean square error nrmse increased as β d decreased for β d 3 140 the nrmse was 0 009 whereas for β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 the nrmses were 0 590 0 375 and 0 093 respectively this indicated that the use of the piecewise steady state flow swpp model instead of the transient flow swpp model could result in the wrong parameter estimation at a low β d 4 2 effect of dispersivity on solute transport to determine how dispersivity affects btcs during the extraction phase under piecewise steady state flow and transient flow three α l values i e 0 04 0 01 and 0 4 m were used for simulation of plume migration under various α l conditions during steady state flow and transient flow a sufficiently large β d 3 140 was used to simulate steady state flow whereas a small β d 3 14 was used to simulate transient flow all other parameters were as described in section 4 1 as shown in fig 8 a the differences in btcs between β d 3 14 and β d 3 140 increase with decreases in α l in particular the btc peak concentration is much higher at α l 0 04 m and β d 3 140 than at α l 0 04 m and β d 3 14 moreover at α l 0 04 m the btc rising limb is steeper at β d 3 140 than at β d 3 14 in contrast at α l 0 4 m the difference in btc peak concentrations between β d 3 140 and β d 3 14 is smaller the difference in steepness of the btc rising limb is also smaller at β d 3 140 and β d 3 14 compared with α l 0 04 m accordingly α l affects the difference in btcs between piecewise steady state flow and transient flow in terms of the peak concentration and rising limb steepness these differences increase with decreases in α l therefore the parameter estimates obtained under small α l values with the piecewise steady state flow assumption might require cautious interpretation under the piecewise steady state flow assumption wang et al 2017 demonstrated that parameter estimation error may be non negligible dimensionless type curves are generally drawn to elaborate on parameter estimation welty and gelhar 1994 chen et al 2007 as shown in fig 8b the dimensionless type curves are prepared by plotting the normalized concentration c c peak against dimensionless time t d on a logarithmic scale where c peak is the peak concentration of the btc parametric estimation uses a curve matching technique that fits the observed btc to a dimensionless type curve for curve matching the field data plotted on log log axes are overlaid on the calculated type curves allowing parameter values to be estimated if most field data match the calculated type curve therefore the accuracy of the type curve is essential to parameter estimation however as shown in fig 8b the transient flow model β d 3 14 and the piecewise steady state flow model β d 3 140 yield very different type curves as shown in fig 8b the type curve of the transient flow model β d 3 14 has a longer tail than the type curve of the piecewise steady state flow model β d 3 140 regardless of α l because of the longer tail of the type curve for the transient flow model use of the piecewise steady state flow model rather than the transient flow swpp model might result in overestimation of dispersivity here long tails under transient flow appear to be characteristic of the type curves figs 5 and 8a illustrate that the gentle falling limbs under transient flow eventually produce long tails similar to the type curve presented in fig 8b as noted above under transient flow the falling limbs shown in figs 5 and 8a exhibit gentle changes because velocities during the extraction phase are lower than under steady state flow as shown in fig 6 additionally the long tails of the type curve under transient flow shown in fig 8b result from lower velocities during the extraction phase compared with steady state flow 4 3 performance comparison in the comparison problem a complex case dealing with sharper concentration distributions than the verification case was considered because very few analytical solutions were available to verify the numerical results for these complex situations tabrizinejadas et al 2020 to achieve this numerically intractable examples were devised that were numerically difficult to solve such as those requiring a very fine grid system or small time steps for convergence here to show that the semi analytical method could provide accurate solutions in a very efficient manner when the numerical code of wang et al 2017 failed to produce an accurate solution due to numerical diffusion and numerical oscillation errors in a certain situation a scenario example that considered solute transport in an advection dominated regime under rapidly changing flow conditions was used the input parameters used in this example are listed in table 2 to demonstrate the effect of grid size on numerical concentration numerical solutions were obtained using coarse and fine grid systems as shown in table 2 as shown in fig 9 when the dispersivity α l was 0 1 m the numerical solutions of wang et al 2017 and the proposed semi analytical solutions aligned well regardless of the grid system used however when it was 0 01 m the numerical solution in the coarse grid system was not accurate due to the severe numerical dispersion in contrast the numerical solution in the fine grid system had better agreement with the proposed semi analytical solution although the numerical solution obtained using the fine grid system appeared to be accurate a comparison of the numerical solution against the semi analytical solution in terms of cpu time on a pc with an intel core i7 10510u cpu processor 1 8 ghz 1 6 mb cache showed that the numerical method was very inefficient and incurred enormous computational costs compared to the proposed analytical solution with 3 764 and 8 s required to obtain numerical solutions using the fine grid and proposed semi analytical solution respectively as shown in table 2 therefore the proposed semi analytical solution had marked advantages over the numerical method of wang et al 2017 in terms of computational efficiency especially in this case of an advection dominated regime and rapidly changing flow conditions 5 summary and conclusions the swpp test can be used to estimate the in situ dispersivity porosity and chemical reaction rates of aquifers thus far the swpp test has been extensively used to determine in situ values of these parameters compared with multi well tests the advantages of the swpp test include easier operation lower cost and greater efficiency however in many previous studies analytical solutions to the swpp test have been based on the piecewise steady state flow assumption in the present study a new semi analytical solution for the swpp test was proposed based on a transient flow theory to investigate conditions under which the difference in solutions between the piecewise steady state flow swpp model and transient flow swpp model is large this causes the piecewise steady state flow swpp model to return an erroneous btc spatial distribution or type curve under transient flow leading to incorrect parameter estimation with the proposed solution the difference in btcs between the transient flow swpp model and the piecewise steady state flow swpp model was non negligible and this difference increased with decreases in β d in the extraction well the rising limb of the btc under piecewise steady state flow becomes steeper and the receding limb drops more steeply compared with transient flow as dispersivity decreases the difference in btcs between piecewise steady state flow and transient flow increases because of changes in the peak concentration and rising limb steepness therefore parameter estimates obtained under small dispersivity values with the piecewise steady state flow assumption might require careful consideration furthermore in terms of the curve matching technique for parameter estimation the transient flow model and piecewise steady state flow model exhibit very different type curves such that the type curve of the transient flow model has a longer tail because of the longer tails of type curves obtained with the transient flow model use of the piecewise steady state flow model rather than the transient flow swpp model for dispersivity estimation may result in the overestimation of dispersivity a numerical solution under a transient flow was developed by wang et al 2017 for such a complex transient flow condition however numerical errors in the numerical method tend to occur in highly heterogeneous media and under strongly transient situations unfortunately very few analytical solutions are available to verify the numerical results for these complex situations tabrizinejadas et al 2020 thus the proposed semi analytical solution describing solute transport in spatially and temporally variable radial flows is necessary for numerical code verification and comparison as well as for the estimation of transport parameters the proposed semi analytical solution provides a useful tool for curve fitting in the extraction phase of parameter estimation when the influence of transient flow is significant the proposed semi analytical solution could serve as a

1989,the single well push pull swpp test has been extensively used in parameter estimation models numerous analytical solutions to the problem are available all of which consider solute transport in a non uniform flow field from steady radial flow created by the swpp test however the non uniform flow velocity is based on the thiem equation and varies in a spatial manner rather than a temporal manner no analytical solution has been previously described for the solute transport equation of swpp under fully transient flow in this study the generalized integral transform technique gitt was used to develop a new semi analytical solution for solute transport in the swpp test under fully transient flow four phases of the swpp test were included injection chaser rest and extraction with the proposed solution the differences between a transient flow swpp model solution and a piecewise steady state flow swpp model solution were non negligible such differences increased with decreases in the dimensionless parameter related to aquifer flow properties which is proportional to transmissivity aquifer thickness and porosity but inversely proportional to the storage coefficient and pumping rate additionally long tails of btcs are characteristic of type curves under the transient flow model the long tails of btcs under transient flow could result in overestimation of dispersivity if the swpp model uses piecewise steady state flow rather than transient flow for parameter estimation the proposed semi analytical solution provides a useful tool for curve fitting during parameter estimation when the effects of transient flow are significant the proposed solution can also serve as a performance comparison for testing numerical solutions to the swpp test keywords generalized integral transform technique gitt long tailed type curve semi analytical solution single well push pull swpp test transient flow condition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the single well push pull swpp test has been extensively used to estimate transport parameters such as porosity dispersivity and reaction rates gelhar and collins 1971 hall et al 1991 istok et al 1997 1999 schroth et al 1998 2001 schroth and istok 2006 cassiani et al 2005 haggerty et al 1998 snodgrass and kitanidis 1998 mcguire et al 2002 boisson et al 2013 kruisdijk and van breukelen 2021 this test involves the injection of a tracer followed by push drift and pumping of a single well the parameters can be obtained by fitting the observed breakthrough curves btcs to type curves that are calculated using a mathematical model when accurate parameter estimates are sought there is a need for an accurate analytical model that considers important processes associated with the swpp test there are many analytical and numerical solutions for the swpp test for example huang et al 2010 obtained an exact analytical solution to the swpp test by considering a partially penetrating well in a homogeneous confined aquifer whereas gelhar and collins 1971 and chen et al 2017 developed an analytical solution for the swpp test in a fully penetrated well wang et al 2018 and shi et al 2020 developed a new semi analytical solution by considering the wellbore mixing effect during both the injection and extraction phases wang et al 2020 derived a new semi analytical solution that considers both mixing and aquitard effects in four stages injection chaser rest and extraction notably all of these analytical solutions have been developed under the assumption that the flow field is non uniform and steady radial flow occurs during the swpp test here the non uniform flow velocity is based on the thiem equation where the flow velocity is inversely proportional to radial distance from the well and varies in a spatial manner rather than a temporal manner although such an assumption has been extensively used to describe solute transport in the swpp test gelhar and collins 1971 schroth and istok 2005 huang et al 2010 jung and pruess 2012 chen et al 2017 wang et al 2018 shi et al 2020 it may be valid only under specific circumstances wang et al 2018 2017 suk et al 2022 this limitation emerges because transient flow effects are inevitable when switching from the injection phase to the extraction phase when aquifer hydraulic diffusivities are not sufficiently large and at the beginning of the injection and extraction phases in particular wang et al 2017 reported that a non negligible difference in btcs between an swpp model based on fully transient flow i e a transient flow swpp model and an swpp model using piecewise steady state radial flow i e a piecewise steady state flow swpp model they found that this difference increased with increases in specific storage in the piecewise steady state flow model flow velocity does not gradually change over time during each phase of the swpp instead the flow velocity changes instantaneously without delay at each between phase transition thus the piecewise steady state flow swpp model presumes that the flow velocity is instantaneously established at a new steady state flow rate during each swpp phase in the piecewise steady state flow swpp model the flow velocity v r t can be expressed as q t 2 π r b θ gelhar and collins 1971 where q t is the injection chaser rest and extraction rate r is the distance from the well b is the aquifer thickness and θ is porosity during the injection and chaser phases the flow velocity v r becomes q 2 π r b θ because the injection rate q t is set to a constant value q which is the injection and chaser rate here without loss of generality the injection and chaser rates are assumed to be equal in this case the flow velocity at any location r is simply inversely proportional to r and proportional to a constant a q 2 π b θ next during the rest period q t 0 and thus the flow velocity v suddenly becomes 0 across the entire domain with no gradual change in velocity over time at the transition from the chaser period to the rest period finally during the extraction phase of q t q the flow velocity v r suddenly changes to q 2 π r b θ accordingly the flow velocity at any location r is inversely proportional to r and proportional to a new constant a q 2 π b θ with no gradual change in velocity over time therefore the flow velocity of the steady state flow swpp model is established for each new steady state flow rate during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases however the actual flow velocity gradually changes over time rather than instantaneously and suddenly when a transition from one phase to another occurs in the swpp no analytical solution has been previously described for the solute transport equation of swpp under fully transient flow piecewise steady state flow has been assumed in existing numerical models of swpp such as the models based on comsol li et al 2019 modflow mt3dms huang et al 2010 wang et al 2018 stomp istok et al 1999 schroth et al 2001 cassiani et al 2005 and pptest phanikumar and mcguire 2010 as well as the finite difference model established by hellerich et al 2003 notably few studies have developed finite difference models to simulate transport in the swpp test under a transient flow field vandenbohede et al 2008a b wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and vandenbohede et al 2008a b developed finite difference models for the swpp test under transient flow conditions however finite difference models might produce non negligible numerical errors particularly under advection dominated conditions the velocity distribution around the well shows that advection velocity is highest at the wellbore aquifer interface and decreases with increases in radial distance from the well although the numerical error could be decreased to a negligible level by increasing the grid resolution to achieve high resolution numerical simulation this process requires excessive computational effort accordingly accurate interpretation of swpp test results requires a more computationally efficient analytical solution rather than the numerical solution that considers a transient flow effect accurate interpretation also requires accurate parameter estimates for the swpp test under transient flow conditions which can be used as a reference to verify the numerical code in this study the swpp test contains four phases illustrated in fig 1 injection of a tracer into an aquifer at a constant injection rate q and constant injected concentration c i injection of a chaser at a constant injection rate q and constant injected concentration c c which is generally much smaller than c i the rest phase when the well is closed and the extraction phase with a constant extraction rate q and extracted concentration c t that varies over time but cannot be determined in advance first at the beginning of the injection phase of the test hydraulic head around the well increases from the initial head which is assumed to be constant fig 1a the tracer spreads in a radial manner around the well second the transition from the injection phase to the chaser phase further increases hydraulic head around the well until a quasi steady state is reached fig 1b here the chaser is used to push the tracer into the aquifer therefore the chaser c c is generally injected at a much lower concentration than the tracer c i and thus the chaser concentration around the well rapidly decreases third when transitioning from the chaser phase to the rest phase i e closing the well hydraulic head around the well decreases until the initial constant hydraulic head is reached fig 1c tracer and chaser around the well drift along a transient groundwater flow path fourth when transitioning from the rest phase to the extraction phase the hydraulic head around the well decreases prior to reaching a new quasi steady state fig 1d in the present study the concentration c t extracted from the aquifer during the extraction phase varies over time but cannot be determined in advance thus this concentration is treated as an unknown variable this study was performed with the assumption that no regional groundwater flow occurs moreover the injection well was assumed to fully penetrate a horizontal homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer of constant thickness accordingly heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifers and partially penetrating wells were not considered in this study an additional limitation was that the study did not consider skin effects around the well wellbore storage or the effect of mixing within the well however a major strength of the study was the ability of the proposed semi analytical solution to consider spatially and temporally variable radial flow induced by a constant injection chaser or extraction rate during the injection phase chaser phase or extraction phase respectively for the calculation of btcs or spatial concentration distributions in contrast previous analytical studies have solely considered spatially variable radial flow without temporal variation using a piecewise steady state groundwater flow assumption the purpose of this study was to develop a new semi analytical solution for solute transport in the swpp test under transient flow conditions without arbitrary assumptions regarding flow velocity thus facilitating the investigation of conditions under which the piecewise steady state flow swpp model causes erroneous btc or spatial concentration distributions in a transient flow state which may impact parameter estimation this semi analytical solution for solute transport in the swpp test is derived using the generalized integral transform technique gitt based on a transient groundwater flow equation that is solved according to the theis method rather than the steady state thiem method here the analytical solution to the transient groundwater flow equation for the swpp test was obtained through expansion of the generalized fourier series using the eigenfunction from a homogeneous helmholtz equation assuming eigenfunction orthogonality the verification of flow distribution was performed by comparison with an existing analytical solution kinzelbach 1986 constructed via superposition of the theis solution considering the change in flow velocity over time during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases at a single well the spatial concentration distributions determined using the new semi analytical solution were verified by comparison with the numerical solutions established by wang et al 2017 after disregarding the non darcian flow and the wellbore storage considered by wang et al 2017 the effects of aquifer flow properties and solute transport parameters on the btc during the extraction phase were investigated using the newly developed semi analytical solution in addition the comparison problem was included to show the superiority of the proposed semi analytical solution over the numerical solution of wang et al 2017 numerical errors tend to occur in highly heterogeneous media and strongly transient situations nevertheless very few analytical solutions are available to verify the numerical results for these complex situations tabrizinejadas et al 2020 a semi analytical solution was proposed for such complex situations furthermore using the proposed solution an attempt was made to explain the long tails of btcs in the transient flow field long tails of btcs have been observed in many tracer tests goldscheider et al 2003 goldscheider 2008 however the type curves of steady state flow models cannot explain why the observed btcs had long tails birk et al 2005 massei et al 2006 geyer et al 2007 göppert and goldscheider 2008 in this study the long tail of btcs were explained using a flow velocity field that gradually changed due to the aquifer storage in the transient flow 2 mathematical formulation to solve the radial advection dispersion reaction for solute transport during the swpp test in a transient state first the transient axisymmetric groundwater flow from the well in a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer system was determined 2 1

solve the radial advection dispersion reaction equation for solute transport during the swpp test in a transient flow state transient axisymmetric groundwater flow from the well was first solved to obtain the head distribution subsequently the advection velocity was calculated from the head distribution using darcy s law and the dispersion coefficient was obtained finally the advection velocity and dispersion coefficient were incorporated into eq 12a therefore the analytical solution of flow should be verified first followed by verification of the proposed semi analytical solution to solute transport in the swpp expressed in eq 22 for the first verification process derived analytical solutions for flow were compared with the analytical solution constructed over time for the injection chaser rest and extraction phases via superposition of the theis solution kinzelbach 1986 as demonstrated in eq 23 23 h r t h 0 1 4 π t i 1 3 q i q i 1 w s r 2 4 t t t i where h 0 is the initial head

condition the domain length l is recommended to be 2 25 t t e s kinzelbach 1986 in the second verification process the new semi analytical solution to solute transport was compared with the numerical solution of the one dimensional finite difference method 1dfdm described in supplementary section s2 because the exact analytical solution has not been obtained for solute transport during swpp testing under transient flow additionally the numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 was used to verify the proposed semi analytical solution of solute transport under transient flow after disregarding the non darcian flow and wellbore storage considered by wang et al 2017 3 1 comparison of the proposed solution with existing analytical and numerical solutions for the hydraulic head to

number 1 0 10 7 5 2 10 2 the injection chaser rest and extraction schedule of the swpp test is provided in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the injection rates during the injection and chaser periods were maintained at 1 m3 day during the rest period injection was stopped during the extraction period the extraction rate was constant at 1 m3 day the analytical results for hydraulic head obtained using the proposed analytical solution were compared with the results of the existing analytical solution and numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 at various times as shown in fig 3 which depicts transient axisymmetric groundwater flow during an swpp test in a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer hydraulic head around the well rapidly increased after injection t 0 031 days from a constant initial head of 50 m then further increased from the end of the injection phase t 0 314 days to the end of the chaser phase t 0 628 days before reaching steady state flow based on the injection rate however after the rest phase hydraulic head greatly decreased around the well and continued to decrease until the end of the rest phase t 2 512 days before returning to the constant initial head value when the extraction phase began hydraulic head decreased around the well and continued to decrease until the end of the extraction phase t 2 826 days after which it reached a new steady state flow based on the extraction rate fig 3 illustrates groundwater flow changes over time during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases in contrast the spatial head distribution obtained under the piecewise steady state flow assumption during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases did not reflect such temporally varying flow behavior as shown in fig 3 notably fig 3 illustrates that the proposed analytical solution perfectly matches the analytical solution obtained via superposition moreover the proposed analytical solution shows good agreement with the numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 3 2 comparison of the proposed semi analytical solution with numerical solutions for solute transport to verify the proposed semi analytical solution for solute transport during the swpp the numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 and the numerical solution of 1dfdm described in supplementary section s2 were used a verification example was designed to describe solute transport during an swpp test under transient axisymmetric groundwater flow from a single well in a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer system as described in section 3 1 therefore all input parameters listed in section 3 1 are used here additional input parameters for the verification of solute transport are as follows k 0 4 days 1 r 1 α l 1 0 m c i 1 0 ppm and c c 0 01 ppm as shown in fig 4 from the injected concentration c i during the injection phase the solute concentration around the well continued to increase over time until the end of the injection phase t 0 314 d a y s however during the chaser phase the injected concentration c c was set to a value 100 fold smaller than c i resulting in a significant decrease in solute concentration around the well additionally the peak concentration migrated away from the injection well into the aquifer t 0 628 days because of the use of a chaser that pushed the tracer into the aquifer when injection was stopped during the rest period the solute concentration around the well continued to decrease until the end of the rest period t 2 512 days during the extraction period the solute migrated toward the extraction well such that the peak concentration moved toward the extraction well until the end of the extraction phase t 2 826 days as shown in fig 4 the spatial concentration distributions obtained using the proposed method showed good agreement with the numerical solution reported by wang et al 2017 and the numerical solution of the 1dfdm over time during all phases injection chaser rest and extraction 4 results and discussion 4 1 differences between breakthrough curves under transient and piecewise steady state flow conditions to analyze radial transport behavior driven by advection dispersion and reaction in a radial flow field that diverges and converges via transient flow during the swpp test many researchers have used the groundwater flow fields described by simplified piecewise steady state equations to calculate the advection and dispersion terms in an advection dispersion reaction equation in contrast the differing impacts of transient flow on transport behavior were investigated during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases and compared with piecewise steady state flow using the mathematical model of groundwater flow presented in eq 4 both the transmissivity and storage coefficient can affect the flow field during the swpp test the flow field is also affected by the pumping rate and aquifer thickness in addition porosity affects pore velocity to illustrate all aquifer flow properties that affect the flow field using one dimensionless parameter suk et al 2022 introduced the dimensionless flow parameter β d π t θ b s q which is proportional to transmissivity aquifer thickness and porosity β d is inversely proportional to the storage coefficient and pumping rate as shown in eq 6 wang et al 2017 and suk et al 2022 found that the difference in btcs between a transient flow swpp model and a piecewise steady state flow swpp model increased with an increase in the storage coefficient because the storage coefficient is inversely proportional to β d suk et al 2022 found that a small value of the dimensionless parameter β d in eq 6 led to a large difference in btcs when obtained under conditions of steady state flow and conditions of transient flow in a diverging tracer test accordingly in this swpp study β d was used in a parametric analysis of the influence of transient flow on transport compared with piecewise steady state flow to determine the range of β d the hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient and porosity values of various aquifer media were summarized i e gravel sand silt clay sedimentary rock and crystalline rock domenico and schwartz 1990 heath 1983 morris and johnson 1967 and then the plausible range of β d was estimated to be 0 003 5 000 suk et al 2022 for this investigation values of β d 3 14 6 28 31 4 and 3 140 were used to illustrate various transient flow regimes according to the work of suk et al 2022 larger β d values represent conditions closer to steady state flow whereas smaller β d values indicate transient flow conditions the input parameters were as follows s 0 1 0 05 0 01 and 0 0001 t 0 5 m2 day b 2 m θ 0 1 k 0 4 days 1 α l 0 1 m c i 1 0 ppm c c 0 01 ppm q 1 m3 day t i 0 7 days t c 0 8 days t r 2 0 days t e 7 0 days and l 9 m fig 5 shows btcs at the extraction well r 0 01 m during the extraction phase for various values of β d for comparison the piecewise steady state flow swpp model used by wang et al 2017 is presented in fig 5 here wang et al 2017 obtained a piecewise steady state flow swpp model by inputting the velocities of steady state flow during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases rather than the transient flow velocities fig 5 shows that the btc of β d 3 140 is equal to the btc of piecewise steady state flow whereas the curves of β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 deviate from piecewise steady state flow the difference in btcs between the transient flow and piecewise steady state flow swpp tests was non negligible and increased with decreases in β d as β d decreases the peak concentration decreases and the plume slowly reaches the extraction well thus the rising limb of the btc becomes gentler and the receding limb drops more gently with decreases in β d this pattern can be explained based on the change in the flow velocity field at r 0 7 m from the pumping well over time as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the variations in flow velocity over time at r 0 7 m for various values of β d for comparison the analytical flow velocity in the piecewise steady state model is shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the flow velocity under piecewise steady state flow β d 3 140 instantaneously and suddenly changes in a stair step pattern whereas the flow velocities under transient flow β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 gradually change over time in particular as β d decreases the change in flow velocity over time becomes more gradual therefore the magnitude of flow velocity under piecewise steady state flow β d 3 140 is greatest during the injection chaser and extraction phases whereas it is smallest during the rest phase in contrast the magnitude of flow velocity under transient flow β d 3 14 is smallest during the injection chaser and extraction phases whereas it is largest in the rest phase in summary the magnitude of flow velocity is smaller at β d 3 14 than at β d 3 140 during the injection chaser and extraction phases but it is greater during the rest phase the differences in velocity between β d 3 14 and β d 3 140 lead to differences in plume migration between piecewise steady state flow and transient flow conditions moreover the differences in btcs between transient flow and piecewise steady state flow as shown in fig 5 can be explained in greater detail based on the differences in plume migration shown in fig 7 fig 7a d shows spatial concentration distributions during the injection chaser rest and extraction phases under various values of β d for comparison the spatial concentration distributions obtained from the piecewise steady state swpp model used by wang et al 2017 are shown in fig 7a d as shown in fig 7a the plume under steady state flow β d 3 140 migrates farther in the flow direction during the injection phase compared with plumes under transient flow conditions β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 this trend results from the achievement of peak flow velocity magnitude under steady state flow β d 3 140 during the injection phase as shown in fig 6 during the chaser phase the peak concentration under steady state flow is lower and the plume migrates farther in the flow direction compared with transient flow conditions as shown in fig 7b because of the above described flow velocity characteristics under steady state flow here the concentrations around the well significantly decreased because the concentration injected was 100 fold lower during the chaser phase than during the injection phase however in contrast to the injection and chaser phases during the rest phase the peak concentrations under transient flow β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 are lower and the plumes migrate farther in the flow direction than under steady state flow β d 3 140 as shown in fig 7c this difference emerges because the magnitudes of flow velocities are larger under transient flow conditions than under piecewise steady state flow during the rest phase as shown in fig 6 accordingly plumes under transient flows β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 migrate farther in the flow direction and are more dispersed reaching lower peak concentrations than under steady state flow β d 3 140 in the rest phase finally during the extraction phase the flow converges at the extraction well because the magnitude of velocity under piecewise steady state flow β d 3 140 is higher than the magnitudes of velocity under transient flows β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 as shown in fig 6 the plume with the higher peak concentration under piecewise steady state flow reaches the extraction well earlier whereas plumes with lower peak concentrations under transient flow conditions arrive later fig 7d generally as shown in fig 5 the peak of the btc is higher under piecewise steady state flow than under transient flow and the plume reaches the extraction well faster under piecewise steady state flow than under transient flow in summary as illustrated in fig 5 increases in β d cause the increasing and decreasing trends in btcs to become steeper therefore during the extraction phase the differences in btcs between piecewise steady state flow and transient flow conditions are non negligible when β d is small to quantify the error that could occur when using the piecewise steady state flow swpp model instead of the transient swpp model for parameter estimation the differences between the steady state flow btc of wang et al 2017 and transient flow btcs of the proposed semi analytical solution according to β d are summarized in table 1 as shown in table 1 the normalized root mean square error nrmse increased as β d decreased for β d 3 140 the nrmse was 0 009 whereas for β d 3 14 6 28 and 31 4 the nrmses were 0 590 0 375 and 0 093 respectively this indicated that the use of the piecewise steady state flow swpp model instead of the transient flow swpp model could result in the wrong parameter estimation at a low β d 4 2 effect of dispersivity on solute transport to determine how dispersivity affects btcs during the extraction phase under piecewise steady state flow and transient flow three α l values i e 0 04 0 01 and 0 4 m were used for simulation of plume migration under various α l conditions during steady state flow and transient flow a sufficiently large β d 3 140 was used to simulate steady state flow whereas a small β d 3 14 was used to simulate transient flow all other parameters were as described in section 4 1 as shown in fig 8 a the differences in btcs between β d 3 14 and β d 3 140 increase with decreases in α l in particular the btc peak concentration is much higher at α l 0 04 m and β d 3 140 than at α l 0 04 m and β d 3 14 moreover at α l 0 04 m the btc rising limb is steeper at β d 3 140 than at β d 3 14 in contrast at α l 0 4 m the difference in btc peak concentrations between β d 3 140 and β d 3 14 is smaller the difference in steepness of the btc rising limb is also smaller at β d 3 140 and β d 3 14 compared with α l 0 04 m accordingly α l affects the difference in btcs between piecewise steady state flow and transient flow in terms of the peak concentration and rising limb steepness these differences increase with decreases in α l therefore the parameter estimates obtained under small α l values with the piecewise steady state flow assumption might require cautious interpretation under the piecewise steady state flow assumption wang et al 2017 demonstrated that parameter estimation error may be non negligible dimensionless type curves are generally drawn to elaborate on parameter estimation welty and gelhar 1994 chen et al 2007 as shown in fig 8b the dimensionless type curves are prepared by plotting the normalized concentration c c peak against dimensionless time t d on a logarithmic scale where c peak is the peak concentration of the btc parametric estimation uses a curve matching technique that fits the observed btc to a dimensionless type curve for curve matching the field data plotted on log log axes are overlaid on the calculated type curves allowing parameter values to be estimated if most field data match the calculated type curve therefore the accuracy of the type curve is essential to parameter estimation however as shown in fig 8b the transient flow model β d 3 14 and the piecewise steady state flow model β d 3 140 yield very different type curves as shown in fig 8b the type curve of the transient flow model β d 3 14 has a longer tail than the type curve of the piecewise steady state flow model β d 3 140 regardless of α l because of the longer tail of the type curve for the transient flow model use of the piecewise steady state flow model rather than the transient flow swpp model might result in overestimation of dispersivity here long tails under transient flow appear to be characteristic of the type curves figs 5 and 8a illustrate that the gentle falling limbs under transient flow eventually produce long tails similar to the type curve presented in fig 8b as noted above under transient flow the falling limbs shown in figs 5 and 8a exhibit gentle changes because velocities during the extraction phase are lower than under steady state flow as shown in fig 6 additionally the long tails of the type curve under transient flow shown in fig 8b result from lower velocities during the extraction phase compared with steady state flow 4 3 performance comparison in the comparison problem a complex case dealing with sharper concentration distributions than the verification case was considered because very few analytical solutions were available to verify the numerical results for these complex situations tabrizinejadas et al 2020 to achieve this numerically intractable examples were devised that were numerically difficult to solve such as those requiring a very fine grid system or small time steps for convergence here to show that the semi analytical method could provide accurate solutions in a very efficient manner when the numerical code of wang et al 2017 failed to produce an accurate solution due to numerical diffusion and numerical oscillation errors in a certain situation a scenario example that considered solute transport in an advection dominated regime under rapidly changing flow conditions was used the input parameters used in this example are listed in table 2 to demonstrate the effect of grid size on numerical concentration numerical solutions were obtained using coarse and fine grid systems as shown in table 2 as shown in fig 9 when the dispersivity α l was 0 1 m the numerical solutions of wang et al 2017 and the proposed semi analytical solutions aligned well regardless of the grid system used however when it was 0 01 m the numerical solution in the coarse grid system was not accurate due to the severe numerical dispersion in contrast the numerical solution in the fine grid system had better agreement with the proposed semi analytical solution although the numerical solution obtained using the fine grid system appeared to be accurate a comparison of the numerical solution against the semi analytical solution in terms of cpu time on a pc with an intel core i7 10510u cpu processor 1 8 ghz 1 6 mb cache showed that the numerical method was very inefficient and incurred enormous computational costs compared to the proposed analytical solution with 3 764 and 8 s required to obtain numerical solutions using the fine grid and proposed semi analytical solution respectively as shown in table 2 therefore the proposed semi analytical solution had marked advantages over the numerical method of wang et al 2017 in terms of computational efficiency especially in this case of an advection dominated regime and rapidly changing flow conditions 5 summary and conclusions the swpp test can be used to estimate the in situ dispersivity porosity and chemical reaction rates of aquifers thus far the swpp test has been extensively used to determine in situ values of these parameters compared with multi well tests the advantages of the swpp test include easier operation lower cost and greater efficiency however in many previous studies analytical solutions to the swpp test have been based on the piecewise steady state flow assumption in the present study a new semi analytical solution for the swpp test was proposed based on a transient flow theory to investigate conditions under which the difference in solutions between the piecewise steady state flow swpp model and transient flow swpp model is large this causes the piecewise steady state flow swpp model to return an erroneous btc spatial distribution or type curve under transient flow leading to incorrect parameter estimation with the proposed solution the difference in btcs between the transient flow swpp model and the piecewise steady state flow swpp model was non negligible and this difference increased with decreases in β d in the extraction well the rising limb of the btc under piecewise steady state flow becomes steeper and the receding limb drops more steeply compared with transient flow as dispersivity decreases the difference in btcs between piecewise steady state flow and transient flow increases because of changes in the peak concentration and rising limb steepness therefore parameter estimates obtained under small dispersivity values with the piecewise steady state flow assumption might require careful consideration furthermore in terms of the curve matching technique for parameter estimation the transient flow model and piecewise steady state flow model exhibit very different type curves such that the type curve of the transient flow model has a longer tail because of the longer tails of type curves obtained with the transient flow model use of the piecewise steady state flow model rather than the transient flow swpp model for dispersivity estimation may result in the overestimation of dispersivity a numerical solution under a transient flow was developed by wang et al 2017 for such a complex transient flow condition however numerical errors in the numerical method tend to occur in highly heterogeneous media and under strongly transient situations unfortunately very few analytical solutions are available to verify the numerical results for these complex situations tabrizinejadas et al 2020 thus the proposed semi analytical solution describing solute transport in spatially and temporally variable radial flows is necessary for numerical code verification and comparison as well as for the estimation of transport parameters the proposed semi analytical solution provides a useful tool for curve fitting in the extraction phase of parameter estimation when the influence of transient flow is significant the proposed semi analytical solution could serve as a
