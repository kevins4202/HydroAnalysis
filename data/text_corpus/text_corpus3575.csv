17875,iron sulphides mainly in the form of mackinawite fes pyrrhotite fe1 xs x 0 0 125 and pyrite fes2 are the most abundant sulphide minerals and can be oxidized under anoxic and circumneutral ph conditions by chemoautotrophic denitrifying bacteria to reduce nitrate to n2 iron sulphides mediated autotrophic denitrification isad represents an important natural attenuation process of nitrate pollution and plays a pivotal role in linking nitrogen sulphur and iron cycles in a variety of anoxic environments recently it has emerged as a promising bioprocess for nutrient removal from various organic deficient water and wastewater due to its specific advantages including high denitrification capacity simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal self buffering properties and fewer by

microbial diversity its natural occurrence and engineering applications its potential and limitations are elucidated by summarizing the key influencing factors including availability of iron sulphides low denitrification rates sulphate emission and leaching heavy metals this review also put forward two key questions in the mechanism of anoxic iron sulphides oxidation i e dissolution of iron

wastewater treatment neo green is proposed which can potentially harness bioenergy in wastewater incorporate resources p and fe recovery achieve simultaneous nutrient and emerging contaminants removal and minimize waste sludge production graphical abstract image 1 keywords autotrophic denitrification groundwater remediation iron sulphides phosphorus recovery sulphur oxidizing denitrification sod sludge minimization 1 introduction due to growing anthropogenic sources agricultural fertilizers wastewaters nitrate no3 pollution has become one of the most significant water quality issues ashok and hait 2015 kiskira et al 2017 one consequence of nitrate pollution is the threat to drinking water supply it is not uncommon for the groundwater nitrate level to exceed the drinking water standards 50 mg no3 l or 11 3 mg no3 n l torrentó et al 2010 which severely impacts the water supply strategies worldwide kanaparthi and conrad 2015 roques et al 2018 another international issue is that elevated nitrate levels can cause many adverse effects such as eutrophication harmful algal bloom hypoxia increased n2o emission and habitat deterioration ashok and hait 2015 therefore nitrate contamination must be under substantial control to prevent its public health and environmental impacts the most popular method for nitrate removal from water is heterotrophic denitrification heterotrophic denitrification is very efficient if there are sufficient organic carbon sources otherwise like in groundwater organic lacking wastewaters efficient nitrate removal is difficult to achieve via this process li et al 2013b adding an extraneous organic carbon source e g methanol ethanol etc is expensive and could lead to secondary pollution chung et al 2014 heterotrophic denitrification also produces large amounts of excess sludge which requires costly treatment and disposal tong et al 2018 nitrate removal can also be achieved by autotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification is conducted by chemolithotrophic denitrifiers which use inorganics as electron donors to reduce nitrate to n2 di capua et al 2015 major merits of autotrophic denitrification are 1 exclusion of organic carbon source which reduces the cost and the risk of secondary contamination and 2 very low cell yield which minimizes sludge handling zhou et al 2011 therefore autotrophic denitrification is an attractive option for nitrate removal from organic deficient water and wastewaters to date autotrophic denitrification can be divided into three major categories based on the electron donors zhou et al 2011 1 hydrogen based process in which h2 serves as the electron donor 2 sulphur iron based processes in which various forms of reduced sulphur and iron compounds e g elemental sulphur thiosulfate zero valent iron ferrous etc are utilized as the electron donor and 3 anammox process which employs anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria to transform nh4 and no2 to n2 due to their low cost ease of use and satisfactory denitrification performance sulphur iron based denitrification processes have attracted increasing interest ashok and hait 2015 kiskira et al 2017 shao et al 2010 naturally as a major source for both sulphur and iron in nature iron sulphides have been recently proposed as a potential electron source for autotrophic denitrification kiskira et al 2017 tong et al 2017a 2017b iron sulphides refer to a series of minerals composed of reduced sulphur and iron including mackinawite fes tetragonal troilite fes hexagonal pyrrhotite fe1 xs x 0 0 125 greigite fe3s4 cubic smythite fe9s11 hexagonal marcasite fes2 orthorhombic and pyrite fes2 cubic rickard and luther 2007 yang et al 2017b among them pyrite is the most abundant mineral on the earth s surface and pyrrhotite is the most abundant iron sulphide in the bulk earth rickard and luther 2007 accordingly they are often found in hydrothermal deposits veins and replacements igneous rocks and sedimentary beds chandra and gerson 2010 iron sulphides are also widespread in many sedimentary environments where hydrogen sulphide h2s generated from microbial sulphate reduction reacts with fe ii fe iii to form various iron sulphides bosch and meckenstock 2012 cutter and kluckhohn 1999 garcia gil and golterman 1993 vaclavkova et al 2014 mackinawite fes is generally the first iron sulphide formed jeong et al 2010 further sulfidation leads to the transformation of mackinawite to more stable phases such as greigite fe3s4 and finally pyrite fes2 gartman and luther 2013 therefore a mixture of pre pyritic iron sulphides mainly mackinawite and greigite are often found in natural sediments where iron sulphides are continuously produced vaclavkova et al 2015 as a mineral iron sulphides have little economic value but frequently accompany high value minerals like sphalerite chalcopyrite and galena thus they are generally discarded as gangue and undergo aerobic oxidation by acidophilic bacteria like acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans which produces acid mine drainage amd belzile et al 2004 chandra and gerson 2010 evangelou and zhang 1995 yang et al 2017b this process is known as pyrite oxidation or bioleaching and has been intensively investigated due to its significant implications in environmental quality and mineral recovery evangelou and zhang 1995 iron sulphides can also be oxidized under anoxic and circumneutral ph conditions where they are utilized by chemoautotrophic denitrifying bacteria like thiobacillus denitrificans t denitrificans for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to n2 gas di capua et al 2015 trouve et al 1998 due to their widespread distribution iron sulphides represent an important electron source for in situ denitrification and link major geochemical cycles nitrogen sulphur iron phosphorus in a variety of anoxic environments fig 1 de wit et al 2001 haaijer et al 2007 hayakawa et al 2013 jørgensen and kasten 2006 vaclavkova et al 2014 recently iron sulphides have emerged as an attractive electron source for autotrophic nitrogen removal in engineered systems such as groundwater remediation pu et al 2014 tong et al 2015 torrentó et al 2011 and advanced wastewater treatment kong et al 2015 2016 li et al 2016b liu et al 2012 tong et al 2017a 2017b 2018 yang et al 2017a compared with other electron sources e g sulphur iron iron sulphides display several unique advantages such as stable ph less sulphate generation and simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal kong et al 2016 li et al 2016b tong et al 2017a these features make it an attractive option for engineering application this review article aims at providing useful information to facilitate the understanding and development of iron sulphides based autotrophic denitrification isad for nitrate pollution control and sustainable wastewater treatment initially current knowledge about the isad process is presented following that the natural occurrence and engineering applications of isad are summarized its potential and limitations are elucidated by summarizing the key influencing factors and comparing with other autotrophic denitrification processes the attention is then focused on several key questions in the mechanism of anoxic iron sulphides oxidation finally its prospects for future sustainable wastewater treatment are highlighted 2 biochemistry of iron sulphides based autotrophic denitrification 2 1 biochemistry autotrophic denitrification based on iron monosulphide fes pyrrhotite fe1 xs and pyrite fes2 is described by eqs 1 3 schippers and jørgensen 2002 yang et al 2017a the overall stoichiometric equations show that the reactions between nitrate and iron sulphides are proton generating processes with n2 gas sulphate and fe iii as the end products for each gram no3 n removed 3 81 g or 4 57 g of so4 2 are generated and 0 39 g or 1 19 g of alkalinity as caco3 are consumed for fes and fes2 respectively to include microbial biomass c5h7o2n a stoichiometric equation eq 4 for pyrite driven denitrification was proposed by tong et al 2017a the equation predicts a low biomass yield of 0 186 gvss g no3 n compared with the yield of 0 68 gvss gno3 n in heterotrophic denitrification tong et al 2018 the low biomass yield has important implications for minimizing waste sludge production complete oxidization of the sulphur moiety to so4 3 leads to the transfer of eight and seven electrons for s2 in fes and s2 2 in fes2 respectively since no more than two electrons can be transferred in single redox reactions various inorganic sulphur intermediates sn 2 s2o3 2 s4o6 2 s3o3 2 s8 etc are formed during the multi step oxidation process schippers 2004 similarly accumulation of intermediate nitrogen compounds i e no2 no and n2o may also occur during the reduction of no3 to n2 korom 1992 1 no3 0 556fes 0 889h2o 0 5n2 0 556so4 2 0 556fe oh 3 0 11h δg 3817 kj mol 2 10fe1 xs 2 9 3x no3 16 12x h2o 9 3x n2 10so4 2

the iron moiety fe2 is oxidized to fe3 and precipitates as ferric hydr oxides at circumneutral ph resulting in thin coatings on the remaining iron sulphides core gartman and luther 2014 the form of the biogenic fe iii minerals is controlled by many factors such as phase dissolved or solid and concentration of fe ii oxidant type and concentration oxidation mechanism reaction rate redox potential and ph etc kiskira et al 2017 yang et al 2017b among them the level of free fe ii ions seems to have a significant impact on the form of the biogenic fe iii hydr oxides soluble fe ii stimulates the conversion of amorphous fe iii to more crystalline forms accordingly in soluble fe ii mediated denitrification most of the produced fe iii is in the crystalline fraction while iron sulphides oxidation mainly yields amorphous fe iii hydr oxide due to low concentration of free fe ii in solution senko et al 2005 this is an important feature since the porous structure of amorphous fe iii hydr oxide could mitigate the detrimental effect of iron encrustation gartman and luther 2014 which is the main challenge for fe ii mediated denitrification process kiskira et al 2017 wang et al 2017 fe oxyhydroxides usually have a high specific surface area ssa 10 132 m2 g and positive surface charges yang et al 2017b which make them efficient adsorbents for negatively charged compounds like phosphate eq 5 arsenate and organic matter kiskira et al 2017 yang et al 2017b phosphate may also precipitate directly with ferric ions to form iron phosphate eq 6 yang et al 2017b thus isad can simultaneously achieve efficient phosphorus removal from wastewater li et al 2013b 2016b yang et al 2017a more importantly the ferric hydr oxides coating may serve as a conduit and play a key role in electron transfer during iron sulphides oxidation gartman and luther 2014 percak dennett et al 2017 which will be further discussed in section 5 1 5 ppo4 3 fen oh m fen oh m po4 p 6 fe3 po4 3 fepo4 it is noteworthy that although the above equations eqs 1 4 are mass charge balanced and widely accepted they do not have any molecular mechanistic meanings the mechanism of anoxic iron sulphides oxidization i e isad remains largely unknown for example the stoichiometric equations do not reveal whether the dissolution of iron sulphides is necessary prior to microbial utilization iron sulphides generally have very low solubility and dissolution rate yang et al 2017b if dissolution is a prerequisite how does the slow dissolution rate match the rapid biochemical reactions the equations imply that both fe ii and sulphur are directly utilized by microorganisms which is not necessarily the case if the dissolution pathways are taken into account these key questions will be discussed in detail in section 5 2 2 iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers isad can be catalysed by certain sulphur oxidizing denitrifiers and fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers schippers 2004 the diversity of iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers is not well understood yet so far eight species have been reported to have the capability to denitrify with iron sulphides table 1 most of them are in the β subclass of the proteobacteria the best known iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifier is thiobacillus denitrificans t denitrificans has an unusual ability to oxidize inorganic sulphur compounds with either oxygen or nitrate kelly and wood 2000 this feature distinguishes it from all other thiobacilli and many known sulphur oxidizing bacteria sob which are obligate aerobes haaijer et al 2006 pokorna and zabranska 2015 its full genome sequencing has been completed by beller et al 2006a some notable genomic features include 1 a diverse complement of genes 50 relevant to sulphur oxidation sqr fcc sox dsr etc sqr and dsrc are upregulated under denitrifying conditions 2 genes encoding all the essential enzymes nar nir nor nos for complete denitrification 3 a large number of c type cytochromes which are likely involved in anoxic oxidation of metals such as fe ii and u iv 4 large numbers of genes relevant to inorganic ion e g fe3 transport and heavy metal resistance beller et al 2006a 2006b shao et al 2010 these genomic traits make t denitrificans quite versatile with respect to electron donors and acceptors being able to use a range of reduced sulphur compounds h2s s0 s2o3 2 etc and certain metals i e fe ii and u iv for dissimilatory reduction of various forms of oxidized nitrogen no3 no2 n2o etc fig 2 beller et al 2006a garcia gil and golterman 1993 kiskira et al 2017 t denitrificans grows over wide temperature 5 32 c and ph 5 8 ranges kiskira et al 2017 trouve et al 1998 although it generally grows best under mesophilic 28 32 c and circumneutral ph 6 8 7 4 conditions table 1 some strains can remove nitrate efficiently under low temperatures 5 10 c and low ph 5 trouve et al 1998 the metabolic and physiological versatility allows its ubiquitous distribution in anoxic ecosystems table 1 its ability to use poorly soluble minerals e g fes2 fes feco3 etc has also been well registered beller et al 2006a haaijer et al 2006 kiskira et al 2017 though the mechanism by which it can use solid phase electron donors is still unknown many laboratory and field studies have demonstrated its ability to oxidize iron sulphides with nitrate from the most reactive fes garcia gil and golterman 1993 straub et al 1996 trouve et al 1998 to the most stable fes2 bosch et al 2012 hosono et al 2015 jørgensen et al 2009 kolle et al 1985 torrentó et al 2010 trouve et al 1998 its metabolic repertoire and wide distribution imply that t denitrificans plays an important role in major biogeochemical cycles e g sulphur nitrogen and iron and particularly in natural attenuation of nitrate in iron sulphides rich ecosystems aquifers subsoils sediments etc beller et al 2006a haaijer et al 2006 t denitrificans was the only known bacterium which could oxidize pyrite with nitrate until recent studies demonstrate that some other sob can also denitrify with pyrite pu et al 2014 vaclavkova et al 2015 the first example is sulfurimonas denitrificans up to date s denitrificans and t denitrificans are the most well known sulphur oxidizing denitrifiers and the only species that can conduct sulphur oxidizing denitrification sod under neutral and freshwater conditions pu et al 2014 shao et al 2010 s denitrificans is widely distributed in sulfidogenic environments and contributes substantially to the global sulphur and nitrogen cycles shao et al 2010 sievert et al 2008 its full genome sequencing has been completed by sievert et al 2008 the genome data reveal that s denitrificans can oxidize a variety of inorganic and organic electron donors h2s s0 s2o3 2 h2 formate etc with oxygen and or nitrate fig 2 s denitrificans is also a complete denitrifier containing all the necessary genes for reduction of nitrate to n2 sievert et al 2008 in a recent study pyrite based denitrification was achieved with a mixed culture enriched from anaerobic sludge of a sewage treatment plant which contained s denitrificans pu et al 2014 the authors suggested that s denitrificans was responsible for the observed pyrite based denitrification in another study s denitrificans was found to be the dominant species 68 05 in a natural pyrrhotite based denitrifying biofilter li et al 2016b these results indicate that s denitrificans could be a key player in isad however due to the mixed nature of the enrichment in these studies further study with pure culture of s denitrificans is needed to confirm its ability to denitrify with iron sulphides another example is thiobacillus thioparus which is closely related to t denitrificans hutt et al 2017 shao et al 2010 accompanied by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria t thioparus often dominates in anaerobic enrichment cultures containing thiosulfate and nitrate robertson and kuenen 2006 taylor et al 1971 it is also frequently found in sulphur based autotrophic denitrification systems di capua et al 2016 2017b li et al 2016b zhang et al 2017 t thioparus has been demonstrated to be able to reduce nitrate using thiosulfate and thiocyanate di capua et al 2016 robertson and kuenen 2006 taylor et al 1971 woolley et al 1962 although negative results have also been reported in few studies hutt et al 2017 vlasceanu et al 1997 vaclavkova et al 2015 speculated and confirmed that t thioparus could also utilize pyrite to reduce nitrate notably t thioparus reduced nitrate faster than t denitrificans but to nitrite only which is in line with previous studies robertson and kuenen 2006 taylor et al 1971 woolley et al 1962 it seems puzzling that t thioparus cannot achieve complete denitrification since it contains operons encoding all the necceassy enzymes nar nir nor and nos of complete denitrification in the same arrangement as in t denitrificans hutt et al 2017 it is speculated that the expression of these genes in t thioparus might be affected by some unknown factors and denitrification may occur under micro oxic conditions rather than strict anoxic conditions hutt et al 2017 nonetheless accelerated anoxic pyrite oxidation without nitrite build up was realized by co culture of t denitrificans and t thioparus vaclavkova et al 2015 the authors therefore suggest that other sob may also involve in anoxic iron sulphides oxidization and different bacteria can cooperate with each other to achieve complete denitrification this hypothesis is supported by the results of li et al 2016b where different sulphur oxidizing denitrifiers including s denitrificans t denitrificans and t thioparus co existed in a natural pyrrhotite based denitrifying biofilter further studies are required to reveal the synergies between the different species based on genome information besides sulphur oxidizing denitrifers several fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers can also denitrify with iron sulphides kiskira et al 2017 straub et al 1996 demonstrated that acidovorax strain brg1 aquabacterium strain brg2 and denitrifying bacterial strain ton1 closely related to thauera selenatis were able to oxidize fes with nitrate hafenbradl et al 1996 isolated a neutrophilic hyperthermophile ferroglobus placidus from a shallow submarine hydrothermal system which demonstrated the capability of using both soluble and insoluble fes and feco3 iron sources to denitrify senko et al 2005 demonstrated that a klebsiella strain fw33an could denitrify with fes at a rate comparable to soluble fe ii however complete denitrification by fw33an seems unlikely since nirk and nirs could not be generated in repeated pcr experiments senko et al 2005 it s noteworthy that most isolated fe oxidizing denitrifiers are not obligate lithotrophs and need organic carbon as a co substrate to continuously oxidize fe ii and grow ilbert and bonnefoy 2013 kiskira et al 2017 straub et al 2004 this characteristic may limit their role in autotrophic denitrification one exception is the chemolithoautotrophic enrichment culture ks which has been demonstrated convincingly to denitrify with fe ii as the sole electron donor he et al 2016 tominski et al 2018a 2018b 3 natural occurrence and engineering application 3 1 natural occurrence of iron sulphides based autotrophic denitrification due to the ubiquitous distribution of iron sulphides isad is one of the most common natural processes for nitrate reduction in a variety of anoxic aquatic environments such as aquifers surface sediments and marine sediments table 2 many field studies demonstrate that isad is an important process for natural nitrate attenuation in groundwater where iron sulphides are commonly present in the form of pyrite beller et al 2004 jørgensen et al 2009 korom et al 2005 pauwels et al 1998 2000 postma et al 1991 schwientek et al 2008 tesoriero et al 2000 torrentó et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 2012 a typical sign of pyrite mediated denitrification is the depletion of nitrate along the depth of aquifers concurrent with build up of sulphate fe2 only when nitrate is exhausted and pyrite associated trace metals and a slight increase in ph bosch and meckenstock 2012 hansen and van berk 2004 postma et al 1991 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 the electron and mass balance analysis indicates that pyrite driven denitrification can be the dominant nitrate removal pathway in groundwater jørgensen et al 2009 pauwels et al 1998 2000 postma et al 1991 tesoriero et al 2000 more compelling evidence is provided by multi isotope analyses stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool to trace the sources and sinks of compounds in a variety of settings and to determine the physicochemical and biogeochemical processes that affect their transport and fates hosono et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 in a specific system the isotopic composition of a compound e g no3 which is expressed using the δ notation e g δ15nno3 rsample rstandard 1 1000 r 15nno3 14nno3 is determined by both the sources of the compound and any isotopic fractionation in the processes physical chemical and biological it involves in biological process usually has large isotopic fractionation which significantly changes the isotopic composition in general organisms preferentially use the lighter isotopic species resulting in the enrichment of heavier isotopes in the residual reactants and lighter isotopes in the products for example denitrification leads to an increase in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 due to the preferential utilization of lighter isotopes 14n and 16o by denitrifying microorganisms zhang et al 2012 furthermore a linear relationship exists between δ15nno3 and ln no3 i e δ15nno3 t δ15nno3 initial ϵn ln no3 t no3 initial if denitrification is happening with the slope of the line providing the enrichment factor ϵn for the reaction fukada et al 2003 heterotrophic denitrification leads to a significant decline in δ13cdic since co2 released by this process is sourced from 13c depleted organic carbon on the contrary autotrophic denitrification results in an increase in δ13cdic due to the preferable uptake of lighter isotope 12c of the dissolved inorganic carbon dic by autotrophic denitrifiers hosono et al 2014 2015 although sulphur isotopes undergo negligible isotopic fractionation during iron sulphides oxidation zhang et al 2012 different sulphur sources are distinguishable by their isotopic signature δ34s for example 1 atmospheric deposition 0 3 to 4 1 2 s containing fertilizers 0 to 7 3 contaminated surface waters 1 6 to 4 4 and 4 s bearing minerals e g fes2 30 4 to 11 8 schwientek et al 2008 due to the distinctly low δ34s value of iron sulphides isad will result in a notable decline in δ34sso4 by generating 32so4 2 therefore a decline of δ34sso4 in concert with an increase of δ15nno3 in water can be regarded as evidence for isad hosono et al 2014 schwientek et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 in addition to the isotopic composition changes different processes can have distinctive isotope signatures for example different studies on pyrite based isad have obtained similar εn εo ratios 1 04 1 18 hosono et al 2015 torrentó et al 2010 moreover the contribution of isad to the total n removal can be quantitively determined by coupling mass balance zhang et al 2012 by using stable isotope analysis several studies have identified pyrite as the dominant electron donor in groundwater denitrification bottrell et al 2001 otero et al 2009 schwientek et al 2008 torrentó et al 2010 vitòria et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 microbial analysis can provide complement evidence for isad jørgensen et al 2009 investigated the denitrification activity of anoxic sediment from a pyrite bearing sandy aquifer a clear tendency of nitrate decline over time in concert with sulphate rise was observed in sediment incubation tests adding pyrite significantly increased both no3 reduction and so4 2 generation rates by a factor of 2 3 while no significant no3 reduction or so4 2 generation occurred in the presence of a microbial inhibitor nan3 these results clearly demonstrated the occurrence of isad in the studied sandy aquifer jørgensen et al 2009 similarly torrentó et al 2011 observed increased denitrification in sediments and groundwater from a nitrate contaminated aquifer after adding pyrite which indicated the existence of pyrite oxidizing denitrifiers in the aquifer material microbial community analysis revealed that the supplementation of pyrite increased the abundance of denitrifying bacteria closely related to the xanthomonadaceae species which seemed good candidates for pyrite oxidizing denitrifier torrentó et al 2011 in another study bacteria closely related to sulphur oxidizing t denitrificans thiotrix nivea thiotrix unzii pseudomonas stutzeri and fe oxidizing gallionella ferruginea brg1 denitrifiers were detected in a heavily nitrate contaminated pyritic sandy aquifer by 16s rrna gene sequencing which were consistent with the conclusion from isotopic analysis that pyrite driven denitrification was the main process for nitrate reduction in the aquifer zhang et al 2012 isad also actively occurs in a variety of sulfidic ecosystems including marine sediments freshwater wetlands surface sediments wet meadows brackish marshes and tidal environments etc haaijer et al 2007 hayakawa et al 2013 schippers and jørgensen 2002 vaclavkova et al 2014 in these environments iron sulphides are often present in more reactive forms such as mackinawite fes greigite fe3s4 or a mixture of pre pyritic minerals vaclavkova et al 2014 2015 the potential and extent of isad are often evaluated by incubation of sediments with or without iron sulphides addition garcia gil and golterman 1993 haaijer et al 2007 hayakawa et al 2013 schippers and jørgensen 2002 vaclavkova et al 2014 through incubation tests schippers and jørgensen 2002 demonstrate that iron sulphide fes can drive denitrification in marine sediments and could play an important role in linking the sulphur nitrogen and iron cycles hayakawa et al 2013 observed significant no3 reduction coupled with so4 2 production during anoxic incubation of surface sediments which contained fes2 as pyrite and marcasite from a sulphide rich ecosystem in japan the observed microbial stoichiometry δso4 2 δno3 was close to the theoretical value of fes2 based denitrification eq 3 similarly vaclavkova et al 2014 found that isad accounted for approximately 30 of the total no3 loss in a variety of danish sediments aquifer freshwater wetlands coastal sites these results demonstrate that isad could be an important no3 depleting process in various sulfidic ecosystems in summary isad is an important process for natural nitrate attenuation and plays an important role in linking major geochemical cycles sulphur nitrogen iron etc further information on the quantity and distribution of iron sulphide minerals the rate limiting factors of isad and environmental controls on the relevant microbes would improve estimates of ecosystem wide denitrification and support better nitrate management jørgensen et al 2009 vitòria et al 2008 3 2 engineering application 3 2 1 groundwater remediation nitrate remediation in groundwater is difficult due to the long term diffuse and continuing nature of the nitrate pollution ashok and hait 2015 rivett et al 2008 a key limitation on groundwater nitrate remediation is the lack of organic carbon sources which restricts heterotrophic denitrification ashok and hait 2015 supplementation of organic carbon sources is costly and may lead to secondary pollution i e carbon and microbial breakthrough chung et al 2014 park and yoo 2009 as described above section 3 1 isad represents an important natural nitrate attenuation process in groundwater but its role might be limited by the quantity and reactivity of iron sulphide minerals in aquifers schwientek et al 2008 vitòria et al 2008 correspondingly a conceivable bioremediation strategy is induced isad by iron sulphides addition which has been assessed by several recent studies jin et al 2019 pu et al 2014 tong et al 2015 torrentó et al 2010 2011 xu et al 2019 using natural pyrite as the sole electron donor torrentó et al 2010 demonstrated that denitrification could be satisfactorily accomplished in presence of t denitrificans at typical nitrate concentrations in contaminated groundwater up to 70 mg no3 n l they further demonstrated that enhanced denitrification could be obtained by biostimulation of indigenous denitrifying bacteria with pyrite addition obviating the need for the inoculation of specialized bacteria complete nitrate removal lasting for 180 days was maintained in flow through experiments manifesting the durability of pyrite based bioremediation torrentó et al 2011 unlike zero valent iron zvi systems high permeability losses under geochemical conditions will likely not be problematic for the iron sulphides based system henderson and demond 2013 which makes iron sulphides a more suitable reactive material for in situ groundwater remediation using pyrite based autotrophic denitrification column as the permeable reactive barrier xu et al 2019 achieved effective nitrate removal with a removal efficiency and removal rate up to 94 5 and ca 12 mg l d respectively notably a significant decline in treatment performance was observed as the temperature decreased to from 30 c to 10 c xu et al 2019 therefore the impact of temperature variation under natural environmental conditions should be sufficiently considered in practical application further discussed in section 3 3 5 the potential of pyrite based denitrification is further highlighted by comparing with sulphur based denitrification pu et al 2014 tong et al 2015 both studies demonstrated that pyrite based denitrification could result in a favourable nitrate removal rate and much lower sulphate production especially it avoids the problem of sharp ph decrease in sulphur based denitrification therefore pyrite can replace sulphur for groundwater remediation to further reduce sulphate formation and improve nitrate removal jin et al 2019 developed a pyrite sawdust mixotrophic denitrification system by coupling autotrophic pyrite and heterotrophic sawdust denitrification the system successfully controlled sulphate at a very low level 33 mg l while meeting the drinking water nitrate standard overall engineered isad for groundwater nitrate remediation is still in its infancy but studies on iron sulphides for groundwater remediation are boosting demiya et al 2018 duan et al 2020 gong et al 2016 huo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 most studies have focused on removing more hazardous pollutants such as toxic metals hg2 cu2 pb2 cr6 etc inorganic oxyanions arsenite arsenate selenite etc radionuclides uranium neptunium etc and emerging organic pollutants chlorinated organic compounds nitroaromatic compounds polychlorinated biphenyls etc gong et al 2016 in most cases iron sulphides remove or immobilize the above pollutants through chemical reactions like reduction and precipitation apparently because nitrate is ubiquitous and commonly high in groundwaters isad and other remediation processes will be closely linked for example isad may interfere with reduction of radionuclides and chlorinated organic compounds by competing for the added iron sulphides on the other hand there may be synergies between isad and other processes surprisingly there are virtually no studies on the interactions between nitrate removal and other pollutants removal by iron sulphides yet a full understanding of these interactions should be the focus in future studies since it is critical to achieve effective groundwater remediation other future research needs limitations and challenges are discussed in section 6 2 3 2 2 advanced wastewater treatment besides groundwater remediation isad can also be a viable option for nitrate removal from a variety of organic deficient wastewaters such as nitrified wastewater stormwater runoff and industrial wastewaters liang et al 2019 ma et al 2019 tong et al 2017a 2017b 2018 its most valuable application is simultaneous nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal nitrogen and phosphorus are the main causes of eutrophication which represents a serious threat to the aquatic environment advanced tertiary wastewater treatment targeting simultaneous n and p removal is generally mandatory in urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide nutrient n p discharge limits for tertiary effluent are typically 10 15 mg l for total nitrogen tn and 0 5 1 mg l for total phosphorus tp heterotrophic biological nutrient removal bnr processes a2 o bardenpho uct sbr etc are the most widely used technology to reduce nutrient level in wastewater li et al 2008 rodgers et al 2004 although they have been proven cost effective insufficient biodegradable organic matter in wastewater is a common challenge for the heterotrophic bnr processes to meet the discharge standards adopting more stringent discharge permits e g tn 2 2 mg l tp 0 15 mg l is becoming a general trend in many countries hu et al 2017 which will further challenge the conventional bnr processes as described previously section 2 1 isad can achieve simultaneous n and p removal from organic lacking wastewaters in a simple and cost effective manner li et al 2013a yang et al 2017b this feature makes it an attractive option for advanced wastewater purification either to serve as a post treatment unit in urban wwtps to meet stringent nutrient discharge limits li et al 2013b 2016b liu et al 2012 yang et al 2017a or to form a simple integral system for onsite advanced wastewater treatment ge et al 2019 kong et al 2015 2016 liang et al 2019 the application reactor configuration and performance of isad in advanced wastewater treatment are summarized in table 3 and discussed in the following paragraphs the potential of iron sulphides for post treatment is first highlighted by li et al 2013b in a batch test the batch experiment was carried out with secondary effluent having no3 n of 14 9 mg l and tp of 3 9 mg l using chemical grade fes 300 g l no3 n decreased to 1 1 mg l after 16 h and tp was entirely removed in 4 h table 3 for practical application the most straightforward way is to form an up flow biofilter with natural iron sulphide minerals e g pyrite pyrrhotite etc as the packing medium li et al 2016b liu et al 2012 tong et al 2018 which is termed as particulate pyrite pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification ppad process liu et al 2012 invented a natural pyrite fes2 based ppad for secondary effluent polishing this simple cost effective technology produced a final effluent with n and p concentrations as low as 0 16 1 17 mg l and 0 0 71 mg l respectively when treating secondary effluent with high levels of nutrient no3 n 25 52 mg l tp 4 17 mg l natural pyrrhotite fe1 xs has also been proven efficient which could substantially reduce n and p in secondary effluent no3 n 21 1 6 mg l tp 3 4 2 2 mg l to 1 89 mg l and 0 34 mg l respectively however one major limitation of natural iron sulphide minerals is the low reaction rate due to their low ssa approximately 0 02 m2 g yang et al 2017a consequently a long hydraulic retention time hrt pyrite 5 d pyrrhotite 12 24 h is required to achieve satisfactory effluent quality table 3 which would constrain their application in urban wwtps to overcome this limitation yang et al 2017a developed a nanostructured pyrrhotite npyrr based ppad owing to its high ssa 10 28 m2 g the npyrr based ppad ensured excellent effluent quality no3 n 0 05 0 01 mg l tp 0 03 0 01 mg l at a short hrt of just 1 2 h table 3 this excellent treatment performance indicates immense potential of this technology as a valuable and viable add on to urban wwtps in meeting strict discharge standards achieving advanced wastewater treatment is more challenging in non urban areas where centralized wwtps with conventional bnr processes are cost prohibitive simple and low maintenance treatment processes such as constructed wetlands cws and soil infiltration systems are the most feasible options for on site wastewater treatment kong et al 2015 these systems can effectively eliminate organic matter cod however their ability in nutrient removal is limited resulting in high levels of nutrients in the effluent vymazal 2007 although intensified methods such as multi stage systems with effluent recirculation zhao et al 2018 step feeding hu et al 2012 or internal recirculation hu et al 2014 can improve nutrient removal performance a simple system with high nutrient removal efficiency is more desirable iron sulphides can address this need by forming simple integrated systems for example iron sulphides can be used as the main substrate in cws for enhanced n and p removal ge et al 2019 liang et al 2019 recent studies demonstrated that iron sulphides could enhance long term removal of nitrogen phosphorus and herbicide glyphosate in cws table 3 without negative impacts on growth of cws plants and other pollutants cod nh4 removal process ge et al 2019 another example is down flow bi layer vertical biofilter kong et al 2015 2016 in this system the top aerobic layer adapts regular filling materials sands volcanics zeolites etc where organics cod removal and nitrification take place the lower anoxic layer is filled with iron sulphides pyrite where nitrate and phosphorus are simultaneously removed kong et al 2015 2016 results table 3 showed excellent treatment performance by removing 89 cod 95 nh4 n 84 tn denitrification rate 532 gno3 n m3 d and 85 100 tp from domestic wastewater at a short hrt of 1 2 h kong et al 2015 these results demonstrated that iron sulphides can enable simple system design and operation to achieve cost effective advanced wastewater treatment 3 3 influencing factors the efficiency and reaction kinetics of isad depends on several factors including type and specific surface area of iron sulphides substrate and biomass concentrations ph temperature micronutrients and carbon source which are discussed in the following sections 3 3 1 type of iron sulphides iron sulphides constitute a diverse group of sulphur and iron compounds rickard and luther 2007 due to their difference in composition and structure their reactivity as electron donors is quite different the most widely used iron sulphides for denitrification are mackinawite fes pyrrhotite fe1 xs x 0 0 125 and pyrite fes2 mackinawite is metastable sulphur deficient iron sulphide with a tetragonal layer structure rickard and luther 2007 yang et al 2017b all studies have shown that fes is a readily accessible electron donor for denitrification garcia gil and golterman 1993 golterman 1991 haaijer et al 2007 li et al 2013b park et al 2015 schippers 2004 schippers and jørgensen 2002 trouve et al 1998 not only enhanced denitrification activities can be induced immediately by the addition of fes garcia gil and golterman 1993 golterman 1991 haaijer et al 2007 li et al 2013b park et al 2015 trouve et al 1998 but also denitrifying bacteria can be enriched from environmental samples using fes as the sole substrate schippers 2004 schippers and jørgensen 2002 pyrrhotite is a nonstoichiometric variant of fes displaying various superstructures based on a nias structure yang et al 2017b although it is a stable mineral pyrrhotite is susceptible to anoxic microbial oxidation li et al 2016b yang et al 2017a additionally a mixture of mackinawite and greigite fe3s4 which represents typical fes2 precursors in pyrite forming environments is also an easily accessible energy source for autotrophic denitrifiers vaclavkova et al 2014 2015 however the results based on fes2 are not always positive despite compelling evidence of pyrite driven denitrification in field section 3 1 and laboratory section 3 2 studies several studies declare that pure crystalline pyrite cannot function as an electron donor for denitrification haaijer et al 2007 schippers and jørgensen 2002 vaclavkova et al 2014 yan 2017 yang et al 2018b in comparative studies the denitrification rate of pyrite is always much lower than that of pre pyritic iron sulphides e g fes fe3s4 etc park et al 2015 trouve et al 1998 all these results reveal that the type of iron sulphides is a determiner for isad the different reactivity between pyrite and other forms of iron sulphides is attributed to their microscopic structure section 3 3 2 and solubility section 5 1 which will be further discussed in the following sections 3 3 2 specific surface area ssa another critical parameter determining iron sulphides reactivity is the ssa torrentó et al 2010 vaclavkova et al 2015 yang et al 2017a iron sulphides oxidization is a surface controlled process in which the oxidation is initiated and enhanced by defect sites containing fe species of reduced coordination bostick et al 2000 chandra and gerson 2011 these defect sites are more prevalent on amorphous iron sulphides associated with increased surface roughness i e high ssa bostick et al 2000 this explains why pure highly crystalline pyrite low ssa could not function as an efficient electron donor for denitrification haaijer et al 2007 schippers and jørgensen 2002 vaclavkova et al 2014 yan 2017 yang et al 2018b while low crystallinity pyrite high ssa could be oxidized microbially with nitrate yan 2017 in addition to increasing reactive sites high ssa also leads to better cell mineral interactions better solid liquid mass transfer and higher dissolution rates of iron sulphides ma et al 2019 torrento et al 2012 therefore ssa is a valid proxy for the overall reactivity of iron sulphides and strongly influences the rate of isad the higher the ssa the higher the denitrification rate torrentó et al 2010 vaclavkova et al 2014 2015 due to their crystalline structure natural iron sulphides e g pyrite pyrrhotite often display a low ssa 0 02 0 4 m2 g at micron sizes which limits the reaction kinetics vaclavkova et al 2014 yang et al 2017a therefore increasing iron sulphides ssa is the key to achieving high rate denitrification size reduction is the most common strategy to increase particle s ssa naturally the denitrification rate is significantly enhanced by decreasing iron sulphides grain size bosch et al 2012 bosch and meckenstock 2012 jørgensen et al 2009 torrentó et al 2010 vaclavkova et al 2015 by using nano sized pyrite particles bosch et al 2012 obtained a high denitrification rate 13 gno3 n m3 d which is up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of micron sized pyrite bosch and meckenstock 2012 alternatively high ssa can also be obtained by altering the mineral s microscopic structure for example yang et al 2017b developed a cost effective method to transform natural pyrite into nanostructured pyrrhotite npyrr by simply calcinating the minerals 600 c 1 h under inert atmosphere n2 after the treatment the product npyrr displays a porous honeycomb like structure with a high ssa ranging from 10 to 28 m2 g yang et al 2017b this high ssa enables npyrr to achieve a high denitrification rate of 165 g no3 n m3 d which is an order of magnitude higher than that of natural iron sulphides at similar grain sizes yang et al 2017a 3 3 3 substrate and biomass concentrations as a biological process isad is affected by both substrate nitrate iron sulphides and biomass concentrations garcia gil and golterman 1993 li et al 2013b tong et al 2018 for given amounts of substrates and biomass there is a maximal denitrification rate tong et al 2018 nitrate removal efficiency is dependent on the nitrate loading rate nlr when the nlr is far below the maximal denitrification rate the removal efficiency can be kept high and constant when the nlr approaches or exceeds the maximum denitrification rate the removal efficiency decreases rapidly although the denitrification rate could remain the same level li et al 2013b torrentó et al 2010 early studies demonstrate that nitrite is toxic to the denitrifying enzyme system of t denitrificans baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 claus and kutzner 1985 although the bacteria contain all the essential enzymes including nitrite reductase for complete denitrification section 2 2 denitrification is inhibited by nitrite at concentrations above 0 2 g no2 l claus and kutzner 1985 nitrite inhibition is confirmed by molecular analysis in a recent study in which t denitrificans was significantly enriched using nitrate but its abundance decreased to a low level when fed with nitrite chen et al 2018 the mechanism of nitrite inhibition on autotrophic denitrifiers has not been investigated yet a recent study on heterotrophic denitrification has revealed that free nitrous acid fna rather than nitrite is the actual inhibitor on nitrate reduction ma et al 2010 therefore it is reasonable to infer that the inhibitory effect of high nitrite on t denitrificans could be resulted from fna this is worthy of further study nonetheless appreciable accumulation of nitrite rarely occurs using regular micron sized iron sulphides minerals t denitrificans is also inhibited by sulphate the reaction product eqs 1 4 at concentrations above 5 g so4 2 l claus and kutzner 1985 this may confine the process s applicability to wastewater with a high nitrate content which results in high sulphate generation 3 3 4 ph ph is an important parameter affecting the microbial process the best known iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifier t denitrificans displays optimal activity over a narrow range of ph close to neutral 6 8 7 5 when grown on reduced sulphur compounds thiosulfate kelly and wood 2000 trouve et al 1998 vaclavkova et al 2015 both acidic 6 5 and alkaline 8 phs inhibit the microbial activity with severer inhibition under increasingly acidic conditions claus and kutzner 1985 trouve et al 1998 complete inhibition of denitrification has been observed at ph 6 claus and kutzner 1985 di capua et al 2017a liu and koenig 2002 oh et al 2000a trouve et al 1998 in addition to affecting the physiological status of microorganisms inappropriate ph may also induce secondary inhibitory factors such as fna as discussed in the above section therefore sufficient buffering is recommended to maintain a near neutral ph oh et al 2000a however the situation differs in isad although few studies have reported marked decrease in the denitrification rate due to acidic ph 6 2 torrentó et al 2010 2011 active isad under low ph of 5 6 typical in groundwater from arable lands postma et al 1991 has been observed in many field pauwels et al 1998 2000 postma et al 1991 zhang et al 2009 and laboratory studies jørgensen et al 2009 li et al 2013b vaclavkova et al 2014 in particular li et al 2013b demonstrated that increased acidity feed ph from 7 to 5 enhanced the denitrification rate from 14 to 17 5 mg no3 n l d in fes based autotrophic denitrification they also found that increased alkaline improved denitrification as well at feed ph between 7 and 8 but the denitrification rate decreased slightly at feed ph 8 li et al 2013b these results indicate that isad can occur actively over a wide ph range 5 8 especially under acidic conditions ph 5 6 this may attribute to the following reasons 1 environmental strains of iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers may have low ph optima di capua et al 2017a vaclavkova et al 2015 2 low ph promotes the dissolution of iron sulphides section 5 1 thus increasing the denitrification rate li et al 2013b and 3 iron sulphides are very effective buffering agent which can keep the ph of the system stable this will be further discussed in section 4 3 1 3 3 5 temperature temperature is one of the key factors affecting microbial activity iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers normally display mesophilic behaviour with a temperature optimum at approximately 30 c table 1 although effective isad under ambient temperature has been reported in many studies kong et al 2016 li et al 2016b tong et al 2017a 2017b yang et al 2017a lower temperature generally results in decreased microbial activities and denitrification rates jørgensen et al 2009 vaclavkova et al 2015 xu et al 2019 for example in a fes based study effective denitrification 17 21 mg no3 n l d was maintained at 10 35 c but it decreased sharply to 3 5 mg no3 n l d at 5 c li et al 2013b given the significant temperature variation under real environmental conditions the temperature impact on treatment performance should receive sufficient consideration during the practical application of isad notably some environmental strains also demonstrate psychrophilic properties trouve et al 1998 isolated several psychrophilic strains of t denitrificans which achieved a maximal denitrification rate at 10 c some of them can even achieve active denitrification at 5 c with efficiency as good as at 20 c trouve et al 1998 this throws light on maintaining active isad activity under low temperatures however whether these strains are widely distributed and how robust they can respond to temperature variation deserve further investigation 3 3 6 micronutrients and carbon source iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers prefer to use nh4 as their nitrogen source and need micronutrients such as mg2 po4 3 and fe2 to fulfil their metabolic requirements an early study demonstrated that the growth of t denitrificans was poor in media with less than 0 0083 nh4cl baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 li et al 2013b observed that nh4 up to 7 8 mg l as n significantly increased the denitrification rate in fes based autotrophic denitrification although denitrification still occurred in the absence of nh4 the rate decreased to ca 60 of the maximum similarly increasing concentrations of mg2 up to 0 24 mg l and po4 3 p up to 0 11 mg l significantly increased the denitrification rate li et al 2013b a small amount of fe2 0 25 8 3 mg l is necessary to sustain the growth of t denitrificans baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 but higher concentrations of fe2 may inhibit denitrification garcia gil and golterman 1993 observed complete inhibition of fes mediated denitrification when the free fe2 reached about 0 1 mm therefore care should be taken to avoid excess fe2 ions when using synthetic iron sulphides for denitrification as an autotrophic process isad is controlled by the availability of inorganic carbon sources co2 hco3 li et al 2013b found that for effective denitrification the concertation of hco3 should be maintained above 30 mg l inorganic carbon limitation hco3 30 mg l results in a rapid decrease of the denitrification activity li et al 2013b although organic co substrates are generally not required for isad baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 li et al 2013b since most of the iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers are obligate chemolithoautotrophs table 1 a small amount of organic carbon could enhance the overall denitrification rate possibly by promoting the mixotrophic process tong et al 2017b presence of organic carbon can also mitigate sulphate accumulation by inducing microbial sulphate reduction yang et al 2017a 4 comparison with other autotrophic denitrification processes besides iron sulphides autotrophic denitrification can also be supported by various reduced sulphur sulphide s2 elemental sulphur s0 thiosulfate s2o3 2 tetrathionate s4o6 2 sulphite so3 2 and iron compounds zero valent iron fe0 zvi ferrous salts minerals fe ii ashok and hait 2015 kiskira et al 2017 liu et al 2018 shao et al 2010 among them the prevalent electron donors are elemental sulphur thiosulfate zvi and ferrous iron the stoichiometric equations based on these electron donors are summarized in table 4 the comparison between iron sulphides and these electron donors in terms of dentification capacity denitrification products by products and dentification rate are made in table 5 and discussed in the following sections 4 1 denitrification capacity in this paper denitrification capacity is termed as the amount of nitrate n that can be denitrified per unit mass of electron donors g no3 n g substrate denitrification capacity is a key parameter in the selection of electron donors a high denitrification capacity can significantly reduce the operating costs by minimizing substrate consumption handling of raw material and maintenance requirements it is especially important for the solid phase electron donors e g s0 zvi ferrous minerals iron sulphides for these substrates are commonly used in biofilm systems biofilter packed bed denitrification wall etc ashok and hait 2015 di capua et al 2015 where the substrate s denitrification capacity is decisive to the system s lifespan the denitrification capacity of different electron donors is calculated based on the stoichiometric equations table 4 and summarized in table 5 as shown in table 5 elemental sulphur has the highest denitrification capacity with a value of 0 398 g no3 n g substrate iron sulphides have a high denitrification capacity between 0 287 and 0 321 g no3 n g substrate which is close to elemental sulphur and higher than thiosulfate 0 145 g no3 n g substrate reduced iron fe0 fe ii has the lowest denitrification capacity between 0 05 and 0 1 g no3 n g substrate the high denitrification capacity indicates that iron sulphides are prolific electron donors for autotrophic denitrification 4 2 denitrification products for nitrate removal via denitrification the desirable end product is innocuous gas n2 however nitrate can also be reduced to a variety of adverse end products such as nh4 nh3 no and n2o depending on the type of electron donor and reaction conditions nitrate reduction with zvi fe0 can proceed via two pathways table 4 1 abiotic reaction between no3 and fe0 with nh4 nh3 as the end product and 2 anaerobic iron corrosion abiotic followed by hydrogenotrophic denitrification biotic with n2 as the end product biswas and bose 2005 normally the first reaction dominates resulting in nh4 as the primary end product in fe0 driven denitrification biswas and bose 2005 liu et al 2018 to minimize nh4 production selective catalysts and or sophisticated control of the reaction conditions are required biswas and bose 2005 liu et al 2018 which limits the application of fe0 in autotropic denitrification besides nh4 n2o can also be a predominant end product in fe0 supported autotrophic denitrification till et al 1998 fe ii mediated denitrification is also prone to produce adverse end products such as nh4 coby et al 2011 robertson et al 2016 robertson and thamdrup 2017 weber et al 2006 and n2o carlson et al 2013 kampschreur et al 2011 wang et al 2016 kiskira et al 2017 conclude that the molar fe ii no3 ratio determines the end product of fe ii based denitrification high fe ii no3 ratios 7 5 induce microbial dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra while low fe ii no3 ratios 4 lead to significant production of intermediates such as no2 and n2o besides microbial processes abiotic reactions also contribute to the generation of adverse products for example no3 can be reduced to nh4 by green rusts mixed fe ii fe iii hydroxides an intermediate in fe ii oxidization at rates of similar magnitude or even higher than the microbial reduction etique et al 2014 hansen et al 1996 no2 reacts with soluble fe ii rapidly with n2o as the principal product carlson et al 2012 moraghan and buresh 1977 this chemical reaction can be a significant cause of n2o emission in soluble fe ii mediated denitrification when no2 is present at elevated concentrations kampschreur et al 2011 klueglein et al 2014 to minimize adverse end products generation the fe ii no3 ratio should be kept around 5 kiskira et al 2017 which requires careful process control reduced sulphur normally doesn t lead to nh4 generation except for free sulphide h2s and s2 which induces dnra by inhibiting no and n2o reductases burgin and hamilton 2007 n2o generation only occurs under high no3 concentrations and loading rates in elemental sulphur driven denitrification park et al 2002 thiosulfate is known to inhibit nitrification resulting in no n2o emission saad et al 1996 but it does not affect denitrification saad et al 1996 yang et al 2018b in the case of iron sulphides most studies demonstrate that the final products are n gaseous compounds pauwels et al 1998 postma et al 1991 torrentó et al 2010 appreciable increase of nh4 has never been observed ruling out dnra in isad although only a few studies have analysed the n gaseous compounds the possibility of n2o production in isad should be smaller than that of sulphur and iron based denitrification for the compounds free sulphide and fe2 that induce n2o production barely exist in iron sulphides based systems haaijer et al 2007 tong et al 2017a zhang et al 2009 in a recent study yang et al 2017a verified that n2o was undetectable in pyrrhotite based denitrification even if considerable no2 accumulation occurred similarly taghizadeh toosi et al 2019 concluded that isad did not lead to n2o emission these results demonstrate that iron sulphides are good electron donors for denitrification with less adverse end products production 4 3 by products 4 3 1 acids bases generation maintaining stable ph is of great importance to denitrification since the ph optimum for most environmental strains of denitrifying bacteria is between 7 and 8 jha and bose 2005 oh et al 2000a unfortunately iron and sulphur based autotrophic denitrification processes generate acids or bases as the reaction by products which represent a major operational issue in their application as shown in table 4 both the abiotic and biotic nitrate reduction by fe0 result in oh ions generation which often elevates the ph of the system rapidly to above 10 hwang et al 2011 till et al 1998 high ph values deteriorate denitrification by abruptly inhibiting microbial activity and hindering fe0 reactivity due to formation of oxide deposition precipitation etc till et al 1998 therefore proper buffering co2 aluminosilicate minerals pyrite etc must be provided to prevent excessive ph increase in fe0 driven denitrification biswas and bose 2005 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 till et al 1998 contrary to fe0 f ii and sulphur s0 s2o3 2 etc driven denitrification result in appreciable acids generation table 5 fe ii mediated denitrification generates 9 14 mol h ions per mole no3 removed which would acidify the reaction system rapidly zhang et al 2015 since fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers are neutrophilic hedrich et al 2011 low ph values 6 seriously repress microbial activity kiskira et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in addition low ph may increase the redox potential of the fe iii fe ii couple to close to or even above the no3 no2 couple 0 43 v making denitrification thermodynamically unfavourable ilbert and bonnefoy 2013 dramatic ph drop is also a well registered problem in sulphur based denitrification which results in severe or complete inhibition of denitrification koenig and liu 2001 kong et al 2014 liu and koenig 2002 moon et al 2006 oh et al 2000b sahinkaya et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 to maintain a favourable ph range 6 8 8 2 external alkalinity sources like bicarbonate need to be consistently supplied which would result in substantial costs chung et al 2014 liu and koenig 2002 various solid alkalinity sources limestone oyster shell calcite dolomite etc have been explored as low cost buffering agents but their applicability could be limited by issues like low dissolution rate availability of materials and increased hardness of treated water chung et al 2014 moon et al 2006 sahinkaya et al 2015 although isad is also an acid producing process tables 4 and 5 it is a common observation that ph remains stable during the reaction hayakawa et al 2013 jørgensen et al 2009 kong et al 2016 postma et al 1991 pu et al 2014 tong et al 2017a yang et al 2017a for example in a field study the ph of water for pyrite driven denitrification was predicted to decrease to 4 by modelling but the field data did not indicate any significant ph drop postma et al 1991 in a comparative study of sulphur and pyrite based denitrification the pyrite reactor maintained a stable ph above 7 while the ph in the sulphur reactor continued to decline to below 4 kong et al 2016 these results demonstrate that isad is a ph buffering process and thus avoids the ph drop problem commonly found in fe ii and sulphur based denitrification the resistance of iron sulphides system to acidification may be attributed to the following buffer mechanisms 1 iron sulphides arrest h ions via proton promoted dissolution eq 7 rickard 2006 schippers and jørgensen 2002 or sorption henderson and demond 2013 2 the product of iron sulphides oxidation ferric oxyhydroxides arrests h ions via protonation eq 8 reduction eq 9 and or complexation eq 10 postma et al 1991 schwertmann 1991 the second mechanism seems more important for pyrite driven denitrification because pyrite is acid insoluble and ferric oxyhydroxides seem to be the only buffer agent in the system it may seem conflict with the fact that ferric oxyhydroxides are also the product of fe ii oxidizing denitrification where ph drop is a common problem two plausible explanations are 1 the ferric oxyhydroxides produced in isad are amorphous which might be more susceptible to proton attack than the crystalline iron hydr oxides formed in the fe ii based denitrification 2 iron sulphides may promote reductive dissolution of the ferric oxyhydroxides eq 9 by providing electrons further discussed in 5 1 while this mechanism is lacking in the fe ii based denitrification further studies are required to clarify these issues 7 fes h fe2 hs 8 feooh h fe oh 2 9 feooh 3h e fe2 2h2o 10 feooh 3h nl ligand feln 3 n 2h2o iron sulphides fes2 can also prevent ph rise by arresting hydroxide ions oh although the mechanism is still not known with certainty jha and bose 2005 suggest that fes2 undergoes oxidative dissolution as per eq 11 and speculate that ferric oxy hydroxide acts as the oxidant as a result ferrous ions are released and consume oh ions through fe oh 2 precipitation alternatively burris et al 1995 suggest that fes2 is dissolved via disproportionation reaction in which h2s is produced and consumes oh ions nonetheless several studies demonstrate that fes2 can act as an effective buffering agent in a system e g fe0 based denitrification where oh ions are constantly added or generated burris et al 1995 devlin et al 2000 holser et al 1995 jha and bose 2005 11 fes2 18oh fe oh 2 2so4 2 14e 8h2o 4 3 2 sulphate generation sulphate is an inevitable by product in sulphur and iron sulphides based denitrification table 4 which results in elevated sulphate concertation in the treated water a high level of sulphate can cause several adverse effects which will be further discussed in section 6 2 3 the sulphate production of sulphur s0 s2o3 2 and iron sulphides fes fe1 xs fes2 based denitrification is compared in table 5 as shown in table 5 elemental sulphur and thiosulfate based denitrification produce 7 54 mg and 11 82 mg so4 2 per mg no3 n removal respectively this high sulphate production represents a major disadvantage of sulphur based denitrification ashok and hait 2015 theoretically only 33 mg l and 21 mg l no3 n can be denitrified using elemental sulphur and thiosulfate without exceeding the sulphate limit of 250 mg l in drinking water if the water being treated has no background sulphate sahinkaya et al 2011 in contrast isad generates much less sulphate with a yield of only 3 81 3 81 3 98 4 99 mg so4 2 per mg no3 n removal for fes fe1 xs and fes2 respectively the much lower sulphate production makes iron sulphides a more viable option than the reduced sulphur compounds s0 s2o3 2 especially when sulphate level has to be under strict control groundwater remediation drinking water treatment etc kong et al 2016 tong et al 2017a to alleviate sulphate accumulation various methods such as post treatment kong et al 2014 mixotrophic denitrification li et al 2016a sahinkaya et al 2011 and autotrophic denitrification via nitrite chung et al 2014 are proposed for sulphur based denitrification these methods can also be applied to isad additionally a lower sulphate production than the stoichiometric calculation is often observed in isad which would be helpful to reduce the sulphate accumulation pauwels et al 1998 2000 tong et al 2017a 2017b torrentó et al 2010 yang et al 2017a zhang et al 2009 2012 several mechanisms may contribute to the lower sulphate production 1 incomplete oxidization of iron sulphides which results in the accumulation of intermediate sulphur species s0 so3 2 etc instead of sulphate zhang et al 2009 2012 however this would be only a temporary effect 2 precipitation of sulphate minerals such as jarosite kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 and natroalunite naal3 so4 2 oh 6 pauwels et al 1998 2000 this is more likely to occur in aquifers where the relevant ions fe3 al3 etc are present 3 the reaction stoichiometry is changed due to physiological response to extreme conditions e g low temperature trouve et al 1998 4 the involvement of heterotrophic denitrification ma et al 2019 torrentó et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 and or microbial sulphate reduction tong et al 2017b yang et al 2017a zhang et al 2009 both processes require organic substrates which could be sourced from lysed cells and or residual organic carbon in the inflow torrentó et al 2011 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017a confirmed the occurrence of microbial sulphate reduction in a pyrrhotite based ppad by the detection of sulphate reducing bacteria sulphate reduction also occurs in sulphur based denitrification systems moon et al 2004 sahinkaya et al 2014 tong et al 2017a which could be a troublesome issue due to h2s emission in iron sulphides systems h2s would be arrested by iron hydr oxides as per eq 12 and 13 davydov et al 1998 by such not only the h2s related problems are avoided but also the iron sulphides are regenerated yang et al 2017a however these useful processes are likely to be limited by organic deficiency 12 2fe oh 3 3h2s 2fes 1 8s8 6h2o 13 2fe oh 3 3h2s fe2s3 6h2o 4 4 denitrification rate different rate units have been used across literatures based on available information the denitrification rate unit is standardized as the volumetric removal rate g n m3 d in this article to fairly compare the denitrification rate we urge that all relevant information material weight size surface area reactor volume should be provided in future studies high rate denitrification 400 g n m3 d can be obtained with zvi by increasing the ssa e g nanoscale zvi nzvi and iron dosage table 5 however the denitrification product under such conditions is principally nh4 due to the rapid abiotic reaction table 4 low ssa low iron dosage or avoiding direct contact between iron and nitrate is thus required to minimize nh4 generation at the cost of a significant decline of the denitrification rate an et al 2009 biswas and bose 2005 di capua et al 2015 sunger and bose 2009 for example biswas and bose 2005 found that using low ssa steel wool 0 0075 m2 g at a low dosage could minimize nh4 yield but a long hrt of above 13 days was necessary for complete denitrification of 40 mg l no3 n an et al 2009 decreased nh4 yield from 51 to 19 by decreasing nzvi dosage from 0 7 to 0 42 g l but the denitrification rate declined significantly from 1 25 to 0 63 g n m3 d by separating iron corrosion h2 generation and hydrogenotrophic denitrification in different reactors sunger and bose 2009 successfully avoided nh4 generation but the denitrification rate was only 0 0289 g n m3 d therefore for genuine nitrate removal to n2 fe0 driven denitrification should be regarded as a slow process the rate of fe ii mediated denitrification depends on the form of fe ii dissolved fe ii e g feso4 can achieve a high denitrification rate of 90 200 g n m3 d table 5 however after a long term operation cell encrustation could occur due to the generated fe iii precipitates which leads to significant decline of the denitrification rate wang et al 2017 therefore long term stability of high rate denitrification remains a challenge for dissolved fe ii based systems when using solid phase fe ii e g feco3 the denitrification rate will be reduced by an order of magnitude yang et al 2018a table 5 being a highly bioavailable electron donor thiosulfate can sustain efficient autotrophic denitrification at very high nlrs with thiosulfate zou et al 2016 achieved complete denitrification under nlrs of 1236 3249 6 g n m3 d in fluidized bed reactors it is even possible to denitrify 100 mg no3 n l at a hrt of just 10 min at 20 c zou et al 2016 notably high rate denitrification can also be attained under unusual conditions like low temperature and low ph di capua et al 2017b maintained complete denitrification at 3 c under a high nlr of 3300 g n m3 d they also achieved high rate denitrification 100 g n m3 d at a ph of 4 75 by continuous co2 purging di capua et al 2017a elemental sulphur can achieve very high denitrification rates as well if both alkalinity and inorganic carbon supply are not limited by using bicarbonate 1 g l koenig and liu 1996 achieved nearly complete nitrate removal 99 2 from synthetic nitrified leachate no3 n 62 3 mg l at a short hrt of 1 2 h corresponding to a high denitrification rate of 1235 6 g n m3 d table 5 however sahinkaya et al 2011 could only obtain a maximum denitrification rate of around 200 g n m3 d when using limestone it is concluded that the dissolution of solid phase alkalinity carbon sources could be a rate limiting step in sulphur based denitrification especially at high nlrs sahinkaya et al 2014 the rate of isad 2 94 82 g n m3 d is generally much lower than that of reduced sulphur and soluble fe ii but can be higher than the solid phase fe ii table 5 among all types of iron sulphides fes sustains the highest denitrification rate of 70 82 g n m3 d with satisfactory removal efficiencies 80 further increasing the nitrate loading rate will results in a significant decline in the removal efficiency li et al 2013b natural pyrrhotite can also sustain efficient nitrate removal 90 with a denitrification rate 59 6 g n m3 d slightly lower than fes natural pyrite can only achieve efficient nitrate removal at loading rates of one order lower than that of fes and pyrrhotite the relatively low denitrification rate of iron sulphides is mainly attributed to their solid nature and crystalline structure section 3 3 which may limit their applicability in areas where high rate denitrification is required to overcome this enhancement strategies like using nano structured iron sulphides 165 g n m3 d table 5 can be explored this will be further discussed in section 6 2 2 on the other hand the relatively low denitrification may offer iron sulphides an advantage in circumstance where material stability outweighs reaction rate such as in situ groundwater remediation henderson and demond 2013 in summary iron sulphides are prolific electron donors for autotrophic denitrification with a high denitrification capacity self buffering is a unique feature of iron sulphides which avoids the ph change problems ph control requirement alkalinity supplementation associated with sulphur iron based denitrification isad also produces much less adverse denitrification products n2o nh4 and by product so4 2 h2s etc which makes them a viable option for nitrate removal despite their relatively low denitrification rate 5 open questions in anoxic microbial iron sulphides oxidation 5 1 dissolution of iron sulphides although anoxic microbial iron sulphides oxidation i e isad is an established fact the mechanism of this process remains largely unknown the central question is how iron sulphides as solid phase electron donors are utilized by bacteria since bacteria cannot ingest solid particles into their cells the only possible ways to utilize these solid phase electron donors are 1 direct electron uptake from the extracellular solid substrates and 2 the solid electron donors are transformed into soluble forms and then utilized by the bacteria direct electron transfer occurs via outer membrane redox proteins or solid conductive matrix i e nanowires kato 2016 both require in any case a close direct attachment of bacteria on the mineral surface bosch and meckenstock 2012 however recent studies reveal that 1 most of the cells could stay alive and active in free living form for a long time tong et al 2017b torrento et al 2012 and 2 the nitrate reduction rate of free living cells is close to the overall denitrification rate torrentó et al 2011 these results indicate that direct electron uptake is unlikely the predominate mechanism leaving dissolution of iron sulphides a prerequisite prior to microbial utilization this is consistent with the mechanism of aerobic iron sulphides oxidation schippers 2004 therefore the question now becomes how the iron sulphides minerals are dissolved prior to microbial utilization to answer this question it is helpful to consider the bioleaching models of iron sulphides which occurs under aerobic and acidic conditions rohwerder and sand 2007 in general two kinds of dissolution mechanism i e acidic dissolution and oxidative dissolution exist depending on the electronic structure of iron sulphides all pre pyritic iron sulphides e g fes fe3s4 fe1 xs fe7s8 etc have their valence bands derived from both the iron and sulphide orbitals these bands are prone to proton attacks leading to a break of the bonding between the metal and sulphur moieties sand et al 2001 consequently all pre pyritic iron sulphides are amenable to acidic dissolution with the liberation of hs h2s and fe2 eq 14 schippers 2004 under anoxic condition both products can be readily oxidized by sulphur oxidizing denitrifiers eq 15 and iron oxidizing denitrifiers eq 16 respectively schippers and jørgensen 2002 in eq 16 protons are produced which continue to dissolve the acid soluble iron sulphides therefore for pre pyritic iron sulphides their anoxic oxidation can be sustained by proton prompted dissolution fig 3 a this is consistent with the higher denitrification rates at lower feed ph values section 3 3 4 in parallel to the acidic dissolution pre pyritic iron sulphides may also undergo oxidative dissolution in the presence of a strong oxidant like o2 or fe iii ions rohwerder and sand 2007 schippers and sand 1999 the oxidative attack liberates fe2 and sulphide cations h2s as the first free sulphur compound eq 17 sulphide cations can also be formed from a single electron oxidation of h2s by fe iii ions eq 18 subsequently sulphide cations dimerize to free disulphide h2s2 which are further oxidized to elemental sulphur via higher polysulfides h2 sn correspondingly this oxidative dissolution pathway for acid soluble metal sulphides is named as the polysulfide mechanism the overall process can be simplified by eq 19 and 20 vera et al 2013 the final product elemental sulphur is chemically inert but can be biologically oxidized to sulphuric acid under both aerobic and anoxic conditions fig 3a 14 fes h hs fe2 15 5hs 8no3 3h 5so4 2 4n2 4h2o 16 10fe2 2no3 24h2o 10fe oh 3 n2 18h 17 fes fe3 2h 2fe2 h2s 18 h2s fe3 fe2 h2s 19 fes fe3 h 2fe2 0 5h2sn n 2 20 0 5h2sn fe3 0 125s8 fe2 h in contrast pyrite has valence bands entirely derived from its metal orbitals rendering resistance of pyrite against proton attack sand et al 2001 the chemical bonds between sulphur and iron atoms can only be broken after a total of 6 successive one electron oxidation steps by a strong oxidant therefore unlike pre pyritic iron sulphides pyrite needs in any case a chemical oxidation process to become dissolved rohwerder and sand 2007 in nature both o2 and f iii ions can serve as the oxidant for pyrite eq 21 and 22 but f iii ions are the more potent oxidizer and generally the primary attacking agent chandra and gerson 2010 sand et al 2001 schippers 2004 after the initial attack the bonds between fe and the two sulphur atoms are cleaved with the liberation of fe ii ions and thiosulfate eq 23 thiosulfate as the first free sulphur intermediate is rapidly oxidized to sulphate eq 24 via various sulphur compounds like tetrathionate disulfanemonosufonic acid and trithionate since thiosulfate is the key intermediate in the reaction series this oxidative dissolution pathway for acid insoluble metal sulphides is termed as the thiosulfate mechanism fig 3b through this process the solid phase electron donor pyrite is transformed into readily bioavailable forms i e fe2 ions under bioleaching condition aerobic acidic fe2 is biologically oxidized back to fe3 eq 25 which continue to dissolve pyrite overall fe iii ions play a key role in pyrite dissolution and the role of bacteria and o2 is to regenerate fe iii ions to sustain the bioleaching process 21 fes2 3 5o2 h2o fe2 2so4 2 2h 22 fes2 14fe3 8h2o 15fe2 2so4 2 16h 23 fes2 6fe3 3h2o s2o3 2 7fe2 6h 24 s2o3 2 8fe3 5h2o 2so4 2 8fe2 10h 25 fe2 0 25o2 h fe3 0 5h2o under anoxic condition no3 can replace o2 to regenerate fe iii by f ii oxidizing denitrifiers eq 16 therefore it is logical to infer that anoxic microbial pyrite oxidation follows the same mechanism as the bioleaching process i e coupled abiotic biotic oxidation of fes2 based on fe iii fe ii electron shuttle fig 3b schwientek et al 2008 torrento et al 2012 however this theory is doubted due to the following reasons 1 unlike the bioleaching process aerobic acidic anoxic microbial pyrite oxidation occurs at circumneutral ph 6 8 under which fe iii rapidly precipitates as fe iii hydr oxides and free fe3 ions are virtually non existent postma et al 1991 2 both o2 and fe3 don t exist at the beginning in anoxic pyrite oxidation how does the initial attack occur to start the electron shuttling mechanism bosch and meckenstock 2012 consequently the feasibility of anoxic pyrite oxidation has been doubted several times bosch and meckenstock 2012 jørgensen et al 2009 schwientek et al 2008 it is likely true that strictly anoxic pyrite oxidation cannot be initiated unless an initial oxidant is present traces of o2 in solution or fe3 from non pyritic ferrous iron oxidation bosch and meckenstock 2012 torrentó et al 2010 or its intrinsic solubility is greatly increased by size reduction to nanoscale bosch et al 2012 gartman and luther 2014 yet the fe redox cycling mechanism cannot be ruled out by the low solubility of fe iii at circumneutral ph early studies demonstrate that at circumneutral ph pyrite dissolution rate in anaerobic fe iii saturated solution is still much faster than that in o2 saturated solution although the fast rate could only last for a few minutes due to rapid depletion of the aqueous fe iii reservoir moses and herman 1991 moses et al 1987 several mechanisms could enhance the mobilization of fe iii 1 acid aided dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides both microbial fe2 oxidation eq 16 and oxidative fes2 dissolution eq 22 generate protons which may dissolve fe iii hydr oxides via protonation eq 8 or reduction eq 9 in the latter case eq 9 pyrite could act as the electron donor this is consistent with the stable ph during pyrite driven denitrification section 4 3 1 acidic microenvironments could also be created between cell mineral interface thus enhancing the release of fe3 ions from fe iii hydr oxides bosch and meckenstock 2012 mielke et al 2003 schwientek et al 2008 2 eps complexing and concentrating it has been demonstrated that bioleaching bacteria like t ferrooxidans and l ferrooxidans carry a considerable load of complexed iron iii ions up to 53 g l in their exopolymer layer which act the same role as free fe iii ions and greatly enhance pyrite dissolution sand and gehrke 2006 vera et al 2013 cells devoid of eps neither attach to nor oxidize pyrite sand et al 2001 a similar mechanism may also operate in anoxic iron sulphides oxidation 3 solubilization by chelating agents natural chelating agents salicylic acid oxalic acid citric acid humic substances etc can solubilize fe iii minerals by forming fe iii complexes liang et al 1993 peiffer and stubert 1999 schwertmann 1991 which have been shown effective in oxidizing pyrite at circumneutral ph luther et al 1992 1996 bacteria may also excrete fe iii chelating agents like siderophores to promote fe iii dissolution kiskira et al 2017 kraemer 2004 very small amounts e g several nm of free siderophores have significant effects on the solution saturation state of iron oxides kraemer 2004 in a genomic analysis it was revealed that t denitrificans contained a cluster of siderophore related genes which were significantly upregulated in fe iii limiting condition beller et al 2006b 4 sorbed fe redox cycling recent studies demonstrate that electrons removed from the pyrite core may be shuttled to fe iii within the oxide coating then lost on the surface through oxidation of fe ii gartman and luther 2014 percak dennett et al 2017 such a sorbed fe redox cycling would remove the fe iii solid phase solubility question in summary direct electron uptake seems if not non existing unlikely the predominate electron transfer pathway in anoxic iron sulphides oxidation that makes iron sulphides dissolution a prerequisite prior to microbial utilization unfortunately the dissolution mechanism under denitrification conditions anoxic circumneutral ph remains unclear for acid soluble iron sulphides their anoxic oxidation is most likely sustained by proton prompted dissolution despite the low solubility of fe iii at circumneutral ph fe iii fe ii electron shuttle may still play a central role in pyrite dissolution because pyrite can only undergo oxidative dissolution and fe iii is exclusively the oxidizing agent under anoxic condition jørgensen et al 2009 kiskira et al 2017 since dissolution is the rate limiting step in iron sulphides driven denitrification it is of great importance to clarify the dissolution mechanism in future study 5 2 direct substrate reduced sulphur vs fe ii following the above question on the dissolution mechanism another question is which component of iron sulphides is the direct substrate of the denitrifying bacteria iron sulphides comprise both sulphide and ferrous iron the stoichiometric equations eqs 1 4 imply that both sulphur and iron moieties contribute directly to the reduction of nitrate from an energetic viewpoint sulphide is a much more prolific electron donor than ferrous iron taking pyrite fes2 for example complete oxidation of s2 2 donates 14 electrons while fe2 only donates one electron therefore several arguments have been made that sulphur compounds are the preferential electron donors in microbial iron sulphides oxidation and oxidation of fe2 is not an important process which may occur only when the cell is emptied for sulphide edwards et al 2003 hansen and van berk 2004 korom 1992 postma et al 1991 this likely holds true for the acid soluble iron sulphides fes fe1 xs etc because reduced sulphur compounds hs s8 are the major dissolution products fig 3a a recent study found that sulphur oxidizing denitrifier s denitrificans was overall the most abundant 68 05 in a pyrrhotite fe1 xs based denitrifying biofilter li et al 2016b however for pyrite the conclusion is probably the opposite this is because fe2 could be the major dissolution product of pyrite fig 3b although most of the electrons are still derived from the sulphur moiety they are transferred to the form of fe2 ions which become the direct substrate of the denitrifying bacteria therefore unlike pre pyritic iron sulphides driven denitrification where microbial sulphur oxidation is the dominant process iron oxidation could be the dominant biotic process in pyrite driven denitrification given that sulphur based denitrification and iron based denitrification have different metabolic pathways and characteristics clarifying these issues is critical for process control and optimization 6 prospects limitations and future research needs 6 1 prospects for sustainable wastewater treatment current municipal wastewater treatment practice is facing three major challenges 1 high material and energy input li et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 2 large amounts of waste sludge generation 5 10 kg wet sludge m3 treated wastewater li et al 2015 and 3 increasingly stringent treatment standards nutrient emerging contaminants etc barbosa et al 2016 hu et al 2017 tran et al 2018 consequently municipal wwtps can have high carbon footprints zhan et al 2018 to address these challenges one emerging consensus is that future wwtps must improve their overall sustainability by reducing the consumption of energy and non renewable resources minimizing waste sludge generation enabling energy and resource recovery whilst meeting stringent effluent quality criteria li et al 2015 trimmer et al 2019 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 in the past decades tremendous efforts have been made to explore novel solutions to fulfil the above mentioned requirements anaerobic treatment has been widely regarded as an essential part of sustainable wastewater treatment owing to its capability in recovering bioenergy and minimizing waste sludge generation batstone and virdis 2014 li et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 to harness its benefits however efficient and cost effective removal or recovery of nutrient from anaerobic effluent is the key issue yet to be resolved li et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 many physical and chemical approaches adsorption struvite crystallization ion exchange electrodialysis etc have been attempted but have proven cost prohibitive or ineffective foresti et al 2006 hao et al 2013 li et al 2015 rittmann et al 2011 shi et al 2018 autotrophic denitrification processes hydrogen based sulphur based anammox appear to be the most logical option to couple anaerobic treatment for sustainable wastewater treatment owing to their intrinsic features such as eliminating the need for organic carbon and very little sludge production di capua et al 2015 of these options anammox is seen as the most promising qiu et al 2019 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 unfortunately although intensive research has been conducted there are numerous difficulties in maintaining its stability in the mainstream i e municipal wastewater conditions ambient temperature low nitrogen concentration etc cao et al 2017a hoekstra et al 2018 xu et al 2015 furthermore anammox is not efficient enough to meet stringent nutrient emission standards due to residual nitrate as a reaction by product and its inability to remove phosphorus ali and okabe 2015 cao et al 2017a as discussed above a viable technology for efficient and cost effective treatment of anaerobic effluent is the missing part to form a sustainable wastewater treatment train for future needs owing to its ability to simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphorus isad has a good potential to fit this need an iron sulphides based biotechnology towards next generation wastewater treatment neo green is illustrated in fig 4 and described as follows the treatment train starts with an anaerobic bioreactor e g anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr which converts organic matters cod to biogas based on recent pilot scale tests more than 90 of the influent cod can be removed under typical operational conditions of urban wwtps shin and bae 2018 the residual cod can be further removed in the nitrifying bioreactor by maximizing bioenergy recovery the system can potentially achieve net energy benefit galib et al 2016 mccarty et al 2011 subsequently the nitrifying biofilter converts nh4 in the anaerobic effluent to nitrate no3 as an established technology the nitrifying biofilter can ensure nearly complete nitrification with effluent nh4 n below 1 mg l peladan et al 1996 since most of the organic matters have been previously converted into biogas the oxygen demand and associated energy consumption are minimized finally in the iron sulphides bioreactor nitrate and phosphorus are effectively removed through isad effluent no3 n 2 mg l effluent po4 3 p 0 2 mg l table 3 another exciting hypothesis is that the iron sulphides bioreactor can also achieve an effective removal of emerging contaminants ecs iron sulphides have proven effective in removing a variety of ecs like chlorinated organic compounds and antibiotics via reduction and adsorption cao et al 2017b fan et al 2017 gong et al 2016 lan and butler 2016 its oxidization product iron hydro oxides can also effectively adsorb ecs like ppcps li et al 2018 yin et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 these physical and chemical processes will likely promote further biodegradation of ecs the spent iron sulphides are saturated by phosphorus p content of 37 5 as p2o5 li et al 2016b thus facilitating phosphorus recovery for example it meets the standard of phosphate ore p2o5 30 and can be used as feedstock by the fertiliser industry hao et al 2013 after p extraction the residue is rich in iron which provides a good opportunity for iron recovery the obtained iron phosphate can also be applied directly in organic agriculture as an environmentally friendly fertiliser and pesticide buhl et al 2013 nieminen et al 2011 through efficient p recovery from wastewater the neo green will contribute significantly to global sustainability and food security together this neo green concept will achieve energy and resources p fe recovery whilst ensuring excellent effluent quality moreover only consisting of anaerobic sludge yield 0 03 0 18 g vss g cod and autotrophic nitrification 0 07 g vss g n isad 0 186 g vss g n processes lei et al 2018 lu et al 2012 tong et al 2017a the overall treatment train would also have a minimized waste sludge production which has significant implications for reducing the costs and negative environmental impacts associated with waste sludge handling the feasibility of the neo green concept can be justified from the following aspects 1 process simplicity and robustness isad can proceed actively over a wide temperature range of 10 35 c li et al 2013b trouve et al 1998 and without the need of ph control the functional bacteria are highly cultivable and can be easily enriched from anaerobic sludge of local wwtps yang et al 2018b owing to its solid nature iron sulphides act as biofilm carries in addition to electron donors thus enabling simple reactor design such as up flow biofilter or fluidized bed reactor 2 lifespan depending on the type of iron sulphides e g fes or fes2 1 g of iron sulphides can remove 286 320 mg no3 n given a practical packing density of 1 85 103 kg m3 yang et al 2017a the iron sulphides bioreactor could last 15 years in theory at a common nitrogen loading of 0 1 kgn m3 d in municipal wwtps influent tn 50 mg l total hrt 12 h in practice the service time will be reduced by a certain extent due to operational issues like bed clogging and reduced denitrification rates after long term operation assuming a 50 reduction a long useful lifespan of 7 8 years can still be expected all these features ensure the broad applicability of this novel and sustainable wastewater treatment technology the key challenge to realize the neo green concept is the low denitrification rate of isad with natural iron sulphides other potential limitations are the local availability of iron sulphides sulphate emission and leaching of heavy metals these challenges are discussed in detail in the following section 6 2 limitations and future research needs 6 2 1 availability of iron sulphides iron sulphides are the most abundant sulphides minerals in the earth s crust and vastly distributed in hydrothermal deposits veins and replacements igneous rocks and sedimentary beds worldwide section 1 they are also continuously formed through microbial sulphur cycle fig 1 approximately 60 million tons of sulphur is buried as pyrite in sediments each year which far exceeds the currently global pyrite production of about 14 million tons per year rickard 2015 current market price for pyrite is as low as 100 300 ton in this regard iron sulphides can be considered as a cheap material of unlimited supply however the supply of iron sulphides can still be an issue due to the local availability of iron sulphides mines and the grade of iron sulphides deposits alternatively iron sulphides can be synthesised locally from cheap iron and sulphur sources iron oxides h2s etc via physicochemical or biological approaches gong et al 2016 the synthesis process also offers a good opportunity to produce more reactive iron sulphides materials such as nano sized or nano structured iron sulphides gong et al 2016 for enhanced denitrification rate site specific technical and economic assessments of the material supply routes will be needed in practical application 6 2 2 low denitrification rate as discussed in section 4 4 due to the solid nature and crystalline structure the denitrification rate of natural iron sulphides 10 70 gno3 n m3 d is considerably lower than other reduced sulphur compounds this can be acceptable for applications where slow processes is not a primary concern such as groundwater remediation however for applications where high rate denitrification is required such as in urban wwtps i e the neo green concept or drinking water treatment plants the applicability of isad would be restricted to fit urban wwtps with a small areal footprint a denitrification rate above 300 g n m3 d based on influent tn 50 mg l hrt for denitrification 4 h would be preferential apparently natural iron sulphides are far from meeting this requirement several strategies can be explored separately or in combination to overcome this limitation 1 size reduction or microscopic structure modification as discussed in section 3 3 2 although the denitrification rate 165 g n m3 d of the nano structed pyrrhotite yang et al 2017a is still lower than the desirable rate i e 300 g n m3 d the extra volume requirement can be made up by cancelling the secondary clarifier with fixed film configuration e g biofilter 2 using mixed electron sources such as s fes or fe fes reduced sulphur s0 s2o3 2 and fe2 generates h ions which would promote the dissolution of acid soluble iron sulphides e g fes fe1 xs thus increasing the denitrification rate similarly fe0 would promote the dissolution of fes2 eq 11 by generating oh ions it can also reduce the sulphate production of isad and 3 optimizing rector configuration for example bed fluidization can significantly increase the denitrification rate by enhancing mass transfer di capua et al 2015 6 2 3 sulphate emission high concentrations of sulphate in drinking water may cause laxness especially in combination with magnesium it may also induce salty taste of the drinking water and corrosion in the distribution system hence a maximal so4 2 level of 250 mg l is set in the drinking water standards ashok and hait 2015 when discharged into ecosystems sulphate would be microbially reduced to sulphide under sulphate reducing environments subsequently excess sulphide may reduce ferric iron from iron phosphate complexes and release the bound phosphate fig 1 resulting in internal eutrophication lamers et al 1998 smolders et al 2006 free sulphide may also damage rooted aquatic macrophytes by causing toxicity and iron deficiency smolders et al 2006 although isad generates much less sulphate 3 81 4 99 gso4 2 gno3 n than sulphur based denitrification 7 54 11 82 gso4 2 gno3 n section 4 3 2 sulphate emission may still become a concern in practical applications for example in groundwater remediation isad may still lead sulphate to exceed the drinking water standards 250 mg l if the nitrate level is high korom 1992 theoretically the maximal nitrate concertation can be dealt with isad is 47 76 mgno3 n l to ensure that both the nitrate 11 3 mgno3 n l and sulphate limits in drinking water are met if there is no background sulphate although sulphate emission in wastewater treatment is generally not controlled by regulations high sulphate emission is still undesirable due to the adverse ecological effects as discussed above therefore sulphate emission control should receive sufficient consideration in isad especially when dealing with high strength wastewater various physical reverse osmosis electrodialysis reversal chemical precipitation and biological technologies are available for sulphate removal with valorisation options arnold et al 2016 biological processes are generally considered more cost effective than the physical and chemical processes but it may be restricted for isad effluent due to lack of organic carbon in addition mixotrophic denitrification can be employed as an effective measure to ensure that the sulphate standard is fulfilled jin et al 2019 sahinkaya et al 2011 6 2 4 leaching of heavy metals natural iron sulphide minerals often function as a sink for some toxic trace metals pb2 zn2 cd2 hg2 as3 as5 ni2 etc table 6 yang et al 2017b zhang et al 2013 these metals may be released during iron sulphides oxidation indeed leaching of heavy metals table 6 has been a well registered environmental issue in aerobic iron sulphides oxidation i e acid mine drainage amd evangelou and zhang 1995 saria et al 2006 naturally it raises a concern about release of trace metals and subsequently metal toxicity in isad especially for groundwater remediation and drinking water treatment haaijer et al 2007 jørgensen et al 2009 torrentó et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 metals release in isad has been monitored in two recent studies li et al 2016b yang et al 2017a in contrast with amd the results show that metals release in isad is negligible and all the measured trace metals are far below the maximum contaminant level in the primary drinking water standards table 6 the negligible metals release in isad as compared with amd can be explained by the different ph ranges of the two processes amd results in a strong acidic condition ph 2 3 3 1 while isad occurs at circumneutral ph table 6 at circumneutral ph the mobility of most metals is significantly reduced furthermore the oxidized fe in isad forms fe iii hydr oxides which are strong scavengers for trace metals via adsorption and or co precipitation evangelou and zhang 1995 jeong et al 2010 to this end it may be concluded that leaching of metals should not be a concern in isad although comprehensive assessment is still needed in future studies 7 conclusions iron sulphides mediated autotrophic denitrification is a promising bioprocess for nitrate removal from a variety of organic deficient water and wastewater such as nitrate polluted groundwater nitrified domestic wastewater stormwater runoff and industrial wastewaters compared with other autotrophic denitrification processes iron sulphides based denitrification poses several unique advantages such as stable ph less adverse products generation sulphate nh4 n2o etc and simultaneous n and p removal these features make it a viable option for engineering applications like groundwater remediation advanced wastewater purification and wastewater reclamation it may also offer further opportunities to decontaminate emerging pollutants while removing nutrients given the renowned capability of iron sulphides and their oxidization

17875,iron sulphides mainly in the form of mackinawite fes pyrrhotite fe1 xs x 0 0 125 and pyrite fes2 are the most abundant sulphide minerals and can be oxidized under anoxic and circumneutral ph conditions by chemoautotrophic denitrifying bacteria to reduce nitrate to n2 iron sulphides mediated autotrophic denitrification isad represents an important natural attenuation process of nitrate pollution and plays a pivotal role in linking nitrogen sulphur and iron cycles in a variety of anoxic environments recently it has emerged as a promising bioprocess for nutrient removal from various organic deficient water and wastewater due to its specific advantages including high denitrification capacity simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal self buffering properties and fewer by

and minimize waste sludge production graphical abstract image 1 keywords autotrophic denitrification groundwater remediation iron sulphides phosphorus recovery sulphur oxidizing denitrification sod sludge minimization 1 introduction due to growing anthropogenic sources agricultural fertilizers wastewaters nitrate no3 pollution has become one of the most significant water quality issues ashok and hait 2015 kiskira et al 2017 one consequence of nitrate pollution is the threat to drinking water supply it is not uncommon for the groundwater nitrate level to exceed the drinking water standards 50 mg no3 l or 11 3 mg no3 n l torrentó et al 2010 which severely impacts the water supply strategies worldwide kanaparthi and conrad 2015 roques et al 2018 another international issue is that elevated nitrate levels can cause many adverse effects such as eutrophication harmful algal bloom hypoxia increased n2o emission and habitat deterioration ashok and hait 2015 therefore nitrate contamination must be under substantial control to prevent its public health and environmental impacts the most popular method for nitrate removal from water is heterotrophic denitrification heterotrophic denitrification is very efficient if there are sufficient organic carbon sources otherwise like in groundwater organic lacking wastewaters efficient nitrate removal is difficult to achieve via this process li et al 2013b adding an extraneous organic carbon source e g methanol ethanol etc is expensive and could lead to secondary pollution chung et al 2014 heterotrophic denitrification also produces large amounts of excess sludge which requires costly treatment and disposal tong et al 2018 nitrate removal can also be achieved by autotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification is conducted by chemolithotrophic denitrifiers which use inorganics as electron donors to reduce nitrate to n2 di capua et al 2015 major merits of autotrophic denitrification are 1 exclusion of organic carbon source which reduces the cost and the risk of secondary contamination and 2 very low cell yield which minimizes sludge handling zhou et al 2011 therefore autotrophic denitrification is an attractive option for nitrate removal from organic deficient water and wastewaters to date autotrophic denitrification can be divided into three major categories based on the electron donors zhou et al 2011 1 hydrogen based process in which h2 serves as the electron donor 2 sulphur iron based processes in which various forms of reduced sulphur and iron compounds e g elemental sulphur thiosulfate zero valent iron ferrous etc are utilized as the electron donor and 3 anammox process which employs anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria to transform nh4 and no2 to n2 due to their low cost ease of use and satisfactory denitrification performance sulphur iron based denitrification processes have attracted increasing interest ashok and hait 2015 kiskira et al 2017 shao et al 2010 naturally as a major source for both sulphur and iron in nature iron sulphides have been recently proposed as a potential electron source for autotrophic denitrification kiskira et al 2017 tong et al 2017a 2017b iron sulphides refer to a series of minerals composed of reduced sulphur and iron including mackinawite fes tetragonal troilite fes hexagonal pyrrhotite fe1 xs x 0 0 125 greigite fe3s4 cubic smythite fe9s11 hexagonal marcasite fes2 orthorhombic and pyrite fes2 cubic rickard and luther 2007 yang et al 2017b among them pyrite is the most abundant mineral on the earth s surface and pyrrhotite is the most abundant iron sulphide in the bulk earth rickard and luther 2007 accordingly they are often found in hydrothermal deposits veins and replacements igneous rocks and sedimentary beds chandra and gerson 2010 iron sulphides are also widespread in many sedimentary environments where hydrogen sulphide h2s generated from microbial sulphate reduction reacts with fe ii fe iii to form various iron sulphides bosch and meckenstock 2012 cutter and kluckhohn 1999 garcia gil and golterman 1993 vaclavkova et al 2014 mackinawite fes is generally the first iron sulphide formed jeong et al 2010 further sulfidation leads to the transformation of mackinawite to more stable phases such as greigite fe3s4 and finally pyrite fes2 gartman and luther 2013 therefore a mixture of pre pyritic iron sulphides mainly mackinawite and greigite are often found in natural sediments where iron sulphides are continuously produced vaclavkova et al 2015 as a mineral iron sulphides have little economic value but frequently accompany high value minerals like sphalerite chalcopyrite and galena thus they are generally discarded as gangue and undergo aerobic oxidation by acidophilic bacteria like acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans which produces acid mine drainage amd belzile et al 2004 chandra and gerson 2010 evangelou and zhang 1995 yang et al 2017b this process is known as pyrite oxidation or bioleaching and has been intensively investigated due to its significant implications in environmental quality and mineral recovery evangelou and zhang 1995 iron sulphides can also be oxidized under anoxic and circumneutral ph conditions where they are utilized by chemoautotrophic denitrifying bacteria like thiobacillus denitrificans t denitrificans for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to n2 gas di capua et al 2015 trouve et al 1998 due to their widespread distribution iron sulphides represent an important electron source for in situ denitrification and link major geochemical cycles nitrogen sulphur iron phosphorus in a variety of anoxic environments fig 1 de wit et al 2001 haaijer et al 2007 hayakawa et al 2013 jørgensen and kasten 2006 vaclavkova et al 2014 recently iron sulphides have emerged as an attractive electron source for autotrophic nitrogen removal in engineered systems such as groundwater remediation pu et al 2014 tong et al 2015 torrentó et al 2011 and advanced wastewater treatment kong et al 2015 2016 li et al 2016b liu et al 2012 tong et al 2017a 2017b 2018 yang et al 2017a compared with other electron sources e g sulphur iron iron sulphides display several unique advantages such as stable ph less sulphate generation and simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal kong et al 2016 li et al 2016b tong et al 2017a these features make it an attractive option for engineering application this review article aims at providing useful information to facilitate the understanding and development of iron sulphides based autotrophic denitrification isad for nitrate pollution control and sustainable wastewater treatment initially current knowledge about the isad process is presented following that the natural occurrence and engineering applications of isad are summarized its potential and limitations are elucidated by summarizing the key influencing factors and comparing with other autotrophic denitrification processes the attention is then focused on several key questions in the mechanism of anoxic iron sulphides oxidation finally its prospects for future sustainable wastewater treatment are highlighted 2 biochemistry of iron sulphides based autotrophic denitrification 2 1 biochemistry autotrophic denitrification based on iron monosulphide fes pyrrhotite fe1 xs and pyrite fes2 is described by eqs 1 3 schippers and jørgensen 2002 yang et al 2017a the overall stoichiometric equations show that the reactions between nitrate and iron sulphides are proton generating processes with n2 gas sulphate and fe iii as the end products for each gram no3 n removed 3 81 g or 4 57 g of so4 2 are generated and 0 39 g or 1 19 g of alkalinity as caco3 are consumed for fes and fes2 respectively to include microbial biomass c5h7o2n a stoichiometric equation eq 4 for pyrite driven denitrification was proposed by tong et al 2017a the equation predicts a low biomass yield of 0 186 gvss g no3 n compared with the yield of 0 68 gvss gno3 n in heterotrophic denitrification tong et al 2018 the low biomass yield has important implications for minimizing waste sludge production complete oxidization of the sulphur moiety to so4 3 leads to the transfer of eight and seven electrons for s2 in fes and s2 2 in fes2 respectively since no more than two electrons can be transferred in single redox reactions various inorganic sulphur intermediates sn 2 s2o3 2 s4o6 2 s3o3 2 s8 etc are formed during the multi step oxidation process schippers 2004 similarly accumulation of intermediate nitrogen compounds i e no2 no and n2o may also occur during the reduction of no3 to n2 korom 1992 1 no3 0 556fes 0 889h2o 0 5n2 0 556so4 2 0 556fe oh 3 0 11h δg 3817 kj mol 2 10fe1 xs 2 9 3x no3 16 12x h2o 9 3x n2 10so4 2

the iron moiety fe2 is oxidized to fe3 and precipitates as ferric hydr oxides at circumneutral ph resulting in thin coatings on the remaining iron sulphides core gartman and luther 2014 the form of the biogenic fe iii minerals is controlled by many factors such as phase dissolved or solid and concentration of fe ii oxidant type and concentration oxidation mechanism reaction rate redox potential and ph etc kiskira et al 2017 yang et al 2017b among them the level of free fe ii ions seems to have a significant impact on the form of the biogenic fe iii hydr oxides soluble fe ii stimulates the conversion of amorphous fe iii to more crystalline forms accordingly in soluble fe ii mediated denitrification most of the produced fe iii is in the crystalline fraction while iron sulphides oxidation mainly yields amorphous fe iii hydr oxide due to low concentration of free fe ii in solution senko et al 2005 this is an important feature since the porous structure of amorphous fe iii hydr oxide could mitigate the detrimental effect of iron encrustation gartman and luther 2014 which is the main challenge for fe ii mediated denitrification process kiskira et al 2017 wang et al 2017 fe oxyhydroxides usually have a high specific surface area ssa 10 132 m2 g and positive surface charges yang et al 2017b which make them efficient adsorbents for negatively charged compounds like phosphate eq 5 arsenate and organic matter kiskira et al 2017 yang et al 2017b phosphate may also precipitate directly with ferric ions to form iron phosphate eq 6 yang et al 2017b thus isad can simultaneously achieve efficient phosphorus removal from wastewater li et al 2013b 2016b yang et al 2017a more importantly the ferric hydr oxides coating may serve as a conduit and play a key role in electron transfer during iron sulphides oxidation gartman and luther 2014 percak dennett et al 2017 which will be further discussed in section 5 1 5 ppo4 3 fen oh m fen oh m po4 p 6 fe3 po4 3 fepo4 it is noteworthy that although the above equations eqs 1 4 are mass charge balanced and widely accepted they do not have any molecular mechanistic meanings the mechanism of anoxic iron sulphides oxidization i e isad remains largely unknown for example the stoichiometric equations do not reveal whether the dissolution of iron sulphides is necessary prior to microbial utilization iron sulphides generally have very low solubility and dissolution rate yang et al 2017b if dissolution is a prerequisite how does the slow dissolution rate match the rapid biochemical reactions the equations imply that both fe ii and sulphur are directly utilized by microorganisms which is not necessarily the case if the dissolution pathways are taken into account these key questions will be discussed in detail in section 5 2 2 iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers isad can be catalysed by certain sulphur oxidizing denitrifiers and fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers schippers 2004 the diversity of iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers is not well understood yet so far eight species have been reported to have the capability to denitrify with iron sulphides table 1 most of them are in the β subclass of the proteobacteria the best known iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifier is thiobacillus denitrificans t denitrificans has an unusual ability to oxidize inorganic sulphur compounds with either oxygen or nitrate kelly and wood 2000 this feature distinguishes it from all other thiobacilli and many known sulphur oxidizing bacteria sob which are obligate aerobes haaijer et al 2006 pokorna and zabranska 2015 its full genome sequencing has been completed by beller et al 2006a some notable genomic features include 1 a diverse complement of genes 50 relevant to sulphur oxidation sqr fcc sox dsr etc sqr and dsrc are upregulated under denitrifying conditions 2 genes encoding all the essential enzymes nar nir nor nos for complete denitrification 3 a large number of c type cytochromes which are likely involved in anoxic oxidation of metals such as fe ii and u iv 4 large numbers of genes relevant to inorganic ion e g fe3 transport and heavy metal resistance beller et al 2006a 2006b shao et al 2010 these genomic traits make t denitrificans quite versatile with respect to electron donors and acceptors being able to use a range of reduced sulphur compounds h2s s0 s2o3 2 etc and certain metals i e fe ii and u iv for dissimilatory reduction of various forms of oxidized nitrogen no3 no2 n2o etc fig 2 beller et al 2006a garcia gil and golterman 1993 kiskira et al 2017 t denitrificans grows over wide temperature 5 32 c and ph 5 8 ranges kiskira et al 2017 trouve et al 1998 although it generally grows best under mesophilic 28 32 c and circumneutral ph 6 8 7 4 conditions table 1 some strains can remove nitrate efficiently under low temperatures 5 10 c and low ph 5 trouve et al 1998 the metabolic and physiological versatility allows its ubiquitous distribution in anoxic ecosystems table 1 its ability to use poorly soluble minerals e g fes2 fes feco3 etc has also been well registered beller et al 2006a haaijer et al 2006 kiskira et al 2017 though the mechanism by which it can use solid phase electron donors is still unknown many laboratory and field studies have demonstrated its ability to oxidize iron sulphides with nitrate from the most reactive fes garcia gil and golterman 1993 straub et al 1996 trouve et al 1998 to the most stable fes2 bosch et al 2012 hosono et al 2015 jørgensen et al 2009 kolle et al 1985 torrentó et al 2010 trouve et al 1998 its metabolic repertoire and wide distribution imply that t denitrificans plays an important role in major biogeochemical cycles e g sulphur nitrogen and iron and particularly in natural attenuation of nitrate in iron sulphides rich ecosystems aquifers subsoils sediments etc beller et al 2006a haaijer et al 2006 t denitrificans was the only known bacterium which could oxidize pyrite with nitrate until recent studies demonstrate that some other sob can also denitrify with pyrite pu et al 2014 vaclavkova et al 2015 the first example is sulfurimonas denitrificans up to date s denitrificans and t denitrificans are the most well known sulphur oxidizing denitrifiers and the only species that can conduct sulphur oxidizing denitrification sod under neutral and freshwater conditions pu et al 2014 shao et al 2010 s denitrificans is widely distributed in sulfidogenic environments and contributes substantially to the global sulphur and nitrogen cycles shao et al 2010 sievert et al 2008 its full genome sequencing has been completed by sievert et al 2008 the genome data reveal that s denitrificans can oxidize a variety of inorganic and organic electron donors h2s s0 s2o3 2 h2 formate etc with oxygen and or nitrate fig 2 s denitrificans is also a complete denitrifier containing all the necessary genes for reduction of nitrate to n2 sievert et al 2008 in a recent study pyrite based denitrification was achieved with a mixed culture enriched from anaerobic sludge of a sewage treatment plant which contained s denitrificans pu et al 2014 the authors suggested that s denitrificans was responsible for the observed pyrite based denitrification in another study s denitrificans was found to be the dominant species 68 05 in a natural pyrrhotite based denitrifying biofilter li et al 2016b these results indicate that s denitrificans could be a key player in isad however due to the mixed nature of the enrichment in these studies further study with pure culture of s denitrificans is needed to confirm its ability to denitrify with iron sulphides another example is thiobacillus thioparus which is closely related to t denitrificans hutt et al 2017 shao et al 2010 accompanied by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria t thioparus often dominates in anaerobic enrichment cultures containing thiosulfate and nitrate robertson and kuenen 2006 taylor et al 1971 it is also frequently found in sulphur based autotrophic denitrification systems di capua et al 2016 2017b li et al 2016b zhang et al 2017 t thioparus has been demonstrated to be able to reduce nitrate using thiosulfate and thiocyanate di capua et al 2016 robertson and kuenen 2006 taylor et al 1971 woolley et al 1962 although negative results have also been reported in few studies hutt et al 2017 vlasceanu et al 1997 vaclavkova et al 2015 speculated and confirmed that t thioparus could also utilize pyrite to reduce nitrate notably t thioparus reduced nitrate faster than t denitrificans but to nitrite only which is in line with previous studies robertson and kuenen 2006 taylor et al 1971 woolley et al 1962 it seems puzzling that t thioparus cannot achieve complete denitrification since it contains operons encoding all the necceassy enzymes nar nir nor and nos of complete denitrification in the same arrangement as in t denitrificans hutt et al 2017 it is speculated that the expression of these genes in t thioparus might be affected by some unknown factors and denitrification may occur under micro oxic conditions rather than strict anoxic conditions hutt et al 2017 nonetheless accelerated anoxic pyrite oxidation without nitrite build up was realized by co culture of t denitrificans and t thioparus vaclavkova et al 2015 the authors therefore suggest that other sob may also involve in anoxic iron sulphides oxidization and different bacteria can cooperate with each other to achieve complete denitrification this hypothesis is supported by the results of li et al 2016b where different sulphur oxidizing denitrifiers including s denitrificans t denitrificans and t thioparus co existed in a natural pyrrhotite based denitrifying biofilter further studies are required to reveal the synergies between the different species based on genome information besides sulphur oxidizing denitrifers several fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers can also denitrify with iron sulphides kiskira et al 2017 straub et al 1996 demonstrated that acidovorax strain brg1 aquabacterium strain brg2 and denitrifying bacterial strain ton1 closely related to thauera selenatis were able to oxidize fes with nitrate hafenbradl et al 1996 isolated a neutrophilic hyperthermophile ferroglobus placidus from a shallow submarine hydrothermal system which demonstrated the capability of using both soluble and insoluble fes and feco3 iron sources to denitrify senko et al 2005 demonstrated that a klebsiella strain fw33an could denitrify with fes at a rate comparable to soluble fe ii however complete denitrification by fw33an seems unlikely since nirk and nirs could not be generated in repeated pcr experiments senko et al 2005 it s noteworthy that most isolated fe oxidizing denitrifiers are not obligate lithotrophs and need organic carbon as a co substrate to continuously oxidize fe ii and grow ilbert and bonnefoy 2013 kiskira et al 2017 straub et al 2004 this characteristic may limit their role in autotrophic denitrification one exception is the chemolithoautotrophic enrichment culture ks which has been demonstrated convincingly to denitrify with fe ii as the sole electron donor he et al 2016 tominski et al 2018a 2018b 3 natural occurrence and engineering application 3 1 natural occurrence of iron sulphides based autotrophic denitrification due to the ubiquitous distribution of iron sulphides isad is one of the most common natural processes for nitrate reduction in a variety of anoxic aquatic environments such as aquifers surface sediments and marine sediments table 2 many field studies demonstrate that isad is an important process for natural nitrate attenuation in groundwater where iron sulphides are commonly present in the form of pyrite beller et al 2004 jørgensen et al 2009 korom et al 2005 pauwels et al 1998 2000 postma et al 1991 schwientek et al 2008 tesoriero et al 2000 torrentó et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 2012 a typical sign of pyrite mediated denitrification is the depletion of nitrate along the depth of aquifers concurrent with build up of sulphate fe2 only when nitrate is exhausted and pyrite associated trace metals and a slight increase in ph bosch and meckenstock 2012 hansen and van berk 2004 postma et al 1991 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 the electron and mass balance analysis indicates that pyrite driven denitrification can be the dominant nitrate removal pathway in groundwater jørgensen et al 2009 pauwels et al 1998 2000 postma et al 1991 tesoriero et al 2000 more compelling evidence is provided by multi isotope analyses stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool to trace the sources and sinks of compounds in a variety of settings and to determine the physicochemical and biogeochemical processes that affect their transport and fates hosono et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 in a specific system the isotopic composition of a compound e g no3 which is expressed using the δ notation e g δ15nno3 rsample rstandard 1 1000 r 15nno3 14nno3 is determined by both the sources of the compound and any isotopic fractionation in the processes physical chemical and biological it involves in biological process usually has large isotopic fractionation which significantly changes the isotopic composition in general organisms preferentially use the lighter isotopic species resulting in the enrichment of heavier isotopes in the residual reactants and lighter isotopes in the products for example denitrification leads to an increase in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 due to the preferential utilization of lighter isotopes 14n and 16o by denitrifying microorganisms zhang et al 2012 furthermore a linear relationship exists between δ15nno3 and ln no3 i e δ15nno3 t δ15nno3 initial ϵn ln no3 t no3 initial if denitrification is happening with the slope of the line providing the enrichment factor ϵn for the reaction fukada et al 2003 heterotrophic denitrification leads to a significant decline in δ13cdic since co2 released by this process is sourced from 13c depleted organic carbon on the contrary autotrophic denitrification results in an increase in δ13cdic due to the preferable uptake of lighter isotope 12c of the dissolved inorganic carbon dic by autotrophic denitrifiers hosono et al 2014 2015 although sulphur isotopes undergo negligible isotopic fractionation during iron sulphides oxidation zhang et al 2012 different sulphur sources are distinguishable by their isotopic signature δ34s for example 1 atmospheric deposition 0 3 to 4 1 2 s containing fertilizers 0 to 7 3 contaminated surface waters 1 6 to 4 4 and 4 s bearing minerals e g fes2 30 4 to 11 8 schwientek et al 2008 due to the distinctly low δ34s value of iron sulphides isad will result in a notable decline in δ34sso4 by generating 32so4 2 therefore a decline of δ34sso4 in concert with an increase of δ15nno3 in water can be regarded as evidence for isad hosono et al 2014 schwientek et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 in addition to the isotopic composition changes different processes can have distinctive isotope signatures for example different studies on pyrite based isad have obtained similar εn εo ratios 1 04 1 18 hosono et al 2015 torrentó et al 2010 moreover the contribution of isad to the total n removal can be quantitively determined by coupling mass balance zhang et al 2012 by using stable isotope analysis several studies have identified pyrite as the dominant electron donor in groundwater denitrification bottrell et al 2001 otero et al 2009 schwientek et al 2008 torrentó et al 2010 vitòria et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 microbial analysis can provide complement evidence for isad jørgensen et al 2009 investigated the denitrification activity of anoxic sediment from a pyrite bearing sandy aquifer a clear tendency of nitrate decline over time in concert with sulphate rise was observed in sediment incubation tests adding pyrite significantly increased both no3 reduction and so4 2 generation rates by a factor of 2 3 while no significant no3 reduction or so4 2 generation occurred in the presence of a microbial inhibitor nan3 these results clearly demonstrated the occurrence of isad in the studied sandy aquifer jørgensen et al 2009 similarly torrentó et al 2011 observed increased denitrification in sediments and groundwater from a nitrate contaminated aquifer after adding pyrite which indicated the existence of pyrite oxidizing denitrifiers in the aquifer material microbial community analysis revealed that the supplementation of pyrite increased the abundance of denitrifying bacteria closely related to the xanthomonadaceae species which seemed good candidates for pyrite oxidizing denitrifier torrentó et al 2011 in another study bacteria closely related to sulphur oxidizing t denitrificans thiotrix nivea thiotrix unzii pseudomonas stutzeri and fe oxidizing gallionella ferruginea brg1 denitrifiers were detected in a heavily nitrate contaminated pyritic sandy aquifer by 16s rrna gene sequencing which were consistent with the conclusion from isotopic analysis that pyrite driven denitrification was the main process for nitrate reduction in the aquifer zhang et al 2012 isad also actively occurs in a variety of sulfidic ecosystems including marine sediments freshwater wetlands surface sediments wet meadows brackish marshes and tidal environments etc haaijer et al 2007 hayakawa et al 2013 schippers and jørgensen 2002 vaclavkova et al 2014 in these environments iron sulphides are often present in more reactive forms such as mackinawite fes greigite fe3s4 or a mixture of pre pyritic minerals vaclavkova et al 2014 2015 the potential and extent of isad are often evaluated by incubation of sediments with or without iron sulphides addition garcia gil and golterman 1993 haaijer et al 2007 hayakawa et al 2013 schippers and jørgensen 2002 vaclavkova et al 2014 through incubation tests schippers and jørgensen 2002 demonstrate that iron sulphide fes can drive denitrification in marine sediments and could play an important role in linking the sulphur nitrogen and iron cycles hayakawa et al 2013 observed significant no3 reduction coupled with so4 2 production during anoxic incubation of surface sediments which contained fes2 as pyrite and marcasite from a sulphide rich ecosystem in japan the observed microbial stoichiometry δso4 2 δno3 was close to the theoretical value of fes2 based denitrification eq 3 similarly vaclavkova et al 2014 found that isad accounted for approximately 30 of the total no3 loss in a variety of danish sediments aquifer freshwater wetlands coastal sites these results demonstrate that isad could be an important no3 depleting process in various sulfidic ecosystems in summary isad is an important process for natural nitrate attenuation and plays an important role in linking major geochemical cycles sulphur nitrogen iron etc further information on the quantity and distribution of iron sulphide minerals the rate limiting factors of isad and environmental controls on the relevant microbes would improve estimates of ecosystem wide denitrification and support better nitrate management jørgensen et al 2009 vitòria et al 2008 3 2 engineering application 3 2 1 groundwater remediation nitrate remediation in groundwater is difficult due to the long term diffuse and continuing nature of the nitrate pollution ashok and hait 2015 rivett et al 2008 a key limitation on groundwater nitrate remediation is the lack of organic carbon sources which restricts heterotrophic denitrification ashok and hait 2015 supplementation of organic carbon sources is costly and may lead to secondary pollution i e carbon and microbial breakthrough chung et al 2014 park and yoo 2009 as described above section 3 1 isad represents an important natural nitrate attenuation process in groundwater but its role might be limited by the quantity and reactivity of iron sulphide minerals in aquifers schwientek et al 2008 vitòria et al 2008 correspondingly a conceivable bioremediation strategy is induced isad by iron sulphides addition which has been assessed by several recent studies jin et al 2019 pu et al 2014 tong et al 2015 torrentó et al 2010 2011 xu et al 2019 using natural pyrite as the sole electron donor torrentó et al 2010 demonstrated that denitrification could be satisfactorily accomplished in presence of t denitrificans at typical nitrate concentrations in contaminated groundwater up to 70 mg no3 n l they further demonstrated that enhanced denitrification could be obtained by biostimulation of indigenous denitrifying bacteria with pyrite addition obviating the need for the inoculation of specialized bacteria complete nitrate removal lasting for 180 days was maintained in flow through experiments manifesting the durability of pyrite based bioremediation torrentó et al 2011 unlike zero valent iron zvi systems high permeability losses under geochemical conditions will likely not be problematic for the iron sulphides based system henderson and demond 2013 which makes iron sulphides a more suitable reactive material for in situ groundwater remediation using pyrite based autotrophic denitrification column as the permeable reactive barrier xu et al 2019 achieved effective nitrate removal with a removal efficiency and removal rate up to 94 5 and ca 12 mg l d respectively notably a significant decline in treatment performance was observed as the temperature decreased to from 30 c to 10 c xu et al 2019 therefore the impact of temperature variation under natural environmental conditions should be sufficiently considered in practical application further discussed in section 3 3 5 the potential of pyrite based denitrification is further highlighted by comparing with sulphur based denitrification pu et al 2014 tong et al 2015 both studies demonstrated that pyrite based denitrification could result in a favourable nitrate removal rate and much lower sulphate production especially it avoids the problem of sharp ph decrease in sulphur based denitrification therefore pyrite can replace sulphur for groundwater remediation to further reduce sulphate formation and improve nitrate removal jin et al 2019 developed a pyrite sawdust mixotrophic denitrification system by coupling autotrophic pyrite and heterotrophic sawdust denitrification the system successfully controlled sulphate at a very low level 33 mg l while meeting the drinking water nitrate standard overall engineered isad for groundwater nitrate remediation is still in its infancy but studies on iron sulphides for groundwater remediation are boosting demiya et al 2018 duan et al 2020 gong et al 2016 huo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 most studies have focused on removing more hazardous pollutants such as toxic metals hg2 cu2 pb2 cr6 etc inorganic oxyanions arsenite arsenate selenite etc radionuclides uranium neptunium etc and emerging organic pollutants chlorinated organic compounds nitroaromatic compounds polychlorinated biphenyls etc gong et al 2016 in most cases iron sulphides remove or immobilize the above pollutants through chemical reactions like reduction and precipitation apparently because nitrate is ubiquitous and commonly high in groundwaters isad and other remediation processes will be closely linked for example isad may interfere with reduction of radionuclides and chlorinated organic compounds by competing for the added iron sulphides on the other hand there may be synergies between isad and other processes surprisingly there are virtually no studies on the interactions between nitrate removal and other pollutants removal by iron sulphides yet a full understanding of these interactions should be the focus in future studies since it is critical to achieve effective groundwater remediation other future research needs limitations and challenges are discussed in section 6 2 3 2 2 advanced wastewater treatment besides groundwater remediation isad can also be a viable option for nitrate removal from a variety of organic deficient wastewaters such as nitrified wastewater stormwater runoff and industrial wastewaters liang et al 2019 ma et al 2019 tong et al 2017a 2017b 2018 its most valuable application is simultaneous nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal nitrogen and phosphorus are the main causes of eutrophication which represents a serious threat to the aquatic environment advanced tertiary wastewater treatment targeting simultaneous n and p removal is generally mandatory in urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide nutrient n p discharge limits for tertiary effluent are typically 10 15 mg l for total nitrogen tn and 0 5 1 mg l for total phosphorus tp heterotrophic biological nutrient removal bnr processes a2 o bardenpho uct sbr etc are the most widely used technology to reduce nutrient level in wastewater li et al 2008 rodgers et al 2004 although they have been proven cost effective insufficient biodegradable organic matter in wastewater is a common challenge for the heterotrophic bnr processes to meet the discharge standards adopting more stringent discharge permits e g tn 2 2 mg l tp 0 15 mg l is becoming a general trend in many countries hu et al 2017 which will further challenge the conventional bnr processes as described previously section 2 1 isad can achieve simultaneous n and p removal from organic lacking wastewaters in a simple and cost effective manner li et al 2013a yang et al 2017b this feature makes it an attractive option for advanced wastewater purification either to serve as a post treatment unit in urban wwtps to meet stringent nutrient discharge limits li et al 2013b 2016b liu et al 2012 yang et al 2017a or to form a simple integral system for onsite advanced wastewater treatment ge et al 2019 kong et al 2015 2016 liang et al 2019 the application reactor configuration and performance of isad in advanced wastewater treatment are summarized in table 3 and discussed in the following paragraphs the potential of iron sulphides for post treatment is first highlighted by li et al 2013b in a batch test the batch experiment was carried out with secondary effluent having no3 n of 14 9 mg l and tp of 3 9 mg l using chemical grade fes 300 g l no3 n decreased to 1 1 mg l after 16 h and tp was entirely removed in 4 h table 3 for practical application the most straightforward way is to form an up flow biofilter with natural iron sulphide minerals e g pyrite pyrrhotite etc as the packing medium li et al 2016b liu et al 2012 tong et al 2018 which is termed as particulate pyrite pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification ppad process liu et al 2012 invented a natural pyrite fes2 based ppad for secondary effluent polishing this simple cost effective technology produced a final effluent with n and p concentrations as low as 0 16 1 17 mg l and 0 0 71 mg l respectively when treating secondary effluent with high levels of nutrient no3 n 25 52 mg l tp 4 17 mg l natural pyrrhotite fe1 xs has also been proven efficient which could substantially reduce n and p in secondary effluent no3 n 21 1 6 mg l tp 3 4 2 2 mg l to 1 89 mg l and 0 34 mg l respectively however one major limitation of natural iron sulphide minerals is the low reaction rate due to their low ssa approximately 0 02 m2 g yang et al 2017a consequently a long hydraulic retention time hrt pyrite 5 d pyrrhotite 12 24 h is required to achieve satisfactory effluent quality table 3 which would constrain their application in urban wwtps to overcome this limitation yang et al 2017a developed a nanostructured pyrrhotite npyrr based ppad owing to its high ssa 10 28 m2 g the npyrr based ppad ensured excellent effluent quality no3 n 0 05 0 01 mg l tp 0 03 0 01 mg l at a short hrt of just 1 2 h table 3 this excellent treatment performance indicates immense potential of this technology as a valuable and viable add on to urban wwtps in meeting strict discharge standards achieving advanced wastewater treatment is more challenging in non urban areas where centralized wwtps with conventional bnr processes are cost prohibitive simple and low maintenance treatment processes such as constructed wetlands cws and soil infiltration systems are the most feasible options for on site wastewater treatment kong et al 2015 these systems can effectively eliminate organic matter cod however their ability in nutrient removal is limited resulting in high levels of nutrients in the effluent vymazal 2007 although intensified methods such as multi stage systems with effluent recirculation zhao et al 2018 step feeding hu et al 2012 or internal recirculation hu et al 2014 can improve nutrient removal performance a simple system with high nutrient removal efficiency is more desirable iron sulphides can address this need by forming simple integrated systems for example iron sulphides can be used as the main substrate in cws for enhanced n and p removal ge et al 2019 liang et al 2019 recent studies demonstrated that iron sulphides could enhance long term removal of nitrogen phosphorus and herbicide glyphosate in cws table 3 without negative impacts on growth of cws plants and other pollutants cod nh4 removal process ge et al 2019 another example is down flow bi layer vertical biofilter kong et al 2015 2016 in this system the top aerobic layer adapts regular filling materials sands volcanics zeolites etc where organics cod removal and nitrification take place the lower anoxic layer is filled with iron sulphides pyrite where nitrate and phosphorus are simultaneously removed kong et al 2015 2016 results table 3 showed excellent treatment performance by removing 89 cod 95 nh4 n 84 tn denitrification rate 532 gno3 n m3 d and 85 100 tp from domestic wastewater at a short hrt of 1 2 h kong et al 2015 these results demonstrated that iron sulphides can enable simple system design and operation to achieve cost effective advanced wastewater treatment 3 3 influencing factors the efficiency and reaction kinetics of isad depends on several factors including type and specific surface area of iron sulphides substrate and biomass concentrations ph temperature micronutrients and carbon source which are discussed in the following sections 3 3 1 type of iron sulphides iron sulphides constitute a diverse group of sulphur and iron compounds rickard and luther 2007 due to their difference in composition and structure their reactivity as electron donors is quite different the most widely used iron sulphides for denitrification are mackinawite fes pyrrhotite fe1 xs x 0 0 125 and pyrite fes2 mackinawite is metastable sulphur deficient iron sulphide with a tetragonal layer structure rickard and luther 2007 yang et al 2017b all studies have shown that fes is a readily accessible electron donor for denitrification garcia gil and golterman 1993 golterman 1991 haaijer et al 2007 li et al 2013b park et al 2015 schippers 2004 schippers and jørgensen 2002 trouve et al 1998 not only enhanced denitrification activities can be induced immediately by the addition of fes garcia gil and golterman 1993 golterman 1991 haaijer et al 2007 li et al 2013b park et al 2015 trouve et al 1998 but also denitrifying bacteria can be enriched from environmental samples using fes as the sole substrate schippers 2004 schippers and jørgensen 2002 pyrrhotite is a nonstoichiometric variant of fes displaying various superstructures based on a nias structure yang et al 2017b although it is a stable mineral pyrrhotite is susceptible to anoxic microbial oxidation li et al 2016b yang et al 2017a additionally a mixture of mackinawite and greigite fe3s4 which represents typical fes2 precursors in pyrite forming environments is also an easily accessible energy source for autotrophic denitrifiers vaclavkova et al 2014 2015 however the results based on fes2 are not always positive despite compelling evidence of pyrite driven denitrification in field section 3 1 and laboratory section 3 2 studies several studies declare that pure crystalline pyrite cannot function as an electron donor for denitrification haaijer et al 2007 schippers and jørgensen 2002 vaclavkova et al 2014 yan 2017 yang et al 2018b in comparative studies the denitrification rate of pyrite is always much lower than that of pre pyritic iron sulphides e g fes fe3s4 etc park et al 2015 trouve et al 1998 all these results reveal that the type of iron sulphides is a determiner for isad the different reactivity between pyrite and other forms of iron sulphides is attributed to their microscopic structure section 3 3 2 and solubility section 5 1 which will be further discussed in the following sections 3 3 2 specific surface area ssa another critical parameter determining iron sulphides reactivity is the ssa torrentó et al 2010 vaclavkova et al 2015 yang et al 2017a iron sulphides oxidization is a surface controlled process in which the oxidation is initiated and enhanced by defect sites containing fe species of reduced coordination bostick et al 2000 chandra and gerson 2011 these defect sites are more prevalent on amorphous iron sulphides associated with increased surface roughness i e high ssa bostick et al 2000 this explains why pure highly crystalline pyrite low ssa could not function as an efficient electron donor for denitrification haaijer et al 2007 schippers and jørgensen 2002 vaclavkova et al 2014 yan 2017 yang et al 2018b while low crystallinity pyrite high ssa could be oxidized microbially with nitrate yan 2017 in addition to increasing reactive sites high ssa also leads to better cell mineral interactions better solid liquid mass transfer and higher dissolution rates of iron sulphides ma et al 2019 torrento et al 2012 therefore ssa is a valid proxy for the overall reactivity of iron sulphides and strongly influences the rate of isad the higher the ssa the higher the denitrification rate torrentó et al 2010 vaclavkova et al 2014 2015 due to their crystalline structure natural iron sulphides e g pyrite pyrrhotite often display a low ssa 0 02 0 4 m2 g at micron sizes which limits the reaction kinetics vaclavkova et al 2014 yang et al 2017a therefore increasing iron sulphides ssa is the key to achieving high rate denitrification size reduction is the most common strategy to increase particle s ssa naturally the denitrification rate is significantly enhanced by decreasing iron sulphides grain size bosch et al 2012 bosch and meckenstock 2012 jørgensen et al 2009 torrentó et al 2010 vaclavkova et al 2015 by using nano sized pyrite particles bosch et al 2012 obtained a high denitrification rate 13 gno3 n m3 d which is up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of micron sized pyrite bosch and meckenstock 2012 alternatively high ssa can also be obtained by altering the mineral s microscopic structure for example yang et al 2017b developed a cost effective method to transform natural pyrite into nanostructured pyrrhotite npyrr by simply calcinating the minerals 600 c 1 h under inert atmosphere n2 after the treatment the product npyrr displays a porous honeycomb like structure with a high ssa ranging from 10 to 28 m2 g yang et al 2017b this high ssa enables npyrr to achieve a high denitrification rate of 165 g no3 n m3 d which is an order of magnitude higher than that of natural iron sulphides at similar grain sizes yang et al 2017a 3 3 3 substrate and biomass concentrations as a biological process isad is affected by both substrate nitrate iron sulphides and biomass concentrations garcia gil and golterman 1993 li et al 2013b tong et al 2018 for given amounts of substrates and biomass there is a maximal denitrification rate tong et al 2018 nitrate removal efficiency is dependent on the nitrate loading rate nlr when the nlr is far below the maximal denitrification rate the removal efficiency can be kept high and constant when the nlr approaches or exceeds the maximum denitrification rate the removal efficiency decreases rapidly although the denitrification rate could remain the same level li et al 2013b torrentó et al 2010 early studies demonstrate that nitrite is toxic to the denitrifying enzyme system of t denitrificans baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 claus and kutzner 1985 although the bacteria contain all the essential enzymes including nitrite reductase for complete denitrification section 2 2 denitrification is inhibited by nitrite at concentrations above 0 2 g no2 l claus and kutzner 1985 nitrite inhibition is confirmed by molecular analysis in a recent study in which t denitrificans was significantly enriched using nitrate but its abundance decreased to a low level when fed with nitrite chen et al 2018 the mechanism of nitrite inhibition on autotrophic denitrifiers has not been investigated yet a recent study on heterotrophic denitrification has revealed that free nitrous acid fna rather than nitrite is the actual inhibitor on nitrate reduction ma et al 2010 therefore it is reasonable to infer that the inhibitory effect of high nitrite on t denitrificans could be resulted from fna this is worthy of further study nonetheless appreciable accumulation of nitrite rarely occurs using regular micron sized iron sulphides minerals t denitrificans is also inhibited by sulphate the reaction product eqs 1 4 at concentrations above 5 g so4 2 l claus and kutzner 1985 this may confine the process s applicability to wastewater with a high nitrate content which results in high sulphate generation 3 3 4 ph ph is an important parameter affecting the microbial process the best known iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifier t denitrificans displays optimal activity over a narrow range of ph close to neutral 6 8 7 5 when grown on reduced sulphur compounds thiosulfate kelly and wood 2000 trouve et al 1998 vaclavkova et al 2015 both acidic 6 5 and alkaline 8 phs inhibit the microbial activity with severer inhibition under increasingly acidic conditions claus and kutzner 1985 trouve et al 1998 complete inhibition of denitrification has been observed at ph 6 claus and kutzner 1985 di capua et al 2017a liu and koenig 2002 oh et al 2000a trouve et al 1998 in addition to affecting the physiological status of microorganisms inappropriate ph may also induce secondary inhibitory factors such as fna as discussed in the above section therefore sufficient buffering is recommended to maintain a near neutral ph oh et al 2000a however the situation differs in isad although few studies have reported marked decrease in the denitrification rate due to acidic ph 6 2 torrentó et al 2010 2011 active isad under low ph of 5 6 typical in groundwater from arable lands postma et al 1991 has been observed in many field pauwels et al 1998 2000 postma et al 1991 zhang et al 2009 and laboratory studies jørgensen et al 2009 li et al 2013b vaclavkova et al 2014 in particular li et al 2013b demonstrated that increased acidity feed ph from 7 to 5 enhanced the denitrification rate from 14 to 17 5 mg no3 n l d in fes based autotrophic denitrification they also found that increased alkaline improved denitrification as well at feed ph between 7 and 8 but the denitrification rate decreased slightly at feed ph 8 li et al 2013b these results indicate that isad can occur actively over a wide ph range 5 8 especially under acidic conditions ph 5 6 this may attribute to the following reasons 1 environmental strains of iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers may have low ph optima di capua et al 2017a vaclavkova et al 2015 2 low ph promotes the dissolution of iron sulphides section 5 1 thus increasing the denitrification rate li et al 2013b and 3 iron sulphides are very effective buffering agent which can keep the ph of the system stable this will be further discussed in section 4 3 1 3 3 5 temperature temperature is one of the key factors affecting microbial activity iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers normally display mesophilic behaviour with a temperature optimum at approximately 30 c table 1 although effective isad under ambient temperature has been reported in many studies kong et al 2016 li et al 2016b tong et al 2017a 2017b yang et al 2017a lower temperature generally results in decreased microbial activities and denitrification rates jørgensen et al 2009 vaclavkova et al 2015 xu et al 2019 for example in a fes based study effective denitrification 17 21 mg no3 n l d was maintained at 10 35 c but it decreased sharply to 3 5 mg no3 n l d at 5 c li et al 2013b given the significant temperature variation under real environmental conditions the temperature impact on treatment performance should receive sufficient consideration during the practical application of isad notably some environmental strains also demonstrate psychrophilic properties trouve et al 1998 isolated several psychrophilic strains of t denitrificans which achieved a maximal denitrification rate at 10 c some of them can even achieve active denitrification at 5 c with efficiency as good as at 20 c trouve et al 1998 this throws light on maintaining active isad activity under low temperatures however whether these strains are widely distributed and how robust they can respond to temperature variation deserve further investigation 3 3 6 micronutrients and carbon source iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers prefer to use nh4 as their nitrogen source and need micronutrients such as mg2 po4 3 and fe2 to fulfil their metabolic requirements an early study demonstrated that the growth of t denitrificans was poor in media with less than 0 0083 nh4cl baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 li et al 2013b observed that nh4 up to 7 8 mg l as n significantly increased the denitrification rate in fes based autotrophic denitrification although denitrification still occurred in the absence of nh4 the rate decreased to ca 60 of the maximum similarly increasing concentrations of mg2 up to 0 24 mg l and po4 3 p up to 0 11 mg l significantly increased the denitrification rate li et al 2013b a small amount of fe2 0 25 8 3 mg l is necessary to sustain the growth of t denitrificans baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 but higher concentrations of fe2 may inhibit denitrification garcia gil and golterman 1993 observed complete inhibition of fes mediated denitrification when the free fe2 reached about 0 1 mm therefore care should be taken to avoid excess fe2 ions when using synthetic iron sulphides for denitrification as an autotrophic process isad is controlled by the availability of inorganic carbon sources co2 hco3 li et al 2013b found that for effective denitrification the concertation of hco3 should be maintained above 30 mg l inorganic carbon limitation hco3 30 mg l results in a rapid decrease of the denitrification activity li et al 2013b although organic co substrates are generally not required for isad baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 li et al 2013b since most of the iron sulphides oxidizing denitrifiers are obligate chemolithoautotrophs table 1 a small amount of organic carbon could enhance the overall denitrification rate possibly by promoting the mixotrophic process tong et al 2017b presence of organic carbon can also mitigate sulphate accumulation by inducing microbial sulphate reduction yang et al 2017a 4 comparison with other autotrophic denitrification processes besides iron sulphides autotrophic denitrification can also be supported by various reduced sulphur sulphide s2 elemental sulphur s0 thiosulfate s2o3 2 tetrathionate s4o6 2 sulphite so3 2 and iron compounds zero valent iron fe0 zvi ferrous salts minerals fe ii ashok and hait 2015 kiskira et al 2017 liu et al 2018 shao et al 2010 among them the prevalent electron donors are elemental sulphur thiosulfate zvi and ferrous iron the stoichiometric equations based on these electron donors are summarized in table 4 the comparison between iron sulphides and these electron donors in terms of dentification capacity denitrification products by products and dentification rate are made in table 5 and discussed in the following sections 4 1 denitrification capacity in this paper denitrification capacity is termed as the amount of nitrate n that can be denitrified per unit mass of electron donors g no3 n g substrate denitrification capacity is a key parameter in the selection of electron donors a high denitrification capacity can significantly reduce the operating costs by minimizing substrate consumption handling of raw material and maintenance requirements it is especially important for the solid phase electron donors e g s0 zvi ferrous minerals iron sulphides for these substrates are commonly used in biofilm systems biofilter packed bed denitrification wall etc ashok and hait 2015 di capua et al 2015 where the substrate s denitrification capacity is decisive to the system s lifespan the denitrification capacity of different electron donors is calculated based on the stoichiometric equations table 4 and summarized in table 5 as shown in table 5 elemental sulphur has the highest denitrification capacity with a value of 0 398 g no3 n g substrate iron sulphides have a high denitrification capacity between 0 287 and 0 321 g no3 n g substrate which is close to elemental sulphur and higher than thiosulfate 0 145 g no3 n g substrate reduced iron fe0 fe ii has the lowest denitrification capacity between 0 05 and 0 1 g no3 n g substrate the high denitrification capacity indicates that iron sulphides are prolific electron donors for autotrophic denitrification 4 2 denitrification products for nitrate removal via denitrification the desirable end product is innocuous gas n2 however nitrate can also be reduced to a variety of adverse end products such as nh4 nh3 no and n2o depending on the type of electron donor and reaction conditions nitrate reduction with zvi fe0 can proceed via two pathways table 4 1 abiotic reaction between no3 and fe0 with nh4 nh3 as the end product and 2 anaerobic iron corrosion abiotic followed by hydrogenotrophic denitrification biotic with n2 as the end product biswas and bose 2005 normally the first reaction dominates resulting in nh4 as the primary end product in fe0 driven denitrification biswas and bose 2005 liu et al 2018 to minimize nh4 production selective catalysts and or sophisticated control of the reaction conditions are required biswas and bose 2005 liu et al 2018 which limits the application of fe0 in autotropic denitrification besides nh4 n2o can also be a predominant end product in fe0 supported autotrophic denitrification till et al 1998 fe ii mediated denitrification is also prone to produce adverse end products such as nh4 coby et al 2011 robertson et al 2016 robertson and thamdrup 2017 weber et al 2006 and n2o carlson et al 2013 kampschreur et al 2011 wang et al 2016 kiskira et al 2017 conclude that the molar fe ii no3 ratio determines the end product of fe ii based denitrification high fe ii no3 ratios 7 5 induce microbial dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra while low fe ii no3 ratios 4 lead to significant production of intermediates such as no2 and n2o besides microbial processes abiotic reactions also contribute to the generation of adverse products for example no3 can be reduced to nh4 by green rusts mixed fe ii fe iii hydroxides an intermediate in fe ii oxidization at rates of similar magnitude or even higher than the microbial reduction etique et al 2014 hansen et al 1996 no2 reacts with soluble fe ii rapidly with n2o as the principal product carlson et al 2012 moraghan and buresh 1977 this chemical reaction can be a significant cause of n2o emission in soluble fe ii mediated denitrification when no2 is present at elevated concentrations kampschreur et al 2011 klueglein et al 2014 to minimize adverse end products generation the fe ii no3 ratio should be kept around 5 kiskira et al 2017 which requires careful process control reduced sulphur normally doesn t lead to nh4 generation except for free sulphide h2s and s2 which induces dnra by inhibiting no and n2o reductases burgin and hamilton 2007 n2o generation only occurs under high no3 concentrations and loading rates in elemental sulphur driven denitrification park et al 2002 thiosulfate is known to inhibit nitrification resulting in no n2o emission saad et al 1996 but it does not affect denitrification saad et al 1996 yang et al 2018b in the case of iron sulphides most studies demonstrate that the final products are n gaseous compounds pauwels et al 1998 postma et al 1991 torrentó et al 2010 appreciable increase of nh4 has never been observed ruling out dnra in isad although only a few studies have analysed the n gaseous compounds the possibility of n2o production in isad should be smaller than that of sulphur and iron based denitrification for the compounds free sulphide and fe2 that induce n2o production barely exist in iron sulphides based systems haaijer et al 2007 tong et al 2017a zhang et al 2009 in a recent study yang et al 2017a verified that n2o was undetectable in pyrrhotite based denitrification even if considerable no2 accumulation occurred similarly taghizadeh toosi et al 2019 concluded that isad did not lead to n2o emission these results demonstrate that iron sulphides are good electron donors for denitrification with less adverse end products production 4 3 by products 4 3 1 acids bases generation maintaining stable ph is of great importance to denitrification since the ph optimum for most environmental strains of denitrifying bacteria is between 7 and 8 jha and bose 2005 oh et al 2000a unfortunately iron and sulphur based autotrophic denitrification processes generate acids or bases as the reaction by products which represent a major operational issue in their application as shown in table 4 both the abiotic and biotic nitrate reduction by fe0 result in oh ions generation which often elevates the ph of the system rapidly to above 10 hwang et al 2011 till et al 1998 high ph values deteriorate denitrification by abruptly inhibiting microbial activity and hindering fe0 reactivity due to formation of oxide deposition precipitation etc till et al 1998 therefore proper buffering co2 aluminosilicate minerals pyrite etc must be provided to prevent excessive ph increase in fe0 driven denitrification biswas and bose 2005 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 till et al 1998 contrary to fe0 f ii and sulphur s0 s2o3 2 etc driven denitrification result in appreciable acids generation table 5 fe ii mediated denitrification generates 9 14 mol h ions per mole no3 removed which would acidify the reaction system rapidly zhang et al 2015 since fe ii oxidizing denitrifiers are neutrophilic hedrich et al 2011 low ph values 6 seriously repress microbial activity kiskira et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in addition low ph may increase the redox potential of the fe iii fe ii couple to close to or even above the no3 no2 couple 0 43 v making denitrification thermodynamically unfavourable ilbert and bonnefoy 2013 dramatic ph drop is also a well registered problem in sulphur based denitrification which results in severe or complete inhibition of denitrification koenig and liu 2001 kong et al 2014 liu and koenig 2002 moon et al 2006 oh et al 2000b sahinkaya et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 to maintain a favourable ph range 6 8 8 2 external alkalinity sources like bicarbonate need to be consistently supplied which would result in substantial costs chung et al 2014 liu and koenig 2002 various solid alkalinity sources limestone oyster shell calcite dolomite etc have been explored as low cost buffering agents but their applicability could be limited by issues like low dissolution rate availability of materials and increased hardness of treated water chung et al 2014 moon et al 2006 sahinkaya et al 2015 although isad is also an acid producing process tables 4 and 5 it is a common observation that ph remains stable during the reaction hayakawa et al 2013 jørgensen et al 2009 kong et al 2016 postma et al 1991 pu et al 2014 tong et al 2017a yang et al 2017a for example in a field study the ph of water for pyrite driven denitrification was predicted to decrease to 4 by modelling but the field data did not indicate any significant ph drop postma et al 1991 in a comparative study of sulphur and pyrite based denitrification the pyrite reactor maintained a stable ph above 7 while the ph in the sulphur reactor continued to decline to below 4 kong et al 2016 these results demonstrate that isad is a ph buffering process and thus avoids the ph drop problem commonly found in fe ii and sulphur based denitrification the resistance of iron sulphides system to acidification may be attributed to the following buffer mechanisms 1 iron sulphides arrest h ions via proton promoted dissolution eq 7 rickard 2006 schippers and jørgensen 2002 or sorption henderson and demond 2013 2 the product of iron sulphides oxidation ferric oxyhydroxides arrests h ions via protonation eq 8 reduction eq 9 and or complexation eq 10 postma et al 1991 schwertmann 1991 the second mechanism seems more important for pyrite driven denitrification because pyrite is acid insoluble and ferric oxyhydroxides seem to be the only buffer agent in the system it may seem conflict with the fact that ferric oxyhydroxides are also the product of fe ii oxidizing denitrification where ph drop is a common problem two plausible explanations are 1 the ferric oxyhydroxides produced in isad are amorphous which might be more susceptible to proton attack than the crystalline iron hydr oxides formed in the fe ii based denitrification 2 iron sulphides may promote reductive dissolution of the ferric oxyhydroxides eq 9 by providing electrons further discussed in 5 1 while this mechanism is lacking in the fe ii based denitrification further studies are required to clarify these issues 7 fes h fe2 hs 8 feooh h fe oh 2 9 feooh 3h e fe2 2h2o 10 feooh 3h nl ligand feln 3 n 2h2o iron sulphides fes2 can also prevent ph rise by arresting hydroxide ions oh although the mechanism is still not known with certainty jha and bose 2005 suggest that fes2 undergoes oxidative dissolution as per eq 11 and speculate that ferric oxy hydroxide acts as the oxidant as a result ferrous ions are released and consume oh ions through fe oh 2 precipitation alternatively burris et al 1995 suggest that fes2 is dissolved via disproportionation reaction in which h2s is produced and consumes oh ions nonetheless several studies demonstrate that fes2 can act as an effective buffering agent in a system e g fe0 based denitrification where oh ions are constantly added or generated burris et al 1995 devlin et al 2000 holser et al 1995 jha and bose 2005 11 fes2 18oh fe oh 2 2so4 2 14e 8h2o 4 3 2 sulphate generation sulphate is an inevitable by product in sulphur and iron sulphides based denitrification table 4 which results in elevated sulphate concertation in the treated water a high level of sulphate can cause several adverse effects which will be further discussed in section 6 2 3 the sulphate production of sulphur s0 s2o3 2 and iron sulphides fes fe1 xs fes2 based denitrification is compared in table 5 as shown in table 5 elemental sulphur and thiosulfate based denitrification produce 7 54 mg and 11 82 mg so4 2 per mg no3 n removal respectively this high sulphate production represents a major disadvantage of sulphur based denitrification ashok and hait 2015 theoretically only 33 mg l and 21 mg l no3 n can be denitrified using elemental sulphur and thiosulfate without exceeding the sulphate limit of 250 mg l in drinking water if the water being treated has no background sulphate sahinkaya et al 2011 in contrast isad generates much less sulphate with a yield of only 3 81 3 81 3 98 4 99 mg so4 2 per mg no3 n removal for fes fe1 xs and fes2 respectively the much lower sulphate production makes iron sulphides a more viable option than the reduced sulphur compounds s0 s2o3 2 especially when sulphate level has to be under strict control groundwater remediation drinking water treatment etc kong et al 2016 tong et al 2017a to alleviate sulphate accumulation various methods such as post treatment kong et al 2014 mixotrophic denitrification li et al 2016a sahinkaya et al 2011 and autotrophic denitrification via nitrite chung et al 2014 are proposed for sulphur based denitrification these methods can also be applied to isad additionally a lower sulphate production than the stoichiometric calculation is often observed in isad which would be helpful to reduce the sulphate accumulation pauwels et al 1998 2000 tong et al 2017a 2017b torrentó et al 2010 yang et al 2017a zhang et al 2009 2012 several mechanisms may contribute to the lower sulphate production 1 incomplete oxidization of iron sulphides which results in the accumulation of intermediate sulphur species s0 so3 2 etc instead of sulphate zhang et al 2009 2012 however this would be only a temporary effect 2 precipitation of sulphate minerals such as jarosite kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 and natroalunite naal3 so4 2 oh 6 pauwels et al 1998 2000 this is more likely to occur in aquifers where the relevant ions fe3 al3 etc are present 3 the reaction stoichiometry is changed due to physiological response to extreme conditions e g low temperature trouve et al 1998 4 the involvement of heterotrophic denitrification ma et al 2019 torrentó et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 and or microbial sulphate reduction tong et al 2017b yang et al 2017a zhang et al 2009 both processes require organic substrates which could be sourced from lysed cells and or residual organic carbon in the inflow torrentó et al 2011 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017a confirmed the occurrence of microbial sulphate reduction in a pyrrhotite based ppad by the detection of sulphate reducing bacteria sulphate reduction also occurs in sulphur based denitrification systems moon et al 2004 sahinkaya et al 2014 tong et al 2017a which could be a troublesome issue due to h2s emission in iron sulphides systems h2s would be arrested by iron hydr oxides as per eq 12 and 13 davydov et al 1998 by such not only the h2s related problems are avoided but also the iron sulphides are regenerated yang et al 2017a however these useful processes are likely to be limited by organic deficiency 12 2fe oh 3 3h2s 2fes 1 8s8 6h2o 13 2fe oh 3 3h2s fe2s3 6h2o 4 4 denitrification rate different rate units have been used across literatures based on available information the denitrification rate unit is standardized as the volumetric removal rate g n m3 d in this article to fairly compare the denitrification rate we urge that all relevant information material weight size surface area reactor volume should be provided in future studies high rate denitrification 400 g n m3 d can be obtained with zvi by increasing the ssa e g nanoscale zvi nzvi and iron dosage table 5 however the denitrification product under such conditions is principally nh4 due to the rapid abiotic reaction table 4 low ssa low iron dosage or avoiding direct contact between iron and nitrate is thus required to minimize nh4 generation at the cost of a significant decline of the denitrification rate an et al 2009 biswas and bose 2005 di capua et al 2015 sunger and bose 2009 for example biswas and bose 2005 found that using low ssa steel wool 0 0075 m2 g at a low dosage could minimize nh4 yield but a long hrt of above 13 days was necessary for complete denitrification of 40 mg l no3 n an et al 2009 decreased nh4 yield from 51 to 19 by decreasing nzvi dosage from 0 7 to 0 42 g l but the denitrification rate declined significantly from 1 25 to 0 63 g n m3 d by separating iron corrosion h2 generation and hydrogenotrophic denitrification in different reactors sunger and bose 2009 successfully avoided nh4 generation but the denitrification rate was only 0 0289 g n m3 d therefore for genuine nitrate removal to n2 fe0 driven denitrification should be regarded as a slow process the rate of fe ii mediated denitrification depends on the form of fe ii dissolved fe ii e g feso4 can achieve a high denitrification rate of 90 200 g n m3 d table 5 however after a long term operation cell encrustation could occur due to the generated fe iii precipitates which leads to significant decline of the denitrification rate wang et al 2017 therefore long term stability of high rate denitrification remains a challenge for dissolved fe ii based systems when using solid phase fe ii e g feco3 the denitrification rate will be reduced by an order of magnitude yang et al 2018a table 5 being a highly bioavailable electron donor thiosulfate can sustain efficient autotrophic denitrification at very high nlrs with thiosulfate zou et al 2016 achieved complete denitrification under nlrs of 1236 3249 6 g n m3 d in fluidized bed reactors it is even possible to denitrify 100 mg no3 n l at a hrt of just 10 min at 20 c zou et al 2016 notably high rate denitrification can also be attained under unusual conditions like low temperature and low ph di capua et al 2017b maintained complete denitrification at 3 c under a high nlr of 3300 g n m3 d they also achieved high rate denitrification 100 g n m3 d at a ph of 4 75 by continuous co2 purging di capua et al 2017a elemental sulphur can achieve very high denitrification rates as well if both alkalinity and inorganic carbon supply are not limited by using bicarbonate 1 g l koenig and liu 1996 achieved nearly complete nitrate removal 99 2 from synthetic nitrified leachate no3 n 62 3 mg l at a short hrt of 1 2 h corresponding to a high denitrification rate of 1235 6 g n m3 d table 5 however sahinkaya et al 2011 could only obtain a maximum denitrification rate of around 200 g n m3 d when using limestone it is concluded that the dissolution of solid phase alkalinity carbon sources could be a rate limiting step in sulphur based denitrification especially at high nlrs sahinkaya et al 2014 the rate of isad 2 94 82 g n m3 d is generally much lower than that of reduced sulphur and soluble fe ii but can be higher than the solid phase fe ii table 5 among all types of iron sulphides fes sustains the highest denitrification rate of 70 82 g n m3 d with satisfactory removal efficiencies 80 further increasing the nitrate loading rate will results in a significant decline in the removal efficiency li et al 2013b natural pyrrhotite can also sustain efficient nitrate removal 90 with a denitrification rate 59 6 g n m3 d slightly lower than fes natural pyrite can only achieve efficient nitrate removal at loading rates of one order lower than that of fes and pyrrhotite the relatively low denitrification rate of iron sulphides is mainly attributed to their solid nature and crystalline structure section 3 3 which may limit their applicability in areas where high rate denitrification is required to overcome this enhancement strategies like using nano structured iron sulphides 165 g n m3 d table 5 can be explored this will be further discussed in section 6 2 2 on the other hand the relatively low denitrification may offer iron sulphides an advantage in circumstance where material stability outweighs reaction rate such as in situ groundwater remediation henderson and demond 2013 in summary iron sulphides are prolific electron donors for autotrophic denitrification with a high denitrification capacity self buffering is a unique feature of iron sulphides which avoids the ph change problems ph control requirement alkalinity supplementation associated with sulphur iron based denitrification isad also produces much less adverse denitrification products n2o nh4 and by product so4 2 h2s etc which makes them a viable option for nitrate removal despite their relatively low denitrification rate 5 open questions in anoxic microbial iron sulphides oxidation 5 1 dissolution of iron sulphides although anoxic microbial iron sulphides oxidation i e isad is an established fact the mechanism of this process remains largely unknown the central question is how iron sulphides as solid phase electron donors are utilized by bacteria since bacteria cannot ingest solid particles into their cells the only possible ways to utilize these solid phase electron donors are 1 direct electron uptake from the extracellular solid substrates and 2 the solid electron donors are transformed into soluble forms and then utilized by the bacteria direct electron transfer occurs via outer membrane redox proteins or solid conductive matrix i e nanowires kato 2016 both require in any case a close direct attachment of bacteria on the mineral surface bosch and meckenstock 2012 however recent studies reveal that 1 most of the cells could stay alive and active in free living form for a long time tong et al 2017b torrento et al 2012 and 2 the nitrate reduction rate of free living cells is close to the overall denitrification rate torrentó et al 2011 these results indicate that direct electron uptake is unlikely the predominate mechanism leaving dissolution of iron sulphides a prerequisite prior to microbial utilization this is consistent with the mechanism of aerobic iron sulphides oxidation schippers 2004 therefore the question now becomes how the iron sulphides minerals are dissolved prior to microbial utilization to answer this question it is helpful to consider the bioleaching models of iron sulphides which occurs under aerobic and acidic conditions rohwerder and sand 2007 in general two kinds of dissolution mechanism i e acidic dissolution and oxidative dissolution exist depending on the electronic structure of iron sulphides all pre pyritic iron sulphides e g fes fe3s4 fe1 xs fe7s8 etc have their valence bands derived from both the iron and sulphide orbitals these bands are prone to proton attacks leading to a break of the bonding between the metal and sulphur moieties sand et al 2001 consequently all pre pyritic iron sulphides are amenable to acidic dissolution with the liberation of hs h2s and fe2 eq 14 schippers 2004 under anoxic condition both products can be readily oxidized by sulphur oxidizing denitrifiers eq 15 and iron oxidizing denitrifiers eq 16 respectively schippers and jørgensen 2002 in eq 16 protons are produced which continue to dissolve the acid soluble iron sulphides therefore for pre pyritic iron sulphides their anoxic oxidation can be sustained by proton prompted dissolution fig 3 a this is consistent with the higher denitrification rates at lower feed ph values section 3 3 4 in parallel to the acidic dissolution pre pyritic iron sulphides may also undergo oxidative dissolution in the presence of a strong oxidant like o2 or fe iii ions rohwerder and sand 2007 schippers and sand 1999 the oxidative attack liberates fe2 and sulphide cations h2s as the first free sulphur compound eq 17 sulphide cations can also be formed from a single electron oxidation of h2s by fe iii ions eq 18 subsequently sulphide cations dimerize to free disulphide h2s2 which are further oxidized to elemental sulphur via higher polysulfides h2 sn correspondingly this oxidative dissolution pathway for acid soluble metal sulphides is named as the polysulfide mechanism the overall process can be simplified by eq 19 and 20 vera et al 2013 the final product elemental sulphur is chemically inert but can be biologically oxidized to sulphuric acid under both aerobic and anoxic conditions fig 3a 14 fes h hs fe2 15 5hs 8no3 3h 5so4 2 4n2 4h2o 16 10fe2 2no3 24h2o 10fe oh 3 n2 18h 17 fes fe3 2h 2fe2 h2s 18 h2s fe3 fe2 h2s 19 fes fe3 h 2fe2 0 5h2sn n 2 20 0 5h2sn fe3 0 125s8 fe2 h in contrast pyrite has valence bands entirely derived from its metal orbitals rendering resistance of pyrite against proton attack sand et al 2001 the chemical bonds between sulphur and iron atoms can only be broken after a total of 6 successive one electron oxidation steps by a strong oxidant therefore unlike pre pyritic iron sulphides pyrite needs in any case a chemical oxidation process to become dissolved rohwerder and sand 2007 in nature both o2 and f iii ions can serve as the oxidant for pyrite eq 21 and 22 but f iii ions are the more potent oxidizer and generally the primary attacking agent chandra and gerson 2010 sand et al 2001 schippers 2004 after the initial attack the bonds between fe and the two sulphur atoms are cleaved with the liberation of fe ii ions and thiosulfate eq 23 thiosulfate as the first free sulphur intermediate is rapidly oxidized to sulphate eq 24 via various sulphur compounds like tetrathionate disulfanemonosufonic acid and trithionate since thiosulfate is the key intermediate in the reaction series this oxidative dissolution pathway for acid insoluble metal sulphides is termed as the thiosulfate mechanism fig 3b through this process the solid phase electron donor pyrite is transformed into readily bioavailable forms i e fe2 ions under bioleaching condition aerobic acidic fe2 is biologically oxidized back to fe3 eq 25 which continue to dissolve pyrite overall fe iii ions play a key role in pyrite dissolution and the role of bacteria and o2 is to regenerate fe iii ions to sustain the bioleaching process 21 fes2 3 5o2 h2o fe2 2so4 2 2h 22 fes2 14fe3 8h2o 15fe2 2so4 2 16h 23 fes2 6fe3 3h2o s2o3 2 7fe2 6h 24 s2o3 2 8fe3 5h2o 2so4 2 8fe2 10h 25 fe2 0 25o2 h fe3 0 5h2o under anoxic condition no3 can replace o2 to regenerate fe iii by f ii oxidizing denitrifiers eq 16 therefore it is logical to infer that anoxic microbial pyrite oxidation follows the same mechanism as the bioleaching process i e coupled abiotic biotic oxidation of fes2 based on fe iii fe ii electron shuttle fig 3b schwientek et al 2008 torrento et al 2012 however this theory is doubted due to the following reasons 1 unlike the bioleaching process aerobic acidic anoxic microbial pyrite oxidation occurs at circumneutral ph 6 8 under which fe iii rapidly precipitates as fe iii hydr oxides and free fe3 ions are virtually non existent postma et al 1991 2 both o2 and fe3 don t exist at the beginning in anoxic pyrite oxidation how does the initial attack occur to start the electron shuttling mechanism bosch and meckenstock 2012 consequently the feasibility of anoxic pyrite oxidation has been doubted several times bosch and meckenstock 2012 jørgensen et al 2009 schwientek et al 2008 it is likely true that strictly anoxic pyrite oxidation cannot be initiated unless an initial oxidant is present traces of o2 in solution or fe3 from non pyritic ferrous iron oxidation bosch and meckenstock 2012 torrentó et al 2010 or its intrinsic solubility is greatly increased by size reduction to nanoscale bosch et al 2012 gartman and luther 2014 yet the fe redox cycling mechanism cannot be ruled out by the low solubility of fe iii at circumneutral ph early studies demonstrate that at circumneutral ph pyrite dissolution rate in anaerobic fe iii saturated solution is still much faster than that in o2 saturated solution although the fast rate could only last for a few minutes due to rapid depletion of the aqueous fe iii reservoir moses and herman 1991 moses et al 1987 several mechanisms could enhance the mobilization of fe iii 1 acid aided dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides both microbial fe2 oxidation eq 16 and oxidative fes2 dissolution eq 22 generate protons which may dissolve fe iii hydr oxides via protonation eq 8 or reduction eq 9 in the latter case eq 9 pyrite could act as the electron donor this is consistent with the stable ph during pyrite driven denitrification section 4 3 1 acidic microenvironments could also be created between cell mineral interface thus enhancing the release of fe3 ions from fe iii hydr oxides bosch and meckenstock 2012 mielke et al 2003 schwientek et al 2008 2 eps complexing and concentrating it has been demonstrated that bioleaching bacteria like t ferrooxidans and l ferrooxidans carry a considerable load of complexed iron iii ions up to 53 g l in their exopolymer layer which act the same role as free fe iii ions and greatly enhance pyrite dissolution sand and gehrke 2006 vera et al 2013 cells devoid of eps neither attach to nor oxidize pyrite sand et al 2001 a similar mechanism may also operate in anoxic iron sulphides oxidation 3 solubilization by chelating agents natural chelating agents salicylic acid oxalic acid citric acid humic substances etc can solubilize fe iii minerals by forming fe iii complexes liang et al 1993 peiffer and stubert 1999 schwertmann 1991 which have been shown effective in oxidizing pyrite at circumneutral ph luther et al 1992 1996 bacteria may also excrete fe iii chelating agents like siderophores to promote fe iii dissolution kiskira et al 2017 kraemer 2004 very small amounts e g several nm of free siderophores have significant effects on the solution saturation state of iron oxides kraemer 2004 in a genomic analysis it was revealed that t denitrificans contained a cluster of siderophore related genes which were significantly upregulated in fe iii limiting condition beller et al 2006b 4 sorbed fe redox cycling recent studies demonstrate that electrons removed from the pyrite core may be shuttled to fe iii within the oxide coating then lost on the surface through oxidation of fe ii gartman and luther 2014 percak dennett et al 2017 such a sorbed fe redox cycling would remove the fe iii solid phase solubility question in summary direct electron uptake seems if not non existing unlikely the predominate electron transfer pathway in anoxic iron sulphides oxidation that makes iron sulphides dissolution a prerequisite prior to microbial utilization unfortunately the dissolution mechanism under denitrification conditions anoxic circumneutral ph remains unclear for acid soluble iron sulphides their anoxic oxidation is most likely sustained by proton prompted dissolution despite the low solubility of fe iii at circumneutral ph fe iii fe ii electron shuttle may still play a central role in pyrite dissolution because pyrite can only undergo oxidative dissolution and fe iii is exclusively the oxidizing agent under anoxic condition jørgensen et al 2009 kiskira et al 2017 since dissolution is the rate limiting step in iron sulphides driven denitrification it is of great importance to clarify the dissolution mechanism in future study 5 2 direct substrate reduced sulphur vs fe ii following the above question on the dissolution mechanism another question is which component of iron sulphides is the direct substrate of the denitrifying bacteria iron sulphides comprise both sulphide and ferrous iron the stoichiometric equations eqs 1 4 imply that both sulphur and iron moieties contribute directly to the reduction of nitrate from an energetic viewpoint sulphide is a much more prolific electron donor than ferrous iron taking pyrite fes2 for example complete oxidation of s2 2 donates 14 electrons while fe2 only donates one electron therefore several arguments have been made that sulphur compounds are the preferential electron donors in microbial iron sulphides oxidation and oxidation of fe2 is not an important process which may occur only when the cell is emptied for sulphide edwards et al 2003 hansen and van berk 2004 korom 1992 postma et al 1991 this likely holds true for the acid soluble iron sulphides fes fe1 xs etc because reduced sulphur compounds hs s8 are the major dissolution products fig 3a a recent study found that sulphur oxidizing denitrifier s denitrificans was overall the most abundant 68 05 in a pyrrhotite fe1 xs based denitrifying biofilter li et al 2016b however for pyrite the conclusion is probably the opposite this is because fe2 could be the major dissolution product of pyrite fig 3b although most of the electrons are still derived from the sulphur moiety they are transferred to the form of fe2 ions which become the direct substrate of the denitrifying bacteria therefore unlike pre pyritic iron sulphides driven denitrification where microbial sulphur oxidation is the dominant process iron oxidation could be the dominant biotic process in pyrite driven denitrification given that sulphur based denitrification and iron based denitrification have different metabolic pathways and characteristics clarifying these issues is critical for process control and optimization 6 prospects limitations and future research needs 6 1 prospects for sustainable wastewater treatment current municipal wastewater treatment practice is facing three major challenges 1 high material and energy input li et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 2 large amounts of waste sludge generation 5 10 kg wet sludge m3 treated wastewater li et al 2015 and 3 increasingly stringent treatment standards nutrient emerging contaminants etc barbosa et al 2016 hu et al 2017 tran et al 2018 consequently municipal wwtps can have high carbon footprints zhan et al 2018 to address these challenges one emerging consensus is that future wwtps must improve their overall sustainability by reducing the consumption of energy and non renewable resources minimizing waste sludge generation enabling energy and resource recovery whilst meeting stringent effluent quality criteria li et al 2015 trimmer et al 2019 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 in the past decades tremendous efforts have been made to explore novel solutions to fulfil the above mentioned requirements anaerobic treatment has been widely regarded as an essential part of sustainable wastewater treatment owing to its capability in recovering bioenergy and minimizing waste sludge generation batstone and virdis 2014 li et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 to harness its benefits however efficient and cost effective removal or recovery of nutrient from anaerobic effluent is the key issue yet to be resolved li et al 2015 mccarty et al 2011 many physical and chemical approaches adsorption struvite crystallization ion exchange electrodialysis etc have been attempted but have proven cost prohibitive or ineffective foresti et al 2006 hao et al 2013 li et al 2015 rittmann et al 2011 shi et al 2018 autotrophic denitrification processes hydrogen based sulphur based anammox appear to be the most logical option to couple anaerobic treatment for sustainable wastewater treatment owing to their intrinsic features such as eliminating the need for organic carbon and very little sludge production di capua et al 2015 of these options anammox is seen as the most promising qiu et al 2019 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 unfortunately although intensive research has been conducted there are numerous difficulties in maintaining its stability in the mainstream i e municipal wastewater conditions ambient temperature low nitrogen concentration etc cao et al 2017a hoekstra et al 2018 xu et al 2015 furthermore anammox is not efficient enough to meet stringent nutrient emission standards due to residual nitrate as a reaction by product and its inability to remove phosphorus ali and okabe 2015 cao et al 2017a as discussed above a viable technology for efficient and cost effective treatment of anaerobic effluent is the missing part to form a sustainable wastewater treatment train for future needs owing to its ability to simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphorus isad has a good potential to fit this need an iron sulphides based biotechnology towards next generation wastewater treatment neo green is illustrated in fig 4 and described as follows the treatment train starts with an anaerobic bioreactor e g anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr which converts organic matters cod to biogas based on recent pilot scale tests more than 90 of the influent cod can be removed under typical operational conditions of urban wwtps shin and bae 2018 the residual cod can be further removed in the nitrifying bioreactor by maximizing bioenergy recovery the system can potentially achieve net energy benefit galib et al 2016 mccarty et al 2011 subsequently the nitrifying biofilter converts nh4 in the anaerobic effluent to nitrate no3 as an established technology the nitrifying biofilter can ensure nearly complete nitrification with effluent nh4 n below 1 mg l peladan et al 1996 since most of the organic matters have been previously converted into biogas the oxygen demand and associated energy consumption are minimized finally in the iron sulphides bioreactor nitrate and phosphorus are effectively removed through isad effluent no3 n 2 mg l effluent po4 3 p 0 2 mg l table 3 another exciting hypothesis is that the iron sulphides bioreactor can also achieve an effective removal of emerging contaminants ecs iron sulphides have proven effective in removing a variety of ecs like chlorinated organic compounds and antibiotics via reduction and adsorption cao et al 2017b fan et al 2017 gong et al 2016 lan and butler 2016 its oxidization product iron hydro oxides can also effectively adsorb ecs like ppcps li et al 2018 yin et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 these physical and chemical processes will likely promote further biodegradation of ecs the spent iron sulphides are saturated by phosphorus p content of 37 5 as p2o5 li et al 2016b thus facilitating phosphorus recovery for example it meets the standard of phosphate ore p2o5 30 and can be used as feedstock by the fertiliser industry hao et al 2013 after p extraction the residue is rich in iron which provides a good opportunity for iron recovery the obtained iron phosphate can also be applied directly in organic agriculture as an environmentally friendly fertiliser and pesticide buhl et al 2013 nieminen et al 2011 through efficient p recovery from wastewater the neo green will contribute significantly to global sustainability and food security together this neo green concept will achieve energy and resources p fe recovery whilst ensuring excellent effluent quality moreover only consisting of anaerobic sludge yield 0 03 0 18 g vss g cod and autotrophic nitrification 0 07 g vss g n isad 0 186 g vss g n processes lei et al 2018 lu et al 2012 tong et al 2017a the overall treatment train would also have a minimized waste sludge production which has significant implications for reducing the costs and negative environmental impacts associated with waste sludge handling the feasibility of the neo green concept can be justified from the following aspects 1 process simplicity and robustness isad can proceed actively over a wide temperature range of 10 35 c li et al 2013b trouve et al 1998 and without the need of ph control the functional bacteria are highly cultivable and can be easily enriched from anaerobic sludge of local wwtps yang et al 2018b owing to its solid nature iron sulphides act as biofilm carries in addition to electron donors thus enabling simple reactor design such as up flow biofilter or fluidized bed reactor 2 lifespan depending on the type of iron sulphides e g fes or fes2 1 g of iron sulphides can remove 286 320 mg no3 n given a practical packing density of 1 85 103 kg m3 yang et al 2017a the iron sulphides bioreactor could last 15 years in theory at a common nitrogen loading of 0 1 kgn m3 d in municipal wwtps influent tn 50 mg l total hrt 12 h in practice the service time will be reduced by a certain extent due to operational issues like bed clogging and reduced denitrification rates after long term operation assuming a 50 reduction a long useful lifespan of 7 8 years can still be expected all these features ensure the broad applicability of this novel and sustainable wastewater treatment technology the key challenge to realize the neo green concept is the low denitrification rate of isad with natural iron sulphides other potential limitations are the local availability of iron sulphides sulphate emission and leaching of heavy metals these challenges are discussed in detail in the following section 6 2 limitations and future research needs 6 2 1 availability of iron sulphides iron sulphides are the most abundant sulphides minerals in the earth s crust and vastly distributed in hydrothermal deposits veins and replacements igneous rocks and sedimentary beds worldwide section 1 they are also continuously formed through microbial sulphur cycle fig 1 approximately 60 million tons of sulphur is buried as pyrite in sediments each year which far exceeds the currently global pyrite production of about 14 million tons per year rickard 2015 current market price for pyrite is as low as 100 300 ton in this regard iron sulphides can be considered as a cheap material of unlimited supply however the supply of iron sulphides can still be an issue due to the local availability of iron sulphides mines and the grade of iron sulphides deposits alternatively iron sulphides can be synthesised locally from cheap iron and sulphur sources iron oxides h2s etc via physicochemical or biological approaches gong et al 2016 the synthesis process also offers a good opportunity to produce more reactive iron sulphides materials such as nano sized or nano structured iron sulphides gong et al 2016 for enhanced denitrification rate site specific technical and economic assessments of the material supply routes will be needed in practical application 6 2 2 low denitrification rate as discussed in section 4 4 due to the solid nature and crystalline structure the denitrification rate of natural iron sulphides 10 70 gno3 n m3 d is considerably lower than other reduced sulphur compounds this can be acceptable for applications where slow processes is not a primary concern such as groundwater remediation however for applications where high rate denitrification is required such as in urban wwtps i e the neo green concept or drinking water treatment plants the applicability of isad would be restricted to fit urban wwtps with a small areal footprint a denitrification rate above 300 g n m3 d based on influent tn 50 mg l hrt for denitrification 4 h would be preferential apparently natural iron sulphides are far from meeting this requirement several strategies can be explored separately or in combination to overcome this limitation 1 size reduction or microscopic structure modification as discussed in section 3 3 2 although the denitrification rate 165 g n m3 d of the nano structed pyrrhotite yang et al 2017a is still lower than the desirable rate i e 300 g n m3 d the extra volume requirement can be made up by cancelling the secondary clarifier with fixed film configuration e g biofilter 2 using mixed electron sources such as s fes or fe fes reduced sulphur s0 s2o3 2 and fe2 generates h ions which would promote the dissolution of acid soluble iron sulphides e g fes fe1 xs thus increasing the denitrification rate similarly fe0 would promote the dissolution of fes2 eq 11 by generating oh ions it can also reduce the sulphate production of isad and 3 optimizing rector configuration for example bed fluidization can significantly increase the denitrification rate by enhancing mass transfer di capua et al 2015 6 2 3 sulphate emission high concentrations of sulphate in drinking water may cause laxness especially in combination with magnesium it may also induce salty taste of the drinking water and corrosion in the distribution system hence a maximal so4 2 level of 250 mg l is set in the drinking water standards ashok and hait 2015 when discharged into ecosystems sulphate would be microbially reduced to sulphide under sulphate reducing environments subsequently excess sulphide may reduce ferric iron from iron phosphate complexes and release the bound phosphate fig 1 resulting in internal eutrophication lamers et al 1998 smolders et al 2006 free sulphide may also damage rooted aquatic macrophytes by causing toxicity and iron deficiency smolders et al 2006 although isad generates much less sulphate 3 81 4 99 gso4 2 gno3 n than sulphur based denitrification 7 54 11 82 gso4 2 gno3 n section 4 3 2 sulphate emission may still become a concern in practical applications for example in groundwater remediation isad may still lead sulphate to exceed the drinking water standards 250 mg l if the nitrate level is high korom 1992 theoretically the maximal nitrate concertation can be dealt with isad is 47 76 mgno3 n l to ensure that both the nitrate 11 3 mgno3 n l and sulphate limits in drinking water are met if there is no background sulphate although sulphate emission in wastewater treatment is generally not controlled by regulations high sulphate emission is still undesirable due to the adverse ecological effects as discussed above therefore sulphate emission control should receive sufficient consideration in isad especially when dealing with high strength wastewater various physical reverse osmosis electrodialysis reversal chemical precipitation and biological technologies are available for sulphate removal with valorisation options arnold et al 2016 biological processes are generally considered more cost effective than the physical and chemical processes but it may be restricted for isad effluent due to lack of organic carbon in addition mixotrophic denitrification can be employed as an effective measure to ensure that the sulphate standard is fulfilled jin et al 2019 sahinkaya et al 2011 6 2 4 leaching of heavy metals natural iron sulphide minerals often function as a sink for some toxic trace metals pb2 zn2 cd2 hg2 as3 as5 ni2 etc table 6 yang et al 2017b zhang et al 2013 these metals may be released during iron sulphides oxidation indeed leaching of heavy metals table 6 has been a well registered environmental issue in aerobic iron sulphides oxidation i e acid mine drainage amd evangelou and zhang 1995 saria et al 2006 naturally it raises a concern about release of trace metals and subsequently metal toxicity in isad especially for groundwater remediation and drinking water treatment haaijer et al 2007 jørgensen et al 2009 torrentó et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 metals release in isad has been monitored in two recent studies li et al 2016b yang et al 2017a in contrast with amd the results show that metals release in isad is negligible and all the measured trace metals are far below the maximum contaminant level in the primary drinking water standards table 6 the negligible metals release in isad as compared with amd can be explained by the different ph ranges of the two processes amd results in a strong acidic condition ph 2 3 3 1 while isad occurs at circumneutral ph table 6 at circumneutral ph the mobility of most metals is significantly reduced furthermore the oxidized fe in isad forms fe iii hydr oxides which are strong scavengers for trace metals via adsorption and or co precipitation evangelou and zhang 1995 jeong et al 2010 to this end it may be concluded that leaching of metals should not be a concern in isad although comprehensive assessment is still needed in future studies 7 conclusions iron sulphides mediated autotrophic denitrification is a promising bioprocess for nitrate removal from a variety of organic deficient water and wastewater such as nitrate polluted groundwater nitrified domestic wastewater stormwater runoff and industrial wastewaters compared with other autotrophic denitrification processes iron sulphides based denitrification poses several unique advantages such as stable ph less adverse products generation sulphate nh4 n2o etc and simultaneous n and p removal these features make it a viable option for engineering applications like groundwater remediation advanced wastewater purification and wastewater reclamation it may also offer further opportunities to decontaminate emerging pollutants while removing nutrients given the renowned capability of iron sulphides and their oxidization product fe iii hydr oxides in removing a wide range of environmental contaminants heavy metals oxyanions radionuclides etc one major limitation is the relatively low denitrification rate which relies on further insights into the mechanism dissolution mechanism direct substrate etc of anoxic microbial iron sulphides oxidation to overcome most significantly by incorporating anaerobic treatment it

17876,natural aged microplastics with changed surface properties accumulate redistribute and spread in all water fields as carriers of hazardous substances the combined hazard of co contamination of microplastics and hazardous substances expands the ecological risks which urgently needs to design treatment schemes for pollutant removal from microplastics in this paper a facile and applicable magnetic biochar with porosity and graphitization pgmb was prepared for realizing the goal of metal removal from the microplastics heterogeneous catalysis of persulfate ps activated by pgmb achieved the decomposition of organics with the decrease of more than 60 of the attached pb on the surface of microplastics and the adsorbed metal amount by pgmb in this system 31 29 mg g is much higher than that by the individual pgmb group 7 07 mg g analysis demonstrated that the organic layer covered on the microplastic surface over the long term weathering provided the key sites for metal sorption whose decomposition and peeling were the critical steps in whole process the prepared pgmb was responsible for activating ps to produce reactive species for decomposing the organic matter accompanied with detaching metals from microplastic surface also would keep the role for re adsorption of the released metals and separation from aqueous phase by magnetic force the influences of natural environmental factors including salinity common matrix species and temperature on the performance of pgmb ps system for metal removal from microplastics were discussed to illustrate the universality of the scheme in saline or organic rich waters the results of this study provided underlying insights for removing metals from microplastic surface and decreasing the harm risks in the co contamination of microplastics and hazardous substances graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural aged microplastics attached pb organic matter biochar sr aops 1 introduction the prevalence distribution and influence of plastic particles in the natural environment have received considerable attention of scientists and government managers the annual production amount of waste plastics had been reported to surpass 348 million tons shen et al 2019a and these various plastics are released into aquatic environment through irresponsible handling illegal dumping and aquaculture activities processes of fragmentation and embrittlement would occur on the discarded plastics when they are exposed to solar radiation temperature change physical effects of wind currents and waves as well as the biological effects fotopoulou and karapanagioti 2015 shen et al 2019c the fragmented plastic particles whose diameter is smaller than 5 mm are defined as microplastics which become the focus of research owing to their potential toxic risk in aquatic ecosystem and human health farrell and nelson 2013 tanaka et al 2013 because of the small dimension that similar to the ingested food and the ubiquitous distribution whether suspended or deposited microplastics are regarded as a huge threat to aquatic organisms through inadvertent ingestion entanglement and smothering the hard digestible microplastics can block the esophagus but also lead to a false sense of fullness mrosovsky et al 2009 taylor et al 2016 wright et al 2013 besides the physical harms of microplastics a related concern is the attachment and enrichment of hazardous substances onto the surface of microplastics causing chemical toxicity as a result microplastics act as a component of the suspended load shown precise role for long range transport of contaminants holmes et al 2014 huffer and hofmann 2016 shen et al 2019b many researches have indicated that microplastics could act as vectors to increase metals and organic chemicals exposure in organisms hodson et al 2017 koelmans et al 2016 massos and turner 2017 furthermore the microplastics along with the adsorbed hazardous substances can not only raise the risk of inflammation and immune impairment on organisms carbery et al 2018 but also be capable of promoting the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of hazardous contaminants via the food chain considerable research efforts have been devoted to the adsorption behaviors of hazardous substances onto different types of microplastics huffer and hofmann 2016 wu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 that depended on both the microplastic types and pollutant properties due to the wide distribution of microplastics likely to be exposed to heavy metals and organic pollutants in natural environment microplastics exhibit substantial potential on adsorption of harmful substances the properties of microplastic such as polarity specific surface area degree of crystalline structure and abundance of rubbery brennecke et al 2016 show significant impacts on adsorption behavior of persistent organic pollutants through hydrophobic interactions electrostatic forces h binding and noncovalent bonds wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a attaching charged metal ions onto inherently neutral surface of plastics seems to be infeasible since the microplastic surface has no inherent characteristics for extra attraction to metal ions however the natural aged microplastics suspended in aqueous environment with loss of physical integrity for a long term basis can gain charges and a larger surface area by surface modification of biofilm formation weathering and attrition or precipitation of inorganic minerals these surface changes endow aged microplastics with accessibility to hazardous substance and metal adsorption was found to be considerably greater to aged microplastics than to virgin microplastics holmes et al 2014 kalcikova et al 2020 studies confirmed that pollutant adsorption on microplastic surface was improved in the presence of organic matter especially the humic acid than fulvic acid which was resulted from the π π conjugation between humic acid and microplastic that provided a suitable and charged surface for attraction and adsorption of various pollutants zhang et al 2018a although the health effects of ingesting microplastics alone have not been formally established higher toxic effects on aquatic life had been verified due to the combined toxic function of hazardous substances and microplastics dong et al 2019 turner and holmes 2015 research confirmed that aged microplastics with biofouling was tested for adsorbing silver at environmentally relevant concentrations and showed more adsorbed amount and intensive subsequent leaching of silver the following toxicological experiments proved that aged microplastics attached with silver had high ecotoxicological potential on daphnids daphnia magna yet little toxicity could be found by pristine microplastics kalcikova et al 2020 surprisingly little attention has been committed to remove the attached hazardous substances from microplastics for decreasing the risk of co contamination on the basis of the above views it can be concluded that the organic matter layer biofilm formed naturally over time on the microplastic surface endows the microplastic surface with the ability to adsorb metals through bridging role in order to achieve the purpose of removing heavy metals from microplastics the decomposition and exfoliation of the organic layer adhering to the microplastic surface is crucial microplastics exposed to the aquatic environment are gradually coated by a layer of inorganic and organic substances which provides available surface for the colonization of microorganisms to inhabit followed by forming biofilm oberbeckmann et al 2015 rummel et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b the subsequent formation of conditioning layer containing microorganisms live or dead and the embedded extracellular polymeric substance eps shows great potential for metal adsorption for transforming the organic layer that bears the bridging role advanced oxidation processes especially the sulfate radical based one sr aops has hopeful prospects in decomposing organic matter by in situ generated reactive species liu et al 2019 luo et al 2019 oh et al 2016 tang et al 2018 yi et al 2019 heterogeneous catalysis for sr aops is of great interest to many researchers in which the selection and preparation of catalysts are the focus of research gong et al 2009 wang et al 2019a xu et al 2012 biochar based material with high graphitization is increasingly reported as a promising redox active catalyst to mineralize organics into carbon dioxide and water by the active sites of defects and versatile functional groups chen et al 2018 oh et al 2018 wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 besides the carbon matrix biochar with appropriate pore structure can be used as a carrier to support transition metals and their oxides which configured with variable valence to coordinate the activation process of persulfate ps fu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 fe is considered as a better alternative of transition metals not only because of its wide range of sources and hypotoxicity more importantly attributed to its inherent magnetism which provides a beneficial opportunity to achieve material recycling yu et al 2019 in addition to the function of catalyst the performance of biochar as adsorbent to immobilize metal ions had been intensively investigated ye et al 2017a zeng et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 owing to the abundant functional groups and large cation exchange capacity song et al 2019a xiong et al 2018 biochar exhibits considerable adsorption capacity for metal ions therefore provides a powerful platform for re immobilizing metals that are detached from the microplastic surface and reduces the mobile form of metal this paper first proposed the view of removing metals from microplastics by decomposing the organic matter layer covered on the surface in order to alleviate the potential harms of microplastics as vectors to transport hazardous substances and reduce the co contamination considering the additional chemical toxicity of heavy metals attached to aged microplastics sulfate radical based aops were regarded as novel and cost effective technology to remove heavy metals from the surface of the microplastic as well as separating the released heavy metals from the water simultaneously by magnetic catalyst lead pb a frequently detected heavy metal in aquatic environment is treated as a representative target pollutant in this study a highly efficient biochar based catalyst containing ferromagnetic property was prepared by modification of k2feo4 a green and multi functional water treatment agent playing the role to improve pore formation and graphitization the performance of prepared biochar based catalyst to activate persulfate for decomposition of organic matter covered on microplastic surface and to achieve immobilization and recovery of the released metal ions was explored the main research purposes are to 1 explore the decomposition of the organic matter layer through sr aops in which ps is activated by biochar based catalyst 2 determine the content change of metal on the microplastic surface during the experiment 3 discuss the effects of coexisting substances inorganics and organics in actual water salinity and temperature on the performance of pgmb ps system for metal removal from microplastics and 4 analyze the main treatment mechanisms involved in degradation of organics separation of attached metal from microplastics and re adsorption of released metal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials natural aged beached plastics were sampled from bottomland of dongting lake a wetland located in hunan province china in the laboratory the sand on the plastic surface was carefully removed by soaking in ultrapure water and then the dried samples pass through a 20 mesh sieve to ensure that the particle dimensions fall into the range of microplastics definition standard lead reserve solution potassium ferrate k2feo4 sodium persulfate na2s2o8 ps were purchased from shanghai chemical corp besides all used solutions were prepared in high purity ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm which was produced by ulupure uprii 10 t laboratory water system 2 2 synthesis of biochar based catalyst straw collected from shallow flats of dongting lake was washed and shattered to a particle size of 0 15 mm as precursor then the straw powders were immersed in 100 ml aqueous solution of k2feo4 0 1 m with continuous stirring lasting for 12 h undergone vacuum drying at 80 c overnight the acquired solid was transferred into a quartz boat and annealed in tube furnace at a temperature of 900 c for a residence time of 2 h at continuous flow of n2 gas the carbonized black solid after naturally cooling with porous structure improved graphitization as well as magnetism was denoted as pgmb 2 3 characterization methods the surface morphological and structural differences between virgin and aged microplastics were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscope sem quanta q400 usa surface functional groups of microplastics in different states were qualitatively detected by fourier transform infrared spectrum ftir nicolet 5700 spectrometer recorded in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the zeta potentials analysis used to determine the surface charge of microplastics was performed by electroacoustic spectrometer zen3600 zetasizer uk edx elemental mapping was used to discover the variation of pb on microplastic surface before and after adsorption equilibrium as well as undergone treatment of sr aops in addition the surface properties of the prepared biochar were also characterized x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi usa with the calibration of c1s at 284 8 ev was applied to test the chemical states of element under an al kα x ray radiation the pore characteristics of biochar based catalyst were calculated by automatic surface area porosity analyzer quantachrome instrum quadrasorb evo usa on the basis of n2 isotherms at 77 3 k 2 4 treatment experiments microplastics mps that had been pre wetted were poured into 250 ml conical flask containing 100 ml solution of pb at a concentration of 10 mg l moderate shaking was carried out in a thermostatic shaker to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium over night pre experiment confirmed that the equilibrium state was reached at 6 h the adsorption capacity was calculated by q t c 0 c t v m c 0 mg l initial pb concentration in solution c t mg l residual pb concentration at t v ml reaction solution volume m mg the mass of the microplastic and taken as the amount of pb that adhered onto the microplastic surface prior to the sr aops treatment in a typical treatment process 15 mg of the synthesized biochar was suspended in above solution followed by adding a certain amount of na2s2o8 maintaining final solution containing 0 25 mm ps to trigger the oxidation reaction the solution samples were withdrawn at each time interval and used for determination of parameters in solution after filtration by 0 45 μm pvdf disposable filters after 4 h of experiments the attached metal onto the microplastic surface were extracted by digestion with acid and measured by atomic absorption spectrometry peaa700 usa and the attached content of pb on microplastics was calculated by q m c 1 v 0 m 1 c 1 mg l pb concentration in digestion solution v 0 ml volume of digestion liquid m 1 mg the mass of the microplastic involved in digestion the differences in metal amount of mps before experiment and fe leaching from pgbc after reaction were detected through coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7800 the transformation of organic matter in solution across the treatment was measured by three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d emms recorded on fluoromax 4 fluorescence spectrophotometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization first of all it could be visually distinguished between natural aged and virgin mps on the basis of their external surface color fig s1 the darker color was assigned to the aged mps resulted from the attachment of organisms such as algaes mosses microbes and their secretions on the microplastic surface more detailed differences in surface morphology of microplastics can be observed by sem images fig 1 virgin microplastics were in the uniform shape of fragments with smooth and flat surface fig 1b since they were derived from the artificially mechanical fragmentation of commercial plastics notably the natural aged mps displayed changes in the morphology roughness and chemical properties on surface compared with virgin ones the surface of aged mps was rougher and presented macroscopic networks of microcracks with covering protrusions and deposition owing to chain scission of the polymer and mineral adhesion showing the characteristics of porous polymer table s1 shows the differences of metal content between virgin and natural aged microplastics determined by icp ms under the same digestion condition it can intuitively demonstrate that the metals such as mg al mn and fe related to mineral deposition are much more abundant in weathered microplastics than in the virgin ones the huge difference in cd content could be explained by the fact that cd was accumulated over a long period on natural aged microplastics which were collected from shallow flats of dongting lake where was polluted by cd the wrinkled and aggregated structure of aged mps might result in larger specific surface area and more potential adsorption sites for metal capture which also could reveal the affinity of microplastics for different organisms and their tendency for surface biofouling the surface functional groups of microplastics before and after weathering were characterized by ftir and shown in fig 1c variations in absorption peak position and peak intensity can be observed between them different from the spectrum of virgin microplastic a broadened new peak located at 1030 cm 1 was detected on the aged microplastic which is attributed to the c o c stretching vibration of ester in addition the new bands appearing at peak position of 535 and 785 cm 1 are assigned to the in plane bending vibration of the co in aliphatic ketone and the oscillations of c o of hetero aromatic ring respectively these variations in oxidation peaks of aged mps are derived from the long term photo oxidation by reaction with atmospheric oxygen during light irradiation assisted with biodeterioration when plastic was exposed to the natural environment fotopoulou and karapanagioti 2015 zhu et al 2019 besides the hetero aromatic ring structure which was not found in the virgin mps the peak positioned at 670 cm 1 in spectrum of aged microplastic could be derived from the c p vibration of phosphorus containing compounds which may be a proof for the organics covering on the surface of natural aged microplastic the zeta potentials of aged and virgin suspended microplastics under different ph values were investigated which reflected the surface charges according to the results obtained by fig 1f the negative values of both mps in a near neutral ph manifested microplastics could be stabilized and minimally aggregated in the natural aquatic environments owing to interparticle electrostatic repulsion li et al 2018 the surface of aged microplastics showed electronegative on a ph range of 2 6 and decreased gradually with increasing ph value compared with the virgin mps the aged mps accumulated more negative charges on surface and the zero point of charge phzpc drop from 3 06 examined by virgin mps suspension to less than 2 00 by aged mps suspension which was accounted for the changes in physico chemical properties of aged microplastic surface or the adhesion of negatively charged organic matter and minerals onto the surface in natural environment for long time 3 2 ps pgbc performance for metal removal from microplastic surface surface modification of aged mps was formed by long term weathering uv induced photo oxidation high temperature and humidity and typical conditions encountered at beaches these variations endow microplastic with larger specific surface area porosity and oxygen containing functional groups as well as turning charge through biofilm formation and mineral precipitation holmes et al 2014 turner and holmes 2015 the more heterogeneous and reactive surface induces greater adsorption capacity of aged mps than that of the virgin ones by electrostatic interactions cation exchange and co precipitation fig s2 shows a time dependent adsorption process and kinetics curve of pb by natural aged mps whose saturated adsorption capacity can reach as high as 20 15 mg g confirming the strong adsorption performance of aged mps and the role in respect of the transport and behavior of metals in aquatic environment compared with the equilibrium adsorbed amount of pb by virgin microplastics calculated to be 4 63 mg g under the same surrounding conditions it could be further clarified that the organic layer as well as the deposited minerals on mp surface formed by weathering was of great importance for metal accumulation the pb content attached to the microplastic surface was calculated to be 19 83 mg g measured by the acid digestion method which was very close to the adsorbed amount calculated by the pb concentration in solution at the equilibrium of adsorption 20 15 mg g therefore it is convincing that the content of pb attached onto the microplastic surface before sr aops treatment was calculated by equilibrium adsorption with pb concentration in the solution at the subsequent experiments undergone adsorption desorption equilibrium within 24 h samples were exposed to different treatment of individual pgmb ps and sr aops treatment with ps activated by pgmb lasting for 4 h as shown in fig 2 a compared with the negligible pb removal from microplastic surface under non treatment treatment by pgmb and ps alone successful combination system of pgmb and ps is likely to inspire the removal improvement for attached pb on microplastic surface with an over 60 removal efficiency calculated by the ratio of pb content on mps after sr aops treatment to the pb content on mps after adsorption to identify the changes in pb on microplastic surfaces elemental mapping analysis under scanning transmission electron microscopy stem mode was carried out to characterize the element distribution the evident contrast differences of pb distribution on microplastic surfaces before and after oxidation treatment by pgmb ps system could be observed on fig 1 this was a strong evidence for pb distribution with large amount on the surface of microplastics after adsorption operation fig 1d while the signal of the attached pb was significantly reduced after the sr aops reaction by pgmb ps system fig 1e it is worthwhile mentioning that the adsorbed amount of pb on biochar surface was observed to increase significantly from 7 07 mg g at treatment of pgmb individual to 31 29 mg g at pgmb ps treatment which not only proved that the prepared biochar has excellent adsorption properties for metals but also indirectly verified the advanced oxidation process of ps activated by pgmb would help the attached pb to fall off from the microplastic surface and thereby provide more opportunities for metal removal to gain more insight we explored the variation of pb concentration in different parts mps pgmb and solution with different periods as shown in fig 2b it could be found that once the aops were triggered by adding biochar into vessels pgmb can rapidly adsorb metal in the solution while activate ps to destroy the organic matter covered on microplastic surface for the pb detachment from surface the fluctuating pb concentration in solution reflected the process of pb desorption from microplastic surface and re adsorption onto pgmb until the end of the reaction the pb concentration in the solution changed little compared with that before aops treatment reflecting that the concentration of mobile pb would not be increased which indicated that the ecological risk of pb in the solution could be effectively controlled as the contact time increased the attached content of pb on microplastics surface gradually decreased while the adsorbed amount of pb on pgmb significantly increased realizing the transfer of metal from microplastic to biochar surface and achieving the purpose of metal separation through magnetic force scheme 1 concerning the potential vehicle role of microplastics for transfer of chemicals from river to ocean the influences of various factors in the natural environment on the performance of pgmb ps system for metal removal need to be further discussed the performance of the pgmb ps system from adsorption to separation removal of metal on microplastic surface under different salinity gradients is shown in fig 3 a a distinct decrease of the attached pb on microplastic surface could be found within the nacl electrolyte which may be explained by the competition of sodium ion for occupying the adsorption site and shielding negative charge of the microplastic surface to reduce electrostatic attraction although the final attached content of pb was lower in the salinity group than in the control the metal removal efficiency from the microplastic surface slightly decreased with the increase of salinity due to its low basic adsorption nacl exhibited an inhibitory effect on the detachment of pb from the microplastic surface as cl can be served as radical scavenger yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 to produce less reactive chlorine radical that adversely affected the exfoliation and breaking of organic layers another possible explanation is that the microplastic particles tend to be agglomerated at a higher salinity which is determined by the less electrostatic repulsion and the steric effect with compression of the electrical double layer li et al 2018 turner and holmes 2015 reducing the opportunities of contact between the microplastic surface and the reactive species generated on the surface of biochar followed by a decrease in degradation toward organic matter on mp surface in order to deeply investigate the practical application several common matrix species were discussed systematically for their effects on metal removal by pgmb ps system fig 3b displays the different attached amount of pb on solid mps and pgmb as well as the metal removal efficiency in the presence of various in organics the ph buffering action of hco3 and hpo2 4 resulted from hydrolysis can alkalinize the solution to a certain extent where an alkaline environment would benefit the precipitation or complexation of pb and reduce the amount of available pb ii for adsorption in solution in terms of the metal removal from microplastic surface based on the radical oxidation there is no denying that hco3 and hpo4 2 have great potential as scavenger to immediately capture radicals song et al 2019b ye et al 2019a thereby inhibiting the decomposition of organic matter and removal of metal on surface the difference between the two groups of hco3 and hpo4 2 is the adsorbed amount of pb on pgmb at the end of treatment it may arise from the fact that the biochar surface is still attractive for adsorption or adhesion of metals or their precipitation generated in the hco3 group while the metals in hpo4 2 group tended to generate soluble complexes by chelating effect a decreasing tendency in the attached amount of pb on mps surface was found as the humic acid ha content increased which was attributed to the extra interaction of ha as organic ligands with metals to produce in soluble complex compounds with stable chemical properties it should be mentioned that there seems to be no significant effect of added amount of ha with regard to the metal removal from microplastic surface it indicated that ha is more likely to affect the metal chelated affinity partition and influence limitedly the oxidation performance of reactive species generated by pgmb ps system considering that microplastics have experienced numerous seasonal cycles in nature the effects of ambient temperature on metal removal from microplastic surface by pgmb ps system were further explored on the basis of the results in fig s3 it can be concluded that higher temperature showed slight inhibited effect on pb adsorption to microplastic surface two possible explanations are responsible for this phenomenon 1 high temperature favors the thermal motion of molecules in solution thereby enhancing the pb ii mobility 2 metal attachment on microplastics dominated by physical interaction is a reversible process where the temperature rise is more conducive to the occurrence of desorption reaction in addition temperature is observed to have a remarkable impact on metal removal behavior from microplastic surface more radical generation by ps decomposition at higher temperature could account for the larger removal efficiency of metal as more radicals were involved in decomposing the organic matter that attached onto the microplastic surface based on the observation on fig s3 pb adsorption by pgmb is a spontaneous endothermic process dominated by chemical interaction indicating warming is likely to inspire more metal recovery with high adsorbed amount on biochar surface 3 3 mechanism exploration the surface properties of the prepared pgmb were characterized to gain more insight into its ability to activate ps decomposition and adsorb metal as can be seen from fig 4 a a plenty of hollow tubes consisted of thin walled carbon with rough surface was observed by sem on which many small bumps were assigned to be iron containing particles the uneven surface and the abundant pores on it provide a platform for the occurrence of various reactions the bet specific surface area of pgmb was calculated to be about 76 316 m2 g testing by n2 isotherms at 77k a iv type isothermal curve with a large hysteresisloop demonstrated the characteristic of mesoporous where the average pore size was detected to be 3 732 nm based on pore size distribution by the bjh model appropriate specific surface area and pore size distribution improved the surface accessibility for drawing ps melocules and metals to trigger surface reaction the graphitic structure and crystallinity of the prepared pgmb were provided by xrd patterns fig 4b a diffraction peak appearing at 26 5 was ascribed to the 002 plane of graphite demonstrating the locally ordered carbon structure even with the introduction of iron three typical characteristic peaks corresponding to fe0 were found at 2θ values of 44 6 65 2 and 82 3 in xrd spectrum respectively indicating that fe0 is the most important form of iron in the prepared biochar fe0 had been intensively investigated to exhibit strong activation ability for ps decomposition due to its low valence state it can not only produce more radicals by the heterogeneous transportation of electrons from fe0 to ps but also continuously and slowly provide fe ii for radical generation eqs 1 3 avoiding the quenching reactions between fe ii ion and so4 oh et al 2010 peluffo et al 2016 the other two weak peaks locating at 30 5 and 43 3 were indexed to the 220 and 400 crystal planes of fe3o4 further confirming the ferromagnetism of pgmb which allows metal could be separated from aqueous phase the vsm magnetization curve fig s4 of the recovered pgmb was examined with saturation magnetization value of 55 51 emu g for verifying the magnetic properties of pgmb after the whole treatment x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to analyze the valence state of each element in pgmb there are three fitted peaks in high resolution spectrum of c1s shown in fig 4e positioned at 284 8 286 2 and 288 8 ev corresponding to cc bonds in aromatic ring c o alkoxy and ketonic co respectively in which carbonyl and ketone groups had been proved to be the active site for triggering advanced oxidation processes duan et al 2016 shao et al 2018 ye et al 2020 moreover most of the oxygen containing functional groups such as co ketonic group cooh carboxyl and h o located at 530 2 531 7 and 533 3 ev respectively detected in the o1s high resolution spectrum were regarded as sites for metal adsorption tan et al 2015 ye et al 2017b 2019b fig 4g and h displays the binding energies of fe 2p peaks at 710 9 and 724 1 ev referring to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 orbit of fe respectively the additional satellite peaks of pgmb appeared in the high resolution spectrum of fe 2p after the aops reaction suggested the increase in oxidation state fe ш which was due to the participation of low valence fe in ps activation with fe cycle eqs 3 7 1 fe0 h2o fe ii oh h2 2 fe0 o2 2h2o 2

so4 hso4 9 c oh s2o8 2 c o so4 hso4 10 quinones h2o 2 semiquinone 2h 11 semiquinone s2o8 2 so4 quinones to shed light on the role of the organic layer covering the surface on metal attachment by microplastics we deeply studied the relationship between the decomposition degree of organic matter on microplastic surface by acid or alkali treatment with the adsorbed amount of pb on the surface thus illustrating the feasibility of separating metals from microplastic surface through the decomposition of organic matter covering on it considering the different solubility of organic matter under the condition of acid and alkali the aged microplastics were shaken in different solutions to obtain various contents of organic matter coated on microplastics different toc values in aqueous phase the pre treated microplastics were dried and used to explore their ability of metal adsorption as shown in fig s5 it should be pointed out that the microplastic with the least amount of remaining organic matter on surface reflected by the largest toc value after the treatment of alkali liquor resulted in the smallest metal adsorption capacity the values of toc in the pretreatment solution were inversely proportional to the amount of metal adsorbed on the microplastic surface fig s5b which proved that the decomposition of organic matter on the microplastic surface can achieve metal detachment and removal from microplastics in order to further confirm the decomposition and mineralization of the organic matter 3d emm spectra was carried out to identify the transformation and evolution of organic matter in solution across the oxidation process by pgmb ps system a sample of the solution oscillated for 24 h with adding the same amount of microplastic as above experiment showed the multiple peaks before sr aops reaction fig 5 a based on spectrum elucidation there were mainly three kinds of fluorescent peak positioned at ex em of 1 250 300 280 380 nm peak a associated with microbial by product like substances including tryptophan and tyrosine 250 290 400 500 nm peak b associated with fulvic acid like compounds and 320 380 400 490 nm peak c associated with humic acid like compounds respectively when the sample was collected by the reaction time of 1 h fig 5b the fluorescence signal of the peak a that closely related to biology decreased markedly which proved that this part of organic matter is most sensitive to the oxidation reaction by pgmb ps system undergone 2 h of oxidation process the intensity of the b and c peaks drop sharply even almost disappeared describing that the fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were decomposed by a large amount during this period and they may be degraded into other intermediate products or mineralized thoroughly to produce co2 and h2o extending the reaction time to 4 h fig 5d the fluorescence intensity of b and c peak abnormally increased dramatically revealing that the organic substances originally covered onto the microplastic surface were destroyed and decomposed thereby released into solution the ftir spectrum of the microplastic that undergone the whole sr aops was performed to analyze the transformation in surface properties in comparison with the microplastic before reaction fig s6 the changes in either position or intensity of peaks associated with the covered organics on surface at 1420 1300 carboxylate and 900 600 cm 1 provided a supplementary explanation for the variation in coverage status of the organics on microplastic surface in the oxidation process the role of reactive species in the detachment of attached metals from microplastic surfaces and the types of active substances involved in the decomposition of organic matter can be analyzed by radical capture experiments methanol meoh and tert butyl alcohol tba at a molar ratio of 1000 to ps were adopted as the scavengers of both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively to consume the reactive species the moderate degree of reduction in metal removal efficiency was provided on fig 6 a which preliminarily indicated that both so4 and oh were produced according to eqs 3 11 and participated in the metal removal process taking the hydrophilicity of scavengers but the radical generated on surface into account the more hydrophobic scavenger for simultaneously capturing both radicals was applied in the presence of phenol the metal removal efficiency was found to be considerable decline from 60 45 to 37 55 confirming the important role of radicals on metal detachment from microplastic surfaces electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrum with dmpo as spin trapping agents is a powerful evidence fig 6b in which the emergence of characteristic peaks of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh adducts directly illustrated the generation and revolution processes of reactive species on system the metal removal by pgmb ps system still proceeded even if the radicals were trapped which was likely due to that the specific pathway of ps activation by carbon based catalyst non radical degradation continued to be a great impetus to organics decomposition luo et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 the sharp decrease in the metal recovery by pgmb is owing to the fact that the coverage of hydrophobic substances on the surface restricts its adsorption site or accessible pathway as well as less pb detached from microplastic and released into solution 4 conclusions in conclusion the removal of the attached heavy metals from natural aged microplastics was first achieved by the advanced oxidation reaction of ps activated by the prepared ferromagnetic biochar the pgmb ps system with reactive species generation and non radical pathway was proposed to transform and decompose the covered organic matter formed by long term exposure to the environment which acted the bridging role for metal adsorption on natural aged microplastic surface the metals that subsequently released from microplastic surface were re immobilized by biochar with favorable specific surface area and abundant versatile functional groups exhibiting great potential regarding the metal separation from aqueous phase through magnetic force the anti interference tests demonstrated that regardless of the differences in processing efficiency the relatively less contents of metal were eventually remained on microplastic after reaction under various surrounding conditions these new overall understandings provide novel opportunities for reducing the risks of microplastic

17876,natural aged microplastics with changed surface properties accumulate redistribute and spread in all water fields as carriers of hazardous substances the combined hazard of co contamination of microplastics and hazardous substances expands the ecological risks which urgently needs to design treatment schemes for pollutant removal from microplastics in this paper a facile and applicable magnetic biochar with porosity and graphitization pgmb was prepared for realizing the goal of metal removal from the microplastics heterogeneous catalysis of persulfate ps activated by pgmb achieved the decomposition of organics with the decrease of more than 60 of the attached pb on the surface of microplastics and the adsorbed metal amount by pgmb in this system 31 29 mg g is much higher than that by the individual pgmb group 7 07 mg g analysis demonstrated that the organic layer covered on the microplastic surface over the long term weathering provided the key sites for metal sorption whose decomposition and peeling were the critical steps in whole process the prepared pgmb was responsible for activating ps to produce reactive species for decomposing the organic matter accompanied with detaching metals from microplastic surface also would keep the role for re adsorption of the released metals and separation from aqueous phase by magnetic force the influences of natural environmental factors including salinity common matrix species and temperature on the performance of pgmb ps system for metal removal from microplastics were discussed to illustrate the universality of the scheme in saline or organic rich waters the results of this study provided underlying insights for removing metals from microplastic surface and decreasing the harm risks in the co contamination of microplastics and hazardous substances graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural aged microplastics attached pb organic matter biochar sr aops 1 introduction the prevalence distribution and influence of plastic particles in the natural environment have received considerable attention of scientists and government managers the annual production amount of waste plastics had been reported to surpass 348 million tons shen et al 2019a and these various plastics are released into aquatic environment through irresponsible handling illegal dumping and aquaculture activities processes of fragmentation and embrittlement would occur on the discarded plastics when they are exposed to solar radiation temperature change physical effects of wind currents and waves as well as the biological effects fotopoulou and karapanagioti 2015 shen et al 2019c the fragmented plastic particles whose diameter is smaller than 5 mm are defined as microplastics which become the focus of research owing to their potential toxic risk in aquatic ecosystem and human health farrell and nelson 2013 tanaka et al 2013 because of the small dimension that similar to the ingested food and the ubiquitous distribution whether suspended or deposited microplastics are regarded as a huge threat to aquatic organisms through inadvertent ingestion entanglement and smothering the hard digestible microplastics can block the esophagus but also lead to a false sense of fullness mrosovsky et al 2009 taylor et al 2016 wright et al 2013 besides the physical harms of microplastics a related concern is the attachment and enrichment of hazardous substances onto the surface of microplastics causing chemical toxicity as a result microplastics act as a component of the suspended load shown precise role for long range transport of contaminants holmes et al 2014 huffer and hofmann 2016 shen et al 2019b many researches have indicated that microplastics could act as vectors to increase metals and organic chemicals exposure in organisms hodson et al 2017 koelmans et al 2016 massos and turner 2017 furthermore the microplastics along with the adsorbed hazardous substances can not only raise the risk of inflammation and immune impairment on organisms carbery et al 2018 but also be capable of promoting the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of hazardous contaminants via the food chain considerable research efforts have been devoted to the adsorption behaviors of hazardous substances onto different types of microplastics huffer and hofmann 2016 wu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 that depended on both the microplastic types and pollutant properties due to the wide distribution of microplastics likely to be exposed to heavy metals and organic pollutants in natural environment microplastics exhibit substantial potential on adsorption of harmful substances the properties of microplastic such as polarity specific surface area degree of crystalline structure and abundance of rubbery brennecke et al 2016 show significant impacts on adsorption behavior of persistent organic pollutants through hydrophobic interactions electrostatic forces h binding and noncovalent bonds wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a attaching charged metal ions onto inherently neutral surface of plastics seems to be infeasible since the microplastic surface has no inherent characteristics for extra attraction to metal ions however the natural aged microplastics suspended in aqueous environment with loss of physical integrity for a long term basis can gain charges and a larger surface area by surface modification of biofilm formation weathering and attrition or precipitation of inorganic minerals these surface changes endow aged microplastics with accessibility to hazardous substance and metal adsorption was found to be considerably greater to aged microplastics than to virgin microplastics holmes et al 2014 kalcikova et al 2020 studies confirmed that pollutant adsorption on microplastic surface was improved in the presence of organic matter especially the humic acid than fulvic acid which was resulted from the π π conjugation between humic acid and microplastic that provided a suitable and charged surface for attraction and adsorption of various pollutants zhang et al 2018a although the health effects of ingesting microplastics alone have not been formally established higher toxic effects on aquatic life had been verified due to the combined toxic function of hazardous substances and microplastics dong et al 2019 turner and holmes 2015 research confirmed that aged microplastics with biofouling was tested for adsorbing silver at environmentally relevant concentrations and showed more adsorbed amount and intensive subsequent leaching of silver the following toxicological experiments proved that aged microplastics attached with silver had high ecotoxicological potential on daphnids daphnia magna yet little toxicity could be found by pristine microplastics kalcikova et al 2020 surprisingly little attention has been committed to remove the attached hazardous substances from microplastics for decreasing the risk of co contamination on the basis of the above views it can be concluded that the organic matter layer biofilm formed naturally over time on the microplastic surface endows the microplastic surface with the ability to adsorb metals through bridging role in order to achieve the purpose of removing heavy metals from microplastics the decomposition and exfoliation of the organic layer adhering to the microplastic surface is crucial microplastics exposed to the aquatic environment are gradually coated by a layer of inorganic and organic substances which provides available surface for the colonization of microorganisms to inhabit followed by forming biofilm oberbeckmann et al 2015 rummel et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b the subsequent formation of conditioning layer containing microorganisms live or dead and the embedded extracellular polymeric substance eps shows great potential for metal adsorption for transforming the organic layer that bears the bridging role advanced oxidation processes especially the sulfate radical based one sr aops has hopeful prospects in decomposing organic matter by in situ generated reactive species liu et al 2019 luo et al 2019 oh et al 2016 tang et al 2018 yi et al 2019 heterogeneous catalysis for sr aops is of great interest to many researchers in which the selection and preparation of catalysts are the focus of research gong et al 2009 wang et al 2019a xu et al 2012 biochar based material with high graphitization is increasingly reported as a promising redox active catalyst to mineralize organics into carbon dioxide and water by the active sites of defects and versatile functional groups chen et al 2018 oh et al 2018 wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 besides the carbon matrix biochar with appropriate pore structure can be used as a carrier to support transition metals and their oxides which configured with variable valence to coordinate the activation process of persulfate ps fu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 fe is considered as a better alternative of transition metals not only because of its wide range of sources and hypotoxicity more importantly attributed to its inherent magnetism which provides a beneficial opportunity to achieve material recycling yu et al 2019 in addition to the function of catalyst the performance of biochar as adsorbent to immobilize metal ions had been intensively investigated ye et al 2017a zeng et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 owing to the abundant functional groups and large cation exchange capacity song et al 2019a xiong et al 2018 biochar exhibits considerable adsorption capacity for metal ions therefore provides a powerful platform for re immobilizing metals that are detached from the microplastic surface and reduces the mobile form of metal this paper first proposed the view of removing metals from microplastics by decomposing the organic matter layer covered on the surface in order to alleviate the potential harms of microplastics as vectors to transport hazardous substances and reduce the co contamination considering the additional chemical toxicity of heavy metals attached to aged microplastics sulfate radical based aops were regarded as novel and cost effective technology to remove heavy metals from the surface of the microplastic as well as separating the released heavy metals from the water simultaneously by magnetic catalyst lead pb a frequently detected heavy metal in aquatic environment is treated as a representative target pollutant in this study a highly efficient biochar based catalyst containing ferromagnetic property was prepared by modification of k2feo4 a green and multi functional water treatment agent playing the role to improve pore formation and graphitization the performance of prepared biochar based catalyst to activate persulfate for decomposition of organic matter covered on microplastic surface and to achieve immobilization and recovery of the released metal ions was explored the main research purposes are to 1 explore the decomposition of the organic matter layer through sr aops in which ps is activated by biochar based catalyst 2 determine the content change of metal on the microplastic surface during the experiment 3 discuss the effects of coexisting substances inorganics and organics in actual water salinity and temperature on the performance of pgmb ps system for metal removal from microplastics and 4 analyze the main treatment mechanisms involved in degradation of organics separation of attached metal from microplastics and re adsorption of released metal 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials natural aged beached plastics were sampled from bottomland of dongting lake a wetland located in hunan province china in the laboratory the sand on the plastic surface was carefully removed by soaking in ultrapure water and then the dried samples pass through a 20 mesh sieve to ensure that the particle dimensions fall into the range of microplastics definition standard lead reserve solution potassium ferrate k2feo4 sodium persulfate na2s2o8 ps were purchased from shanghai chemical corp besides all used solutions were prepared in high purity ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm which was produced by ulupure uprii 10 t laboratory water system 2 2 synthesis of biochar based catalyst straw collected from shallow flats of dongting lake was washed and shattered to a particle size of 0 15 mm as precursor then the straw powders were immersed in 100 ml aqueous solution of k2feo4 0 1 m with continuous stirring lasting for 12 h undergone vacuum drying at 80 c overnight the acquired solid was transferred into a quartz boat and annealed in tube furnace at a temperature of 900 c for a residence time of 2 h at continuous flow of n2 gas the carbonized black solid after naturally cooling with porous structure improved graphitization as well as magnetism was denoted as pgmb 2 3 characterization methods the surface morphological and structural differences between virgin and aged microplastics were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscope sem quanta q400 usa surface functional groups of microplastics in different states were qualitatively detected by fourier transform infrared spectrum ftir nicolet 5700 spectrometer recorded in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the zeta potentials analysis used to determine the surface charge of microplastics was performed by electroacoustic spectrometer zen3600 zetasizer uk edx elemental mapping was used to discover the variation of pb on microplastic surface before and after adsorption equilibrium as well as undergone treatment of sr aops in addition the surface properties of the prepared biochar were also characterized x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi usa with the calibration of c1s at 284 8 ev was applied to test the chemical states of element under an al kα x ray radiation the pore characteristics of biochar based catalyst were calculated by automatic surface area porosity analyzer quantachrome instrum quadrasorb evo usa on the basis of n2 isotherms at 77 3 k 2 4 treatment experiments microplastics mps that had been pre wetted were poured into 250 ml conical flask containing 100 ml solution of pb at a concentration of 10 mg l moderate shaking was carried out in a thermostatic shaker to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium over night pre experiment confirmed that the equilibrium state was reached at 6 h the adsorption capacity was calculated by q t c 0 c t v m c 0 mg l initial pb concentration in solution c t mg l residual pb concentration at t v ml reaction solution volume m mg the mass of the microplastic and taken as the amount of pb that adhered onto the microplastic surface prior to the sr aops treatment in a typical treatment process 15 mg of the synthesized biochar was suspended in above solution followed by adding a certain amount of na2s2o8 maintaining final solution containing 0 25 mm ps to trigger the oxidation reaction the solution samples were withdrawn at each time interval and used for determination of parameters in solution after filtration by 0 45 μm pvdf disposable filters after 4 h of experiments the attached metal onto the microplastic surface were extracted by digestion with acid and measured by atomic absorption spectrometry peaa700 usa and the attached content of pb on microplastics was calculated by q m c 1 v 0 m 1 c 1 mg l pb concentration in digestion solution v 0 ml volume of digestion liquid m 1 mg the mass of the microplastic involved in digestion the differences in metal amount of mps before experiment and fe leaching from pgbc after reaction were detected through coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7800 the transformation of organic matter in solution across the treatment was measured by three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d emms recorded on fluoromax 4 fluorescence spectrophotometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization first of all it could be visually distinguished between natural aged and virgin mps on the basis of their external surface color fig s1 the darker color was assigned to the aged mps resulted from the attachment of organisms such as algaes mosses microbes and their secretions on the microplastic surface more detailed differences in surface morphology of microplastics can be observed by sem images fig 1 virgin microplastics were in the uniform shape of fragments with smooth and flat surface fig 1b since they were derived from the artificially mechanical fragmentation of commercial plastics notably the natural aged mps displayed changes in the morphology roughness and chemical properties on surface compared with virgin ones the surface of aged mps was rougher and presented macroscopic networks of microcracks with covering protrusions and deposition owing to chain scission of the polymer and mineral adhesion showing the characteristics of porous polymer table s1 shows the differences of metal content between virgin and natural aged microplastics determined by icp ms under the same digestion condition it can intuitively demonstrate that the metals such as mg al mn and fe related to mineral deposition are much more abundant in weathered microplastics than in the virgin ones the huge difference in cd content could be explained by the fact that cd was accumulated over a long period on natural aged microplastics which were collected from shallow flats of dongting lake where was polluted by cd the wrinkled and aggregated structure of aged mps might result in larger specific surface area and more potential adsorption sites for metal capture which also could reveal the affinity of microplastics for different organisms and their tendency for surface biofouling the surface functional groups of microplastics before and after weathering were characterized by ftir and shown in fig 1c variations in absorption peak position and peak intensity can be observed between them different from the spectrum of virgin microplastic a broadened new peak located at 1030 cm 1 was detected on the aged microplastic which is attributed to the c o c stretching vibration of ester in addition the new bands appearing at peak position of 535 and 785 cm 1 are assigned to the in plane bending vibration of the co in aliphatic ketone and the oscillations of c o of hetero aromatic ring respectively these variations in oxidation peaks of aged mps are derived from the long term photo oxidation by reaction with atmospheric oxygen during light irradiation assisted with biodeterioration when plastic was exposed to the natural environment fotopoulou and karapanagioti 2015 zhu et al 2019 besides the hetero aromatic ring structure which was not found in the virgin mps the peak positioned at 670 cm 1 in spectrum of aged microplastic could be derived from the c p vibration of phosphorus containing compounds which may be a proof for the organics covering on the surface of natural aged microplastic the zeta potentials of aged and virgin suspended microplastics under different ph values were investigated which reflected the surface charges according to the results obtained by fig 1f the negative values of both mps in a near neutral ph manifested microplastics could be stabilized and minimally aggregated in the natural aquatic environments owing to interparticle electrostatic repulsion li et al 2018 the surface of aged microplastics showed electronegative on a ph range of 2 6 and decreased gradually with increasing ph value compared with the virgin mps the aged mps accumulated more negative charges on surface and the zero point of charge phzpc drop from 3 06 examined by virgin mps suspension to less than 2 00 by aged mps suspension which was accounted for the changes in physico chemical properties of aged microplastic surface or the adhesion of negatively charged organic matter and minerals onto the surface in natural environment for long time 3 2 ps pgbc performance for metal removal from microplastic surface surface modification of aged mps was formed by long term weathering uv induced photo oxidation high temperature and humidity and typical conditions encountered at beaches these variations endow microplastic with larger specific surface area porosity and oxygen containing functional groups as well as turning charge through biofilm formation and mineral precipitation holmes et al 2014 turner and holmes 2015 the more heterogeneous and reactive surface induces greater adsorption capacity of aged mps than that of the virgin ones by electrostatic interactions cation exchange and co precipitation fig s2 shows a time dependent adsorption process and kinetics curve of pb by natural aged mps whose saturated adsorption capacity can reach as high as 20 15 mg g confirming the strong adsorption performance of aged mps and the role in respect of the transport and behavior of metals in aquatic environment compared with the equilibrium adsorbed amount of pb by virgin microplastics calculated to be 4 63 mg g under the same surrounding conditions it could be further clarified that the organic layer as well as the deposited minerals on mp surface formed by weathering was of great importance for metal accumulation the pb content attached to the microplastic surface was calculated to be 19 83 mg g measured by the acid digestion method which was very close to the adsorbed amount calculated by the pb concentration in solution at the equilibrium of adsorption 20 15 mg g therefore it is convincing that the content of pb attached onto the microplastic surface before sr aops treatment was calculated by equilibrium adsorption with pb concentration in the solution at the subsequent experiments undergone adsorption desorption equilibrium within 24 h samples were exposed to different treatment of individual pgmb ps and sr aops treatment with ps activated by pgmb lasting for 4 h as shown in fig 2 a compared with the negligible pb removal from microplastic surface under non treatment treatment by pgmb and ps alone successful combination system of pgmb and ps is likely to inspire the removal improvement for attached pb on microplastic surface with an over 60 removal efficiency calculated by the ratio of pb content on mps after sr aops treatment to the pb content on mps after adsorption to identify the changes in pb on microplastic surfaces elemental mapping analysis under scanning transmission electron microscopy stem mode was carried out to characterize the element distribution the evident contrast differences of pb distribution on microplastic surfaces before and after oxidation treatment by pgmb ps system could be observed on fig 1 this was a strong evidence for pb distribution with large amount on the surface of microplastics after adsorption operation fig 1d while the signal of the attached pb was significantly reduced after the sr aops reaction by pgmb ps system fig 1e it is worthwhile mentioning that the adsorbed amount of pb on biochar surface was observed to increase significantly from 7 07 mg g at treatment of pgmb individual to 31 29 mg g at pgmb ps treatment which not only proved that the prepared biochar has excellent adsorption properties for metals but also indirectly verified the advanced oxidation process of ps activated by pgmb would help the attached pb to fall off from the microplastic surface and thereby provide more opportunities for metal removal to gain more insight we explored the variation of pb concentration in different parts mps pgmb and solution with different periods as shown in fig 2b it could be found that once the aops were triggered by adding biochar into vessels pgmb can rapidly adsorb metal in the solution while activate ps to destroy the organic matter covered on microplastic surface for the pb detachment from surface the fluctuating pb concentration in solution reflected the process of pb desorption from microplastic surface and re adsorption onto pgmb until the end of the reaction the pb concentration in the solution changed little compared with that before aops treatment reflecting that the concentration of mobile pb would not be increased which indicated that the ecological risk of pb in the solution could be effectively controlled as the contact time increased the attached content of pb on microplastics surface gradually decreased while the adsorbed amount of pb on pgmb significantly increased realizing the transfer of metal from microplastic to biochar surface and achieving the purpose of metal separation through magnetic force scheme 1 concerning the potential vehicle role of microplastics for transfer of chemicals from river to ocean the influences of various factors in the natural environment on the performance of pgmb ps system for metal removal need to be further discussed the performance of the pgmb ps system from adsorption to separation removal of metal on microplastic surface under different salinity gradients is shown in fig 3 a a distinct decrease of the attached pb on microplastic surface could be found within the nacl electrolyte which may be explained by the competition of sodium ion for occupying the adsorption site and shielding negative charge of the microplastic surface to reduce electrostatic attraction although the final attached content of pb was lower in the salinity group than in the control the metal removal efficiency from the microplastic surface slightly decreased with the increase of salinity due to its low basic adsorption nacl exhibited an inhibitory effect on the detachment of pb from the microplastic surface as cl can be served as radical scavenger yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 to produce less reactive chlorine radical that adversely affected the exfoliation and breaking of organic layers another possible explanation is that the microplastic particles tend to be agglomerated at a higher salinity which is determined by the less electrostatic repulsion and the steric effect with compression of the electrical double layer li et al 2018 turner and holmes 2015 reducing the opportunities of contact between the microplastic surface and the reactive species generated on the surface of biochar followed by a decrease in degradation toward organic matter on mp surface in order to deeply investigate the practical application several common matrix species were discussed systematically for their effects on metal removal by pgmb ps system fig 3b displays the different attached amount of pb on solid mps and pgmb as well as the metal removal efficiency in the presence of various in organics the ph buffering action of hco3 and hpo2 4 resulted from hydrolysis can alkalinize the solution to a certain extent where an alkaline environment would benefit the precipitation or complexation of pb and reduce the amount of available pb ii for adsorption in solution in terms of the metal removal from microplastic surface based on the radical oxidation there is no denying that hco3 and hpo4 2 have great potential as scavenger to immediately capture radicals song et al 2019b ye et al 2019a thereby inhibiting the decomposition of organic matter and removal of metal on surface the difference between the two groups of hco3 and hpo4 2 is the adsorbed amount of pb on pgmb at the end of treatment it may arise from the fact that the biochar surface is still attractive for adsorption or adhesion of metals or their precipitation generated in the hco3 group while the metals in hpo4 2 group tended to generate soluble complexes by chelating effect a decreasing tendency in the attached amount of pb on mps surface was found as the humic acid ha content increased which was attributed to the extra interaction of ha as organic ligands with metals to produce in soluble complex compounds with stable chemical properties it should be mentioned that there seems to be no significant effect of added amount of ha with regard to the metal removal from microplastic surface it indicated that ha is more likely to affect the metal chelated affinity partition and influence limitedly the oxidation performance of reactive species generated by pgmb ps system considering that microplastics have experienced numerous seasonal cycles in nature the effects of ambient temperature on metal removal from microplastic surface by pgmb ps system were further explored on the basis of the results in fig s3 it can be concluded that higher temperature showed slight inhibited effect on pb adsorption to microplastic surface two possible explanations are responsible for this phenomenon 1 high temperature favors the thermal motion of molecules in solution thereby enhancing the pb ii mobility 2 metal attachment on microplastics dominated by physical interaction is a reversible process where the temperature rise is more conducive to the occurrence of desorption reaction in addition temperature is observed to have a remarkable impact on metal removal behavior from microplastic surface more radical generation by ps decomposition at higher temperature could account for the larger removal efficiency of metal as more radicals were involved in decomposing the organic matter that attached onto the microplastic surface based on the observation on fig s3 pb adsorption by pgmb is a spontaneous endothermic process dominated by chemical interaction indicating warming is likely to inspire more metal recovery with high adsorbed amount on biochar surface 3 3 mechanism exploration the surface properties of the prepared pgmb were characterized to gain more insight into its ability to activate ps decomposition and adsorb metal as can be seen from fig 4 a a plenty of hollow tubes consisted of thin walled carbon with rough surface was observed by sem on which many small bumps were assigned to be iron containing particles the uneven surface and the abundant pores on it provide a platform for the occurrence of various reactions the bet specific surface area of pgmb was calculated to be about 76 316 m2 g testing by n2 isotherms at 77k a iv type isothermal curve with a large hysteresisloop demonstrated the characteristic of mesoporous where the average pore size was detected to be 3 732 nm based on pore size distribution by the bjh model appropriate specific surface area and pore size distribution improved the surface accessibility for drawing ps melocules and metals to trigger surface reaction the graphitic structure and crystallinity of the prepared pgmb were provided by xrd patterns fig 4b a diffraction peak appearing at 26 5 was ascribed to the 002 plane of graphite demonstrating the locally ordered carbon structure even with the introduction of iron three typical characteristic peaks corresponding to fe0 were found at 2θ values of 44 6 65 2 and 82 3 in xrd spectrum respectively indicating that fe0 is the most important form of iron in the prepared biochar fe0 had been intensively investigated to exhibit strong activation ability for ps decomposition due to its low valence state it can not only produce more radicals by the heterogeneous transportation of electrons from fe0 to ps but also continuously and slowly provide fe ii for radical generation eqs 1 3 avoiding the quenching reactions between fe ii ion and so4 oh et al 2010 peluffo et al 2016 the other two weak peaks locating at 30 5 and 43 3 were indexed to the 220 and 400 crystal planes of fe3o4 further confirming the ferromagnetism of pgmb which allows metal could be separated from aqueous phase the vsm magnetization curve fig s4 of the recovered pgmb was examined with saturation magnetization value of 55 51 emu g for verifying the magnetic properties of pgmb after the whole treatment x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to analyze the valence state of each element in pgmb there are three fitted peaks in high resolution spectrum of c1s shown in fig 4e positioned at 284 8 286 2 and 288 8 ev corresponding to cc bonds in aromatic ring c o alkoxy and ketonic co respectively in which carbonyl and ketone groups had been proved to be the active site for triggering advanced oxidation processes duan et al 2016 shao et al 2018 ye et al 2020 moreover most of the oxygen containing functional groups such as co ketonic group cooh carboxyl and h o located at 530 2 531 7 and 533 3 ev respectively detected in the o1s high resolution spectrum were regarded as sites for metal adsorption tan et al 2015 ye et al 2017b 2019b fig 4g and h displays the binding energies of fe 2p peaks at 710 9 and 724 1 ev referring to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 orbit of fe respectively the additional satellite peaks of pgmb appeared in the high resolution spectrum of fe 2p after the aops reaction suggested the increase in oxidation state fe ш which was due to the participation of low valence fe in ps activation with fe cycle eqs 3 7 1 fe0 h2o fe ii oh h2 2 fe0 o2 2h2o 2

microplastics we deeply studied the relationship between the decomposition degree of organic matter on microplastic surface by acid or alkali treatment with the adsorbed amount of pb on the surface thus illustrating the feasibility of separating metals from microplastic surface through the decomposition of organic matter covering on it considering the different solubility of organic matter under the condition of acid and alkali the aged microplastics were shaken in different solutions to obtain various contents of organic matter coated on microplastics different toc values in aqueous phase the pre treated microplastics were dried and used to explore their ability of metal adsorption as shown in fig s5 it should be pointed out that the microplastic with the least amount of remaining organic matter on surface reflected by the largest toc value after the treatment of alkali liquor resulted in the smallest metal adsorption capacity the values of toc in the pretreatment solution were inversely proportional to the amount of metal adsorbed on the microplastic surface fig s5b which proved that the decomposition of organic matter on the microplastic surface can achieve metal detachment and removal from microplastics in order to further confirm the decomposition and mineralization of the organic matter 3d emm spectra was carried out to identify the transformation and evolution of organic matter in solution across the oxidation process by pgmb ps system a sample of the solution oscillated for 24 h with adding the same amount of microplastic as above experiment showed the multiple peaks before sr aops reaction fig 5 a based on spectrum elucidation there were mainly three kinds of fluorescent peak positioned at ex em of 1 250 300 280 380 nm peak a associated with microbial by product like substances including tryptophan and tyrosine 250 290 400 500 nm peak b associated with fulvic acid like compounds and 320 380 400 490 nm peak c associated with humic acid like compounds respectively when the sample was collected by the reaction time of 1 h fig 5b the fluorescence signal of the peak a that closely related to biology decreased markedly which proved that this part of organic matter is most sensitive to the oxidation reaction by pgmb ps system undergone 2 h of oxidation process the intensity of the b and c peaks drop sharply even almost disappeared describing that the fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were decomposed by a large amount during this period and they may be degraded into other intermediate products or mineralized thoroughly to produce co2 and h2o extending the reaction time to 4 h fig 5d the fluorescence intensity of b and c peak abnormally increased dramatically revealing that the organic substances originally covered onto the microplastic surface were destroyed and decomposed thereby released into solution the ftir spectrum of the microplastic that undergone the whole sr aops was performed to analyze the transformation in surface properties in comparison with the microplastic before reaction fig s6 the changes in either position or intensity of peaks associated with the covered organics on surface at 1420 1300 carboxylate and 900 600 cm 1 provided a supplementary explanation for the variation in coverage status of the organics on microplastic surface in the oxidation process the role of reactive species in the detachment of attached metals from microplastic surfaces and the types of active substances involved in the decomposition of organic matter can be analyzed by radical capture experiments methanol meoh and tert butyl alcohol tba at a molar ratio of 1000 to ps were adopted as the scavengers of both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively to consume the reactive species the moderate degree of reduction in metal removal efficiency was provided on fig 6 a which preliminarily indicated that both so4 and oh were produced according to eqs 3 11 and participated in the metal removal process taking the hydrophilicity of scavengers but the radical generated on surface into account the more hydrophobic scavenger for simultaneously capturing both radicals was applied in the presence of phenol the metal removal efficiency was found to be considerable decline from 60 45 to 37 55 confirming the important role of radicals on metal detachment from microplastic surfaces electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrum with dmpo as spin trapping agents is a powerful evidence fig 6b in which the emergence of characteristic peaks of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh adducts directly illustrated the generation and revolution processes of reactive species on system the metal removal by pgmb ps system still proceeded even if the radicals were trapped which was likely due to that the specific pathway of ps activation by carbon based catalyst non radical degradation continued to be a great impetus to organics decomposition luo et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 the sharp decrease in the metal recovery by pgmb is owing to the fact that the coverage of hydrophobic substances on the surface restricts its adsorption site or accessible pathway as well as less pb detached from microplastic and released into solution 4 conclusions in conclusion the removal of the attached heavy metals from natural aged microplastics was first achieved by the advanced oxidation reaction of ps activated by the prepared ferromagnetic biochar the pgmb ps system with reactive species generation and non radical pathway was proposed to transform and decompose the covered organic matter formed by long term exposure to the environment which acted the bridging role for metal adsorption on natural aged microplastic surface the metals that subsequently released from microplastic surface were re immobilized by biochar with favorable specific surface area and abundant versatile functional groups exhibiting great potential regarding the metal separation from aqueous phase through magnetic force the anti interference tests demonstrated that regardless of the differences in processing efficiency the relatively less contents of metal were eventually remained on microplastic after reaction under various surrounding conditions these new overall understandings provide novel opportunities for reducing the risks of microplastic

17877,to date high performance of full scale aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been demonstrated on a global scale its further integration with existing continuous flow activated sludge cfas treatment plants is the next logical step all granular sludge reactors operated in sequencing batch reactors sbr mode with anaerobic feeding conditions select for growth of phosphorus and glycogen accumulating organisms pao and gao respectively which are known to enhance sludge settling characteristics therefore we hypothesized that ags are commonly present at full scale cfas processes with enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and low sludge volume index svi this hypothesis was confirmed at 13 ebpr plants where granules were found present at plants where svi was lower than 100 ml g with a strong correlation between high granule abundance and low svi a wide range of granule abundance was found among the plants ranging from 0 5 to as high as 80 evaluations of the ebpr plant process configurations showed that high granule abundances may be related to selector design features such as high anaerobic food to mass f m ratios unmixed in line fermentation and high influent soluble cod fraction granules were also observed at a non ebpr plant with an aerobic selector receiving high f m feeds quantitative pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing analyses revealed higher relative gene abundance of accumulibacter pao and competibacter gao in the granules over flocs as well as a correlation between granule abundance and some possible eps producers such as flavobacterium and competibacter our results indicated that process configurations that select for slow growing or eps producing heterotrophs play an important role for granule formation in full scale cfas systems as previously shown in sbr configurations graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granules ebpr polyphosphate and glycogen accumulating organisms svi continuous flow abbreviations ags aerobic

interest as a biological treatment process more efficient for nutrient removal than the activated sludge process requiring less reactor volume energy and recycle pumping aerobic granules are self forming dense biofilm aggregates with high content of extracellular polymeric substances eps exhibiting greater adhesive and stronger gel properties than flocs nancharaiah and reddy 2018 seviour et al 2009 they are semi spherical and defined operationally as having a minimum diameter of 0 2 mm de kreuk et al 2007 but most typically range from 0 5 mm to 3 0 mm figdore et al 2017 the larger size and spherical morphology of granular sludge result in a much greater settling velocity and thickening ability compared to flocculent activated sludge adav et al 2008 in ags sequencing batch reactors sbrs granules have a sludge volume index svi of about 30 50 ml g with an svi5 svi30 near 1 0 whereas flocculent sludge has a typical svi30 of 100 ml g and an svi5 svi30 value in the range of 1 6 2 0 figdore et al 2017 winkler et al 2018 thus ags systems can be operated with a much higher mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration and shorter detention time to greatly improve system capacity reducing plant construction costs and footprint giesen et al 2013 various types of aerobic granules have been grown including heterotrophic liu et al 2003 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr pronk et al 2015 nitrifying belmonte et al 2009 nitrifying denitrifying wang et al 2012 and nitritation anaerobic ammonium oxidation granules winkler et al 2012 the existing literature has shown that anaerobic feeding conditions are not required for cultivation of aerobic granules but as yet granular sludge with ebpr and nitrification denitrification capability pao ndn granules is the preferred type for biological nutrient removal figdore et al 2018a there are also reports in the literature suggesting that selection of slow growing heterotrophs such as the polyphosphate and glycogen accumulating organisms paos and gaos respectively tends to form granules that are denser and smoother in comparison to heterotrophic granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 the well established treatment systems that select for pao ndn granules have been mostly limited to sbr such as the full scale ags nereda technology and therefore cannot be easily integrated in existing continuous flow activated sludge cfas infrastructure in sbr systems the readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand rbcod is used by slow growing heterotrophs to generate internal energy reserves as it is fed through the settled sludge bed anaerobically during the subsequent aeration phase the internal storages are used for phosphorus uptake and denitrification this anaerobic feast and famine operation favors the growth of slow growing paos and gaos that form the compact and smooth granule structure winkler et al 2011 the high food to mass f m feeding regime reduces diffusion limited growth by promoting substrate penetration into the granule core additionally the aeration period is followed by a short settling time and subsequently the influent feed pushes the effluent over the top of the reactor washing out the slow settling particles but retaining the larger ags aggregates pronk et al 2015 selective wasting of smaller particles is also done manually although cfas processes do not inherently have the key selective mechanisms of the ags sbr operation they have incorporated selector designs to favor growth of floc forming over filamentous organisms to avoid poor settling sludge such selectors have been categorized as either kinetic or metabolic selectors jenkins et al 2004 with the latter having an anaerobic or anoxic reactor in which the influent wastewater is in contact with recycle mixed liquor prior to entering the downstream aerobic reactor the anaerobic selector favors pao growth and is a necessary feature for the commonly used ebpr process designs in flocculent activated sludge processes despite the very low svi values as low as 49 ml g parker et al 2004 reported for some cfas ebpr facilities there has been no initiative to determine the presence of granules additionally the conventional microscopic practice at wastewater treatment plants uses a magnification too high generally 100x to visualize granules jenkins et al 2004 as a result granule occurrence at cfas facilities has remained largely unexplored for the 100 years plus history of activated sludge granules were speculated to be present in cfas plants with svis below 60 ml g martin et al 2016 and large dense particles with granular like appearance had also been observed in a cfas system svi 45 ml g operated with an anoxic selector andreasen et al 1999 however no confirmation with clear images of granules were provided by these studies downing et al 2017 were first to report on granule formation at a cfas plant with a high f m in an initial aerated zone and svi5 svi30 values of about 1 0 large particles were observed by light microscopy and sieve analysis showed that 80 of particles in the mixed liquor were greater than 0 20 mm thus we examined microscopically a sample from an a2o ebpr facility in washington state that utilized surface wasting for solids retention time srt control and reported periods of svi near 40 ml g our observation of small granules 212 500 μm diameter in this facility then led us to survey other cfas plants for the presence of granules in this work we collected sludge samples from 13 ebpr and 4 non ebpr cfas plants to investigate if granules are 1 commonly present at full scale continuous flow ebpr facilities with low svis and 2 related to the abundance of paos and gaos for each sludge sample the percentage of granules and flocs their relative sizes and their microbial community were analyzed the objective of this work was to determine if granule presence was common in cfas plants and if their presence could be related to process design and or operational factors the outcome of this research should aid in further understanding of the potential for implementing or improving granular growth in existing cfas facilities for treatment capacity and nutrient removal enhancement 2 methods 2 1 sample collection and plant data a mixed liquor grab sample was collected at the end of aeration basin from 13 ebpr plants and shipped overnight on ice to the university of washington a second sample was collected from 3 of the 13 plants resulting in a total of 16 mixed liquor samples table 1 samples were immediately stored at 4 c upon arrival and analyzed within 24 h each plant provided information on their process flow scheme operating conditions and secondary treatment influent and effluent data which typically included daily measurements of bod tss tkn nh3 n total and or ortho p for influent and effluent there was no data for influent volatile fatty acids vfas influent soluble cod scod data was available for only the id and sp plants we used data collected for the 3 srt period just prior to sample collection additional information of the plants are provided in the supplementary information including aeration basin design and hydraulic retention times table s1 influent characteristics and performance data tables s2 and s3 and process schematics table s4 five mixed liquor samples were also collected from 4 non ebpr plants table s5 to check for presence of granules 2 2 percent granule determination the percent of granule solids in a mixed liquor sample was based on the fraction of mixed liquor solids retained on a 212 μm sieve the suspended solids retained and passing through the sieve were measured separately and equaled the total suspended solids of the sample the presence of granules versus wastewater influent inert particulates was also confirmed by observing granular morphologies of mixed liquor at 6x 10x magnification under a zeiss stemi sv11 and zeiss stemi 508 for later samples stereomicroscope in dark field mode in addition neisser staining was performed as described in jenkins et al 2004 to detect the presence of paos in the granules 2 3 granular size distribution additional analysis was done for plant samples with a granular sludge content greater than 30 to determine the granular size distribution by image processing of stereo microscopic images taken in dark field mode the area of each granule was traced and measured manually using the fiji image processing package of imagej the diameter of the granule was then calculated from the area a d2п 4 assuming a spherical granule granule size distribution was based on the calculated diameter values 2 4 analytical methods suspended and volatile solids tss and vss were analyzed according to standard methods 2540d and 2540e the svi5 and svi30 ml g were determined from the settled volume ml of a mixed liquor sample after 5 and 30 min settling in a 1 l graduated cylinder divided by g tss 2 5 dna extraction flocs and granules were separated with a 212 μm sieve for 14 of the 16 ebpr mixed liquor samples id2 and puy1 were not included see table s6 for details dna was extracted for the granule and floc samples separately following the method described in tatti et al 2016 with a few exceptions samples were lysed for 25 s at the speed of 4 m s using the fastprep 24 bead beater mp biomedical and the cleanup step was repeated twice first with phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 then with chloroform isoamyl alcohol 24 1 concentrations of the dna samples were measured using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer for comparison purposes dna was also extracted from one non ebpr plant ed having no granule fraction 2 6 quantitative pcr dna extracted from 12 flocs and 12 granules from the ebpr plants were characterized with the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr excluding plants with granule abundance of less than 1 table s6 quantitative pcr was done on triplicate dna extractions except for those extracted only in duplicates he2 id1 and poc granules quantitative pcr targeted three populations using primers 341f 534r for total bacterial 16s rrna genes he et al 2007 651f 846r for candidatus accumulibacter crocetti et al 2000 and gbf gaoq989r for candidatus competibacter kong et al 2002 table s7 all reactions were run on the roche light cycler 96 using the faststart essential dna green master reaction mix for sybr green i technical duplicates were conducted for each dna extraction in 10 μl total volume containing 0 2 ng μl dna and 0 25 μm each for forward and reverse primers amplification efficiencies and starting concentrations n0 were calculated for each primer set using the linregpcr program ruijter et al 2009 relative gene copies were estimated by taking the ratio of n0 of pao or gao n0 total bacteria 2 7 amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified from 24 dna extractions 11 granule and 13 floc samples using primers 515f y 926r parada et al 2016 for pcr the amplification products were sequenced on a 2 300bp illumina miseq bgi genomics hong kong amplicon reads were processed following the divisive amplicon denoising algorithm 2 dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 a model based approach yielding amplicon sequence variants asv as the end product instead of the traditional operational taxonomic units otu the forward and reverse reads were first trimmed at 290 and 240 bp respectively while using 2 as the dada2 maximum expected error allowed in a read next 20 sub sample sets were used to conduct iterations for estimating the error rates and sample composition until they matched the samples were then denoised using the error parameters followed by identification of sequence variances and merging of forward and reverse reads taxonomy of the sequence variants were assigned from domain to genus level against the silva project s v 128 dataset using the ribosomal database project classifier wang et al 2007 the relative gene abundance of each asv was calculated by the amplicon read counts of each asv 100 divided by the total amplicon read counts the r package phyloseq version 1 28 0 was used to analyze the phylogenetic sequencing data calculate alpha diversity measures and perform non metric multi dimensional scaling and canonical correspondence analyses mcmurdie and holmes 2013 heatmaps were generated using the r package pheatmap version 1 0 12 2 8 estimation of gene copies in granule relative to floc using the relative gene abundances determined from qpcr and the percent granules eq 1 was applied to estimate the ratio of absolute gene abundance in granules relative to flocs the approach for arriving at eq 1 can be found in supplementary note 1 and the motivation for why this calculation was important was discussed in section 3 5 eq 1 x g x f x g g r a n u l e x f f l o c where x g x f gene copies in the granules relative to flocs in the mixed liquor x g and xf relative gene abundance to total bacterial gene copies in granules and flocs respectively known from qpcr results section 2 6 granule percent mlss retained on 212 μm sieve known from granule determination section 2 2 flocs 100 granules 3 results and discussions 3 1 high granule abundance is correlated with low svi the percent granules from the 16 ebpr samples ranged from 0 5 to 80 while the svi30 ranged from 39 to 209 ml g fig 1 granules could not be observed with the traditional light microscopic approach for activated sludge at typical magnifications of 100x which are too high for granule observations instead granules were observed with a stereomicroscope with darkfield illuminations at 6 20x magnifications fig 2 the granules exhibited semi spherical morphology and dense core as contrasted to flocculent sludge because cfas systems are not designed for granulation the granules were smaller in diameter mostly less than 0 5 mm than the typical 0 5 3 0 mm observed in granular sludge sbr systems having higher f m feeding and washout regimes figdore et al 2017 due to the small sizes of the granules their presence and abundance at cfas plants appears to have been generally overlooked non degraded influent particulates could contribute to the fractional granule determination based on the 212 μm sieve method especially at plants without primary treatment however our microscopic observations of the smooth morphology and dense core of the granules and enrichment of paos in these particles confirmed with neisser staining fig s1 indicated that granule growth dominated influent particulates size distribution analyses were conducted for samples with the highest percent granules fig 3 note that not all cfas granules were small as 15 of he1 s mixed liquor fell into the 0 5 mm size range the imaging technique used for obtaining the size distributions was not suitable for samples that were mostly flocs because outline tracing of the small and irregular aggregates was difficult if size distribution of highly flocculent samples is desired an alternative method e g using series of sieves would be needed three of the non ebpr plants ed lyn wp with svi30 of 193 475 ml g were filamentous and had minor or no granules table s5 fig s2 for the pasco plant the pas1 sample had 3 4 granules with high svi 193 ml g whereas pas2 sample had 44 granules with low svi 67 ml g neisser staining images not shown could not detect polyphosphate in both pas samples the pas plant had an aerobic selector that received only 10 of the return sludge flow see table s4 for configuration and thus the f m ratio of the aerobic selector was very high 18 3 28 8 gbod gvss d under this high f m operation a feast phase high availability of electron donor and acceptor is followed by a famine phase carbon depleted such an aerobic feast famine operational regime is known to select for polyhydroxyalkanoates pha storing organisms such as in bioplastic research mannina et al 2020 therefore even though paos were not detected at pasco it is possible that granule growth at this plant was related to the selection of other slow growing pha storing organisms additional data for the pas plant can be found in supplementary note 2 our observation of granules at pas confirmed the understanding that granulation can be achieved under aerobic operations without anaerobic or anoxic selectors li et al 2011 liu et al 2003 and that eps formation or other heterotrophs perhaps pha storing organisms other than pao may be contributing to granule growth at pas higher granule abundances were clearly correlated with lower svi values fig 1a and granule abundance of 1 were observed at all ebpr plants except kal and bm which were the two ebpr plants with the highest svi values it appears that granules are commonly present in ebpr plants with low svis the svi5 svi30 ratio is a common indicator for the settling characteristics of the sludge with granules the closer the svi5 svi30 ratio is to 1 the higher the amount of granules świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 this relationship was confirmed by our results with the significant correlation between higher granule abundance and svi5 svi30 as this ratio approached 1 fig 1b 3 2 possible importance of f m ratio and rbcod fraction anoxic and anaerobic selectors are typically used to improve settleability at cfas plants to suppress the growth of aerobic filamentous bacteria in ags systems the anaerobic zone is accompanied by high f m ratios to allow rbcod to reach the granule core by diffusion which speeds up granulation and supports granule stability li et al 2011 liu et al 2003 wu et al 2018 the ranges of nominal f m ratios are 0 15 1 3 g rbcod gmlss d in lab scale acetate fed sbrs and 0 1 0 3 kg cod kgvss d in full scale ags sbrs but much higher f m values can be expected as the influent is fed by plug flow in direct contact with the settled sludge bed rather than diluting it with the mixed liquor figdore et al 2017 in this study the f m ratios of the first anaerobic stage ranged from 0 65 to 14 0 gbod gvss d fig 4 we found no correlation between these f m ratios and the percent granules fig s3a it should be noted that the lack of correlation could be partly due to having only net bod data for most of the plants even though rbcod or vfas would be more representative as the electron donor for anaerobic metabolism of pao and gao the difference in process configurations also increased the variability for example cm had the highest influent bod table 1 but the lowest f m ratio due to the lack of anaerobic staging bm was also an outlier having a high f m feed with multiple anaerobic stages but a mixed liquor lacking granules and barely settled after 30 min this discrepancy may be related to bm being the only mbr plant characterized in this study having the longest srt and a different sludge wasting regime than the other plants with secondary clarifiers in addition bm was the only plant using glycerol as supplemented carbon source thus additional studies to provide more detailed cod characterizations in the f m analysis and to minimize plant to plant operational variables would likely improve understanding of factors contributing to granule formation however it should not be overlooked that the henderson plants he1 he2 and hw had the highest f m ratios and highest granule abundance he and hw also utilized an unmixed in line fermenter umif design by turning off the mixer in their second anaerobic zone to produce additional rbcod barnard et al 2012 although id had high granule abundance 68 but low f m it had a longer anaerobic hydraulic retention time fig 4 which could promote additional rbcod vfa formation additionally id had very high scod cod fraction 82 18 which serves as a precursor for a high rbcod fraction and thus a possibly higher f m if based on rbcod than some other plants as a comparison sp s scod cod fraction was 30 3 the only other plant with scod data and had lower granule percentage 5 6 the importance of f m ratio for improved settleability and granule growth had been noted by previous research at a full scale biological nitrogen removal plant wilen et al 2008 observed significant improvement in settleability svi of 30 70 ml g along with occurrence of paos although not an ebpr plant and elevated sludge eps content during a period when f m was increased due to bypassing primary settler similarly dense and granular like flocs with low diluted svis of 39 47 ml g were observed at a pulp and paper plant with an anoxic selector and very high f m ratios of 17 30 g scod gvss d andreasen et al 1999 although not yet conclusive these data have identified high f m ratios and high scod or rbcod fraction as factors relating to granule growth at cfas systems in addition to high anaerobic f m conditions feast a prolonged starvation famine phase has also been shown to enhance cell adhesiveness and granule stability in ags sbr systems wilen et al 2018 we explored the effect of starvation phase based on the plant s total srt anoxic and aerobic fraction of the srt srtanoxic aerobic and ratio of srtanoxic aerobic to minimum srt required for ebpr however no correlations could be found between these starvation parameters versus granule abundance figs s3b d it is possible that the effect of famine phase could not be seen with the range of srts in this study 3 3 microbial community compositions the amplicon reads from 16s rrna gene sequencing of 24 dna extractions were analyzed using dada2 resulting in a total of 397 146 amplicon reads and 4325 unique asvs the sequencing depth of each sample is shown in fig s4 after taxonomic assignment and prefiltering supplementary note 3 a total of 28 phyla and 385 genera were kept for subsequent analyses proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum across all samples with relative abundance ranging from 33 0 to 61 3 fig s5 within the proteobacteria phylum β proteobacteria 10 3 48 1 α proteobacteria 3 1 35 6 and γ proteobacteria 3 1 21 4 were the dominant classes the other dominant phyla were bacteroidetes 11 2 45 6 actinobacteria 0 3 31 9 chloroflexi 0 0 13 7 and planctomycetes none anammox type 0 2 8 6 these phyla are the common dominating microbial groups in full scale activated sludge treatment plants coats et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 at the genus level the genera exhibiting high abundance varied for each plant fig s6 but the most common dominating groups included flavobacterium candidatus competibacter competibacter zoogloea and candidatus accumulibacter accumulibacter accumulibacter was detected at all ebpr plants with relative gene abundances from 0 1 to 5 9 fig 5 puy2 floc was the only sample from an ebpr plant with no accumulibacter detected relative accumulibacter gene abundances of 0 2 6 had been reported for full scale ebpr plants coats et al 2017 lanham et al 2013 qiu et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 except he1 and bm tetrasphaera was detected at all ebpr plants at relative gene abundances of 0 04 1 22 previous studies had reported tetrasphaera abundances of 3 6 28 in full scale plants in temperate climate lanham et al 2013 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and 0 23 1 8 in tropical climate qiu et al 2019 the dna extraction method used here might have caused underestimation of the tetrasphaera abundances due to a shorter bead beating time utilized 25 s at 4 m s than the recommended protocols 160 s at 6 m s for extracting dna from gram positive actinobacteria e g tetrasphaera albertsen et al 2015 putative paos obscuribacter and candidatus accumulimonas were not detected in any samples candidatus competibacter was the dominate putative gao 0 04 17 for most of our ebpr plant samples fig 5 defluviicoccus was the dominant putative gao in cm both granules and flocs and id floc lab scale studies had shown that competibacter cannot metabolize propionate efficiently whereas defluviicoccus gaos can assimilate both acetate and propionate at relatively high rates dai et al 2007 cm and id received wastewater from a local fruit plant and malting plant respectively which can lead to higher vfas although the composition is unknown these industrial loads may explain the high influent bod of cm table 1 and high influent scod cod fraction of id discussed in section 3 2 the actinobacterial genus micropruina was the only putative gao detected at bm unlike the classical competibacter and defluviicoccus gaos micropruina is a fermentative gao that can utilize a broad range of substrates including glucose amino acids and glycerol mcilroy et al 2018 bm was the only plant in this study that used glycerol as a supplemental carbon source which may explain the dominance of micropruina gao comparison of alpha diversity measures showed no discernible differences between granules and flocs in terms of richness and evenness fig s7 which is in alignment with the literature winkler et al 2013a similarity analyses with non metric multidimensional scaling nmds results fig s8 showed that floc and granule samples did not form separate clusters instead samples from the same plant tended to ordinate closer together i e having more similar microbial community structure this observation suggested that the difference in microbial structure between granule and floc samples from the same plant is relatively small in comparison to the difference between two separate plants at a full scale ags sbr plant ali et al 2019 found that the percent of shared otus between flocs 0 2 mm and small granules 0 2 1 mm was 62 while this similarity was reduced for large granules sharing only 36 otus with flocs and 39 otus with small granules they concluded that the lack of a clear phylogenetic separation between floc and small granule communities was due to their similar srts on the other hand large granules had much higher srt and were enriched with putative functional groups for nitrogen and phosphorus removal due to the small granule size and lack of selective wasting at the plants in this study we can expect similar srts and high percent of shared asvs between granules and flocs which was found to be 83 7 among all the plants excluding asvs with 0 1 relative abundance 3 4 eps producing and filamentous organisms are related to granule abundance canonical correspondence cca was performed to correlate environmental factors with microbial community structure and to determine the major microbial groups related to granule abundance fig 6 is the resulted cca plots showing the ordinations of abundance gradient across the 11 plants with more than 0 5 granules constrained by environmental factors top 100 abundant genera were used for producing the cca plots but only the 10 genera showing the highest correlations with environmental factors furthest away from the origin were displayed for ease of visibility the strong positive correlation between temperature and granule was likely due to the high granule abundance at the henderson plants samples he1 he2 and hw where temperature was also high genera that correlated with the granule were competibacter roseiflexus nitrospira thermomonas flavobacterium and azospira the ratio of granule abundance over floc abundance fig 7 for the genera identified in the cca plots similarly showed that competibacter roseiflexus and nitrospira were commonly more abundant in the granules than flocs competibacter has been demonstrated to be an important eps producer during the granulation process which will be further discussed in section 3 5 roseiflexus is a filamentous bacterium closely related to the type 1851 morphotype filamentous bacteria have been shown to serve as the backbone of aerobic granules liu and liu 2006 which may explain the correlation of roseiflexus with granule abundance for all the plants where nitrospira was detected it was more dominant in the granules in comparison to flocs fig 7 as nitrospira are not the main eps producers in activated sludge systems they are likely not the cause of granulation their higher abundance in the granules may be explained by the preference of some complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira species for biofilm environments cotto et al 2019 flavobacterium are commonly present at relatively high abundance 1 2 in lab and full scale ags systems fed with real wastewater and appeared to be associated with eps production and or substrate hydrolysis fan et al 2018 świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 szabo et al 2017 except the high amount of thermomonas observed in a lab scale ags sbr treating synthetic wastewater song et al 2009 other mentions of thermomonas and azospira which are both heterotrophic denitrifiers heylen et al 2006 mcllroy et al 2016 in ags systems are very limited 3 5 abundance of accumulibacter and competibacter in granules over flocs are highly correlated with percent granule the qpcr results showed that the relative abundances of accumulibacter pao and competibacter gao were typically higher in the granules than in flocs supplementary note 4 relative abundances only represent the enrichment of pao or gao relative to other bacteria within an ecosystem e g granule or floc and cannot be used to compare abundances between granules versus flocs in the mixed liquor for example relative accumulibacter abundance in he1 granules was 2 more than the flocs whereas this difference was 10 for sp however he1 had 80 granules and sp only had 6 granules thus the absolute accumulibacter pao abundance in granule over floc is higher for he1 therefore an estimation approach was taken section 2 8 to compare the absolute abundances in granule relative to floc in the mixed liquor sample after this estimation the percent granules were significantly correlated with the estimated abundance ratio of granule over floc for accumulibacter and competibacter as shown in fig 8 our results confirmed that pao and gao were more dominant relative to other bacteria in the granules than flocs additionally a higher distribution of pao or gao abundance in the granules relative to flocs in a mixed liquor sample was associated with higher granule abundance undoubtedly the selection of slow growing heterotrophs such as pao and gao is known to induce granulation in ags sbrs de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 higher inert content e g polyphosphate of pao cells had been associated with higher biomass density and thus better sludge settleability schuler and jang 2007 winkler et al 2013b corroborating our findings on the correlation of pao abundance as related to low svi and granule growth in cfas systems the ability of pao aggregates to withstand higher shear stress than other floc forming populations larsen et al 2006 and produce denser granules in comparison to other granule types figdore et al 2018a winkler et al 2011 may contribute to the occurrence of granules at these cfas facilities although gaos do not accumulate polyphosphate competibacter enrichment was found to be related to the synthesis of granulan an exopolysaccharide important for the eps structural change during the granulation process in lab scale ags sbrs seviour et al 2011 in addition flocs in a competibacter dominated sbr without fast washout had been shown to self granulate during a period of increased physiological stress due to over aeration weissbrodt et al 2013 further research is needed to understand the role of pao and gao in eps production as related to granulation in cfas systems in addition the qpcr analyses of this study were limited to accumulibacter competibacter and did not capture other important putative pao gao populations such as tetrasphaera and micropruina of which tetrasphaera is as important as accumulibacter for biological p removal in full scale systems nielsen et al 2019 despite this limitation it can be concluded hereof that the abundances of accumulibacter and competibacter are associated with granule growth in full scale cfas systems 4 conclusions sludge samples were collected from 13 ebpr and 4 non ebpr cfas plants to determine the presence of granules and identify the factors related to granule growth we found that granules were commonly present in existing cfas treatment systems with low svis our evaluations of plant process configurations indicated that granule growth may be related to feeding characteristics such as high f m ratios and scod or rbcod fraction in the anaerobic selectors this observation was consistent with the high correlation of granule versus pao and gao abundances in the granules over flocs ongoing efforts for integrating ags technologies into cfas systems such as the use of hydrocyclones sturm et al 2017 or granule floc separator figdore et al 2018b could benefit from adopting strategies that increase the feed f m ratio or rbcod fractions granules were also observed at a facility with an aerobic selector receiving high f m feeds indicating that other heterotrophs other than pao were related to granule growth in addition the abundance of eps producers such as the flavobacterium was found to be correlated with granule abundance our results indicated that process configurations that select for the slow growing or eps producing heterotrophs may be factors contributing to granule growth in full scale cfas systems

17877,to date high performance of full scale aerobic granular sludge ags technology has been demonstrated on a global scale its further integration with existing continuous flow activated sludge cfas treatment plants is the next logical step all granular sludge reactors operated in sequencing batch reactors sbr mode with anaerobic feeding conditions select for growth of phosphorus and glycogen accumulating organisms pao and gao respectively which are known to enhance sludge settling characteristics therefore we hypothesized that ags are commonly present at full scale cfas processes with enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and low sludge volume index svi this hypothesis was confirmed at 13 ebpr plants where granules were found present at plants where svi was lower than 100 ml g with a strong correlation between high granule abundance and low svi a wide range of granule abundance was found among the plants ranging from 0 5 to as high as 80 evaluations of the ebpr plant process configurations showed that high granule abundances may be related to selector design features such as high anaerobic food to mass f m ratios unmixed in line fermentation and high influent soluble cod fraction granules were also observed at a non ebpr plant with an aerobic selector receiving high f m feeds quantitative pcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing analyses revealed higher relative gene abundance of accumulibacter pao and competibacter gao in the granules over flocs as well as a correlation between granule abundance and some possible eps producers such as flavobacterium and competibacter our results indicated that process configurations that select for slow growing or eps producing heterotrophs play an important role for granule formation in full scale cfas systems as

interest as a biological treatment process more efficient for nutrient removal than the activated sludge process requiring less reactor volume energy and recycle pumping aerobic granules are self forming dense biofilm aggregates with high content of extracellular polymeric substances eps exhibiting greater adhesive and stronger gel properties than flocs nancharaiah and reddy 2018 seviour et al 2009 they are semi spherical and defined operationally as having a minimum diameter of 0 2 mm de kreuk et al 2007 but most typically range from 0 5 mm to 3 0 mm figdore et al 2017 the larger size and spherical morphology of granular sludge result in a much greater settling velocity and thickening ability compared to flocculent activated sludge adav et al 2008 in ags sequencing batch reactors sbrs granules have a sludge volume index svi of about 30 50 ml g with an svi5 svi30 near 1 0 whereas flocculent sludge has a typical svi30 of 100 ml g and an svi5 svi30 value in the range of 1 6 2 0 figdore et al 2017 winkler et al 2018 thus ags systems can be operated with a much higher mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration and shorter detention time to greatly improve system capacity reducing plant construction costs and footprint giesen et al 2013 various types of aerobic granules have been grown including heterotrophic liu et al 2003 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr pronk et al 2015 nitrifying belmonte et al 2009 nitrifying denitrifying wang et al 2012 and nitritation anaerobic ammonium oxidation granules winkler et al 2012 the existing literature has shown that anaerobic feeding conditions are not required for cultivation of aerobic granules but as yet granular sludge with ebpr and nitrification denitrification capability pao ndn granules is the preferred type for biological nutrient removal figdore et al 2018a there are also reports in the literature suggesting that selection of slow growing heterotrophs such as the polyphosphate and glycogen accumulating organisms paos and gaos respectively tends to form granules that are denser and smoother in comparison to heterotrophic granules de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 the well established treatment systems that select for pao ndn granules have been mostly limited to sbr such as the full scale ags nereda technology and therefore cannot be easily integrated in existing continuous flow activated sludge cfas infrastructure in sbr systems the readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand rbcod is used by slow growing heterotrophs to generate internal energy reserves as it is fed through the settled sludge bed anaerobically during the subsequent aeration phase the internal storages are used for phosphorus uptake and denitrification this anaerobic feast and famine operation favors the growth of slow growing paos and gaos that form the compact and smooth granule structure winkler et al 2011 the high food to mass f m feeding regime reduces diffusion limited growth by promoting substrate penetration into the granule core additionally the aeration period is followed by a short settling time and subsequently the influent feed pushes the effluent over the top of the reactor washing out the slow settling particles but retaining the larger ags aggregates pronk et al 2015 selective wasting of smaller particles is also done manually although cfas processes do not inherently have the key selective mechanisms of the ags sbr operation they have incorporated selector designs to favor growth of floc forming over filamentous organisms to avoid poor settling sludge such selectors have been categorized as either kinetic or metabolic selectors jenkins et al 2004 with the latter having an anaerobic or anoxic reactor in which the influent wastewater is in contact with recycle mixed liquor prior to entering the downstream aerobic reactor the anaerobic selector favors pao growth and is a necessary feature for the commonly used ebpr process designs in flocculent activated sludge processes despite the very low svi values as low as 49 ml g parker et al 2004 reported for some cfas ebpr facilities there has been no initiative to determine the presence of granules additionally the conventional microscopic practice at wastewater treatment plants uses a magnification too high generally 100x to visualize granules jenkins et al 2004 as a result granule occurrence at cfas facilities has remained largely unexplored for the 100 years plus history of activated sludge granules were speculated to be present in cfas plants with svis below 60 ml g martin et al 2016 and large dense particles with granular like appearance had also been observed in a cfas system svi 45 ml g operated with an anoxic selector andreasen et al 1999 however no confirmation with clear images of granules were provided by these studies downing et al 2017 were first to report on granule formation at a cfas plant with a high f m in an initial aerated zone and svi5 svi30 values of about 1 0 large particles were observed by light microscopy and sieve analysis showed that 80 of particles in the mixed liquor were greater than 0 20 mm thus we examined microscopically a sample from an a2o ebpr facility in washington state that utilized surface wasting for solids retention time srt control and reported periods of svi near 40 ml g our observation of small granules 212 500 μm diameter in this facility then led us to survey other cfas plants for the presence of granules in this work we collected sludge samples from 13 ebpr and 4 non ebpr cfas plants to investigate if granules are 1 commonly present at full scale continuous flow ebpr facilities with low svis and 2 related to the abundance of paos and gaos for each sludge sample the percentage of granules and flocs their relative sizes and their microbial community were analyzed the objective of this work was to determine if granule presence was common in cfas plants and if their presence could be related to process design and or operational factors the outcome of this research should aid in further understanding of the potential for implementing or improving granular growth in existing cfas facilities for treatment capacity and nutrient removal enhancement 2 methods 2 1 sample collection and plant data a mixed liquor grab sample was collected at the end of aeration basin from 13 ebpr plants and shipped overnight on ice to the university of washington a second sample was collected from 3 of the 13 plants resulting in a total of 16 mixed liquor samples table 1 samples were immediately stored at 4 c upon arrival and analyzed within 24 h each plant provided information on their process flow scheme operating conditions and secondary treatment influent and effluent data which typically included daily measurements of bod tss tkn nh3 n total and or ortho p for influent and effluent there was no data for influent volatile fatty acids vfas influent soluble cod scod data was available for only the id and sp plants we used data collected for the 3 srt period just prior to sample collection additional information of the plants are provided in the supplementary information including aeration basin design and hydraulic retention times table s1 influent characteristics and performance data tables s2 and s3 and process schematics table s4 five mixed liquor samples were also collected from 4 non ebpr plants table s5 to check for presence of granules 2 2 percent granule determination the percent of granule solids in a mixed liquor sample was based on the fraction of mixed liquor solids retained on a 212 μm sieve the suspended solids retained and passing through the sieve were measured separately and equaled the total suspended solids of the sample the presence of granules versus wastewater influent inert particulates was also confirmed by observing granular morphologies of mixed liquor at 6x 10x magnification under a zeiss stemi sv11 and zeiss stemi 508 for later samples stereomicroscope in dark field mode in addition neisser staining was performed as described in jenkins et al 2004 to detect the presence of paos in the granules 2 3 granular size distribution additional analysis was done for plant samples with a granular sludge content greater than 30 to determine the granular size distribution by image processing of stereo microscopic images taken in dark field mode the area of each granule was traced and measured manually using the fiji image processing package of imagej the diameter of the granule was then calculated from the area a d2п 4 assuming a spherical granule granule size distribution was based on the calculated diameter values 2 4 analytical methods suspended and volatile solids tss and vss were analyzed according to standard methods 2540d and 2540e the svi5 and svi30 ml g were determined from the settled volume ml of a mixed liquor sample after 5 and 30 min settling in a 1 l graduated cylinder divided by g tss 2 5 dna extraction flocs and granules were separated with a 212 μm sieve for 14 of the 16 ebpr mixed liquor samples id2 and puy1 were not included see table s6 for details dna was extracted for the granule and floc samples separately following the method described in tatti et al 2016 with a few exceptions samples were lysed for 25 s at the speed of 4 m s using the fastprep 24 bead beater mp biomedical and the cleanup step was repeated twice first with phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 then with chloroform isoamyl alcohol 24 1 concentrations of the dna samples were measured using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer for comparison purposes dna was also extracted from one non ebpr plant ed having no granule fraction 2 6 quantitative pcr dna extracted from 12 flocs and 12 granules from the ebpr plants were characterized with the quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr excluding plants with granule abundance of less than 1 table s6 quantitative pcr was done on triplicate dna extractions except for those extracted only in duplicates he2 id1 and poc granules quantitative pcr targeted three populations using primers 341f 534r for total bacterial 16s rrna genes he et al 2007 651f 846r for candidatus accumulibacter crocetti et al 2000 and gbf gaoq989r for candidatus competibacter kong et al 2002 table s7 all reactions were run on the roche light cycler 96 using the faststart essential dna green master reaction mix for sybr green i technical duplicates were conducted for each dna extraction in 10 μl total volume containing 0 2 ng μl dna and 0 25 μm each for forward and reverse primers amplification efficiencies and starting concentrations n0 were calculated for each primer set using the linregpcr program ruijter et al 2009 relative gene copies were estimated by taking the ratio of n0 of pao or gao n0 total bacteria 2 7 amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified from 24 dna extractions 11 granule and 13 floc samples using primers 515f y 926r parada et al 2016 for pcr the amplification products were sequenced on a 2 300bp illumina miseq bgi genomics hong kong amplicon reads were processed following the divisive amplicon denoising algorithm 2 dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 a model based approach yielding amplicon sequence variants asv as the end product instead of the traditional operational taxonomic units otu the forward and reverse reads were first trimmed at 290 and 240 bp respectively while using 2 as the dada2 maximum expected error allowed in a read next 20 sub sample sets were used to conduct iterations for estimating the error rates and sample composition until they matched the samples were then denoised using the error parameters followed by identification of sequence variances and merging of forward and reverse reads taxonomy of the sequence variants were assigned from domain to genus level against the silva project s v 128 dataset using the ribosomal database project classifier wang et al 2007 the relative gene abundance of each asv was calculated by the amplicon read counts of each asv 100 divided by the total amplicon read counts the r package phyloseq version 1 28 0 was used to analyze the phylogenetic sequencing data calculate alpha diversity measures and perform non metric multi dimensional scaling and canonical correspondence analyses mcmurdie and holmes 2013 heatmaps were generated using the r package pheatmap version 1 0 12 2 8 estimation of gene copies in granule relative to floc using the relative gene abundances determined from qpcr and the percent granules eq 1 was applied to estimate the ratio of absolute gene abundance in granules relative to flocs the approach for arriving at eq 1 can be found in supplementary note 1 and the motivation for why this calculation was important was discussed in section 3 5 eq 1 x g x f x g g r a n u l e x f f l o c where x g x f gene copies in the granules relative to flocs in the mixed liquor x g and xf relative gene abundance to total bacterial gene copies in granules and flocs respectively known from qpcr results section 2 6 granule percent mlss retained on 212 μm sieve known from granule determination section 2 2 flocs 100 granules 3 results and discussions 3 1 high granule abundance is correlated with low svi the percent granules from the 16 ebpr samples ranged from 0 5 to 80 while the svi30 ranged from 39 to 209 ml g fig 1 granules could not be observed with the traditional light microscopic approach for activated sludge at typical magnifications of 100x which are too high for granule observations instead granules were observed with a stereomicroscope with darkfield illuminations at 6 20x magnifications fig 2 the granules exhibited semi spherical morphology and dense core as contrasted to flocculent sludge because cfas systems are not designed for granulation the granules were smaller in diameter mostly less than 0 5 mm than the typical 0 5 3 0 mm observed in granular sludge sbr systems having higher f m feeding and washout regimes figdore et al 2017 due to the small sizes of the granules their presence and abundance at cfas plants appears to have been generally overlooked non degraded influent particulates could contribute to the fractional granule determination based on the 212 μm sieve method especially at plants without primary treatment however our microscopic observations of the smooth morphology and dense core of the granules and enrichment of paos in these particles confirmed with neisser staining fig s1 indicated that granule growth dominated influent particulates size distribution analyses were conducted for samples with the highest percent granules fig 3 note that not all cfas granules were small as 15 of he1 s mixed liquor fell into the 0 5 mm size range the imaging technique used for obtaining the size distributions was not suitable for samples that were mostly flocs because outline tracing of the small and irregular aggregates was difficult if size distribution of highly flocculent samples is desired an alternative method e g using series of sieves would be needed three of the non ebpr plants ed lyn wp with svi30 of 193 475 ml g were filamentous and had minor or no granules table s5 fig s2 for the pasco plant the pas1 sample had 3 4 granules with high svi 193 ml g whereas pas2 sample had 44 granules with low svi 67 ml g neisser staining images not shown could not detect polyphosphate in both pas samples the pas plant had an aerobic selector that received only 10 of the return sludge flow see table s4 for configuration and thus the f m ratio of the aerobic selector was very high 18 3 28 8 gbod gvss d under this high f m operation a feast phase high availability of electron donor and acceptor is followed by a famine phase carbon depleted such an aerobic feast famine operational regime is known to select for polyhydroxyalkanoates pha storing organisms such as in bioplastic research mannina et al 2020 therefore even though paos were not detected at pasco it is possible that granule growth at this plant was related to the selection of other slow growing pha storing organisms additional data for the pas plant can be found in supplementary note 2 our observation of granules at pas confirmed the understanding that granulation can be achieved under aerobic operations without anaerobic or anoxic selectors li et al 2011 liu et al 2003 and that eps formation or other heterotrophs perhaps pha storing organisms other than pao may be contributing to granule growth at pas higher granule abundances were clearly correlated with lower svi values fig 1a and granule abundance of 1 were observed at all ebpr plants except kal and bm which were the two ebpr plants with the highest svi values it appears that granules are commonly present in ebpr plants with low svis the svi5 svi30 ratio is a common indicator for the settling characteristics of the sludge with granules the closer the svi5 svi30 ratio is to 1 the higher the amount of granules świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 this relationship was confirmed by our results with the significant correlation between higher granule abundance and svi5 svi30 as this ratio approached 1 fig 1b 3 2 possible importance of f m ratio and rbcod fraction anoxic and anaerobic selectors are typically used to improve settleability at cfas plants to suppress the growth of aerobic filamentous bacteria in ags systems the anaerobic zone is accompanied by high f m ratios to allow rbcod to reach the granule core by diffusion which speeds up granulation and supports granule stability li et al 2011 liu et al 2003 wu et al 2018 the ranges of nominal f m ratios are 0 15 1 3 g rbcod gmlss d in lab scale acetate fed sbrs and 0 1 0 3 kg cod kgvss d in full scale ags sbrs but much higher f m values can be expected as the influent is fed by plug flow in direct contact with the settled sludge bed rather than diluting it with the mixed liquor figdore et al 2017 in this study the f m ratios of the first anaerobic stage ranged from 0 65 to 14 0 gbod gvss d fig 4 we found no correlation between these f m ratios and the percent granules fig s3a it should be noted that the lack of correlation could be partly due to having only net bod data for most of the plants even though rbcod or vfas would be more representative as the electron donor for anaerobic metabolism of pao and gao the difference in process configurations also increased the variability for example cm had the highest influent bod table 1 but the lowest f m ratio due to the lack of anaerobic staging bm was also an outlier having a high f m feed with multiple anaerobic stages but a mixed liquor lacking granules and barely settled after 30 min this discrepancy may be related to bm being the only mbr plant characterized in this study having the longest srt and a different sludge wasting regime than the other plants with secondary clarifiers in addition bm was the only plant using glycerol as supplemented carbon source thus additional studies to provide more detailed cod characterizations in the f m analysis and to minimize plant to plant operational variables would likely improve understanding of factors contributing to granule formation however it should not be overlooked that the henderson plants he1 he2 and hw had the highest f m ratios and highest granule abundance he and hw also utilized an unmixed in line fermenter umif design by turning off the mixer in their second anaerobic zone to produce additional rbcod barnard et al 2012 although id had high granule abundance 68 but low f m it had a longer anaerobic hydraulic retention time fig 4 which could promote additional rbcod vfa formation additionally id had very high scod cod fraction 82 18 which serves as a precursor for a high rbcod fraction and thus a possibly higher f m if based on rbcod than some other plants as a comparison sp s scod cod fraction was 30 3 the only other plant with scod data and had lower granule percentage 5 6 the importance of f m ratio for improved settleability and granule growth had been noted by previous research at a full scale biological nitrogen removal plant wilen et al 2008 observed significant improvement in settleability svi of 30 70 ml g along with occurrence of paos although not an ebpr plant and elevated sludge eps content during a period when f m was increased due to bypassing primary settler similarly dense and granular like flocs with low diluted svis of 39 47 ml g were observed at a pulp and paper plant with an anoxic selector and very high f m ratios of 17 30 g scod gvss d andreasen et al 1999 although not yet conclusive these data have identified high f m ratios and high scod or rbcod fraction as factors relating to granule growth at cfas systems in addition to high anaerobic f m conditions feast a prolonged starvation famine phase has also been shown to enhance cell adhesiveness and granule stability in ags sbr systems wilen et al 2018 we explored the effect of starvation phase based on the plant s total srt anoxic and aerobic fraction of the srt srtanoxic aerobic and ratio of srtanoxic aerobic to minimum srt required for ebpr however no correlations could be found between these starvation parameters versus granule abundance figs s3b d it is possible that the effect of famine phase could not be seen with the range of srts in this study 3 3 microbial community compositions the amplicon reads from 16s rrna gene sequencing of 24 dna extractions were analyzed using dada2 resulting in a total of 397 146 amplicon reads and 4325 unique asvs the sequencing depth of each sample is shown in fig s4 after taxonomic assignment and prefiltering supplementary note 3 a total of 28 phyla and 385 genera were kept for subsequent analyses proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum across all samples with relative abundance ranging from 33 0 to 61 3 fig s5 within the proteobacteria phylum β proteobacteria 10 3 48 1 α proteobacteria 3 1 35 6 and γ proteobacteria 3 1 21 4 were the dominant classes the other dominant phyla were bacteroidetes 11 2 45 6 actinobacteria 0 3 31 9 chloroflexi 0 0 13 7 and planctomycetes none anammox type 0 2 8 6 these phyla are the common dominating microbial groups in full scale activated sludge treatment plants coats et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 at the genus level the genera exhibiting high abundance varied for each plant fig s6 but the most common dominating groups included flavobacterium candidatus competibacter competibacter zoogloea and candidatus accumulibacter accumulibacter accumulibacter was detected at all ebpr plants with relative gene abundances from 0 1 to 5 9 fig 5 puy2 floc was the only sample from an ebpr plant with no accumulibacter detected relative accumulibacter gene abundances of 0 2 6 had been reported for full scale ebpr plants coats et al 2017 lanham et al 2013 qiu et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 except he1 and bm tetrasphaera was detected at all ebpr plants at relative gene abundances of 0 04 1 22 previous studies had reported tetrasphaera abundances of 3 6 28 in full scale plants in temperate climate lanham et al 2013 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and 0 23 1 8 in tropical climate qiu et al 2019 the dna extraction method used here might have caused underestimation of the tetrasphaera abundances due to a shorter bead beating time utilized 25 s at 4 m s than the recommended protocols 160 s at 6 m s for extracting dna from gram positive actinobacteria e g tetrasphaera albertsen et al 2015 putative paos obscuribacter and candidatus accumulimonas were not detected in any samples candidatus competibacter was the dominate putative gao 0 04 17 for most of our ebpr plant samples fig 5 defluviicoccus was the dominant putative gao in cm both granules and flocs and id floc lab scale studies had shown that competibacter cannot metabolize propionate efficiently whereas defluviicoccus gaos can assimilate both acetate and propionate at relatively high rates dai et al 2007 cm and id received wastewater from a local fruit plant and malting plant respectively which can lead to higher vfas although the composition is unknown these industrial loads may explain the high influent bod of cm table 1 and high influent scod cod fraction of id discussed in section 3 2 the actinobacterial genus micropruina was the only putative gao detected at bm unlike the classical competibacter and defluviicoccus gaos micropruina is a fermentative gao that can utilize a broad range of substrates including glucose amino acids and glycerol mcilroy et al 2018 bm was the only plant in this study that used glycerol as a supplemental carbon source which may explain the dominance of micropruina gao comparison of alpha diversity measures showed no discernible differences between granules and flocs in terms of richness and evenness fig s7 which is in alignment with the literature winkler et al 2013a similarity analyses with non metric multidimensional scaling nmds results fig s8 showed that floc and granule samples did not form separate clusters instead samples from the same plant tended to ordinate closer together i e having more similar microbial community structure this observation suggested that the difference in microbial structure between granule and floc samples from the same plant is relatively small in comparison to the difference between two separate plants at a full scale ags sbr plant ali et al 2019 found that the percent of shared otus between flocs 0 2 mm and small granules 0 2 1 mm was 62 while this similarity was reduced for large granules sharing only 36 otus with flocs and 39 otus with small granules they concluded that the lack of a clear phylogenetic separation between floc and small granule communities was due to their similar srts on the other hand large granules had much higher srt and were enriched with putative functional groups for nitrogen and phosphorus removal due to the small granule size and lack of selective wasting at the plants in this study we can expect similar srts and high percent of shared asvs between granules and flocs which was found to be 83 7 among all the plants excluding asvs with 0 1 relative abundance 3 4 eps producing and filamentous organisms are related to granule abundance canonical correspondence cca was performed to correlate environmental factors with microbial community structure and to determine the major microbial groups related to granule abundance fig 6 is the resulted cca plots showing the ordinations of abundance gradient across the 11 plants with more than 0 5 granules constrained by environmental factors top 100 abundant genera were used for producing the cca plots but only the 10 genera showing the highest correlations with environmental factors furthest away from the origin were displayed for ease of visibility the strong positive correlation between temperature and granule was likely due to the high granule abundance at the henderson plants samples he1 he2 and hw where temperature was also high genera that correlated with the granule were competibacter roseiflexus nitrospira thermomonas flavobacterium and azospira the ratio of granule abundance over floc abundance fig 7 for the genera identified in the cca plots similarly showed that competibacter roseiflexus and nitrospira were commonly more abundant in the granules than flocs competibacter has been demonstrated to be an important eps producer during the granulation process which will be further discussed in section 3 5 roseiflexus is a filamentous bacterium closely related to the type 1851 morphotype filamentous bacteria have been shown to serve as the backbone of aerobic granules liu and liu 2006 which may explain the correlation of roseiflexus with granule abundance for all the plants where nitrospira was detected it was more dominant in the granules in comparison to flocs fig 7 as nitrospira are not the main eps producers in activated sludge systems they are likely not the cause of granulation their higher abundance in the granules may be explained by the preference of some complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira species for biofilm environments cotto et al 2019 flavobacterium are commonly present at relatively high abundance 1 2 in lab and full scale ags systems fed with real wastewater and appeared to be associated with eps production and or substrate hydrolysis fan et al 2018 świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 szabo et al 2017 except the high amount of thermomonas observed in a lab scale ags sbr treating synthetic wastewater song et al 2009 other mentions of thermomonas and azospira which are both heterotrophic denitrifiers heylen et al 2006 mcllroy et al 2016 in ags systems are very limited 3 5 abundance of accumulibacter and competibacter in granules over flocs are highly correlated with percent granule the qpcr results showed that the relative abundances of accumulibacter pao and competibacter gao were typically higher in the granules than in flocs supplementary note 4 relative abundances only represent the enrichment of pao or gao relative to other bacteria within an ecosystem e g granule or floc and cannot be used to compare abundances between granules versus flocs in the mixed liquor for example relative accumulibacter abundance in he1 granules was 2 more than the flocs whereas this difference was 10 for sp however he1 had 80 granules and sp only had 6 granules thus the absolute accumulibacter pao abundance in granule over floc is higher for he1 therefore an estimation approach was taken section 2 8 to compare the absolute abundances in granule relative to floc in the mixed liquor sample after this estimation the percent granules were significantly correlated with the estimated abundance ratio of granule over floc for accumulibacter and competibacter as shown in fig 8 our results confirmed that pao and gao were more dominant relative to other bacteria in the granules than flocs additionally a higher distribution of pao or gao abundance in the granules relative to flocs in a mixed liquor sample was associated with higher granule abundance undoubtedly the selection of slow growing heterotrophs such as pao and gao is known to induce granulation in ags sbrs de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 higher inert content e g polyphosphate of pao cells had been associated with higher biomass density and thus better sludge settleability schuler and jang 2007 winkler et al 2013b corroborating our findings on the correlation of pao abundance as related to low svi and granule growth in cfas systems the ability of pao aggregates to withstand higher shear stress than other floc forming populations larsen et al 2006 and produce denser granules in comparison to other granule types figdore et al 2018a winkler et al 2011 may contribute to the occurrence of granules at these cfas facilities although gaos do not accumulate polyphosphate competibacter enrichment was found to be related to the synthesis of granulan an exopolysaccharide important for the eps structural change during the granulation process in lab scale ags sbrs seviour et al 2011 in addition flocs in a competibacter dominated sbr without fast washout had been shown to self granulate during a period of increased physiological stress due to over aeration weissbrodt et al 2013 further research is needed to understand the role of pao and gao in eps production as related to granulation in cfas systems in addition the qpcr analyses of this study were limited to accumulibacter competibacter and did not capture other important putative pao gao populations such as tetrasphaera and micropruina of which tetrasphaera is as important as accumulibacter for biological p removal in full scale systems nielsen et al 2019 despite this limitation it can be concluded hereof that the abundances of accumulibacter and competibacter are associated with granule growth in full scale cfas systems 4 conclusions sludge samples were collected from 13 ebpr and 4 non ebpr cfas plants to determine the presence of granules and identify the factors related to granule growth we found that granules were commonly present in existing cfas treatment systems with low svis our evaluations of plant process configurations indicated that granule growth may be related to feeding characteristics such as high f m ratios and scod or rbcod fraction in the anaerobic selectors this observation was consistent with the high correlation of granule versus pao and gao abundances in the granules over flocs ongoing efforts for integrating ags technologies into cfas systems such as the use of hydrocyclones sturm et al 2017 or granule floc separator figdore et al 2018b could benefit from adopting strategies that increase the feed f m ratio or rbcod fractions granules were also observed at a facility with an aerobic selector receiving high f m feeds indicating that other heterotrophs other than pao were related to granule growth in addition the abundance of eps producers such as the flavobacterium was found to be correlated with granule abundance our results indicated that process configurations that select for the slow growing or eps producing heterotrophs may be factors contributing to granule growth in full scale cfas systems

17878,quorum quenching qq has been applied as a promising membrane fouling control strategy for anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs nevertheless long term operation of anmbrs for real domestic wastewater dww treatment needs to be systematically studied to evaluate comprehensive membrane fouling mechanisms and bioprocess performance in this study the impact of qq on membrane fouling was investigated using a quorum quenching anmbr qqanmbr deploying a bead entrapped facultative quorum quenching consortium fqq to treat dww fqq was shown to prolong membrane filtration operation by an average of 75 reduced proteins p 0 005 and carbohydrates p 0 005 in the extracellular polymeric substances eps of mixed liquor ml were key differentiators that led to lower cake layer cl formation additionally reduced biopolymers production p 0 05 in eps improved sludge dewaterability the findings suggested that qq could alter fluorescent microbial metabolites of both eps and cl as unveiled by excitation emission matrix spectra pattern furthermore colloidal particles i e particles with size larger than 0 45 μm in ml supernatants production was retarded by qq thereafter also contributed to the reduced cl formation pore blockage was slightly increased by qq which might be attributed to pore blockage by large 230 nm and small organic compounds 51 nm in soluble microbial products smp however qq had no significant impact on organic concentration of smp and qq was not associated with particle size distribution of biomass qq performance was further affirmed through suppressed production of c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl the overall ahls degradability of fqq was well maintained even after five membrane service cycles total operation of 70 d moreover qq had no compromised impact on treatment performance i e chemical oxygen demand cod removal and methane yield collectively this study bridged the knowledge gap to bring forward qq technology in anmbr for widespread domestic wastewater treatment application graphical abstract image 1 keywords anmbrs colloidal particles eps smp fouling quorum quenching 1 introduction numerous studies have explored various innovative technologies to convert current schemes of domestic wastewater dww treatment to energy positive processes mccarty et al 2011 notably anaerobic processes are novel alternatives these processes offer significant operational cost savings because there are no requirement for aeration low sludge production for handling and disposal and high acquisition of methane by directly capturing organics from wastewater rather than through sludge digestion of excess sludge produced from conventional aerobic activated sludge systems mccarty et al 2011 however conventional anaerobic process is often plagued with washout of slow growing anaerobic microorganisms huang et al 2011 anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs which integrate membranes into anaerobic reactors for solids and liquid separation could enable operation of long solid retention time srt and short hydraulic retention time hrt ng et al 2020 this surmounts the drawback of conventional anaerobic processes which in turn aid in producing effluent with lower organic contaminants and free from suspended solids ss nevertheless severe membrane fouling i e the undesirable formation of a cohesive biofilm on membranes is a long standing predominant bottleneck for anmbrs which leads to a high life cycle cost especially low critical flux of anmbrs which is commonly less than 20 l m 2 h 1 lmh fox and stuckey 2015 yue et al 2015 hindered their commercial scalability although extensive physical and chemical fouling mitigation approaches have been implemented to counteract this chronic deficiency fox and stuckey 2015 yue et al 2018 the methods were not able to directly prevent biofilm formation on the membrane surfaces thus an efficient fouling control regime to retrofit anmbrs for dww treatment is critically needed quorum sensing qs which is a cell to cell communication among bacterial community promoted by n acyl homoserine lactones ahls as a typical qs signal is deemed important to anaerobic treatment process lv et al 2018 huang et al 2020 as bacterial qs could induce biofilm development kim et al 2013 the ability to manipulate qs created new possibilities for membrane fouling control a forefront biological paradigm termed quorum quenching qq based on qs disruption by using a facultative quorum quenching bacterium microbacterium sp was shown to mitigate membrane fouling in a lab scale anmbr qqanmbr treating synthetic wastewater liu et al 2019 however qq bacterium bioactivity on ahls degradation in the qqanmbr was found to reduce after operating for about 45 d this could be due to predation or competition with indigenous bacteria thus to revitalize competitiveness of qqanmbrs a facultative quorum quenching consortium named fqq c6 fqq isolated by xu et al 2020 which would possess a wider range of ahls degradability and high survivability was employed in this study to mitigate membrane fouling in anmbrs treating dww qq would inhibit the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps as it is directly facilitated by qs kim et al 2013 however little is known on the effect of qq on key organic matters in eps of mixed liquor ml especially biopolymers which could cause poor biomass dewaterability niu et al 2013 furthermore clear mechanism of qq limiting soluble microbial products smp formation is still not well understood although there was mounting evidence that qq could reduce membrane fouling by retarding the production of smp and eps findings are still relatively inconsistent kampouris et al 2018 weerasekara et al 2014 yu et al 2019 a prior study observed that qq could only decrease eps rather than smp yu et al 2019 further qq was even reported to have no adverse impact on smp nor eps formation weerasekara et al 2014 smp was found to cause pore blockage while eps in ml could help biomass adhere to membrane surface and provide the architecture needed for biofilm formation kampouris et al 2018 these findings reflected the different fouling mechanisms between smp and eps therefore the influence of qq on smp and eps formation in anmbrs would need to be further elucidated the existing knowledge of qq in altering fouling mechanism with regarded to size fractioned particles is obscured the effect of qq in retarding eps formation could accelerate deflocculation of biomass flocs jiang et al 2013 this subsequently could lead to severe membrane fouling due to the deposition of small particles onto membrane surface meng et al 2006 nevertheless one study showed there was no correlation between qq and changes in particle size distribution psd of biomass weerasekara et al 2014 therefore further evaluation on psd of biomass in qqanmbrs is needed to verify these findings in addition currently fundamental membrane fouling research effort has mainly focused on the smp i e filtrates of ml supernatants filtered by 0 45 μm membranes of anmbrs huang et al 2011 yue et al 2015 overlooking the contribution of colloidal particles i e particles with size larger than 0 45 μm in ml supernatants dong et al 2015 which was suggested to be a main factor driving initial biofilm formation in anmbrs zhou et al 2019 as qs would be promoted by abundant free bacterial cells harbored within colloids zhou et al 2019 considerable proteins and carbohydrates could be generated to cause serious membrane fouling the information regarding the influence of qq on colloidal particles was a black box with poor understanding therefore investigation of colloidal particles in qqanmbrs could expand our knowledge of the mechanism of qq governing the associated elusive fouling mitigation moreover membrane pore blockage has been demonstrated increase by qq waheed et al 2017 theoretically pore blockage is achieved by particles of similar size to the membrane pores of anmbrs e g commonly nominal pore size of 0 08 0 45 μm huang et al 2011 wu et al 2011 yue et al 2018 therefore it was also imperative to investigate organic size distribution osd of smp which has comparable range to the membrane pore size to further probe the pore blocking mechanism in qqanmbrs to address the aforementioned knowledge gaps a comprehensive assessment of the qqanmbr for dww treatment was conducted in this study the effect of fqq on membrane fouling control was evaluated by monitoring changes in trans membrane pressures tmps and crucial organics of eps smp and cake layer cl in anmbrs size fractioned particles and organics coupled with membrane resistance profiles were investigated to offer an in depth understanding of qq associated fouling mechanism this study would generate fundamental knowledge and provide mechanistic insights involved in the underlying fouling control mechanism of qqanmbrs for holistic treatment of dww 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbrs setup and operation fig 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of two lab scale anmbrs r1 and r2 used in this study both anmbrs were seeded with sludge obtained from an anaerobic digester of a local domestic wastewater treatment plant and operated in parallel at room temperature 30 3 c each anmbr comprised a 6 l anaerobic tank coupled to a 1 17 l submerged membrane tank the latter employed a flat sheet ceramic membrane module with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and a total surface area of 0 045 m2 meiden japan both anmbrs were operated with a srt and a hrt of 30 d and 17 h respectively gas pumps knf n86 kt 18 germany were employed to provide souring effect in the membrane tanks at a gas sparing rate of 0 7 l min to avoid mechanical decomposition of beads when passing through the recirculation pump a 3 mm mesh was installed at the outlet point of the membrane tank ph was adjusted to be above 7 by ph controllers etatron d s s p a italy the ph in both r1 and r2 were noted to be stable with average values of 7 84 0 11 and 7 80 0 21 respectively throughout the experiment dww table s1 used in this study was collected from a local domestic wastewater treatment plant the wastewater was passed through a 1 mm mesh sieve to remove large particulate matters before continuously fed into the anmbrs other anmbr parameters are summarized in table s2 fouled membrane was taken offline for cleaning when the trans membrane pressure tmp exceeded 30 kpa meanwhile operation continued by replacing with a new piece of membrane membrane cleaning was conducted by gently scraping off the cl using a sponge and subsequently soaked in 5 sodium hypochlorite followed by 1 g l citric acid for 12 h in each cleaning solution anmbrs achieved steady state conditions after about 60 d from startup based on the volatile suspended solid mlvss chemical oxygen demand cod removal and methane production profiles fqq fqq c6 was encapsulated in hydrogel beads following the methods described by xu et al 2020 four operating schemes were designed for r1 and r2 fig 1 phase 1 control both r1 and r2 were operated without beads phase 2 r1 remained as control while r2 was filled with empty beads without qq consortium phase 3 r1 contained empty beads while r2 was replaced by qq beads phase 4 r1 contained empty beads r2 was replaced with empty beads phase 4 was designed to examine whether there was qq effect in r2 after replacing qq beads with empty beads the volume of empty beads or qq beads for each anmbr was 50 ml and the dosage i e mass of fqq per volume of mixed liquor of the fqq in r2 in phase 3 was 12 5 mg l 2 2 preparation of samples the influent collected once a week ml i e biomass from anaerobic tank collected twice a week and permeate collected once a week were collected from r1 and r2 for preparation and analyses the volume of each sample was 35 ml biogas were collected once a week to calculate methane production a modified method based on previous studies dong et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 to extract size fractionated components in ml supernatant was conducted briefly ml was centrifuged at 9000 x g for 10 min to collect the supernatant then it was fractionated into six parts 0 1 μm 0 1 0 45 μm 0 45 1 μm 1 3 μm 3 5 μm and 5 μm by collecting the filtrates after passing through a series of membranes 5 μm 3 μm 1 μm 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester and 0 1 μm cellulose nitrate the filtrate with size less than 0 45 μm was regarded as smp huang et al 2011 this comprised low size smp 0 1 μm and high size smp 0 1 0 45 μm the other four fractions larger than 0 45 μm were described as colloidal particles eps in ml was then collected using sludge pellet by the heating method as described in an earlier study huang et al 2011 the cl of r1 and r2 were gently obtained by clean sponges during the membrane cleaning when the tmp exceeded 30 kpa and at day 118 when both reactors had been operated with a similar membrane cycle period i e 8 d the eps of cl was extracted by the heating method for further physical chemical analysis the pore blocking foulants were obtained by backwashing the membrane with 1 5 l of milli q water chen et

characterized according to the method described by niu et al 2013 proteins and carbohydrates of the colloidal particles smp and eps were quantified by the lowry s method and dubois method huang et al 2011 respectively liquid chromatography organic carbon detector dr huber doc lab germany was employed to characterize the dissolved organic matters doms cation and anion were quantified using an ion

pore size distribution of the ceramic membrane was characterized by a capillary flow porometer porometer 3g quantachrome instruments usa mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods for water and wastewater analysis apha 2005 cod was measured by the apha 5220d closed reflux colorimetric method biogas composition was measured using a gc bid gc17a shimadzu japan resistance in series model was used to evaluate cake layer resistance and pore blocking resistance for both anmbrs chen et al 2016 two sample t test were conducted to investigate the statistical changes on physico chemical parameters between the two anmbrs 2 4 quantification of ahls in influent mixed liquor supernatant and permeate qs of anmbrs with and without fqq was determined by analyzing ahls content in the influent ml supernatant and permeate the influent and ml except permeate were centrifuged at 9000 x g for 10 min to obtain their supernatants c7 hsl is a well recognized internal standard which is rarely produced by bacteria kumari et al 2008 therefore ahls were then extracted via solid phase extraction spe with the internal standard c7 hsl spiked into all samples to determine the recovery rate of spe ahls were finally analyzed using an agilent 1290 infinity lc coupled agilent 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer lc ms ms the detailed spe and ahls

hsl was prepared all 10 ahls standards were obtained from sigma aldrich an amount of 40 ml ahl mixture was then mixed with 5 ml of newly prepared qq beads nqqb with an overall dosage of 167 5 mg l in a serum bottle the same ahl mixture with 5 ml of newly prepared empty beads neb and no hydrogel beads were prepared in parallel as control and blank respectively the above mixed solutions were purged by nitrogen gas to achieve anaerobic condition after 120 min the liquid samples were diluted and the ahl content was measured by lc ms ms to evaluate the performance stability of fqq the same amount 5 ml of old empty beads oeb and old qq beads oqqb were extracted from r1 and r2 respectively on day 87 the beads were washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs by 3 times before the ahls degradation test the same amount 5 ml of neb and nqqb were dosed into r1 and r2 respectively to replace the removed beads and maintain the effective volume in each anmbr 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal and methane production cod removal which dictated the system performance was measured to determine if there was any sacrificed contaminants removal by qq since the key bacterial metabolic processes have been reported to be mediated by qs lv et al 2018 the overall influent cod was at an average of 400 123 mg l fig 2 a except that during phase 4 a higher average influent cod 695 mg l was encountered this was due to the fluctuation of primary effluent characteristics of the local full scale wastewater treatment plant which was used as influent to r1 and r2 of this study statistically evaluation showed that the total cod removal p 0 187 and the biological cod removal p 0 34 were similar for both r1 and r2 during 4 phases fig 2a in phase 3 the biological cod removal were 77 4 and 80 3 while total cod removal efficiency were 89 0 4 1 and 91 3 4 2 in r1 and r2 respectively fig 2a and table 1 the physical rejection of membrane contributed to higher total cod removal compared with biological cod removal alone huang et al 2011 other treatment performance parameters are summarized in table 1 anmbrs typically lacked biological capacity for nutrient removals but the r1 and r2 had removal of ammonium with 22 31 and 27 02 respectively which might be due to the precipitation and rejection by the membranes as an inorganic foulant struvite choo and lee 1996 nearly 80 of sulfate removals were achieved by both reactors which might result from its reduction via the metabolic process of sulfur reducing bacteria and its removal as inorganic foulants on membrane surface overall these findings inferred that qq also did not affect the biomass concentration p 0 27 ammonium p 0 84 and sulfate removals p 0 65 methane yield was demonstrated to improve by exogenous ahls via regulating the microbial community structure in anaerobic sludge lv et al 2018 this suggests that qq would result in substantial reductions in methane production on the contrary another study observed a higher methane production in a qqanmbr compared with the control liu et al 2019 however the qqanmbr in liu s study was only operated for a relatively short period of 45 d long term methanation operation is essential to provide a more accurate treatment performance assessment of qqanmbrs for dww treatment fig 2b illustrated the methane yield profiles of the 4 phases in r1 and r2 of this study comparable specific methane yields between r1 and r2 within each phase was observed in phase 3 r1 and r2 had similar methane contents in the biogas which were at 63 6 7 0 and 65 7 7 2 table 1 respectively additionally the specific methane yields were 0 064 0 02 and 0 070 0 03 l gcodremoved in r1 and r2 respectively fig 2b and table 1 these were within the range of 0 062 0 27 l gcodremoved for anmbrs treating dww as summarized in a previous study ozgun et al 2013 in comparison with r1 without qq the fqq in r2 showed insignificant impact p 0 28 on methane yield during the long term operation of more than 100 d i e phase 3 comparable cod removal and methane production suggested that fqq could be applied in a qqanmbr treating dww without adversely affecting treatment performance 3 2 effect of qq on membrane filtration behavior this study was divided into 4 phases to assess the change in membrane fouling propensity by monitoring the tmp of r1 and r2 fig 3 during the phase 1 when both anmbrs were operated as controls without addition of beads it took about 7 d for the anmbrs to reach a tmp of 30 kpa in phase 2 the empty beads added in r2 slightly extended the operation period from 7 to 9d this fouling control effect could be due to the scouring effect of beads on the membrane surface the usage of qq beads instead of empty beads in phase 3 extended the r2 membrane operation period by only 37 in the first cycle day 17 30 compared to that of r1 fig 3 the fqq might experience a lag phase as it was just introduced to r2 it highlighted that priming of microbial consortiums is important to achieve efficient functional performance herrero and stuckey 2015 subsequently the membrane operation periods in r2 from 10 3 to 17 8 d was largely extended by 39 135 compared with those of r1 from 6 5 to 10 9 d p 0 005 based on the average period of filtration cycles qq was able to extend membrane filtration operating time by 75 the prolonged operating period in r2 demonstrated that qq bioaugmentation was evident in mitigating membrane fouling this mitigation strategy could contribute to energy saving and thereby could lower the operating cost of anmbrs similar membrane operation period was observed in r2 4 0 1 1d compared with r1 3 7 0 6d following the replacement of qq beads with empty beads in phase 4 fig 3 the result suggested that once qq bacteria was removed the fouling control effect would diminish immediately both r1 and r2 in phase 4 experienced higher fouling rates compared with r1 in phase 3 it could be attributed to the high protein content of smp and eps in both reactors fig 4 a as induced by higher cod concentration of influent in phase 4 fig 2a huang et al 2011 jiang et al 2013 3 3 effect of qq on smp and eps production as shown in fig 4a and b the organic content i e proteins and carbohydrates in the smp of r2 during phase 3 were only about 6 6 lesser than those of r1 the difference was determined to be statistically insignificant p 0 57 for proteins p 0 91 for carbohydrates there is no clear mechanism to date that qq could have a negative impact on smp production since eps release aquino and stuckey 2004 substrate metabolism biomass decay and feed strength barker and stuckey 1999 could all contribute to smps in anaerobic systems especially biomass in reactors could yield smp as exocellular enzymes to scavenge nutrients and substrates for the process of metabolism therefore it was speculated that qq in this study did not have a direct influence on the smp concentration thus the contribution of organic content of smp towards reducing membrane fouling in r2 during phase 3 was negligible concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates were also monitored in the eps fig 4a and b concentration of proteins were higher than carbohydrates in the eps for both r1 and r2 during all 4 phases as proteins rather than carbohydrates in eps were suggested to be associated with the enhanced attachment of microbial flocs on membrane surface jiang et al 2013 lee et al 2001 it possibly signified relatively higher role of proteins of eps in membrane fouling in both phase 1 and phase 2 similar eps contents were detected for both r1 and r2 this suggested that the eps production in the anmbrs was not significantly affected by empty beads following the addition of fqq in phase 3 both concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates between r1 and r2 were statistically different p 0 005 the protein and carbohydrate contents were 36 6 and 23 0 lower than those of r1 respectively it indicated that eps might be a key differentiator that led to the lower fouling propensity of r2 during phase 3 fig 3 eps production would increase in the presence of highly biodegradable carbon source barker and stuckey 1999 thus higher eps produced 30 79 9 38 mg vss in r1 could be correlated to the spiked in influent organics during phase 3 nevertheless it was intriguing that the eps of r2 was only elevated to a smaller extent 20 16 4 71 mg vss this clearly demonstrated the capability of qq in retarding eps formation it was believed that the lower fouling propensity of r2 could be partially attributed to the retardation of eps production higher amount of eps was reported to favor adherence of biomass onto the membrane surface to form cl charfi et al 2012 therefore qq might have improved the biomass filtration characteristics in r2 by retarding eps production and thereby could contribute to the reduced cl fouling tendency compared with r1 in phase 3 fig 3 during phase 4 when qq beads were replaced with empty beads in r2 the specific protein concentration of the eps increased to 47 60 11 54 mg vss which was similar to that of r1 47 34 14 15 mg vss the specific carbohydrate concentration of the eps of r2 was elevated to 6 17 1 99 mg vss which was even higher than that of r1 4 61 0 70 mg vss these could be due to the reduced qq effect in r2 and it again suggested qq effect was reversible and would not be maintained without qq bacteria the eps of r2 in phase 4 were even higher than those of r2 in phases 1 and 2 which might result from the increased organic strength of the influent fig 2a 3 4 characterization of the dissolved organic carbon within smp and eps the prevalence of doms has been demonstrated to contribute to membrane fouling in anmbrs yue et al 2015 doms of different molecular weight mw were quantified as dissolved organic carbon doc to evaluate the fouling alleviation mechanisms of qq doc constitutes biopolymer with mw more than 20 kda and low molecular weight compounds lmws with mw less than 1000 da which includes humics building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals chen et al 2016 lmws were the major doc in the smp for both anmbrs during all the 4 phases table s3 similar doc content in terms of biopolymer and lmws was unveiled between r1 and r2 during all the 4 phases fig 5 a the protein compositions in biopolymers between r1 and r2 was also comparable table s4 statistically there was no differences in the biopolymer content p 0 66 and the lmws p 0 71 in smp between r1 and r2 in phase 3 the result suggested that qq would not have significant impact on key organics production within smp which was in agreement with the similar concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates of r2 as compared with those of r1 in phase 3 fig 4a and b based on these findings it was likely that other mechanisms e g substrate metabolism which was involved in regulating exocellular enzymes production in smp was governing the smp concentrations in both reactors barker and stuckey 1999 in this study to further characterize the fate of doms across the membrane and trace potential sources of foulants the rejections of biopolymers and lmws by the ceramic membrane with nominal pore size of 0 1 μm were analyzed during phase 3 table 2 the membrane fouling rate was found to be positively correlated to the rejection rate of organic compounds chen et al 2016 therefore the relatively higher rejection rate of proteins than carbohydrates for both anmbrs p 0 05 inferred proteins contributed to higher fouling propensity lmws with mw less than 1000da is deemed not rejected by membrane with nominal pore size of 0 1 μm chen et al 2016 huang et al 2019 it seems to be contradictory to the fact that rejections of lmws were 24 7 and 17 6 for r1 and r2 p 0 62 respectively it might be attributed to pore blockage or cl modifying the membrane surface which could adsorb and intercept lmws chen et al 2016 the biopolymer rejection rates were 81 5 and 74 2 for r1 and r2 respectively p 0 05 and the rejection rates were significantly higher than those of lmws for both anmbrs the results indicated that the biopolymers from both anmbrs could be the main contributors to the membrane fouling while the contribution of lmws cannot be ruled out as organics could be rejected by dense biofilm on membrane surface yue et al 2015 the lower rejection rate of biopolymers of r2 than that of r1 might be attributed to lower interception by the loose biofilm on the membrane surface this might be due to the disruption effect of qq which could cause high porous biofilm to be developed kim et al 2011 the lower rejection rates could further alleviate membrane fouling in r2 during phase 3 biopolymers content and the protein composition in the biopolymers of eps were both higher than those of smp for both r1 and r2 during all the 4 phases tables s3 and s4 the doc of eps in r1 in all the 4 phases had similar values with an average of 38 09 9 81 mg l fig 5b in phases 1 and 2 the doc of eps in r2 had similar concentration with an average of 39 14 3 02 mg l however doc 22 20 5 00 mg l concentration in the eps which was mainly comprised of the biopolymers p 0 05 and lmws p 0 05 was significantly reduced in r2 of phase 3 compared with those of r1 specifically the biopolymer content was decreased by 53 by qq in r2 it is worth noting that high biopolymer content in eps was reported to lead to inferior biomass dewaterability niu et al 2013 therefore qq could improve biomass dewaterability via retardation of biopolymers of eps and thereby reduces membrane fouling the high dewaterability of biomass in r2 during phase 3 was evidenced by 45 8 lower srf and 32 1 lower cst compared with those of r1 table 1 in phase 4 after replacing qq beads with empty beads the doc content of the eps of r2 increased to 40 13 3 93 mg l which included 12 31 5 43 mg l of biopolymer and 27 82 1 50 mg l of lmws the biopolymer was similar with that of r1 13 12 0 74 mg l while the lmws was even higher than that of r1 19 29 1 71 mg l it could be inferred that the increased key organics in eps might be due to the reduced qq effect when qq beads were replaced with empty beads the biotransformation behaviors of doc in eps cl i e eps of cl smp and permeate were further investigated by three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy to aid in tracking the origins of membrane foulants fig 6 all samples were diluted to the same toc to exclude the concentration effect on spectral behaviors aryal et al 2009 all peaks afflicted to the five regions appeared in samples collected from both anmbrs they were located at ex em of 200 250 280 330 region i ex em of 250 330 380 region ii ex em of 230 250 380 545 region iii ex em of 250 280 230 380 region iv and ex em of 280 520 380 545 region v which presented the aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii fulvic acid like materials microbial by products and humic acid like organic compounds chen et al 2003 respectively the eem profiles of eps and cl collected from fouled membrane after it reached tmp of 30 kpa for both r1 and r2 were unexpectedly similar in other words organic compounds in the eps correlated to those in the cl due to their comparable chemical compositions this suggested the predilection of eps contributing to foulants on the membrane surface generally eps of the cl could directly result from both the eps of mixed liquor and the internal eps secretion of microorganisms within the cl therefore the bio community within the cl is needed for further investigation of the formation of cl in anmbrs for eps in r2 there was less intensity for region v and more intensity for region i ii and iv compared to those of r1 this finding showed the significant difference in the eps compositions between r1 and r2 it is worth noting that humic acid like organic compounds region v in eps could have a high membrane fouling potential jiang et al 2013 and therefore the low intensity of region v i e low amount of humic like organic compounds could contribute to the lower fouling rate in r2 fig 3 as there was lower toc of eps in r2 than that of r1 12 26 3 25 mg vss for r1 6 23 2 46 mg vss for r2 in phase 3 it was believed that qq not only reduced microbial metabolites in eps but altered its organic fingerprint which might lead to changes in the chemical compositions of cl there was increased intensity of region i iii and v and less intensity of region ii in the permeate compared with those of smp for both anmbrs it might be due to the hydrolysis of organics by microorganisms within biofilm and rejection of organics by the membrane low et al 2016 no significant difference for both smp and permeate between r1 and r2 was observed which indicated that qq did not have a significant impact on organic composition of smp and permeate 3 5 fouling resistance profiles fouling resistance profiles were characterized for both anmbrs after the same membrane cycle operation period 8 d and at the end of the filtration cycles i e with the same tmp of 30 kpa in phase 3 table 3 analysis of these samples could provide the fouling resistance assessment between long and short term effects of qq the percentages of cl resistance between r1 68 7 and r2 65 4 were determined to be similar at the end of the filtration cycles however 78 5 lower cl resistance of r2 2 7 1011 m 1 compared to that of r1 12 6 1011 m 1 was observed after both r1 and r2 were operated over the same filtration period i e 8 d on the day 118 when tmp of r1 and r2 were 30 3 kpa and 7 6 kpa respectively cls from both anmbrs after the same filtration period i e 8 d were extracted the concentrations of inorganics and key organic compounds i e proteins carbohydrates biopolymers and lmws in the eps of the cl were investigated the inorganic compounds i e ca mg fe and al found in cl of r2 were significantly lower than those of r1 fig 7 a it might be due to less adsorption or interception of inorganic compounds by the minor cl on the membrane surface ca and mg were majority of the inorganics that accumulated in the cl of both anmbrs mg could be a major composition of a common inorganic foulant i e struvite on membrane surfaces additionally bridging between inorganic compounds and biopolymer could lead to low porosity of cl thereby enhancing membrane fouling chen et al 2016 the findings suggested that fqq could be correlated to less inorganic fouling in r2 corresponding to a decreased cross linking between inorganics and organics within cl proteins were the predominant organic components found in the cls of both anmbrs fig 7b significantly lower proteins and carbohydrates in cl of r2 was observed this could be stemming from retardation of eps in the ml by qq additionally it could also result from the lower internal eps production by microorganisms within the cl in r2 due to the qq effect of fqq the total doc amount for r2 was also significantly lower compared to r1 fig 7c more importantly the biopolymers which was considered as a major membrane fouling factor chen et al 2016 was at lower concentration in r2 compared with r1 these suggested that fqq could have mitigated both inorganic fouling and organic fouling which consequently reduced the cl resistance and tmp rise of r2 during phase 3 pore blocking resistance in r2 2 92 1011 m 1 after same operation period was slightly higher than that of r1 2 36 1011 m 1 subsequently it continued to increase to 3 03 1011 m 1 at the end of the filtration cycle therefore the doc profiles of pore blocking foulants at the end of filtration cycles for both anmbrs were analyzed table s5 lmws which could penetrate into membrane pores easily due to its low molecular weight contributed to majority of the compositions in the pore blocking foulants for both anmbrs overall the doc profile was roughly similar between r1 and r2 these findings suggested that concentrations of doms in pore blocking foulants could not predict pore blocking resistance in this study since sizes of foulants and membrane pores are two main factors affecting pore blockage wu et al 2011 it is necessary to determine the osd of smp which could have comparable size range to the membrane pore to investigate the pore blocking mechanism the findings are further discussed in section 3 6 3 noticeably cl resistance of r2 was found to increase with operation time table 3 while pore blocking resistance was observed to be weakly related to operation time in r2 i e the pore blocking resistance values were comparable after 8 d and 13 d of membrane operation thus it showed that the fouling mechanism of the qqanmbr involved initial fouling by pore blocking followed by development of cake layer that eventually caused severe membrane fouling in r2 3 6 size fractioned particles and organics associated fouling mechanism particles of different sizes in ml could contribute to fouling with diverse mechanisms in anmbrs biomass floc size could have significantly affected cl resistance meng et al 2006 and colloids was considered to drive initial cl formation zhou et al 2019 additionally pore blockage could be mainly attributed to the particles or organics with size similar to membrane pores e g smp wu et al 2011 therefore the evaluation of size fractioned compounds in relation to membrane resistances profiles was used to scrutinize the fouling mechanisms of anmbrs with and without qq 3 6 1 particle size distribution of mixed liquor qq could reduce the size of biomass flocs jiang et al 2013 and thereby accelerate the formation of small particles that would cause high cl resistance meng et al 2006 psd of biomass collected from each anmbr was measured based on five biological replicates in phase 3 fig 8 a the psd results were comparable in all measurements for each anmbr the d 0 5 values i e volume median diameter of anaerobic biomass were 39 28 3 68 μm and 39 77 8 07 μm for r1 and r2 respectively p 0 91 therefore the results showed that the psd of anaerobic biofloc in r1 and r2 were not significantly different this was in disagreement with the previous statement that qq could be associated to generate small flocs via inducing deflocculation of biomass jiang et al 2013 additionally qq has been demonstrated to interfere cell aggregation via disruption of ahls based cell to cell communication salehiziri et al 2018 however it was worth noting that other qs signals including autoinducter 2 ai 2 and diffusible signal factor dsf also played important roles in cell aggregation of anaerobic biomass feng et al 2014 therefore the floc size of biomass could be mainly governed by other qs signals in this study which thus lead to the inconsistent results the relationship between other qs signals and floc size of anaerobic biomass should be investigated in the future overall this showed that qq would not be correlated to change the anaerobic biofloc of r2 in phase 3 which thus would not accelerate fouling resistance in this study 3 6 2 colloidal particles the colloidal particles in supernatant in anmbrs were reported to have typical size range of 0 45 10 μm fig s1 zhou et al 2019 additionally colloidal particles harbored considerable metabolic products and would inevitably exacerbate membrane fouling in anmbrs zhou et al 2019 therefore the organic content of colloids which were at higher concentration than smp fig 4a b and 8b should be well analyzed the colloids in r1 and r2 mainly comprised organic particles with size larger than 5 μm fig 8b the organic compounds i e proteins and carbohydrates within the colloidal particles were lower in r2 compared with those in r1 with a reduction of 54 10 34 76 51 75 and 31 13 for colloids having size range of 0 45 1 μm 1 3 μm 3 5 μm and 5 μm respectively the colloidal particles 0 45 10 μm were demonstrated to have higher cl resistance than that of smp 0 45 μm zhou et al 2019 further all colloids had higher size than the nominal pore size of the ceramic membrane i e 0 1 μm therefore the significant reduction of colloids in r2 could contributed to the lower cl resistance compared with that of r1 after a similar operation period i e 8 d table 3 eem spectra of size fractionated components in supernatants was carried out in this study fig s2 as the overall organic profiles of smp for both anmbrs were identical fig 6 the differences of dominant organics within supernatants filtered by 1 μm 3 μm and 5 μm membranes between r1 and r2 were attributed to the different compounds in particles larger than 0 45 μm aromatic protein ii was obviously lower in the supernatants of r2 filtered by the 5 μm and 3 μm membrane compared to those of r1 therefore this suggeted that qq could mainly retard aromatic protein ii formation within the colloids coexistence of multiply biofilm forming microbial species within colloids was verified by fluorescence staining in anmbrs zhou et al 2019 therefore it could be inferred that the lower organic concentration and the altered organic compositions of colloids could be mainly attributed to the disruption of qs activity of these bacteria further studies would be needed to interrupt the effect of qq on the bio community changes within the colloids 3 6 3 organic size distribution of smp pore blocking resistance contributed to 32 5 in r2 after 8 d table 3 and the absolute value 2 92 1011 m 1 was slightly higher than that of r1 2 36 1011 m 1 however the organic contents proteins and carbohydrates within high size smp and low size smp were similar between r1 and r2 during phase 3 as revealed by fig 8b therefore the organic concentrations of smp alone would not be sufficient to help predict the occurrence of pore blockage much efforts have been conducted to characterize molecular weight distribution of smp to predict pore blocking in anmrbs yue et al 2015 2018 however the osd of smp was also of significance to be analyzed since their size ranges are similar to the membrane nominal pore size i e 0 1 μm two peaks centered at around 51 nm and 230 nm were observed in the osd analysis of smp in r2 while the majority of organic size of smp in r1 was only around 230 nm fig 8c this observation inferred that qq could contribute towards the change in osd of smp membrane pore size distribution of virgin ceramic membrane based on differential flow and differential area was also evaluated figs s3 and 8d to provide important clues to interpret the organics interception behavior by the membrane the membranes used in this study had dominant pore sizes of around 46 6 nm 54 9 nm and 100 3 nm as membrane pore was likely to be clogged by organics of similar or slightly larger sizes the organics with dominant size around 230 nm of smp in r1 was more prone to cause the 100 3 nm pore blockage nevertheless in addition to the 100 3 nm pore blockage causing by 230 nm organics in smp of r2 51 nm organics could also contribute to blockage of 46 6 nm and 54 9 nm pores it provided the reason why the overall pore blocking was relatively higher in r2 compared to that in r1 after the same period of operation 3 7 ahls degradability of fqq and ahls profile shift as gram negative bacteria that employed ahls as qs signals was dominant in both ml and cl in r1 as unveiled by fig s4 it suggested that ahls based qs could play a vital role in regulating membrane fouling in anmbrs therefore it was necessary to analyze the ahls degradability of qq beads to evaluate its qq performance during the ahls degradability tests residual ahls in the blank without beads after 120 min were 87 5 90 6 91 6 97 7 92 8 87 6 92 3 98 0 64 4 and 83 3 for c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl respectively fig 9 a in view of the lower ahls of the empty beads both neb and oeb as compared with the blanks the differences were attributed to the physical adsorption of ahls by the beads additionally the differences in residual ahls found in the qq beads nqqb or oqqb and their corresponding empty beads neb or oeb were defined as the biodegradation efficiencies of qq beads the biodegradation efficiencies of the nqqb for c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl were 23 4 18 9 20 1 16 1 20 1 16 9 20 1 13 9 20 4 and 21 6 respectively fig 9b thus the results demonstrated the ability of nqqb i e fqq to biodegrade a wide range of ahls the ahls profile was further unraveled for both the anmbrs to endeavor an exhaustive insight of qq performance of fqq the 10 ahls in the influents supernatants of ml and permeates were characterized table 4 short chain ahls including c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl were found to be the dominant ahls in the supernatants of both the anmbrs concretely exogenous addition of c4 hsl and c6 hsl was found to be related to the increased protein concentrations of eps in anaerobic sludge lv et al 2018 therefore the dominant ahls was strongly associated with eps production and thus might negatively affect membrane filtration performance it could be deduced that the influent could be of significance because the concentrations of c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl in the influent accounted for 180 53 54 45 73 and 106 of those in the supernatant of r1 respectively the lower concentrations of c4 hsl and 3 oxoc14 hsl in the supernatant of r1 than those of the influent could be attributed to the internal qq activity of sludge lv et al 2018 waheed et al 2020 while the higher concentrations of 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl and c12 hsl in the supernatant of r1 than those of the influent could be the results of qs activity of sludge this phenomenon suggested the battle phenomenon between qs and qq activities of microorganisms regulating ahls concentration in the anmbr however with the external qq effect i e dosing fqq into r2 it was apparent that c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl i e the dominant ahls were suppressed in phase 3 with reduction of 19 7 100 and 54 4 respectively compared to that of r1 this suggested that the fqq could degrade dominant ahls in r2 obviously the reduced dominant ahls suggested the lower qs activity which could thus be associated to the lower membrane fouling in r2 during phase 3 as the detected concentration of ahls in the permeates were lower than those in supernatants for both anmbrs and the ahls were smaller than the nominal pore size of the membrane i e 0 1 μm ahls could either be rejected by the cl or plug the membrane pores high stability of qq performance of the fqq is critical to foster widespread application of qqanmbr therefore the biodegradation behaviors of ahls by the oqqb also were investigated fig 9b interestingly after 5 membrane service periods of r2 during phase 3 70 d the biodegradability of the oqqb for 3 oxo c8 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl were enhanced with efficiencies of 29 5 20 8 23 5 51 0 28 8 and 23 7 respectively while the biodegradation efficiencies for c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl and c10 hsl were reduced with degradation efficiency of 7 5 18 5 17 5 and 18 3 respectively compared with those of the nqqb fig 9b the differences in biodegradability between the nqqb and oqqb might be due to the shift of qq microbial communities inside the qq beads the declining qq performance could be due to qq microorganisms out competed by local bio communities liu et al 2019 it was also in agreement with another previous study which observed that only 2 out of 5 qq strain could be found in oqqb waheed et al 2020 however the increased qq capacity for other ahls after the long term operation might be contributed by adaption of qq bacteria to the new environment cheong et al 2014 therefore more validations regarding the evolution of the qq community would be needed overall there was only significant biodegradability loss for c4 hsl 68 2 of oqqb as compared with nqqb while the biodegradability of oqqb with regard to other 9 ahls was well maintained in the harsh environment of real wastewater after 70 d fig 9b this suggested that the fqq could be an efficient and sustainable technology for membrane fouling management 4 conclusion this study revealed the effect of qq on key organics in eps and size fractioned particles and organics in anmbrs for the first time it demonstrated that fqq is an ideal qq inoculum to exemplify the potential for sustainable membrane fouling circumvention in anmbrs without sacrificing treatment performance this study showed that fqq significantly extended the membrane operating period of the qqanmbr treating dww mitigated c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl by fqq directly proved the qq effect qq was shown to reduce biopolymers yield in eps thus improved biomass dewaterability concomitantly qq affected the key organic compositions of eps and cake layer qq caused a shift of dominant membrane foulants from cl to pore blockage after a similar period of operation i e 8d compared with the control reduced cl in the qqanmbr was attributed to not only the suppressed eps production but lower organic content of colloids the small size organics 51 nm within the smp in the presence of qq led to the slightly increased occurrence of pore

17878,quorum quenching qq has been applied as a promising membrane fouling control strategy for anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs nevertheless long term operation of anmbrs for real domestic wastewater dww treatment needs to be systematically studied to evaluate comprehensive membrane fouling mechanisms and bioprocess performance in this study the impact of qq on membrane fouling was investigated using a quorum quenching anmbr qqanmbr deploying a bead entrapped facultative quorum quenching consortium fqq to treat dww fqq was shown to prolong membrane filtration operation by an average of 75 reduced proteins p 0 005 and carbohydrates p 0 005 in the extracellular polymeric substances eps of mixed liquor ml were key differentiators that led to lower cake layer cl formation additionally reduced biopolymers production p 0 05 in eps improved sludge dewaterability the findings suggested that qq could alter fluorescent microbial metabolites of both eps and cl as unveiled by excitation emission matrix spectra pattern furthermore colloidal particles i e particles with size larger than 0 45 μm in ml supernatants production was retarded by qq thereafter also contributed to the reduced cl formation pore blockage was slightly increased by qq which might be attributed to pore blockage by large 230 nm and small organic compounds 51 nm in soluble microbial products smp however qq had no significant impact on organic concentration of smp and qq was not associated with particle size distribution of biomass qq performance was further affirmed through suppressed production of c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl the overall ahls degradability of fqq was well maintained even after five membrane service cycles total operation of 70 d moreover qq had no compromised impact on treatment performance i e chemical oxygen demand cod removal and methane yield collectively this study bridged the knowledge gap to bring forward qq technology in anmbr for widespread domestic wastewater treatment application graphical abstract image 1 keywords anmbrs colloidal particles eps smp fouling quorum quenching 1 introduction numerous studies have explored various innovative technologies to convert current schemes of domestic wastewater dww treatment to energy positive processes mccarty et al 2011 notably anaerobic processes are novel alternatives these processes offer significant operational cost savings because there are no requirement for aeration low sludge production for handling and disposal and high acquisition of methane by directly capturing organics from wastewater rather than through sludge digestion of excess sludge produced from conventional aerobic activated sludge systems mccarty et al 2011 however conventional anaerobic process is often plagued with washout of slow growing anaerobic microorganisms huang et al 2011 anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs which integrate membranes into anaerobic reactors for solids and liquid separation could enable operation of long solid retention time srt and short hydraulic retention time hrt ng et al 2020 this surmounts the drawback of conventional anaerobic processes which in turn aid in producing effluent with lower organic contaminants and free from suspended solids ss nevertheless severe membrane fouling i e the undesirable formation of a cohesive biofilm on membranes is a long standing predominant bottleneck for anmbrs which leads to a high life cycle cost especially low critical flux of anmbrs which is commonly less than 20 l m 2 h 1 lmh fox and stuckey 2015 yue et al 2015 hindered their commercial scalability although extensive physical and chemical fouling mitigation approaches have been implemented to counteract this chronic deficiency fox and stuckey 2015 yue et al 2018 the methods were not able to directly prevent biofilm formation on the membrane surfaces thus an efficient fouling control regime to retrofit anmbrs for dww treatment is critically needed quorum sensing qs which is a cell to cell communication among bacterial community promoted by n acyl homoserine lactones ahls as a typical qs signal is deemed important to anaerobic treatment process lv et al 2018 huang et al 2020 as bacterial qs could induce biofilm development kim et al 2013 the ability to manipulate qs created new possibilities for membrane fouling control a forefront biological paradigm termed quorum quenching qq based on qs disruption by using a facultative quorum quenching bacterium microbacterium sp was shown to mitigate membrane fouling in a lab scale anmbr qqanmbr treating synthetic wastewater liu et al 2019 however qq bacterium bioactivity on ahls degradation in the qqanmbr was found to reduce after operating for about 45 d this could be due to predation or competition with indigenous bacteria thus to revitalize competitiveness of qqanmbrs a facultative quorum quenching consortium named fqq c6 fqq isolated by xu et al 2020 which would possess a wider range of ahls degradability and high survivability was employed in this study to mitigate membrane fouling in anmbrs treating dww qq would inhibit the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps as it is directly facilitated by qs kim et al 2013 however little is known on the effect of qq on key organic matters in eps of mixed liquor ml especially biopolymers which could cause poor biomass dewaterability niu et al 2013 furthermore clear mechanism of qq limiting soluble microbial products smp formation is still not well understood although there was mounting evidence that qq could reduce membrane fouling by retarding the production of smp and eps findings are still relatively inconsistent kampouris et al 2018 weerasekara et al 2014 yu et al 2019 a prior study observed that qq could only decrease eps rather than smp yu et al 2019 further qq was even reported to have no adverse impact on smp nor eps formation weerasekara et al 2014 smp was found to cause pore blockage while eps in ml could help biomass adhere to membrane surface and provide the architecture needed for biofilm formation kampouris et al 2018 these findings reflected the different fouling mechanisms between smp and eps therefore the influence of qq on smp and eps formation in anmbrs would need to be further elucidated the existing knowledge of qq in altering fouling mechanism with regarded to size fractioned particles is obscured the effect of qq in retarding eps formation could accelerate deflocculation of biomass flocs jiang et al 2013 this subsequently could lead to severe membrane fouling due to the deposition of small particles onto membrane surface meng et al 2006 nevertheless one study showed there was no correlation between qq and changes in particle size distribution psd of biomass weerasekara et al 2014 therefore further evaluation on psd of biomass in qqanmbrs is needed to verify these findings in addition currently fundamental membrane fouling research effort has mainly focused on the smp i e filtrates of ml supernatants filtered by 0 45 μm membranes of anmbrs huang et al 2011 yue et al 2015 overlooking the contribution of colloidal particles i e particles with size larger than 0 45 μm in ml supernatants dong et al 2015 which was suggested to be a main factor driving initial biofilm formation in anmbrs zhou et al 2019 as qs would be promoted by abundant free bacterial cells harbored within colloids zhou et al 2019 considerable proteins and carbohydrates could be generated to cause serious membrane fouling the information regarding the influence of qq on colloidal particles was a black box with poor understanding therefore investigation of colloidal particles in qqanmbrs could expand our knowledge of the mechanism of qq governing the associated elusive fouling mitigation moreover membrane pore blockage has been demonstrated increase by qq waheed et al 2017 theoretically pore blockage is achieved by particles of similar size to the membrane pores of anmbrs e g commonly nominal pore size of 0 08 0 45 μm huang et al 2011 wu et al 2011 yue et al 2018 therefore it was also imperative to investigate organic size distribution osd of smp which has comparable range to the membrane pore size to further probe the pore blocking mechanism in qqanmbrs to address the aforementioned knowledge gaps a comprehensive assessment of the qqanmbr for dww treatment was conducted in this study the effect of fqq on membrane fouling control was evaluated by monitoring changes in trans membrane pressures tmps and crucial organics of eps smp and cake layer cl in anmbrs size fractioned particles and organics coupled with membrane resistance profiles were investigated to offer an in depth understanding of qq associated fouling mechanism this study would generate fundamental knowledge and provide mechanistic insights involved in the underlying fouling control mechanism of qqanmbrs for holistic treatment of dww 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbrs setup and operation fig 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of two lab scale anmbrs r1 and r2 used in this study both anmbrs were seeded with sludge obtained from an anaerobic digester of a local domestic wastewater treatment plant and operated in parallel at room temperature 30 3 c each anmbr comprised a 6 l anaerobic tank coupled to a 1 17 l submerged membrane tank the latter employed a flat sheet ceramic membrane module with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and a total surface area of 0 045 m2 meiden japan both anmbrs were operated with a srt and a hrt of 30 d and 17 h respectively gas pumps knf n86 kt 18 germany were employed to provide souring effect in the membrane tanks at a gas sparing rate of 0 7 l min to avoid mechanical decomposition of beads when passing through the recirculation pump a 3 mm mesh was installed at the outlet point of the membrane tank ph was adjusted to be above 7 by ph controllers etatron d s s p a italy the ph in both r1 and r2 were noted to be stable with average values of 7 84 0 11 and 7 80 0 21 respectively throughout the experiment dww table s1 used in this study was collected from a local domestic wastewater treatment plant the wastewater was passed through a 1 mm mesh sieve to remove large particulate matters before continuously fed into the anmbrs other anmbr parameters are summarized in table s2 fouled membrane was taken offline for cleaning when the trans membrane pressure tmp exceeded 30 kpa meanwhile operation continued by replacing with a new piece of membrane membrane cleaning was conducted by gently scraping off the cl using a sponge and subsequently soaked in 5 sodium hypochlorite followed by 1 g l citric acid for 12 h in each cleaning solution anmbrs achieved steady state conditions after about 60 d from startup based on the volatile suspended solid mlvss chemical oxygen demand cod removal and methane production profiles fqq fqq c6 was encapsulated in hydrogel beads following the methods described by xu et al 2020 four operating schemes were designed for r1 and r2 fig 1 phase 1 control both r1 and r2 were operated without beads phase 2 r1 remained as control while r2 was filled with empty beads without qq consortium phase 3 r1 contained empty beads while r2 was replaced by qq beads phase 4 r1 contained empty beads r2 was replaced with empty beads phase 4 was designed to examine whether there was qq effect in r2 after replacing qq beads with empty beads the volume of empty beads or qq beads for each anmbr was 50 ml and the dosage i e mass of fqq per volume of mixed liquor of the fqq in r2 in phase 3 was 12 5 mg l 2 2 preparation of samples the influent collected once a week ml i e biomass from anaerobic tank collected twice a week and permeate collected once a week were collected from r1 and r2 for preparation and analyses the volume of each sample was 35 ml biogas were collected once a week to calculate methane production a modified method based on previous studies dong et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 to extract size fractionated components in ml supernatant was conducted briefly ml was centrifuged at 9000 x g for 10 min to collect the supernatant then it was fractionated into six parts 0 1 μm 0 1 0 45 μm 0 45 1 μm 1 3 μm 3 5 μm and 5 μm by collecting the filtrates after passing through a series of membranes 5 μm 3 μm 1 μm 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester and 0 1 μm cellulose nitrate the filtrate with size less than 0 45 μm was regarded as smp huang et al 2011 this comprised low size smp 0 1 μm and high size smp 0 1 0 45 μm the other four fractions larger than 0 45 μm were described as colloidal particles eps in ml was then collected using sludge pellet by the heating method as described in an earlier study huang et al 2011 the cl of r1 and r2 were gently obtained by clean sponges during the membrane cleaning when the tmp exceeded 30 kpa and at day 118 when both reactors had been operated with a similar membrane cycle period i e 8 d the eps of cl was extracted by the heating method for further physical chemical analysis the pore blocking foulants were obtained by backwashing the membrane with 1 5 l of milli q water chen et al 2016 2 3 physico chemical analyses capillary suction time cst of biomass was measured by a cst equipment model 304m triton electronics ltd uk sludge specific resistance to filtration srf was characterized according to the method described by niu et al 2013 proteins and carbohydrates of the colloidal particles smp and eps were quantified by the lowry s method and dubois method huang et al 2011 respectively liquid chromatography organic carbon detector dr huber doc lab germany was employed to characterize the dissolved organic matters doms cation and anion were quantified using an ion chromatography lc20 chromatography enclosure usa an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy 5110 icp oes agilent usa was employed for measurement of inorganic elements total organic carbon toc was measured by a toc analyzer tocvcsh shimadzu japan a fluorescence spectrophotometer varian gary eclipse agilent was used for measuring the excitation emission matrix eem of the doms yue et al 2015 psd of biomass in both anmbrs was analyzed using a laser diffraction particle analyzer ls 13 320 coulter beckman coulter usa osd of smp was evaluated by a zetasizer zetasizer pro malvern uk pore size distribution of the ceramic membrane was characterized by a capillary flow porometer porometer 3g quantachrome instruments usa mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods for water and wastewater analysis apha 2005 cod was measured by the apha 5220d closed reflux colorimetric method biogas composition was measured using a gc bid gc17a shimadzu japan resistance in series model was used to evaluate cake layer resistance and pore blocking resistance for both anmbrs chen et al 2016 two sample t test were conducted to investigate the statistical changes on physico chemical parameters between the two anmbrs 2 4 quantification of ahls in influent mixed liquor supernatant and permeate qs of anmbrs with and without fqq was determined by analyzing ahls content in the influent ml supernatant and permeate the influent and ml except permeate were centrifuged at 9000 x g for 10 min to obtain their supernatants c7 hsl is a well recognized internal standard which is rarely produced by bacteria kumari et al 2008 therefore ahls were then extracted via solid phase extraction spe with the internal standard c7 hsl spiked into all samples to determine the recovery rate of spe ahls were finally analyzed using an agilent 1290 infinity lc coupled agilent 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer lc ms ms the detailed spe and ahls quantification procedures are provided in the supporting information 2 5 evaluation of qq capacity an ahl mixture containing 1 mg l each of n butyryl dl homoserine lactone c4 hsl n hexanoyl dl

hsl was prepared all 10 ahls standards were obtained from sigma aldrich an amount of 40 ml ahl mixture was then mixed with 5 ml of newly prepared qq beads nqqb with an overall dosage of 167 5 mg l in a serum bottle the same ahl mixture with 5 ml of newly prepared empty beads neb and no hydrogel beads were prepared in parallel as control and blank respectively the above mixed solutions were purged by nitrogen gas to achieve anaerobic condition after 120 min the liquid samples were diluted and the ahl content was measured by lc ms ms to evaluate the performance stability of fqq the same amount 5 ml of old empty beads oeb and old qq beads oqqb were extracted from r1 and r2 respectively on day 87 the beads were washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs by 3 times before the ahls degradation test the same amount 5 ml of neb and nqqb were dosed into r1 and r2 respectively to replace the removed beads and maintain the effective volume in each anmbr 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal and methane production cod removal which dictated the system performance was measured to determine if there was any sacrificed contaminants removal by qq since the key bacterial metabolic processes have been reported to be mediated by qs lv et al 2018 the overall influent cod was at an average of 400 123 mg l fig 2 a except that during phase 4 a higher average influent cod 695 mg l was encountered this was due to the fluctuation of primary effluent characteristics of the local full scale wastewater treatment plant which was used as influent to r1 and r2 of this study statistically evaluation showed that the total cod removal p 0 187 and the biological cod removal p 0 34 were similar for both r1 and r2 during 4 phases fig 2a in phase 3 the biological cod removal were 77 4 and 80 3 while total cod removal efficiency were 89 0 4 1 and 91 3 4 2 in r1 and r2 respectively fig 2a and table 1 the physical rejection of membrane contributed to higher total cod removal compared with biological cod removal alone huang et al 2011 other treatment performance parameters are summarized in table 1 anmbrs typically lacked biological capacity for nutrient removals but the r1 and r2 had removal of ammonium with 22 31 and 27 02 respectively which might be due to the precipitation and rejection by the membranes as an inorganic foulant struvite choo and lee 1996 nearly 80 of sulfate removals were achieved by both reactors which might result from its reduction via the metabolic process of sulfur reducing bacteria and its removal as inorganic foulants on membrane surface overall these findings inferred that qq also did not affect the biomass concentration p 0 27 ammonium p 0 84 and sulfate removals p 0 65 methane yield was demonstrated to improve by exogenous ahls via regulating the microbial community structure in anaerobic sludge lv et al 2018 this suggests that qq would result in substantial reductions in methane production on the contrary another study observed a higher methane production in a qqanmbr compared with the control liu et al 2019 however the qqanmbr in liu s study was only operated for a relatively short period of 45 d long term methanation operation is essential to provide a more accurate treatment performance assessment of qqanmbrs for dww treatment fig 2b illustrated the methane yield profiles of the 4 phases in r1 and r2 of this study comparable specific methane yields between r1 and r2 within each phase was observed in phase 3 r1 and r2 had similar methane contents in the biogas which were at 63 6 7 0 and 65 7 7 2 table 1 respectively additionally the specific methane yields were 0 064 0 02 and 0 070 0 03 l gcodremoved in r1 and r2 respectively fig 2b and table 1 these were within the range of 0 062 0 27 l gcodremoved for anmbrs treating dww as summarized in a previous study ozgun et al 2013 in comparison with r1 without qq the fqq in r2 showed insignificant impact p 0 28 on methane yield during the long term operation of more than 100 d i e phase 3 comparable cod removal and methane production suggested that fqq could be applied in a qqanmbr treating dww without adversely affecting treatment performance 3 2 effect of qq on membrane filtration behavior this study was divided into 4 phases to assess the change in membrane fouling propensity by monitoring the tmp of r1 and r2 fig 3 during the phase 1 when both anmbrs were operated as controls without addition of beads it took about 7 d for the anmbrs to reach a tmp of 30 kpa in phase 2 the empty beads added in r2 slightly extended the operation period from 7 to 9d this fouling control effect could be due to the scouring effect of beads on the membrane surface the usage of qq beads instead of empty beads in phase 3 extended the r2 membrane operation period by only 37 in the first cycle day 17 30 compared to that of r1 fig 3 the fqq might experience a lag phase as it was just introduced to r2 it highlighted that priming of microbial consortiums is important to achieve efficient functional performance herrero and stuckey 2015 subsequently the membrane operation periods in r2 from 10 3 to 17 8 d was largely extended by 39 135 compared with those of r1 from 6 5 to 10 9 d p 0 005 based on the average period of filtration cycles qq was able to extend membrane filtration operating time by 75 the prolonged operating period in r2 demonstrated that qq bioaugmentation was evident in mitigating membrane fouling this mitigation strategy could contribute to energy saving and thereby could lower the operating cost of anmbrs similar membrane operation period was observed in r2 4 0 1 1d compared with r1 3 7 0 6d following the replacement of qq beads with empty beads in phase 4 fig 3 the result suggested that once qq bacteria was removed the fouling control effect would diminish immediately both r1 and r2 in phase 4 experienced higher fouling rates compared with r1 in phase 3 it could be attributed to the high protein content of smp and eps in both reactors fig 4 a as induced by higher cod concentration of influent in phase 4 fig 2a huang et al 2011 jiang et al 2013 3 3 effect of qq on smp and eps production as shown in fig 4a and b the organic content i e proteins and carbohydrates in the smp of r2 during phase 3 were only about 6 6 lesser than those of r1 the difference was determined to be statistically insignificant p 0 57 for proteins p 0 91 for carbohydrates there is no clear mechanism to date that qq could have a negative impact on smp production since eps release aquino and stuckey 2004 substrate metabolism biomass decay and feed strength barker and stuckey 1999 could all contribute to smps in anaerobic systems especially biomass in reactors could yield smp as exocellular enzymes to scavenge nutrients and substrates for the process of metabolism therefore it was speculated that qq in this study did not have a direct influence on the smp concentration thus the contribution of organic content of smp towards reducing membrane fouling in r2 during phase 3 was negligible concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates were also monitored in the eps fig 4a and b concentration of proteins were higher than carbohydrates in the eps for both r1 and r2 during all 4 phases as proteins rather than carbohydrates in eps were suggested to be associated with the enhanced attachment of microbial flocs on membrane surface jiang et al 2013 lee et al 2001 it possibly signified relatively higher role of proteins of eps in membrane fouling in both phase 1 and phase 2 similar eps contents were detected for both r1 and r2 this suggested that the eps production in the anmbrs was not significantly affected by empty beads following the addition of fqq in phase 3 both concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates between r1 and r2 were statistically different p 0 005 the protein and carbohydrate contents were 36 6 and 23 0 lower than those of r1 respectively it indicated that eps might be a key differentiator that led to the lower fouling propensity of r2 during phase 3 fig 3 eps production would increase in the presence of highly biodegradable carbon source barker and stuckey 1999 thus higher eps produced 30 79 9 38 mg vss in r1 could be correlated to the spiked in influent organics during phase 3 nevertheless it was intriguing that the eps of r2 was only elevated to a smaller extent 20 16 4 71 mg vss this clearly demonstrated the capability of qq in retarding eps formation it was believed that the lower fouling propensity of r2 could be partially attributed to the retardation of eps production higher amount of eps was reported to favor adherence of biomass onto the membrane surface to form cl charfi et al 2012 therefore qq might have improved the biomass filtration characteristics in r2 by retarding eps production and thereby could contribute to the reduced cl fouling tendency compared with r1 in phase 3 fig 3 during phase 4 when qq beads were replaced with empty beads in r2 the specific protein concentration of the eps increased to 47 60 11 54 mg vss which was similar to that of r1 47 34 14 15 mg vss the specific carbohydrate concentration of the eps of r2 was elevated to 6 17 1 99 mg vss which was even higher than that of r1 4 61 0 70 mg vss these could be due to the reduced qq effect in r2 and it again suggested qq effect was reversible and would not be maintained without qq bacteria the eps of r2 in phase 4 were even higher than those of r2 in phases 1 and 2 which might result from the increased organic strength of the influent fig 2a 3 4 characterization of the dissolved organic carbon within smp and eps the prevalence of doms has been demonstrated to contribute to membrane fouling in anmbrs yue et al 2015 doms of different molecular weight mw were quantified as dissolved organic carbon doc to evaluate the fouling alleviation mechanisms of qq doc constitutes biopolymer with mw more than 20 kda and low molecular weight compounds lmws with mw less than 1000 da which includes humics building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals chen et al 2016 lmws were the major doc in the smp for both anmbrs during all the 4 phases table s3 similar doc content in terms of biopolymer and lmws was unveiled between r1 and r2 during all the 4 phases fig 5 a the protein compositions in biopolymers between r1 and r2 was also comparable table s4 statistically there was no differences in the biopolymer content p 0 66 and the lmws p 0 71 in smp between r1 and r2 in phase 3 the result suggested that qq would not have significant impact on key organics production within smp which was in agreement with the similar concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates of r2 as compared with those of r1 in phase 3 fig 4a and b based on these findings it was likely that other mechanisms e g substrate metabolism which was involved in regulating exocellular enzymes production in smp was governing the smp concentrations in both reactors barker and stuckey 1999 in this study to further characterize the fate of doms across the membrane and trace potential sources of foulants the rejections of biopolymers and lmws by the ceramic membrane with nominal pore size of 0 1 μm were analyzed during phase 3 table 2 the membrane fouling rate was found to be positively correlated to the rejection rate of organic compounds chen et al 2016 therefore the relatively higher rejection rate of proteins than carbohydrates for both anmbrs p 0 05 inferred proteins contributed to higher fouling propensity lmws with mw less than 1000da is deemed not rejected by membrane with nominal pore size of 0 1 μm chen et al 2016 huang et al 2019 it seems to be contradictory to the fact that rejections of lmws were 24 7 and 17 6 for r1 and r2 p 0 62 respectively it might be attributed to pore blockage or cl modifying the membrane surface which could adsorb and intercept lmws chen et al 2016 the biopolymer rejection rates were 81 5 and 74 2 for r1 and r2 respectively p 0 05 and the rejection rates were significantly higher than those of lmws for both anmbrs the results indicated that the biopolymers from both anmbrs could be the main contributors to the membrane fouling while the contribution of lmws cannot be ruled out as organics could be rejected by dense biofilm on membrane surface yue et al 2015 the lower rejection rate of biopolymers of r2 than that of r1 might be attributed to lower interception by the loose biofilm on the membrane surface this might be due to the disruption effect of qq which could cause high porous biofilm to be developed kim et al 2011 the lower rejection rates could further alleviate membrane fouling in r2 during phase 3 biopolymers content and the protein composition in the biopolymers of eps were both higher than those of smp for both r1 and r2 during all the 4 phases tables s3 and s4 the doc of eps in r1 in all the 4 phases had similar values with an average of 38 09 9 81 mg l fig 5b in phases 1 and 2 the doc of eps in r2 had similar concentration with an average of 39 14 3 02 mg l however doc 22 20 5 00 mg l concentration in the eps which was mainly comprised of the biopolymers p 0 05 and lmws p 0 05 was significantly reduced in r2 of phase 3 compared with those of r1 specifically the biopolymer content was decreased by 53 by qq in r2 it is worth noting that high biopolymer content in eps was reported to lead to inferior biomass dewaterability niu et al 2013 therefore qq could improve biomass dewaterability via retardation of biopolymers of eps and thereby reduces membrane fouling the high dewaterability of biomass in r2 during phase 3 was evidenced by 45 8 lower srf and 32 1 lower cst compared with those of r1 table 1 in phase 4 after replacing qq beads with empty beads the doc content of the eps of r2 increased to 40 13 3 93 mg l which included 12 31 5 43 mg l of biopolymer and 27 82 1 50 mg l of lmws the biopolymer was similar with that of r1 13 12 0 74 mg l while the lmws was even higher than that of r1 19 29 1 71 mg l it could be inferred that the increased key organics in eps might be due to the reduced qq effect when qq beads were replaced with empty beads the biotransformation behaviors of doc in eps cl i e eps of cl smp and permeate were further investigated by three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy to aid in tracking the origins of membrane foulants fig 6 all samples were diluted to the same toc to exclude the concentration effect on spectral behaviors aryal et al 2009 all peaks afflicted to the five regions appeared in samples collected from both anmbrs they were located at ex em of 200 250 280 330 region i ex em of 250 330 380 region ii ex em of 230 250 380 545 region iii ex em of 250 280 230 380 region iv and ex em of 280 520 380 545 region v which presented the aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii fulvic acid like materials microbial by products and humic acid like organic compounds chen et al 2003 respectively the eem profiles of eps and cl collected from fouled membrane after it reached tmp of 30 kpa for both r1 and r2 were unexpectedly similar in other words organic compounds in the eps correlated to those in the cl due to their comparable chemical compositions this suggested the predilection of eps contributing to foulants on the membrane surface generally eps of the cl could directly result from both the eps of mixed liquor and the internal eps secretion of microorganisms within the cl therefore the bio community within the cl is needed for further investigation of the formation of cl in anmbrs for eps in r2 there was less intensity for region v and more intensity for region i ii and iv compared to those of r1 this finding showed the significant difference in the eps compositions between r1 and r2 it is worth noting that humic acid like organic compounds region v in eps could have a high membrane fouling potential jiang et al 2013 and therefore the low intensity of region v i e low amount of humic like organic compounds could contribute to the lower fouling rate in r2 fig 3 as there was lower toc of eps in r2 than that of r1 12 26 3 25 mg vss for r1 6 23 2 46 mg vss for r2 in phase 3 it was believed that qq not only reduced microbial metabolites in eps but altered its organic fingerprint which might lead to changes in the chemical compositions of cl there was increased intensity of region i iii and v and less intensity of region ii in the permeate compared with those of smp for both anmbrs it might be due to the hydrolysis of organics by microorganisms within biofilm and rejection of organics by the membrane low et al 2016 no significant difference for both smp and permeate between r1 and r2 was observed which indicated that qq did not have a significant impact on organic composition of smp and permeate 3 5 fouling resistance profiles fouling resistance profiles were characterized for both anmbrs after the same membrane cycle operation period 8 d and at the end of the filtration cycles i e with the same tmp of 30 kpa in phase 3 table 3 analysis of these samples could provide the fouling resistance assessment between long and short term effects of qq the percentages of cl resistance between r1 68 7 and r2 65 4 were determined to be similar at the end of the filtration cycles however 78 5 lower cl resistance of r2 2 7 1011 m 1 compared to that of r1 12 6 1011 m 1 was observed after both r1 and r2 were operated over the same filtration period i e 8 d on the day 118 when tmp of r1 and r2 were 30 3 kpa and 7 6 kpa respectively cls from both anmbrs after the same filtration period i e 8 d were extracted the concentrations of inorganics and key organic compounds i e proteins carbohydrates biopolymers and lmws in the eps of the cl were investigated the inorganic compounds i e ca mg fe and al found in cl of r2 were significantly lower than those of r1 fig 7 a it might be due to less adsorption or interception of inorganic compounds by the minor cl on the membrane surface ca and mg were majority of the inorganics that accumulated in the cl of both anmbrs mg could be a major composition of a common inorganic foulant i e struvite on membrane surfaces additionally bridging between inorganic compounds and biopolymer could lead to low porosity of cl thereby enhancing membrane fouling chen et al 2016 the findings suggested that fqq could be correlated to less inorganic fouling in r2 corresponding to a decreased cross linking between inorganics and organics within cl proteins were the predominant organic components found in the cls of both anmbrs fig 7b significantly lower proteins and carbohydrates in cl of r2 was observed this could be stemming from retardation of eps in the ml by qq additionally it could also result from the lower internal eps production by microorganisms within the cl in r2 due to the qq effect of fqq the total doc amount for r2 was also significantly lower compared to r1 fig 7c more importantly the biopolymers which was considered as a major membrane fouling factor chen et al 2016 was at lower concentration in r2 compared with r1 these suggested that fqq could have mitigated both inorganic fouling and organic fouling which consequently reduced the cl resistance and tmp rise of r2 during phase 3 pore blocking resistance in r2 2 92 1011 m 1 after same operation period was slightly higher than that of r1 2 36 1011 m 1 subsequently it continued to increase to 3 03 1011 m 1 at the end of the filtration cycle therefore the doc profiles of pore blocking foulants at the end of filtration cycles for both anmbrs were analyzed table s5 lmws which could penetrate into membrane pores easily due to its low molecular weight contributed to majority of the compositions in the pore blocking foulants for both anmbrs overall the doc profile was roughly similar between r1 and r2 these findings suggested that concentrations of doms in pore blocking foulants could not predict pore blocking resistance in this study since sizes of foulants and membrane pores are two main factors affecting pore blockage wu et al 2011 it is necessary to determine the osd of smp which could have comparable size range to the membrane pore to investigate the pore blocking mechanism the findings are further discussed in section 3 6 3 noticeably cl resistance of r2 was found to increase with operation time table 3 while pore blocking resistance was observed to be weakly related to operation time in r2 i e the pore blocking resistance values were comparable after 8 d and 13 d of membrane operation thus it showed that the fouling mechanism of the qqanmbr involved initial fouling by pore blocking followed by development of cake layer that eventually caused severe membrane fouling in r2 3 6 size fractioned particles and organics associated fouling mechanism particles of different sizes in ml could contribute to fouling with diverse mechanisms in anmbrs biomass floc size could have significantly affected cl resistance meng et al 2006 and colloids was considered to drive initial cl formation zhou et al 2019 additionally pore blockage could be mainly attributed to the particles or organics with size similar to membrane pores e g smp wu et al 2011 therefore the evaluation of size fractioned compounds in relation to membrane resistances profiles was used to scrutinize the fouling mechanisms of anmbrs with and without qq 3 6 1 particle size distribution of mixed liquor qq could reduce the size of biomass flocs jiang et al 2013 and thereby accelerate the formation of small particles that would cause high cl resistance meng et al 2006 psd of biomass collected from each anmbr was measured based on five biological replicates in phase 3 fig 8 a the psd results were comparable in all measurements for each anmbr the d 0 5 values i e volume median diameter of anaerobic biomass were 39 28 3 68 μm and 39 77 8 07 μm for r1 and r2 respectively p 0 91 therefore the results showed that the psd of anaerobic biofloc in r1 and r2 were not significantly different this was in disagreement with the previous statement that qq could be associated to generate small flocs via inducing deflocculation of biomass jiang et al 2013 additionally qq has been demonstrated to interfere cell aggregation via disruption of ahls based cell to cell communication salehiziri et al 2018 however it was worth noting that other qs signals including autoinducter 2 ai 2 and diffusible signal factor dsf also played important roles in cell aggregation of anaerobic biomass feng et al 2014 therefore the floc size of biomass could be mainly governed by other qs signals in this study which thus lead to the inconsistent results the relationship between other qs signals and floc size of anaerobic biomass should be investigated in the future overall this showed that qq would not be correlated to change the anaerobic biofloc of r2 in phase 3 which thus would not accelerate fouling resistance in this study 3 6 2 colloidal particles the colloidal particles in supernatant in anmbrs were reported to have typical size range of 0 45 10 μm fig s1 zhou et al 2019 additionally colloidal particles harbored considerable metabolic products and would inevitably exacerbate membrane fouling in anmbrs zhou et al 2019 therefore the organic content of colloids which were at higher concentration than smp fig 4a b and 8b should be well analyzed the colloids in r1 and r2 mainly comprised organic particles with size larger than 5 μm fig 8b the organic compounds i e proteins and carbohydrates within the colloidal particles were lower in r2 compared with those in r1 with a reduction of 54 10 34 76 51 75 and 31 13 for colloids having size range of 0 45 1 μm 1 3 μm 3 5 μm and 5 μm respectively the colloidal particles 0 45 10 μm were demonstrated to have higher cl resistance than that of smp 0 45 μm zhou et al 2019 further all colloids had higher size than the nominal pore size of the ceramic membrane i e 0 1 μm therefore the significant reduction of colloids in r2 could contributed to the lower cl resistance compared with that of r1 after a similar operation period i e 8 d table 3 eem spectra of size fractionated components in supernatants was carried out in this study fig s2 as the overall organic profiles of smp for both anmbrs were identical fig 6 the differences of dominant organics within supernatants filtered by 1 μm 3 μm and 5 μm membranes between r1 and r2 were attributed to the different compounds in particles larger than 0 45 μm aromatic protein ii was obviously lower in the supernatants of r2 filtered by the 5 μm and 3 μm membrane compared to those of r1 therefore this suggeted that qq could mainly retard aromatic protein ii formation within the colloids coexistence of multiply biofilm forming microbial species within colloids was verified by fluorescence staining in anmbrs zhou et al 2019 therefore it could be inferred that the lower organic concentration and the altered organic compositions of colloids could be mainly attributed to the disruption of qs activity of these bacteria further studies would be needed to interrupt the effect of qq on the bio community changes within the colloids 3 6 3 organic size distribution of smp pore blocking resistance contributed to 32 5 in r2 after 8 d table 3 and the absolute value 2 92 1011 m 1 was slightly higher than that of r1 2 36 1011 m 1 however the organic contents proteins and carbohydrates within high size smp and low size smp were similar between r1 and r2 during phase 3 as revealed by fig 8b therefore the organic concentrations of smp alone would not be sufficient to help predict the occurrence of pore blockage much efforts have been conducted to characterize molecular weight distribution of smp to predict pore blocking in anmrbs yue et al 2015 2018 however the osd of smp was also of significance to be analyzed since their size ranges are similar to the membrane nominal pore size i e 0 1 μm two peaks centered at around 51 nm and 230 nm were observed in the osd analysis of smp in r2 while the majority of organic size of smp in r1 was only around 230 nm fig 8c this observation inferred that qq could contribute towards the change in osd of smp membrane pore size distribution of virgin ceramic membrane based on differential flow and differential area was also evaluated figs s3 and 8d to provide important clues to interpret the organics interception behavior by the membrane the membranes used in this study had dominant pore sizes of around 46 6 nm 54 9 nm and 100 3 nm as membrane pore was likely to be clogged by organics of similar or slightly larger sizes the organics with dominant size around 230 nm of smp in r1 was more prone to cause the 100 3 nm pore blockage nevertheless in addition to the 100 3 nm pore blockage causing by 230 nm organics in smp of r2 51 nm organics could also contribute to blockage of 46 6 nm and 54 9 nm pores it provided the reason why the overall pore blocking was relatively higher in r2 compared to that in r1 after the same period of operation 3 7 ahls degradability of fqq and ahls profile shift as gram negative bacteria that employed ahls as qs signals was dominant in both ml and cl in r1 as unveiled by fig s4 it suggested that ahls based qs could play a vital role in regulating membrane fouling in anmbrs therefore it was necessary to analyze the ahls degradability of qq beads to evaluate its qq performance during the ahls degradability tests residual ahls in the blank without beads after 120 min were 87 5 90 6 91 6 97 7 92 8 87 6 92 3 98 0 64 4 and 83 3 for c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl respectively fig 9 a in view of the lower ahls of the empty beads both neb and oeb as compared with the blanks the differences were attributed to the physical adsorption of ahls by the beads additionally the differences in residual ahls found in the qq beads nqqb or oqqb and their corresponding empty beads neb or oeb were defined as the biodegradation efficiencies of qq beads the biodegradation efficiencies of the nqqb for c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c8 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl were 23 4 18 9 20 1 16 1 20 1 16 9 20 1 13 9 20 4 and 21 6 respectively fig 9b thus the results demonstrated the ability of nqqb i e fqq to biodegrade a wide range of ahls the ahls profile was further unraveled for both the anmbrs to endeavor an exhaustive insight of qq performance of fqq the 10 ahls in the influents supernatants of ml and permeates were characterized table 4 short chain ahls including c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl were found to be the dominant ahls in the supernatants of both the anmbrs concretely exogenous addition of c4 hsl and c6 hsl was found to be related to the increased protein concentrations of eps in anaerobic sludge lv et al 2018 therefore the dominant ahls was strongly associated with eps production and thus might negatively affect membrane filtration performance it could be deduced that the influent could be of significance because the concentrations of c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl in the influent accounted for 180 53 54 45 73 and 106 of those in the supernatant of r1 respectively the lower concentrations of c4 hsl and 3 oxoc14 hsl in the supernatant of r1 than those of the influent could be attributed to the internal qq activity of sludge lv et al 2018 waheed et al 2020 while the higher concentrations of 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl and c12 hsl in the supernatant of r1 than those of the influent could be the results of qs activity of sludge this phenomenon suggested the battle phenomenon between qs and qq activities of microorganisms regulating ahls concentration in the anmbr however with the external qq effect i e dosing fqq into r2 it was apparent that c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl i e the dominant ahls were suppressed in phase 3 with reduction of 19 7 100 and 54 4 respectively compared to that of r1 this suggested that the fqq could degrade dominant ahls in r2 obviously the reduced dominant ahls suggested the lower qs activity which could thus be associated to the lower membrane fouling in r2 during phase 3 as the detected concentration of ahls in the permeates were lower than those in supernatants for both anmbrs and the ahls were smaller than the nominal pore size of the membrane i e 0 1 μm ahls could either be rejected by the cl or plug the membrane pores high stability of qq performance of the fqq is critical to foster widespread application of qqanmbr therefore the biodegradation behaviors of ahls by the oqqb also were investigated fig 9b interestingly after 5 membrane service periods of r2 during phase 3 70 d the biodegradability of the oqqb for 3 oxo c8 hsl c7 hsl c8 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c14 hsl were enhanced with efficiencies of 29 5 20 8 23 5 51 0 28 8 and 23 7 respectively while the biodegradation efficiencies for c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl c6 hsl and c10 hsl were reduced with degradation efficiency of 7 5 18 5 17 5 and 18 3 respectively compared with those of the nqqb fig 9b the differences in biodegradability between the nqqb and oqqb might be due to the shift of qq microbial communities inside the qq beads the declining qq performance could be due to qq microorganisms out competed by local bio communities liu et al 2019 it was also in agreement with another previous study which observed that only 2 out of 5 qq strain could be found in oqqb waheed et al 2020 however the increased qq capacity for other ahls after the long term operation might be contributed by adaption of qq bacteria to the new environment cheong et al 2014 therefore more validations regarding the evolution of the qq community would be needed overall there was only significant biodegradability loss for c4 hsl 68 2 of oqqb as compared with nqqb while the biodegradability of oqqb with regard to other 9 ahls was well maintained in the harsh environment of real wastewater after 70 d fig 9b this suggested that the fqq could be an efficient and sustainable technology for membrane fouling management 4 conclusion this study revealed the effect of qq on key organics in eps and size fractioned particles and organics in anmbrs for the first time it demonstrated that fqq is an ideal qq inoculum to exemplify the potential for sustainable membrane fouling circumvention in anmbrs without sacrificing treatment performance this study showed that fqq significantly extended the membrane operating period of the qqanmbr treating dww mitigated c4 hsl 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl by fqq directly proved the qq effect qq was shown to reduce biopolymers yield in eps thus improved biomass dewaterability concomitantly qq affected the key organic compositions of eps and cake layer qq caused a shift of dominant membrane foulants from cl to pore blockage after a similar period of operation i e 8d compared with the control reduced cl in the qqanmbr was attributed to not only the suppressed eps production but lower organic content of colloids the small size organics 51 nm within the smp in the presence of qq led to the slightly increased occurrence of pore

17879,oxidative treatment of iodide containing waters can lead to a formation of potentially toxic iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps iodide i is easily oxidized to hoi by various oxidation

activation energy for the reaction between hoi and h2o2 was determined to be e a 34 kj mol 1 the effect of buffer types phosphate acetate and borate and their concentrations was also investigated phosphate and acetate buffers significantly increased the rate of the h2o2 hoi reaction at ph 7 3 and 4 7 respectively whereas the effect of borate was moderate it could be demonstrated that the formation of iodophenols from phenol as a model for i dbps formation was significantly reduced by the addition of h2o2 to hoi and phenol containing solutions during water treatment with the o3 h2o2 process or peracetic acid in the presence of i o3 and peracetic acid will be consumed by a catalytic oxidation of i due to the fast reduction of hoi by h2o2 the o3 deposition on the ocean surface may also be influenced by the presence of h2o2 which leads to a catalytic consumption of o3 by i graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogen peroxide hypoiodous acid iodide oxidation disinfection byproducts ozone deposition 1 introduction during oxidative water treatment at circumneutral ph iodide i is rapidly oxidized to aqueous iodine mainly hypoiodous acid hoi which has a high potential to produce iodinated disinfection byproducts i dbps by its reactions with dissolved organic matter moieties bichsel and von gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000a criquet et al 2012 allard et al 2015 as a consequence i dbps have been widely detected in oxidatively treated iodide containing waters krasner et al 2006 wei et al 2013 gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2016 the formation of i dbps is of concern in drinking water because they are more cytotoxic genotoxic and mutagenic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 yang et al 2014 dong et al 2019 moreover iodinated trihalomethanes i thms especially iodoform can lead to an undesired medicinal taste and odor in finished drinking waters hansson et al 1987 to minimize the formation of i dbps several studies have investigated the reactions of hoi with in organic constituents and various oxidants during drinking water treatment hoi can be transformed by three competing pathways scheme 1 a oxidation to iodate io3 b disproportionation to i and io3 and c reduction to i by dissolved organic matter dom or hydrogen peroxide h2o2 nagy et al 1988 bichsel and von gunten 1999 bichsel and von gunten 2000a zhao et al 2016 li et al 2017 shin et al 2018 iodate io3 is nontoxic and thus the desired sink for iodine during oxidative water treatment bürgi et al 2001 however many oxidants i e chlorine chlorine dioxide chloramine permanganate manganese dioxide have relatively low reactivity with hoi wherefore io3 formation is slow or absent bichsel and von gunten 2000a zhao et al 2016 during chlorination of bromide containing water the oxidation of hoi to io3 is significantly enhanced by hobr k hobr oi 1 9 106 m 1s 1 which is formed by the oxidation of bromide by chlorine criquet et al 2012 however at the same time the formation of brominated i dbps is enhanced in the presence of bromide allard et al 2015 only ozone o3 and ferrate fe vi show significant potential for a

intentionally added for some advanced oxidation processes e g o3 h2o2 or uv h2o2 h2o2 is also present during various water treatment applications with peracids such as peracetic acid shah et al 2015a moreover significant concentrations of h2o2 20 30 of the consumed fe vi can be produced during treatment with fe vi by self decay of fe vi lee et al 2014 during water treatment or in natural systems hoi is the dominant species compared to molecular iodine i2 because the i concentration is typically very low maximum 100 μg l of i in surface water and hence the equilibrium is on the side of hoi eq 5 in table 1 smedley 2000 moran et al 2002 richardson et al 2008 the reactions of iodine with h2o2 have been studied previously eq 1 was proposed as a dominant reaction pathway in the hoi h2o2 system

shiraishi et al 1992 vary over several orders of magnitude in literature table 2 this might be related to experimental differences previously to determine the second order rate constants for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 an indirect method was used which measures the decrease of i3 in presence of excess i based on eqs 5 and 6 in table 1 this approach can lead to different i2 concentrations depending on the experimental conditions e g ph i2 or i o wherefore the reaction system may be ill defined based on this approach different ph dependences of second order rate constants were found in several studies e g k 1 h 2 for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 as a consequence reactions in eqs 9 and 10 were introduced as a dominant reaction pathway in some previous studies shiraishi et al 1992 ball and hnatiw 2001 9 i 2 oh i 2 oh hoi i 10 i2oh h2o2 2i o2 h3o overall a lot of conflicting information for the kinetics of the reaction of hoi with h2o2 has been published however so far no agreement has been reached mainly due to the utilization of an indirect experimental approach in this study second order rate constants for the reactions of hoi with h2o2 were directly determined by measuring the hoi decrease or i formation over a wide ph range from 4 0 to 12 0 using stopped flow and batch type experiments excluding the formation and reactions of i2 this approach makes it possible to assess the importance of the reduction of hoi by h2o2 compared to its other reactions in water treatment and h2o2 containing natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents all experiments were carried out with ultrapure water from a milli q millipore nanopure system all chemicals and solvents were of the highest purity available and used as received without further purification supporting information si text 1 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 stock solutions were prepared by diluting a commercial solution of h2o2 30 wt in h2o sigma and standardized spectrophotometrically using the molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 ε 40 m 1 cm 1 at 240 nm bader et al 1988 chlorine hocl ocl stock solutions were prepared by diluting a commercial sodium hypochlorite solution 10 15 sigma and standardized spectrophotometrically using the molar absorption coefficient of ocl ph 11 ε 350 m 1 cm 1 at 292 nm kumar and margerum 1987 stock solutions of hoi 5 25 μm were freshly prepared through oxidation of a slight excess of iodide 5 1 25 5 μm by chlorine 5 25 μm in pure water 2 2 kinetic experiments with stopped flow kinetic studies for the reactions of hoi with h2o2 were performed under pseudo first order conditions with h2o2 in molar excess over hoi with a hi tech scientific sf 61dx2 stopped flow spectrometer tgk scientific united kingdom in the ph range from 7 1 to 12 at 22 2 c initial concentrations of h2o2 were at least 4 times higher than hoi a wide range 12 16 000 μm of h2o2 solutions were prepared in different buffer solutions table s1 si hoi solutions at concentrations of 6 μm were in the same buffer solutions as the h2o2 solutions to avoid mixing problems buffered h2o2 and hoi solutions were then mixed in a 1 1 ratio to initiate the reaction and the formation of i was determined spectrophotometrically at 226 nm ε 226nm 1 36 104 m 1 cm 1 the uv spectrum of i is shown in fig s1 si the uv absorption of i was not affected by the other reactants i e h2o2 and hoi because their molar absorption coefficients at 226 nm are much lower ε 80 m 1 cm 1 and their concentrations change proportionally with i therefore the changes of the absorption at 226 nm are proportional to the relative changes of the i concentration which can be used to calculate the apparent first order rate constant the average i formation curves were calculated from at least eight replicate curves for each experimental condition pseudo first order rate constants k obs were then calculated by an exponential regression with the software kinetic studio 2 x tgk scientific from the average i formation curves 2 3 kinetic experiments with the abts method in batch reactors lower second order rate constants for the reactions of hoi with h2o2 in the ph range 4 6 2 were determined by the abts method pinkernell et al 2000 shin et al 2018 the kinetic experiments were conducted under pseudo first order conditions with 1 μm or 2 μm hoi with a molar excess of h2o2 20 200 μm in the presence of 100 μm of agno3 ag was added to quench i by forming agi k so 8 5 10 17 lide 2006 and hence suppress the formation and the reactions of i2 this enabled us to determine the second order rate constants of the reaction of hoi with h2o2 at low and neutral phs the reaction was initiated by adding a small volume 1 ml of a h2o2 stock solution 20 mm under vigorous mixing to a buffered solution 100 ml containing hoi the reaction solutions were then quenched with an abts solution after certain reaction times to measure the residual hoi concentrations pinkernell et al 2000 2 4 formation of iodophenols in hoi h2o2 and phenol containing waters solutions 20 ml containing phenol 10 μm h2o2 0 50 μm and agno3 100 μm were prepared in glass bottles and then reactions were initiated by adding 1 μm hoi at ph 7 0 8 mm phosphate and ph 9 0 8 mm phosphate 4 mm borate under rapid mixing 10 s iodo phenols 2 iodo and 4 iodo phenols were analyzed by hplc dionex ultimate 3000 usa with uv detection at 231 nm the separation was achieved by a machery nagel c18 column using a mobile phase consisting of 70 10 mm phosphoric acid and 30 methanol the limit of quantification loq for both 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol was 0 05 μm 2 5 data analysis the species specific second order rate constants were determined from the ph dependent apparent second order rate constants by using the software graphpad prism www graphpad com model calculations to evaluate the influence of h2o2 during various oxidative water treatment in the presence of i were performed using kintecus ianni 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of reaction order and second order rate constants at ph 7 or higher the reaction kinetics for the reactions of hoi with h2o2 followed a second order rate law under our experimental conditions table s1 si during the reaction of hoi with excess h2o2 the evolution of i was exponential indicating that the reaction is pseudo first order with respect to the h2o2 concentration fig s2 si k obs was calculated by an exponential regression with the software kinetic studio 2 x from the i formation curves fig s2 si and alternatively was also obtained from the slopes of the linear plots of the logarithmic relative residual concentration of hoi versus time fig s3 si the relative residual concentration of hoi was calculated from the formation of i eq 11 11 l n h o i 0 i h o i 0 k o b s t i m e the obtained k obs values for the two methods were within 7 6 figures s2 and s3 si fig s4 si shows the linearity of k obs as a function of the h2o2 concentration r2 0 999 at phs 8 and 9 the inset shows that the log k obs versus log h2o2 0 plot has as slope of 1 confirming a reaction order of one with respect to h2o2 based on this apparent second order rate constants k app were determined by dividing k obs by the corresponding initial h2o2 concentrations eq 12 the calculated k app values were 6 3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 and 3 7 105 m 1s 1 at ph 9 0 table s1 si and fig 1 and fig s4 si 12 k a p p k o b s h 2 o 2 0 for ph 7 0 the kinetics for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 did not follow pseudo first order 1 3 μm hoi in excess of h2o2 this is illustrated as an example in fig s5 si for ph 6 hoi 3 μm with excess h2o2 1 2 and 4 mm this is due to the presence of i2 leading to several competitive reactions which may have caused the wide range of reported second order rate constants for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 in the literature table 2 since i is produced during the reaction of hoi with h2o2 the i2 concentration increases with increasing formation of i in the course of the reaction especially at low ph eq 5 table 1 fig s6 si shows the speciation of i2 hoi oi depending on i concentrations 0 1 and 2 0 μm as a function of ph hoi is the major species in the neutral ph 6 9 in the presence of low concentration of i e g 0 1 μm meanwhile i2 is the major species in presence of a high concentration of i e g 2 0 μm for a ph 6 5 to exclude the effect of i 100 μm ag was added before initiating the reactions at ph 7 0 to avoid the formation of i2 see above under these conditions the decrease of hoi hoi 0 1 or 2 μm in the presence of excess h2o2 20 200 μm showed pseudo first order kinetics fig s7 si second order rate constants k app were determined by eq 13 yielding 34 1 m 1s 1 84 8 m 1s 1 and 940 60 m 1s 1 at phs 4 5 and 6 respectively 13 l n h o i h o i 0 k a p p h 2 o 2 0 t i m e 3 2 ph dependence of the second order rate constant for the reaction between hypoiodous acid and hydrogen peroxide table s1 si compiles the observed ph dependent first order rate constants k obs and apparent second order rate constants k app for the reactions of hoi with h2o2 the k app are also plotted in fig 1 for the ph range 4 12 in general the k app values increase with increasing ph which can be explained by the speciation of hoi and h2o2 pk a1 hoi oi 10 4 and pk a2 h2o2 ho2 11 8 acid base equilibria are considered to be faster than the redox reactions from a kinetic point of view the reactions in eqs 2 and 3 cannot be distinguished because they have the same ph dependence rather than considering the two reactions in parallel it is assumed that only one of the two pathways is important in the hoi h2o2 systems hoi is more electrophilic than oi and ho2 is stronger nucleophile than h2o2 therefore the reaction of hoi with ho2 eq 2 is considered the major pathway for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 the same mechanistic interpretations for the hocl h2o2 and hobr h2o2 systems are discussed in the literature held et al 1978 von gunten and oliveras 1997 meanwhile at low or high ph the reactions of hoi with h2o2 or oi with ho2 respectively can also occur therefore eqs 1 2 and 4 should be considered to determine the species specific second order rate constants the ph dependent variation in k app could be quantitatively modeled by eq 14 considering the species specific reactions between hoi oi and h2o2 ho2 14 k a p p k 1 α h o i β h 2 o 2 k 2 α h o i β h o 2 k 4 α o i β h o 2 where k 1 k 2 and k 4 are the species specific second order rate constants in eqs 1 2 and 4 respectively α hoi α oi β h2o2 and β ho2 represent the fractions of hoi oi h2o2 and ho2 respectively which at a given ph can be expressed as α hoi h h k a hoi α oi k a hoi h k a hoi β h2o2 h h k a h2o2 and β ho2 k a h2o2 h k a h2o2 with k a being the corresponding acid base equilibrium constants see table 1 the species specific second order rate constants were calculated from least squares nonlinear regressions of the experimental k app data table s1 si using the graphpad prism www graphpad com the model could fit the experimental k app well r2 0 92 the species specific second order rate constants were determined to be k 1 hoi h2o2 29 5 2 m 1s 1 k 2 hoi ho2 3 1 0 3 108 m 1s 1 k 4 oi ho2 6 4 1 4 107 m 1s 1 table 2 the error ranges for k 1 k 2 and k 4 are due to experimental variabilities and also due to the types and concentrations of the buffers the second order rate constants for the reactions of hoi with h2o2 can be applied to calculate the half life of hoi in h2o2 containing water treatment the calculations of the half life of hoi are shown in fig 1 for 10 mg l 1 h2o2 which is an intermediate high range dose applied to advanced oxidation processes aops stefan 2017 half lives for the hoi abatement in the presence of 10 mg l of h2o2 are 4 4 0 47 and 0 047 s at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively 3 3 effect of the buffer type and concentrations on the kinetics of the reactions of hoi with h2o2 previous studies have shown that buffer type and concentrations can influence the reactivity of hoi with oxidants i e ferrate vi or permanganate vii wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 or phenols zhao et al 2017 and the disproportionation of hoi bichsel and von gunten 2000b the effects of different buffers phosphate borate and acetate at different phs ph 7 3 9 0 and 4 7 on the reduction of hoi by h2o2 were investigated table s2 and figs s8 s10 si during the reaction of hoi 3 μm with h2o2 4 mm at ph 7 3 40 μm at ph 9 0 an exponential increase of i was monitored by stopped flow in the presence of various concentrations of phosphate pk a 7 2 for h2po4 goldberg et al 2002 or borate buffer pk a 9 2 goldberg et al 2002 figs s8 and s9 si at ph 4 7 the kinetics of the reactions of hoi with h2o2 follow pseudo first order in the presence of 100 μm of ag with various concentrations of acetate pk a 4 76 goldberg et al 2002 fig s10 si the rates of i formation and hence the hoi consumption increased with increasing phosphate borate and acetate concentrations this indicates that the selected buffers enhance the reaction of hoi with h2o2 among the selected buffers phosphate shows the most significant enhancement of the reactivity especially at ph 7 3 fig s11 si at ph 7 3 k app in presence of 1 25 mm phosphate buffer was 7 6 103 m 1s 1 which increased up to a factor of 4 3 for 25 mm phosphate k app 3 3 104 m 1s 1 however the effect of phosphate was less pronounced at ph 9 0 the reaction in presence of 50 mm phosphate was 1 6 times faster than without phosphate meanwhile acetate enhanced the apparent second order rate constant from 52 m 1s 1 1 mm acetate to 140 m 1s 1 25 mm acetate at ph 4 7 borate showed lower effects on the apparent second order rate constants which ranged from 2 5 105 m 1s 1 0 5 mm borate to 5 4 105 m 1s 1 25 mm borate the rate constants at zero buffer concentrations were also estimated by a linear regression based on fig s11 si the y axis intercept indicates each second order rate constant at zero buffer concentration 40 7 m 1s 1 at ph 4 7 5 6 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 3 and 2 4 105 m 1s 1 at ph 9 0 these second order rate constants are compared in fig s12 si with the determined k app fig 1 and table s1 si which were used for determining the species specific rate constants the measured k app values at 3 6 mm acetate buffer ph 4 5 at 5 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 6 8 and at 5 10 mm borate buffer ph 9 might be overestimated at most 2 4 3 2 1 7 fold respectively which is in the range of variations of experimental second order rate constants 3 4 temperature effect on the kinetics of the reduction of hoi by h2o2 the effect of temperature on the kinetics of the reaction of hoi with h2o2 was studied at 10 0 23 2 c at ph 9 0 5 mm phosphate 5 mm

phenol was added as a simplified surrogate for dom and the formed iodophenols were quantified as a proxy for the extent of i dbps formation the second order rate constant of the reaction of hoi with phenol is similar to the reaction of hoi with h2o2 at ph 7 i e k hoi phenol 2 6 103 m 1s 1 bichsel and von gunten 2000a and k hoi h2o2 4 9 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 this study 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol were detected during the reaction of hoi 1 μm with phenol 10 μm in the presence of varying concentrations of h2o2 0 50 μm at ph 7 0 8 mm phosphate and ph 9 0 8 mm phosphate 4 mm borate ag was added to exclude the formation and reactions of i2 a hoi concentration of 1 μm was chosen to simulate an elevated i level 130 μg l and the concentration of phenol was 10 times that of hoi 10 μm 0 94 mg l of phenol would correspond to a source water containing about 5 mgc l doc with a typical phenol content of around 20 önnby et al 2018 h2o2 is generally applied as 2 15 mg l in advanced oxidation processes stefan 2017 nevertheless relatively low concentrations of h2o2 2 mg l were applied here to evaluate the trend of iodophenol formation fig 2 shows that hoi was fully transformed to iodophenols during the reaction of hoi with phenol in the absence of h2o2 at phs 7 0 and 9 0 as expected the formation of iodophenols decreased with increasing h2o2 doses and at the maximum h2o2 concentration of about 1 7 mg l 50 μm only low concentrations of iodophenols 0 1 μm were detected due to the reduction of hoi by h2o2 to i even with these relatively low h2o2 doses a large effect on the minimization of the formation of iodophenols was observed similar levels of iodophenol formation were observed at both ph 7 0 and 9 0 this is because k app of the reaction of hoi with phenol and the reaction of hoi with h2o2 exhibit a similar ph dependency with generally increasing apparent second order rate constants with increasing ph bichsel and von gunten 2000a zhao et al 2017 the modeling results based on the reaction in table s3 si for the iodophenol formation were slightly higher than the experimental data by a factor of 1 05 1 15 at ph 7 0 and 1 1 1 3 at ph 9 0 fig 2a and b dashed lines with circles this can be considered as a good agreement given the uncertainty in the values of the second order rate constants for the involved reactions 3 6 comparison of the reactivities of h2o2 with hoi hocl and hobr fig 3 and table 2 show a comparison of the apparent and species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of h2o2 with hoi hobr and hocl respectively the species specific second order rate constants for the reaction of ho2 with hox decrease in the order hobr 7 6 108 m 1s 1 hoi 3 1 108 m 1s 1 hocl 4 4 107 m 1s 1 this sequence has also been observed for electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions of hox with phenols heeb et al 2014 based on the standard reduction potentials it would be expected that hocl has the highest reactivity however since the reaction potentially involves a x transfer to ho2 heeb et al 2014 the partial positive charge on x in hox is also important the electronegativity of the halogens decreases in the order cl br i wherefore the partial positive charge increases in the order cl br i based on this consideration hoi should have the highest reactivity to form the h o o x intermediate this species decomposes under the formation of x and singlet oxygen this reaction step is favored again by the more electrophilic halogen overall the combination of these factors then leads to the observed sequence for the species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of hox with h2o2 the only exception was observed from the reaction of ho2 with oi in the literature the reaction of ho2 with hypohalite ions obr and ocl were not considered because of the strongly reduced partial positive charge on br and cl for the hypohalite ions meanwhile the reaction of ho2 with oi was the major reaction at high ph 11 0 this may be due to the lower electronegativity of i compared to br or cl which means that there is still a significant partial positive charge on i in oi 3 7 implications for water treatment and natural systems 3 7 1 water treatment the formation of i dbps during drinking water disinfection has become an emerging concern their formation is initiated by the relatively easy oxidation of i to hoi by chemical oxidants during water treatment however most oxidants with the exception of o3 and fe vi have low reactivity with hoi which leads to the formation of i dbps by the reaction of hoi with dom in certain processes in which h2o2 is present together with a primary oxidant the reduction of hoi to i by h2o2 needs to be considered due to the significant reactivity of the two compounds a recent study showed a constant i concentration during uv h2o2 treatment in the presence of 130 μg l of i 10 mg l of h2o2 and 3 5 mg l doc at ph 7 0 zhang et al 2018 in fact in the uv h2o2 process i is oxidized to hoi through the formation of radical species i e i i2 by the rapid reaction with oh radical k 1010 m 1s 1 elliot 1992 ellison et al 1972 nagarajan and fessenden 1985 however the formed hoi will be quickly reduced to i by h2o2 as already mentioned above half lives for the hoi abatement in the presence of 10 mg l of h2o2 at neutral ph were low namely 0 5 and 0 05 s at ph 7 and 8 respectively thus uv h2o2 pre oxidation followed by chlorination or chloramination still has a risk of i dbp formation due to the remaining i in the o3 h2o2 process i is quickly oxidized to hoi k o3 i 2 0 109 m 1s 1 the resulting hypoiodous acid hoi oi has two competing reaction pathways 1 reduction to i by h2o2 k ho2 hoi 3 1 108 m 1s 1 and 2 oxidation to io3 through io2 by o3 k o3 hoi 3 6 104 m 1s 1 and k o3 oi 1 6 106 m 1s 1 reduction of hoi by h2o2 could lead to the loss of oxidation capacity of o3 by a catalytic cycle of oxidation of i by o3 and reduction of hoi by h2o2 back to i a kinetic simulation was used to calculate the relative contributions of various reactions to the o3 consumption i e catalytic oxidation of i reaction with h2o2 and further oxidation of hoi to io3 for simplicity the formation and reactions of oh were not considered in these model calculations for the selected conditions of the o3 h2o2 process 56 66 of o3 i e 11 7 13 7 μm was consumed by the catalytic oxidation of i fig s14 si rather than for the formation of oh via its reaction with h2o2 k o3 ho2 9 6 106 m 1s 1 for an elevated level of i e g 1 μm 130 μg l o3 1 mg l 20 8 μm and h2o2 4 10 mg l at ph 8 0 io3 was the dominant iodine species only during ozonation with a low concentration of h2o2 h2o2 2 mg l due to the fast reactions of o3 with i and with hoi forming io3 however significant concentrations of i could remain after complete consumption of o3 in the presence of relatively high h2o2 h2o2 2 mg l such conditions are typically applied for bromate control during the o3 h2o2 process pinkernell and von gunten 2001 soltermann et al 2017 von gunten and oliveras 1997 von gunten and oliveras 1998 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during post disinfection with chlorine or chloramine iodide can then be a precursor to i dbps therefore if both i and br are present in a source water appropriate h2o2 doses should be applied during ozonation to minimize the formation of both i dbps and bro3 peracetic acid paa is a disinfectant considered for use in ballast water and wastewater treatment luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 shah et al 2015a b werschkun et al 2014 h2o2 is always present in peracetic acid paa solutions because paa is synthesized by the reaction of acetic acid with h2o2 to evaluate the role of h2o2 during the treatment of i and br by paa in an ocean type water a kinetic simulation was performed fig s15 si shows the evolutions of hoi hobr h2o2 and paa during treatment of 0 5 μm i and 460 μm br by 2 15 mm paa in the presence of 0 65 mm h2o2 at ph 8 0 in this system i and br are oxidized to hoi and hobr by paa k paa i 4 2 102 m 1s 1 k paa br 0 24 m 1s 1 awad et al 2003 shah et al 2015a however as soon as hoi or hobr are produced they are reduced by h2o2 to i or br these reactions continued until most of the h2o2 was consumed and at the same time paa decreased to a similar extent as h2o2 for the selected conditions fig s15 si h2o2 was almost completely consumed at 20 min and i was rapidly oxidized to hoi whereas br was slowly oxidized to hobr by paa during paa treatment h2o2 can be a barrier for the formation i dbps or br dbps by minimization the lifetime of the hypohalous acids hoi and hobr however it can also lead to a rapid consumption of paa by an iodide catalyzed reaction this catalyzed reaction was also reported in a previous study shah et al 2015a h2o2 is one of the major products during the self decay of fe vi lee et al 2014 the yield of h2o2 δ h2o2 δ fe vi was 0 2 during the reaction of fe vi with i or hoi shin et al 2018 to assess the influence of h2o2 formation on the fate of iodine a kinetic simulation was performed for treatment of i by fe vi to better understand the effect of h2o2 the following simplified boundary conditions were assumed h2o2 was not produced during the fe vi reactions but was initially present as 30 of fe vi fig s16 si shows the modeling results for the evolution of hoi io3 h2o2 and fe vi during the treatment of 1 μm of i by 17 9 μm fe vi 1 mgfe l in the presence of 5 4 μm h2o2 at phs 7 0 9 0 at ph 7 0 99 of i was oxidized to io3 within 11 s by fe vi without interference of h2o2 with increasing ph from 7 0 to 9 0 the oxidation rate of i to io3 decreased this is because the rate of fe vi reaction with hoi and i decreases with increasing ph i e k fe vi hoi 1 8 105 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 and 4 7 103 m 1s 1 at ph 9 0 while the rate of hoi reduction by h2o2 to i increases overall an increase in ph led to an increase in the consumption of h2o2 and fe vi at ph 7 0 only 3 μm of fe vi was consumed to completely oxidize 1 μm i to io3 without consumption of h2o2 while at ph 9 0 8 4 μm of fe vi was consumed with a h2o2 consumption of 5 6 μm for a full oxidation of i to io3 3 7 2 natural systems o3 deposition to the seawater surface is a significant mechanism for the loss of atmospheric o3 accounting for a loss of 600 1000 tg o3 yr 1 ganzeveld et al 2009 aqueous inorganic iodine i e i hoi at the sea surface microlayer is one of the major contributors to the oceanic deposition of o3 this is based on the fast reaction between o3 gas and i which forms hoi in the aqueous phase and iodine oxide in the gaseous phase while o3 is reduced to o2 carpenter et al 2013 chang et al 2004 sarwar et al 2015 simpson et al 2015 during this reaction o3 deposition might be significantly enhanced by h2o2 due to its high reactivity with hoi to form i the concentration of h2o2 at the sea surface varies from 10 to 500 nm moore et al 1993 price et al 1998 zika et al 1985 the gas phase flux of o3 into the boundary layer can be determined by the product of the o3 deposition velocity v d and the o3 concentration o3 gas the o3 deposition velocity v d over seawater is highly variable 0 01 0 27 cm s 1 ganzeveld et al 2009 helmig et al 2012 depending on several factors in the seawater i e water quality and the atmosphere e g wind a simplified isolated kinetic modeling was performed to assess the impact of the seawater concentrations of h2o2 on the o3 deposition to the sea surface microlayer in the presence of i and br fig s17 si since the source of o3 is the atmosphere and the source of i br and h2o2 is the ocean it was assumed that the concentrations of each compound are in steady state a steady state concentration of hoi was applied instead of i since i is easily oxidized to hoi currently hoi concentrations in the seawater are unknown due to the lack of analytical techniques with sufficient accuracy and sensitivity carpenter et al 2013 considering the reported total inorganic iodine concentrations e g i and io3 of 500 nm in seawater chance et al 2014 the hoi ss was varied between 25 500 nm with increasing hoi ss o3 deposition increases si text 3 and fig s17 si in a next step the hoi ss was fixed at an intermediate concentration of 100 nm and the steady state concentrations of the other reactive species were assumed as follows o3 ss 1 nm br ss 500 μm and variable h2o2 ss 0 10 25 100 250 500 nm virtual reaction products as tracers i e p1 p2 p7 in table s4 si were quantified by kintecus modeling to obtain the relative contributions of the various reactions to o3 consumption reactions 1 7 in table s4 si 1 oxidation of i was obtained from p3 2 oxidation of br was obtained from p7 and 3 oxidation of hoi to io3 was determined by the summation of p4 p5 and p6 the reaction system reached steady state within a few seconds however one year of modeling time was applied to obtain the total yearly o3 deposition as the h2o2 concentration is increasing the o3 consumption for the oxidation of i becomes increasingly important compared to the reaction with bromide which dominates at low h2o2 concentrations fig s18a si the contribution of the catalytic oxidation of i for the o3 consumptions increased from 36 to 97 for an increase of h2o2 from 10 nm to 500 nm fig s18a si for all selected h2o2 concentrations the consumption of o3 by the oxidation of hoi to io3 was insignificant 10 compared to the o3 consumption for the oxidation of i or br in this kinetic modeling the concentration of i reached steady state within a few seconds fig s18b si shows that the resulting steady state concentration of i i ss and the total o3 consumptions over 1 year depend on the initial h2o2 ss according to kinetic modeling results the i ss increased linearly with increasing h2o2 concentrations 0 500 nm as a consequence the total o3 deposition rate increased proportionally 2 8 82 1 mm per year if these results are combined with variable hoi ss the total o3 deposition ranges from 3 6 mm 25 nm hoi 25 nm h2o2 to 400 mm 500 nm hoi 500 nm h2o2 per year accounting for the area of the sea surface microlayer 3 5 108 km2 costello et al 2010 and setting the depth of the boundary layer to 100 μm an o3 deposition rate of 6 2 400 tg year can be calculated depending on the hoi 25 500 nm and the h2o2 concentrations 0 500 nm depending on the boundary conditions this deposition rate is about two orders of magnitude lower or in the same range as current estimates see above therefore our simplified estimate shows that h2o2 may have a high potential to increase the o3 deposition by the catalytic oxidation of i at the sea surface which might warrant an inclusion of these reactions to calculate o3 deposition in future modeling efforts the reduction of hoi by h2o2 can also occur in atmospheric waters which may lead to a reduction of the o3 levels in the troposphere pillar et al 2013 4 conclusions apparent and species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of hydrogen peroxide with hypoiodous acid were determined and the main conclusions are as follows the reaction between hoi and h2o2 is a second order process the species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of h2o2 with hoi ho2 with hoi ho2 with oi are k h2o2 hoi 29 5 2 m 1s 1 k ho2 hoi 3 1 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 and k ho2 oi 6 4 1 4 107 m 1s 1 respectively phosphate 1 25 25 mm and acetate 1 25 mm buffers lead to a significant enhancement of the h2o2 hoi reactivity at ph 7 3 by a factor of 4 and at ph 4 7 by a factor of 3 respectively meanwhile borate 0 5 25 mm buffer showed a moderate effect a factor of 2 on the h2o2 hoi reactivity at ph 9 0 the activation energy for the reaction between hoi and h2o2 is e a 34 kj mol 1 the formation of i dbps in a model system could be significantly reduced by addition of relatively low concentrations of h2o2 to hoi and phenol containing solutions the species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of ho2 with hox increased in the order of hocl hoi hobr oxidative water treatment of iodide containing water in presence of h2o2 can lead to a reduced formation of i dbps by minimizing the lifetime of hoi however due to the remaining i h2o2 based pre oxidation e g uv h2o2 followed by chlorination or chloramination may still have a risk of i dbp formation o3 deposition by the oxidation of i on the seawater surface can be significantly enhanced in presence of h2o2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

activation energy for the reaction between hoi and h2o2 was determined to be e a 34 kj mol 1 the effect of buffer types phosphate acetate and borate and their concentrations was also investigated phosphate and acetate buffers significantly increased the rate of the h2o2 hoi reaction at ph 7 3 and 4 7 respectively whereas the effect of borate was moderate it could be demonstrated that the formation of iodophenols from phenol as a model for i dbps formation was significantly reduced by the addition of h2o2 to hoi and phenol containing solutions during water treatment with the o3 h2o2 process or peracetic acid in the presence of i o3 and peracetic acid will be consumed by a catalytic oxidation of i due to the fast reduction of hoi by h2o2 the o3 deposition on the ocean surface may also be influenced by the presence of h2o2 which leads to a catalytic consumption of o3 by i graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogen peroxide hypoiodous acid iodide oxidation disinfection

as a consequence i dbps have been widely detected in oxidatively treated iodide containing waters krasner et al 2006 wei et al 2013 gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2016 the formation of i dbps is of

moreover significant concentrations of h2o2 20 30 of the consumed fe vi can be produced during treatment with fe vi by self decay of fe vi lee et al 2014 during water treatment or in natural systems hoi is the dominant species compared to molecular iodine i2 because the i concentration is typically very low maximum 100 μg l of i in surface water and hence the equilibrium is on the side of hoi eq

shiraishi et al 1992 vary over several orders of magnitude in literature table 2 this might be related to experimental differences previously to determine the second order rate constants for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 an indirect method was used which measures the decrease of i3 in presence of excess i based on eqs 5 and 6 in table 1 this approach can lead to different i2 concentrations depending on the experimental conditions e g ph i2 or i o wherefore the reaction system may be ill defined based on this approach different ph dependences of second order rate constants were found in several studies e g k 1 h 2 for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 as a consequence reactions in eqs 9 and 10 were introduced as a dominant reaction pathway in some previous studies shiraishi et al 1992 ball and hnatiw 2001 9 i 2 oh i 2 oh hoi i 10 i2oh h2o2 2i o2 h3o overall a lot of conflicting information for the kinetics of the reaction of hoi with h2o2 has been published however so far no agreement has been reached mainly due to the utilization of an indirect experimental approach in this study second order rate constants for the reactions of hoi with h2o2 were directly determined by measuring the hoi decrease or i formation over a wide ph range from 4 0 to 12 0 using stopped flow and batch type experiments excluding the formation and reactions of i2 this approach makes it possible to assess the importance of the reduction of hoi by h2o2 compared to its other reactions in water treatment and h2o2 containing natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and

range from 7 1 to 12 at 22 2 c initial concentrations of h2o2 were at least 4 times higher than hoi a wide range 12 16 000 μm of h2o2 solutions were prepared in different buffer solutions table s1 si hoi solutions at concentrations of 6 μm were in the same buffer solutions as the h2o2 solutions to avoid mixing problems buffered h2o2 and hoi solutions were then mixed in a 1 1 ratio to initiate the reaction and the formation of i was determined spectrophotometrically at 226 nm ε 226nm 1 36 104 m 1 cm 1 the uv spectrum of i is shown in fig s1 si the uv absorption of i was not affected by the other reactants i e h2o2 and hoi because their molar absorption coefficients at 226 nm are much lower ε 80 m 1 cm 1 and their concentrations change proportionally with i therefore the changes of the absorption at 226 nm are proportional to the relative changes of the i concentration which can be used to calculate the apparent first order rate constant the average i formation curves were calculated from at least eight replicate curves for each experimental condition pseudo first order rate constants k obs were then calculated by an exponential regression with the software kinetic

determine the second order rate constants of the reaction of hoi with h2o2 at low and neutral phs the reaction was initiated by adding a small volume 1 ml of a h2o2 stock solution 20 mm under vigorous mixing to a buffered solution 100 ml containing hoi the reaction solutions were then quenched with an abts solution after certain reaction times to measure the residual hoi concentrations pinkernell

respect to the h2o2 concentration fig s2 si k obs was calculated by an exponential regression with the software kinetic studio 2 x from the i formation curves fig s2 si and alternatively was also obtained from the slopes of the linear plots of the logarithmic relative residual concentration of hoi versus time fig s3 si the relative residual concentration of hoi was calculated from the formation of i eq 11 11 l n h o i 0 i h o i 0 k o b s t i m e the obtained k obs values for the two methods were within 7 6 figures s2 and s3 si fig s4 si shows the linearity of k obs as a function of the h2o2 concentration r2 0 999 at phs 8 and 9 the inset shows that the log k obs versus log h2o2 0 plot has as slope of 1 confirming a reaction order of one with respect to h2o2 based on this apparent second order rate constants k app were determined by dividing k obs by the corresponding initial h2o2 concentrations eq 12 the calculated k app values were 6 3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 and 3 7 105 m 1s 1 at ph 9 0 table s1 si and fig 1 and fig s4 si 12 k a p p k o b s h 2 o 2 0 for ph 7 0 the kinetics for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 did not follow pseudo first order 1 3 μm hoi in excess of h2o2 this is illustrated as an example in fig s5 si for ph 6 hoi 3 μm with excess h2o2 1 2 and 4 mm this is due to the presence of i2 leading to several competitive reactions which may have caused the wide range of reported second order rate constants for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 in the literature table 2 since i is produced during the reaction of hoi with h2o2 the i2 concentration increases with increasing formation of i in the course of the reaction especially at low ph eq 5 table 1 fig s6 si shows the speciation of i2 hoi oi depending on i concentrations 0 1 and 2 0 μm as a function of ph hoi is the major species in the neutral ph 6 9 in the presence of low concentration of i e g 0 1 μm meanwhile i2 is the major species in presence of a high concentration of i e g 2 0 μm for a ph 6 5 to exclude the effect of i 100 μm ag was added before initiating the reactions at ph 7 0 to avoid the formation of i2 see above under these conditions the decrease of hoi hoi 0 1 or 2 μm

phs 4 5 and 6 respectively 13 l n h o i h o i 0 k a p p h 2 o 2 0 t i m e 3 2 ph dependence of the second order rate constant for the reaction between hypoiodous acid and hydrogen peroxide table s1 si compiles the observed ph dependent first order rate constants k obs and apparent second order rate constants k app for the reactions of hoi with h2o2 the k app are also plotted in fig 1 for the ph range 4 12 in general the k app values increase with increasing ph which can be explained by the speciation of hoi and h2o2 pk a1 hoi oi 10 4 and pk a2 h2o2 ho2 11 8 acid base equilibria are considered to be faster than the redox reactions from a kinetic point of view the reactions in eqs 2 and 3 cannot be distinguished because they have the same ph dependence rather than considering the two reactions in parallel it is assumed that only one of the two pathways is important in the hoi h2o2 systems hoi is more electrophilic than oi and ho2 is stronger nucleophile than h2o2 therefore the reaction of hoi with ho2 eq 2 is considered the major pathway for the reaction of hoi with h2o2 the same mechanistic interpretations for the hocl h2o2 and hobr h2o2 systems are discussed in the literature held et al 1978 von gunten and oliveras 1997 meanwhile at low or high ph the reactions of hoi with h2o2 or oi with ho2 respectively can also occur therefore eqs 1 2 and 4 should be considered to determine the species specific second order rate constants the ph dependent variation in k app could be quantitatively modeled by eq 14 considering the species specific reactions between hoi oi and h2o2 ho2 14 k a p p k 1 α h o i β h 2 o 2 k 2 α h o i β h o 2 k 4 α o i β h o 2 where k 1 k 2 and k 4 are the species specific second order rate constants in eqs 1 2 and 4 respectively α hoi α oi β h2o2 and β ho2 represent the fractions of hoi oi h2o2 and ho2 respectively which at a given ph can be expressed as α hoi h h k a hoi α oi k a hoi h k a hoi β h2o2 h h k a h2o2 and β ho2 k a h2o2 h k a h2o2 with k a being the corresponding acid base equilibrium constants see table 1 the species specific second order rate constants were calculated from least squares nonlinear regressions of the experimental k app data table s1 si using the graphpad prism www graphpad com the model could fit the experimental k app well r2 0 92 the species specific second order rate constants were determined to be k 1 hoi h2o2 29 5 2 m 1s 1 k 2 hoi ho2 3 1 0 3 108 m 1s 1 k 4 oi ho2 6 4 1 4 107 m 1s 1 table 2 the error ranges for k 1 k 2 and k 4 are due to experimental variabilities and also due to the types and concentrations of the buffers the second order rate constants for the reactions of hoi with h2o2 can be applied to calculate the half life of hoi in h2o2 containing water treatment the calculations of the half life of hoi are shown in fig 1 for 10 mg l 1 h2o2 which is an intermediate high range dose applied to advanced oxidation processes aops stefan 2017 half lives for the hoi abatement in the presence of 10 mg l of h2o2 are 4 4 0 47 and 0 047 s at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively 3 3 effect of the buffer type and concentrations on the kinetics of the reactions of hoi with h2o2 previous studies have shown that buffer type and concentrations can influence the reactivity of hoi with oxidants i e ferrate vi or permanganate vii wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 or phenols zhao et al 2017 and the disproportionation of hoi bichsel and von gunten 2000b the effects of different buffers phosphate borate and acetate at different phs ph 7 3 9 0 and 4 7 on the reduction of hoi by h2o2 were investigated table s2 and figs s8 s10 si during the reaction of hoi 3 μm with h2o2 4 mm at ph 7 3 40 μm at ph 9 0 an exponential increase of i was monitored by stopped flow in the presence of various concentrations of phosphate pk a 7 2 for h2po4 goldberg et al 2002 or borate buffer pk a 9 2 goldberg et al 2002 figs s8 and s9 si at ph 4 7 the kinetics of the reactions of hoi with h2o2 follow pseudo first order in the presence of 100 μm of ag with various concentrations of acetate pk a 4 76 goldberg et al 2002 fig s10 si the rates of i formation and hence the hoi consumption increased with increasing phosphate borate and acetate concentrations this indicates that the selected buffers enhance the reaction of hoi with h2o2 among the selected buffers phosphate shows the most significant enhancement of the reactivity especially at ph 7 3 fig s11 si at ph 7 3 k app in presence of 1 25 mm phosphate buffer was 7 6 103 m 1s 1 which increased up to a factor of 4 3 for 25 mm phosphate k app 3 3 104 m 1s 1 however the effect of phosphate was less pronounced at ph 9 0 the reaction in presence of 50 mm phosphate was 1 6 times faster than without phosphate meanwhile acetate enhanced the apparent second order rate constant from 52 m 1s 1 1 mm acetate to 140 m 1s 1 25 mm acetate at ph 4 7 borate showed lower effects on the apparent second order rate constants which ranged from 2 5 105 m 1s 1 0 5 mm borate to 5 4 105 m 1s 1 25 mm borate the rate constants at zero buffer concentrations were also estimated by a linear regression based on fig s11 si the y axis intercept indicates each second order rate constant at zero buffer concentration 40 7 m 1s 1 at ph 4 7 5 6 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 3 and 2 4 105 m 1s 1 at ph 9 0 these second order rate constants are compared in fig s12 si with the determined k app fig 1 and table s1 si which were used for determining the species specific rate constants the measured k app values at 3 6 mm acetate buffer ph 4 5 at 5 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 6 8 and at 5 10 mm borate buffer ph 9 might be overestimated at most 2 4 3 2 1 7 fold respectively which is in the range of variations of experimental second order rate constants 3 4 temperature effect on the kinetics of the reduction of hoi by h2o2 the effect of temperature on the kinetics of the reaction of hoi with h2o2 was studied at 10 0 23 2 c at ph 9 0 5 mm phosphate 5 mm borate buffer fig s13 si an arrhenius plot shows good linearity r2 0 98 between the logarithm of the apparent second order rate constants and the reciprocal of the absolute temperature t eq 15 15 ln k

an e a of 34 kj mol 1 can be obtained this is significantly lower than the e a value of 125 kj mol 1 reported for the reaction of i2 with h2o2 ball and hnatiw 2001 3 5 formation of iodophenols in hoi h2o2 and phenol containing waters to evaluate the effect of h2o2 on the formation of i dbps during oxidation processes in which h2o2 is present e g o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 ferrate vi peracetic acid treatment phenol was added as a simplified surrogate for dom and the formed iodophenols were quantified as a proxy for the extent of i dbps formation the second order rate constant of the reaction of hoi with phenol is similar to the reaction of hoi with h2o2 at ph 7 i e k hoi phenol 2 6 103 m 1s 1 bichsel and von gunten 2000a and k hoi h2o2 4 9 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 this study 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol were detected during the reaction of hoi 1 μm with phenol 10 μm in the presence of varying concentrations of h2o2 0 50 μm at ph 7 0 8 mm phosphate and ph 9 0 8 mm phosphate 4 mm borate ag was added to exclude the formation and reactions of i2 a hoi concentration of 1 μm was chosen to simulate an elevated i level 130 μg l and the concentration of phenol was 10 times that of hoi 10 μm 0 94 mg l of phenol would correspond to a source water containing about 5 mgc l doc with a typical phenol content of around 20 önnby et al 2018 h2o2 is generally applied as 2 15 mg l in advanced oxidation processes stefan 2017 nevertheless relatively low concentrations of h2o2 2 mg l were applied here to evaluate the trend of iodophenol formation fig 2 shows that hoi was fully transformed to iodophenols during the reaction of hoi with phenol in the absence of h2o2 at phs 7 0 and 9 0 as expected the formation of iodophenols decreased with increasing h2o2 doses and at the maximum h2o2 concentration of about 1 7 mg l 50 μm only low concentrations of iodophenols 0 1 μm were detected due to the reduction of hoi by h2o2 to i even with these relatively low h2o2 doses a large effect on the minimization of the formation of iodophenols was observed similar levels of iodophenol formation were observed at both ph 7 0 and 9 0 this is because k app of the reaction of hoi with phenol and the reaction of hoi with h2o2 exhibit a similar ph dependency with generally increasing apparent second order rate constants with increasing ph bichsel and von gunten 2000a zhao et al 2017 the modeling results based on the reaction in table s3 si for the iodophenol formation were slightly higher than the experimental data by a factor of 1 05 1 15 at ph 7 0 and 1 1 1 3 at ph 9 0 fig 2a and b dashed lines with circles this can be considered as a good agreement given the uncertainty in the values of the second order rate constants for the involved reactions 3 6 comparison of the reactivities of h2o2 with hoi hocl and hobr fig 3 and table 2 show a comparison of the apparent and species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of h2o2 with hoi hobr and hocl respectively the species specific second order rate constants for the reaction of ho2 with hox decrease in the order hobr 7 6 108 m 1s 1 hoi 3 1 108 m 1s 1 hocl 4 4 107 m 1s 1 this sequence has also been observed for electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions of hox with phenols heeb et al 2014 based on the standard reduction potentials it would be expected that hocl has the highest reactivity however since the reaction potentially involves a x transfer to ho2 heeb et al 2014 the partial positive charge on x in hox is also important the electronegativity of the halogens decreases in the order cl br i wherefore the partial positive charge increases in the order cl br i based on this consideration hoi should have the highest reactivity to form the h o o x intermediate this species decomposes under the formation of x and singlet oxygen this reaction step is favored again by the more electrophilic halogen overall the combination of these factors then leads to the observed sequence for the species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of hox with h2o2 the only exception was observed from the reaction of ho2 with oi in the literature the reaction of ho2 with hypohalite ions obr and ocl were not considered because of the strongly reduced partial positive charge on br and cl for the hypohalite ions meanwhile the reaction of ho2 with oi was the major reaction at high ph 11 0 this may be due to the lower electronegativity of i compared to br or cl which means that there is still a significant partial positive charge on i in oi 3 7 implications for water treatment and natural systems 3 7 1 water treatment the formation of i dbps during drinking water disinfection has become an emerging concern their formation is initiated by the relatively easy oxidation of i to hoi by chemical oxidants during water treatment however most oxidants with the exception of o3 and fe vi have low reactivity with hoi which leads to the formation of i dbps by the reaction of hoi with dom in certain processes in which h2o2 is present together with a primary oxidant the reduction of hoi to i by h2o2 needs to be considered due to the significant reactivity of the two compounds a recent study showed a constant i concentration during uv h2o2 treatment in the presence of 130 μg l of i 10 mg l of h2o2 and 3 5 mg l doc at ph 7 0 zhang et al 2018 in fact in the uv h2o2 process i is oxidized to hoi through the formation of radical species i e i i2 by the rapid reaction with oh radical k 1010 m 1s 1 elliot 1992 ellison et al 1972 nagarajan and fessenden 1985 however the formed hoi will be quickly reduced to i by h2o2 as already mentioned above half lives for the hoi abatement in the presence of 10 mg l of h2o2 at neutral ph were low namely 0 5 and 0 05 s at ph 7 and 8 respectively thus uv h2o2 pre oxidation followed by chlorination or chloramination still has a risk of i dbp formation due to the remaining i in the o3 h2o2 process i is quickly oxidized to hoi k o3 i 2 0 109 m 1s 1 the resulting hypoiodous acid hoi oi has two competing reaction pathways 1 reduction to i by h2o2 k ho2 hoi 3 1 108 m 1s 1 and 2 oxidation to io3 through io2 by o3 k o3 hoi 3 6 104 m 1s 1 and k o3 oi 1 6 106 m 1s 1 reduction of hoi by h2o2 could lead to the loss of oxidation capacity of o3 by a catalytic cycle of oxidation of i by o3 and reduction of hoi by h2o2 back to i a kinetic simulation was used to calculate the relative contributions of various reactions to the o3 consumption i e catalytic oxidation of i reaction with h2o2 and further oxidation of hoi to io3 for simplicity the formation and reactions of oh were not considered in these model calculations for the selected conditions of the o3 h2o2 process 56 66 of o3 i e 11 7 13 7 μm was consumed by the catalytic oxidation of i fig s14 si rather than for the formation of oh via its reaction with h2o2 k o3 ho2 9 6 106 m 1s 1 for an elevated level of i e g 1 μm 130 μg l o3 1 mg l 20 8 μm and h2o2 4 10 mg l at ph 8 0 io3 was the dominant iodine species only during ozonation with a low concentration of h2o2 h2o2 2 mg l due to the fast reactions of o3 with i and with hoi forming io3 however significant concentrations of i could remain after complete consumption of o3 in the presence of relatively high h2o2 h2o2 2 mg l such conditions are typically applied for bromate control during the o3 h2o2 process pinkernell and von gunten 2001 soltermann et al 2017 von gunten and oliveras 1997 von gunten and oliveras 1998 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during post disinfection with chlorine or chloramine iodide can then be a precursor to i dbps therefore if both i and br are present in a source water appropriate h2o2 doses should be applied during ozonation to minimize the formation of both i dbps and bro3 peracetic acid paa is a disinfectant considered for use in ballast water and wastewater treatment luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 shah et al 2015a b werschkun et al 2014 h2o2 is always present in peracetic acid paa solutions because paa is synthesized by the reaction of acetic acid with h2o2 to evaluate the role of h2o2 during the treatment of i and br by paa in an ocean type water a kinetic simulation was performed fig s15 si shows the evolutions of hoi hobr h2o2 and paa during treatment of 0 5 μm i and 460 μm br by 2 15 mm paa in the presence of 0 65 mm h2o2 at ph 8 0 in this system i and br are oxidized to hoi and hobr by paa k paa i 4 2 102 m 1s 1 k paa br 0 24 m 1s 1 awad et al 2003 shah et al 2015a however as soon as hoi or hobr are produced they are reduced by h2o2 to i or br these reactions continued until most of the h2o2 was consumed and at the same time paa decreased to a similar extent as h2o2 for the selected conditions fig s15 si h2o2 was almost completely consumed at 20 min and i was rapidly oxidized to hoi whereas br was slowly oxidized to hobr by paa during paa treatment h2o2 can be a barrier for the formation i dbps or br dbps by minimization the lifetime of the hypohalous acids hoi and hobr however it can also lead to a rapid consumption of paa by an iodide catalyzed reaction this catalyzed reaction was also reported in a previous study shah et al 2015a h2o2 is one of the major products during the self decay of fe vi lee et al 2014 the yield of h2o2 δ h2o2 δ fe vi was 0 2 during the reaction of fe vi with i or hoi shin et al 2018 to assess the influence of h2o2 formation on the fate of iodine a kinetic simulation was performed for treatment of i by fe vi to better understand the effect of h2o2 the following simplified boundary conditions were assumed h2o2 was not produced during the fe vi reactions but was initially present as 30 of fe vi fig s16 si shows the modeling results for the evolution of hoi io3 h2o2 and fe vi during the treatment of 1 μm of i by 17 9 μm fe vi 1 mgfe l in the presence of 5 4 μm h2o2 at phs 7 0 9 0 at ph 7 0 99 of i was oxidized to io3 within 11 s by fe vi without interference of h2o2 with increasing ph from 7 0 to 9 0 the oxidation rate of i to io3 decreased this is because the rate of fe vi reaction with hoi and i decreases with increasing ph i e k fe vi hoi 1 8 105 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 and 4 7 103 m 1s 1 at ph 9 0 while the rate of hoi reduction by h2o2 to i increases overall an increase in ph led to an increase in the consumption of h2o2 and fe vi at ph 7 0 only 3 μm of fe vi was consumed to completely oxidize 1 μm i to io3 without consumption of h2o2 while at ph 9 0 8 4 μm of fe vi was consumed with a h2o2 consumption of 5 6 μm for a full oxidation of i to io3 3 7 2 natural systems o3 deposition to the seawater surface is a significant mechanism for the loss of atmospheric o3 accounting for a loss of 600 1000 tg o3 yr 1 ganzeveld et al 2009 aqueous inorganic iodine i e i hoi at the sea surface microlayer is one of the major contributors to the oceanic deposition of o3 this is based on the fast reaction between o3 gas and i which forms hoi in the aqueous phase and iodine oxide in the gaseous phase while o3 is reduced to o2 carpenter et al 2013 chang et al 2004 sarwar et al 2015 simpson et al 2015 during this reaction o3 deposition might be significantly enhanced by h2o2 due to its high reactivity with hoi to form i the concentration of h2o2 at the sea surface varies from 10 to 500 nm moore et al 1993 price et al 1998 zika et al 1985 the gas phase flux of o3 into the boundary layer can be determined by the product of the o3 deposition velocity v d and the o3 concentration o3 gas the o3 deposition velocity v d over seawater is highly variable 0 01 0 27 cm s 1 ganzeveld et al 2009 helmig et al 2012 depending on several factors in the seawater i e water quality and the atmosphere e g wind a simplified isolated kinetic modeling was performed to assess the impact of the seawater concentrations of h2o2 on the o3 deposition to the sea surface microlayer in the presence of i and br fig s17 si since the source of o3 is the atmosphere and the source of i br and h2o2 is the ocean it was assumed that the concentrations of each compound are in steady state a steady state concentration of hoi was applied instead of i since i is easily oxidized to hoi currently hoi concentrations in the seawater are unknown due to the lack of analytical techniques with sufficient accuracy and sensitivity carpenter et al 2013 considering the reported total inorganic iodine concentrations e g i and io3 of 500 nm in seawater chance et al 2014 the hoi ss was varied between 25 500 nm with increasing hoi ss o3 deposition increases si text 3 and fig s17 si in a next step the hoi ss was fixed at an intermediate concentration of 100 nm and the steady state concentrations of the other reactive species were assumed as follows o3 ss 1 nm br ss 500 μm and variable h2o2 ss 0 10 25 100 250 500 nm virtual reaction products as tracers i e p1 p2 p7 in table s4 si were quantified by kintecus modeling to obtain the relative contributions of the various reactions to o3 consumption reactions 1 7 in table s4 si 1 oxidation of i was obtained from p3 2 oxidation of br was obtained from p7 and 3 oxidation of hoi to io3 was determined by the summation of p4 p5 and p6 the reaction system reached steady state within a few seconds however one year of modeling time was applied to obtain the total yearly o3 deposition as the h2o2 concentration is increasing the o3 consumption for the oxidation of i becomes increasingly important compared to the reaction with bromide which dominates at low h2o2 concentrations fig s18a si the contribution of the catalytic oxidation of i for the o3 consumptions increased from 36 to 97 for an increase of h2o2 from 10 nm to 500 nm fig s18a si for all selected h2o2 concentrations the consumption of o3 by the oxidation of hoi to io3 was insignificant 10 compared to the o3 consumption for the oxidation of i or br in this kinetic modeling the concentration of i reached steady state within a few seconds fig s18b si shows that the resulting steady state concentration of i i ss and the total o3 consumptions over 1 year depend on the initial h2o2 ss according to kinetic modeling results the i ss increased linearly with increasing h2o2 concentrations 0 500 nm as a consequence the total o3 deposition rate increased proportionally 2 8 82 1 mm per year if these results are combined with variable hoi ss the total o3 deposition ranges from 3 6 mm 25 nm hoi 25 nm h2o2 to 400 mm 500 nm hoi 500 nm h2o2 per year accounting for the area of the sea surface microlayer 3 5 108 km2 costello et al 2010 and setting the depth of the boundary layer to 100 μm an o3 deposition rate of 6 2 400 tg year can be calculated depending on the hoi 25 500 nm and the h2o2 concentrations 0 500 nm depending on the boundary conditions this deposition rate is about two orders of magnitude lower or in the same range as current estimates see above therefore our simplified estimate shows that h2o2 may have a high potential to increase the o3 deposition by the catalytic oxidation of i at the sea surface which might warrant an inclusion of these reactions to calculate o3 deposition in future modeling efforts the reduction of hoi by h2o2 can also occur in atmospheric waters which may lead to a reduction of the o3 levels in the troposphere pillar et al 2013 4 conclusions apparent and species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of hydrogen peroxide with hypoiodous acid were determined and the main conclusions are as follows the reaction between hoi and h2o2 is a second order process the species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of h2o2 with hoi ho2 with hoi ho2 with oi are k h2o2 hoi 29 5 2 m 1s 1 k ho2 hoi 3 1 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 and k ho2 oi 6 4 1 4 107 m 1s 1 respectively phosphate 1 25 25 mm and acetate 1 25 mm buffers lead to a significant enhancement of the h2o2 hoi reactivity at ph 7 3 by a factor of 4 and at ph 4 7 by a factor of 3 respectively meanwhile borate 0 5 25 mm buffer showed a moderate effect a factor of 2 on the h2o2 hoi reactivity at ph 9 0 the activation energy for the reaction between hoi and h2o2 is e a 34 kj mol 1 the formation of i dbps in a model system could be significantly reduced by addition of relatively low concentrations of h2o2 to hoi and phenol containing solutions the species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of ho2 with hox increased in the order of hocl hoi hobr oxidative water treatment of iodide containing water in presence of h2o2 can lead to a reduced formation of i dbps by minimizing the lifetime of hoi however due to the remaining i h2o2 based pre oxidation e g uv h2o2 followed by chlorination or chloramination may still have a risk of i dbp formation o3 deposition by the oxidation of i on the seawater surface can be significantly enhanced in presence of h2o2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
