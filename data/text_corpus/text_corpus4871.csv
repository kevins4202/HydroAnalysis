24355,materials and energy consumed by urban systems are one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions measuring these flows and their associated emissions is necessary to estimate the impact of cities on climate change in the future in this research we developed a dynamic model for measuring the carbon footprint of cities urban metabolism using an integrated socio ecological systems approach illustrated with a case study in montreal we modelled the urban carbon footprint between 2000 and 2018 and simulated on to 2030 under four scenarios baseline increasing adoption of plant based diets pbd pavement road material circularity pmc and a combined approach of the latter two by simultaneously modelling montreal s population growth the ghg per capita trend was compared to the anticipated 2030 global threshold of 2 9 t co2e per person needed to meet the 1 5 c paris agreement target all scenarios result in decreased per capita emissions from 15 0 t co2e capita in 2018 in part due to the increasing urban population the baseline scenario estimates a decrease to 12 7 t co2e by 2030 the pbd and pmc scenarios estimate respective reductions to 10 8 and 12 4 t co2e capita by 2030 the combined scenario estimates a greater reduction to 10 5 t co2e capita but this is still 7 6 t co2e capita over the paris agreement target for 1 5 c global warming graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction human activities have already increased earth s average temperature by an estimated 1 c since preindustrial times this is expected to increase to 1 5 c between 2030 and 2052 under business as usual projections ipcc 2018 spatial variation in global warming means some regions will suffer more adverse and extreme climate impacts such as parts of canada warren 2014 the majority of activities generating the ghgs responsible for global warming are associated with urban living efforts to mitigate the causes and adapt to the impacts of climate change have been addressed in numerous global fora including cop21 in paris france 2015 this resulted in the ratification of the paris agreement currently ratified by 191 parties out of 197 the aim of the agreement is to limit global temperature increases article 2 of the agreement declares a maximum of 2 c warming from preindustrial times with a preferred limit of 1 5 c article 4 of the agreement details how the signatories aim to achieve this limit by reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions ghgs and increasing carbon sinks the 1 5 c warming limit equates to approximately 25 gt co2 equivalent per year by 2030 rogelj et al 2018 in 2019 43 1 gt co2e were released by human activities friedlingstein et al 2019 and projections indicate 55 gt co2e per year by 2030 unfccc 2015 by 2030 global population is projected to reach 8 5 billion people united nations 2019 with the cap of 25 gt co2e per year in 2030 the average contribution would need to be no more than 2 9 t co2e per person per year policy continues to be implemented aligned with decarbonisation to meet the paris agreement commitments for a 1 5 c global average temperature increase these policies are implemented at national provincial and city levels and tend to focus on direct emissions i e territorial ghg accounting ignoring upstream emissions that may not occur within the given territory elliot babí almenar rugani 2020 these policies typically focus on electrification of the transport sector and building energy which are known to be large sources of ghgs however large portions of the urban carbon footprint are embedded in resources that have little to no direct ghg emissions within the city and are thus often overlooked in ghg mitigation policies for example we know food cement and textiles generate large amounts of ghgs during the upstream stages of their supply chains poore nemecek 2018 zhang et al 2014 typically occurring in remote areas before being transported to the city to begin their use phase goldstein rasmussen 2018 this research hypothesises that the fervent focus on decarbonizing urban energy use contributes to an increase in ghgs exterior to the city and potentially increasing other types of environmental damage we test this hypothesis by exploring the resource flows in a case city and simulating the demand for those flows in the future and by linking those flows to life cycle emission factors distinguishing between their upstream and use phase impacts we then develop scenarios to illustrate the types of mitigation policies that would additionally reduce the embodied ghgs generated by cities one area of novelty in this research is the way in which we approach urban scope 2 and 3 ghgs with respect to sustainable urban planning scope 2 emissions are generated by activities that use electricity and scope 3 emissions are generated by upstream extractive and manufacturing activities hertwich wood 2018 in both cases these emissions typically occur outside the city limits efforts to integrate more systemic analytical frameworks have been heralded by a number of field experts for example pincetl bunje and holmes 2012 argued for a wider view of urban sustainability encompassing life cycle thinking political economy political ecology and ecosystem service assessments more recently a review by beloin saint pierre et al 2017 put forth a roadmap listing the types of model required for certain urban metabolism problems including system dynamics life cycle thinking and ecological network analysis these show a trend to understanding the complexity underlying indirect global impacts of cities a small number of methods have been developed to this end such as ecological footprint moore kissinger rees 2013 rees 1992 the um lca goldstein birkved quitzau hauschild 2013 and estimum elliot et al 2022 ecological footprint captures the combined land use and carbon footprint of a city into a single indicator this is useful for communicating the appropriated land area and carbon sink deficits of urban systems but is not tailored to the non linear dynamics needed for meeting future policy targets and mitigating trade offs between different impacts um lca uses a material and energy flow analysis extended by life cycle impact assessment to capture the array of impacts from different impact categories and distinguish between the direct urban level and indirect rest of world this method allows for an advanced analysis of trade offs between impact categories such as global warming potential and water depletion which may be competing objectives in developing urban sustainability policies this method is not predictive instead providing a barometer of the contemporary impacts related to the breadth of material and energy resource demands in a city estimum applies the um lca concept of distinguishing local and global impacts in multiple impacts categories to urban ecosystem service assessments it uses system dynamics to simulate future scenarios of trade offs but measures these in ecosystem service groups such as global climate regulation and global habitat maintenance it is limited in its spatial resolution of global impacts providing a binary urban global output of the location of cities impacts literature suggests better understanding is needed on dynamics between urban consumption and their remote impacts as well as the trade offs between different impact categories with cities becoming larger and hungrier for resources this understanding is necessary to develop robust and comprehensive sustainable urban plans for the 1 5 c degree global warming limit while minimising impacts to other important challenges such as water security rugani almenar elliot 2020 secondly this research advances the state of the art on integration of social contagion theory and environmental modelling little has been published on the intersection of these two disciplines a growing body of research purports the need to consider social tipping points to affect climate futures moser dilling 2007 russill nyssa 2009 but these are largely theoretical models as the concepts are a highly novel and b highly complex lenton 2014 otto et al 2020 social contagion theory which applies epidemiological modelling to social networks hodas lerman 2014 has been applied to the acceptance of solar photovoltaics baranzini carattini péclat 2017 ongoing work lays the path between changes in societal consumption at regional levels and the global paris agreement commitments liu raftery 2021 yet the vastly complex realm intersecting environmental modelling and paris agreement commitments remains wide open a gap that has been only approached theoretically from the social tipping points perspective this paper posits that social contagion theory may be useful to leverage climate social tipping points and thus mobilise society towards meeting global warming objectives in lieu of underwhelming political frameworks the structure of this paper follows a description of the method including definitions of scope and system boundary the modules in the integrated modelling framework and their respective assumptions data sources and equations the validation procedure and statistics and finally scenario development thereafter results are reported and discussed before recommendations and conclusions to promote a more systems thinking way of devising sustainable urban plans aligned to the paris agreement commitments 2 method 2 1 scope and system boundary we modelled montreal s carbon footprint between 2000 and 2018 against observed values and projected out to 2030 including ratified and anticipated policy changes that will affect the city s material and energy flows montreal is the largest city in the province of quebec and the second most populous city in canada it lies on an island in the saint lawrence river whose land area covers 497 km2 some of which belongs to independent municipalities collectively the cities occupying the island are referred to as the agglomeration of montreal this case study applies to the agglomeration of montreal rather than the city proper for ease of data acquisition and because the functionality of the city is not delineated by the municipal boundaries hereafter we refer to the agglomeration of montreal simply as montreal for readability 2 2 model framework the life cycle extended urban material energy flow model is based on the concept of coupled human and nature systems models hackenhaar babí almenar elliot rugani 2022 peng du liu hu 2016 it is a system dynamics model engineered in simile www simulistics com the model is composed of urban resource modules which simulate the per capita consumption of food electricity fossil fuels water construction materials and the generation of waste flows from those resources using population dynamics as a basis shifts to age and wealth cohorts over time influence the resource demands of the city for example younger people have different needs compared to older people while wealthier people have higher purchase power and appetite for luxury and more elastic consumerism the model works on a 1 year time step over time not only does the number of consumers change but so too do the types of consumers the environmental impacts of the simulated resource flows are estimated in two steps the upstream cradle to gate impacts are calculated using life cycle emission factors these are taken from ecoinvent wernet et al 2016 or literature where more appropriate and represent the impacts occurring outside the city rest of world row these impacts were calculated for the impact category gwp100 using the recipe 2016 mid point hierarchist method huijbregts et al 2017 the use phase impacts are estimated for urban processes such as tailpipe and flue emissions from burning fossil fuels in the city using direct emissions factors taken from the intergovernmental panel on climate change s emission factor database ipcc 2006 or literature where more appropriate these urban impacts are calculated as the product of each energy carrier s combustion emission factor and the amount of that energy carrier used in the year these combustion emission factors are taken from the ipcc efdb ipcc 2006 the overview of this framework is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 1 population dynamics population is one of the key drivers of the urban metabolism and thus the associated environmental impacts elliot rugani almenar niza 2018 moreover the age structure of the population influences the types of resources and activities the population engages with the population is therefore modelled in eight age cohorts whose members graduate to the next cohort until death death may occur during any cohort membership but the mortality rate of each cohort differs to reflect reality babies are born into the youngest age cohort but new immigrants also enter at each cohort it is assumed only the middle age cohort reproduces in the case of montreal fertility mortality and net immigration rates by age are taken from institut de la statistique du québec 2021c institut de la statistique du québec 2021a and statistics canada 2017a respectively immigration is calculated as the mean average between 2007 and 2017 initial population count for 2000 is taken from institut de la statistique du québec 2021b these values are shown in table 1 2 2 2 commercial and institutional energy dynamics the commercial and institutional module considers nine sectors wholesale trade retail trade offices health education information hospitality arts and storage each sector has different energy end uses among the nine sectors there are six energy end uses using a mix of three energy carriers electricity natural gas and fuel oil as shown in table 2 several dynamic cause effect relationships are used in this model the activity of the sectors change over time changes to wholesale retail offices information hospitality arts and storage activities are influenced by the economic productivity of the city modelled by gdp forecasts changes to health and education services are influenced by population changes using the population module described in section 2 2 1 historic urban energy flows are estimated by disaggregating provincial quebec energy data by the respective activity indicator either gdp or population these data provide the basis for model validation described below in section 2 3 the ghg emissions of each commercial and institutional sector is estimated from the energy demand of the activities subject to the type of energy used for those activities each energy end use has a specific emission factor the emission factors change as the city s technology stocks change technologies change over time due to policy interventions aimed at reducing the urban carbon footprint for example in montreal fuel oil combustion is to be phased out in the city by 2025 thus the fuel oil based technologies will be phased out and replaced by natural gas and electric technology based on the end use requirements for time steps between the announcement of a phase out policy and the phase out deadline the demand for the phasing out technology decreases as the phase out date approaches that technology will become less available meanwhile economies of scale will make the emerging technologies progressively cheaper however counteracting the changing of preferences is the changing of overall demand as population and economic production change presumed to increase within the modelled time horizon thus the demand for a certain activity might increase while the incumbent fuel technology is undergoing a phase out the model deals with this by setting a fuel use ceiling equal to the fuel consumption at the time of the policy announcement meanwhile energy intensity is determined by regression on energy end use over time which allows for trends in technological efficiency gains 2 2 3 transport dynamics the transport module considers freight and passenger movements the passenger part deals with the interaction of three different passenger transport modes light private vehicles lpv buses and light passenger rail aviation is included but does not interact directly with demand for the other passenger modes as they are not substitutable aviation is influenced by population growth alone demand for lpv bus and rail mobility is measured as passenger kilometres travelled pkts pkt for a given year is calculated as the product of the number of cars in use the load factor and the average kilometers driven per vehicle per year as used in the comprehensive energy use database nrcan 2020 load factor is the number of occupied seats divided by the number of available seats lpvs are assumed to have five available seats while buses have 50 lpv and bus load factor increases over time in quebec and we assume this holds true for montreal nrcan 2020 the total demand for passenger mobility is determined from observed historical relationship between population and pkts in quebec which was sourced from nrcan 2020 pkt demand can be supplied by buses lpv and bicycles the model shares the supply on the basis of what we refer to as loaded seats loaded seats are determined by multiplying the fleet by the seats per vehicle by the average load factor of a vehicle it is assumed the number of seats per vehicle does not change but the fleet is influenced by population and policy decisions load factor also changes and this is modelled according to the rate of change observed historically nrcan 2020 for every time step the model calculates the demand for mobility pkts and the loaded seats for lpvs buses and rail and apportions the mobility supply accordingly the lpv fleet changes over time the model considers three types of lpv standard internal combustion engine cars henceforth simply cars light passenger trucks lpts such as special utility vehicles also with internal combustion engines and electric cars ecs cars and lpts run on petroleum although the model has flexibility to include diesel and other fossil fuels other time the fleet changes according to a sigmoidal growth curve regression which assumes growing preference for lpts with waning preference for cars until the implementation of policy restrictions on fossil combusting vehicles in the case study of montreal fossil combusting private vehicles will not be sold after 2035 thus all fleet renewal after 2035 will be ecs similarly the bus fleet changes over time three types of bus are considered diesel buses hybrid diesel electric buses and electric buses these are assumed to have lifespans of around 800 000 kms as bus kilometres increase with their utilization buses are more rapidly retired and the fleet is renewed in this dynamic way in the case of montreal it is anticipated that diesel buses will no longer be purchased by the bus operator from 2025 meanwhile a combination of diesel hybrid and electric buses enter the fleet but thereafter only electric buses will be purchased the attributes used to model the vehicle fleets are shown in table 3 the petroleum diesel and electricity used by the collective fleets are summed in petajoules at each year the direct impacts are calculated depending on the fuel type and the mode in which it is used these impacts constitute the urban impacts the row impacts are calculated for each year as sum of the product of additions to the fleet and the system process emission factor for that type of vehicle and adding the product and the product of fuel imports and the system process emission factor for that type of fuel put another way all the fuel and vehicles entering the city each year contribute to row impacts while the combustion of those fuels contributes to the urban impacts the input data for the transport dynamics covering lpv bus and rail between 2000 2018 are available in supplementary table 1 a c the freight transport module includes only truck movements which accounted for more than 95 of quebec s freight energy use in 2018 nrcan 2020 demand for freight transport is influenced positively by urban gdp 2 2 4 residential energy dynamics the residential energy module includes the energy used in peoples homes transport energy is captured in the previous section energy is used in the residential sector by five end use categories space heating systems shs water heating systems whs appliances lighting and space cooling systems scs the types of energy used for the residential activities are shown in table 4 the energy used by these categories is modelled by first modelling the stock of those systems in this sense the stock is the city s inventory of each heating system the type of shs in a dwelling determines the fuel type and the energy efficiency as a system reaches the end of its lifespan it is replaced by either a new and more modern version of that system or it might be replaced by a different technology this is determined by market availability which is in this model influenced by implementations such as government regulation for example when it is announced that a technology will be phased out no new systems with that technology will be installed and those already in existence will run the course of their normal life before being replaced by a different technology the new shs installments are estimated as the sum of new dwellings and shs needing to be replaced multiplied by a vector of preferences for each of the possible shs types the number of new dwellings is estimated as half the number of new adults in the population the systems phased out is estimated as the ratio of stock to life expectancy for each system type estimates of system longevity are taken from tonkens 2020 the initial preference vector is calculated as the distribution of shs in 2000 in quebec the preferences adding to one each year after any shs that has been phased out e g heating oil boilers is set to zero in the preference vector and its value in the previous time step is shared between the remaining allowable shs types such as heat pumps space cooling involves some additional influential variables each of which are themselves dynamic average floor area of a dwelling influences demand for space cooling energy floor area of new dwellings is influenced by changes in personal wealth in this model we estimate the gdp and population at each time step creating a variable of gdp per capita the natural logarithm of the delta of these values is correlated to floor area of newly built dwellings the average floor area in a given year is the sum of floor area over all existing and new dwellings divided by the number of all existing and new dwellings meanwhile energy efficiency of scs is estimated by linear regression of observed values over time in quebec this assumes efficiency of quebec scs are representative of montreal room scs have a maximum efficiency of 12 while floor scs can reach 13 efficiency nrcan 2020 the weighted average of room and floor scs is calculated to do this the number of new scs units is estimated using a sigmoidal growth curve fitted to the observed preference to install new scs in quebec finally the cooling degree day cdd index which gradually increases linearly within the time period also influences energy used to cool dwellings this variable acknowledges warming of temperatures over time the energy use by scs is calculated by multi linear regression of observed energy use for scs on cdd index cooled floor area and weighted energy efficiency which has an adjusted r squared of 0 9236 2 2 5 material flow dynamics the flow rate of the materials is taken from vega azamar glaus hausler oropeza garcía and romero lópez 2013 whose emergy footprint of montreal reported an inventory of flow rates for the year 2005 while these single point data are old we assume these materials to be driven by infrastructure maintenance and largely consistent year on year due to lack of time series data to inform temporal dynamics we have extrapolated the 2005 data using montreal s gdp time series each of the material resources is linked to a global warming potential emission factor as described in section 2 2 2 2 6 water the water module considers residential and commercial water use residential water use is modelled per capita and thus linked to population change this is considered inelastic and the value is taken from rasifaghihi li and haghighat 2020 however this portion of water makes up approximately a thousandth of the urban water use in the case of montreal vega azamar et al 2013 for the most part water is consumed by the commercial and institutional sectors and water use changes therein are linked to economic productivity environmental impacts of water are taken from ecoinvent as 0 0002 kg co2e per kg of municipal tap water in quebec specifically 2 2 7 food the food module uses average consumption data per person the data used in the montreal case are taken from health canada 2018 average amounts of different foods are consumed in different quantities by different age groups the list of foods for each age group is given in supplementary table 2 as the age structure of the population changes so too does the food consumption profile of the city the total food consumption of the city is calculated for each year and the environmental impact is calculated as the sum of products of mass of each food type and the emission factor for each food type the emission factors are taken from poore and nemecek 2018 or ecoinvent wernet et al 2016 where appropriate emission factors for the remaining food types were supplemented from literature including pasta recchia cappelli cini garbati pegna boncinelli 2019 mushroom robinson winans kendall dlott dlott 2018 ice cream konstantas stamford azapagic 2019 baby food sieti schmidt rivera stamford azapagic 2019 confectionary miah et al 2018 soft drinks amienyo gujba stichnothe azapagic 2013 game meat fiala et al 2020 and margarine and shortening nilsson et al 2010 upstream food waste is captured in the emission factors however end of life food waste is not this is estimated using the end of life wastage per tonne of food consumed in canada gooch et al 2019 canadians consume 25 million tonnes of food annually of which 33 is wasted at or after the consumer gooch et al 2019 wastage occurs at different rates between types of food the waste of each food group is shown in table 5 below per tonne of food at consumer market 2 3 validation the model s validation period is 2000 to 2018 the simulated values are validated on historical material and energy flow data per capita the correlation coefficients for the response variables are shown in supplementary table 3 the correlation coefficients are used to calculate the standard error of forecast to demonstrate levels of confidence in simulated values for the forecast period 2019 2030 in section 3 2 4 principles of social contagion for socio ecological systems social contagion is the phenomenon of the spread of cultural spiritual ideological and political belief systems through social networks christakis fowler 2013 social contagion theory can be applied to study the spread of environmental decision making when a belief system spreads through a community it can become endemic or it can be short lived depending on the reproduction rate of the belief system and the recovery rate christakis fowler 2013 this in turn may affect economic choices and therefor has consequences for the environmental impacts of that community in the case of veganism which is the exclusion of animal products as far as practically possible there are consequences for the foodprint goldstein birkved fernández hauschild 2017 as veganism and the wider plant based trend is reproduced between agents in the community the proportion of food coming from animal sources decreases a large body of evidence already exists to show the environmental benefits associated with reducing animal based foods in our diets lynch johnston wharton 2018 poore nemecek 2018 as discussed by elliot 2022 this presents an opportunity to remove barriers to the reproduction rate in order to meaningfully reduce a city s foodprint this may be useful in the study of urban carbon metabolism as it can be used to test scenarios for future dietary change in a city and thus the inflow of food products and their associated remote environment impacts e g methane during farm activities this calculation involves two main cohorts the vegan cohort and the non vegan cohort agents move between these cohorts subject to their contact with members of the opposing cohort this movement is calculated using a dynamic reproduction rate number of people a vegan influences to join the vegan cohort within one time step a fixation rate proportion of those influenced who remain part of the vegan cohort for more than one time step furthermore these rates are influenced by the status quo a variable defined as the ratio of non vegans to the total population a scenario is developed and described in section 2 5 using the social contagion theory to test the environmental performance of montreal subject to shifts away from animal based foods 2 5 scenario development scenarios were developed to show how the model could be used to help decision makers analyse the impact of different potential mitigation actions the model discussed to this point described a baseline scenario the baseline scenario establishes a gap in montreal s future ghgs compared to the 1 5 c warming benchmark two alternative exploratory scenarios are subsequently developed to determine the scale of change needed to meet the 1 5 c warming benchmark a third scenario combines these two exploratory scenarios to show their additive effects each scenario investigates an important aspect of resource use in montreal determined by the rank of most ghg intensive activities under the baseline scenario the three scenarios are defined below more details on each of the scenario attributes can be found in supplementary table 4 2 5 1 pavement material circularity pmc the pavement material circularity pmc scenario is narrow in scope as the possibilities for resources circularity are almost limitless while at the same time each unique in how a city might adopt such principles this scenario deals with circularisation of road materials which is easily the largest solid mass flow water is an order of magnitude greater road construction and maintenance are also large end uses of materials in montreal virgin gravel and virgin bitumen are the main components of montreal s road pavements cold recycling of used road aggregate in bitumen emulsion mix is a method by which virgin materials are substituted by in situ reforming of the pavement with the old pavement hypothetically this may result in no demand for virgin aggregate and much reduced demand for bitumen which is the basis of this scenario under the baseline scenario 1 km of road resurfacing requires 655 t virgin aggregate and 23 t virgin bitumen under the cold recycling scenario 1 km of road resurfacing requires 6 t virgin bitumen for the emulsion mixture and 46 t water estimated based on nrcan 2005 thus for every tonne of virgin aggregate substituted a net saving of 0 0252 t of virgin bitumen is realised while an increase of 0 0573 t of water use road resurfacing rate was assumed based on montreal s annual demand of bitumen and it was assumed that all bitumen was used for roading 2 5 2 plant based diets pbd this scenario pertains to replacing animal based foods with plant based foods it is known that plant based foods typically generate fewer ghgs than their equivalent animal based foods poore nemecek 2018 the dietary change assumes two diet profiles standard canadian omnivore diet and plant based diet the standard canadian omnivore diet scod is similar to the standard canadian diet used in the business as usual scenario but each specifically plant based food type is set to zero grams per day each animal based food type is set to the eater value of grams per day rather than the population mean value health canada 2018 the plant based diet pbd uses the standard canadian diet as a basis each animal based product is set to zero grams per day each specifically plant based food value is calculated as the product of its calorific value and the sum of animal based foods it substitutes in this way both dietary profiles provide the same calories which is 2251 per day the model calculates a dietary profile for the city at each time step weighted by the number of adherents to each dietary programme the number of adherents is calculated using social contagion theory with a reproduction value r value which allows for an exponential uptake in pbd population as the diet becomes more contagious pbd population is then treated as fixed based on a fixation rate which determines the ratio who will remain on the pbd the remainder switch back to the scod r value and fixation rate for each age cohort were set at 1 and 0 75 respectively this is the combination for which the ghg capita plateaus toward the lower limit sensitivity analysis of r and f on ghg capita is available in supplementary table 5 reproduced from elliot 2022 initial pbd population in montreal is set at 2 3 based on a 2018 survey by charlebois somogyi and music 2018 the percent of pbd immigrants is set at 2 7 based on a global estimate by the economist 2019 3 results 3 1 business as usual table 6 below shows the average annual and cumulative ghgs for each urban activity for the historic period and the forecast period the activities are ranked by percentage contribution to the ghgs in 2030 food is anticipated to generate the highest portion of montreal s ghgs in 2030 which is an increase both in relative and in absolute terms compared to 2000 important absolute reductions are anticipated in the commercial institutional sectors due to electrification in contrast activities whose demands are less elastic food water construction and activities whose impacts are not influenced by montreal s electrification plans consumable materials are expected to be relatively stable and therefore increase their share of urban emissions in order to meet the paris agreement limit of 1 5 c global warming since preindustrial temperature the global citizen may generate 2 9 t co2e per person in 2030 rogelj et al 2018 as it stood in 2018 montreal s population generated around 15 t co2e per person and the projection of both ghgs and population lead to 12 7 t per person in 2030 this result takes into account the local policies for electrification and energy decarbonisation and yet it is still more than four times the average required to meet the 1 5 c warming limit results from this business as usual scenario show that by 2030 an increasing portion of montreal s carbon footprint is associated with remote activities 80 and the bulk of that 66 is linked to food and materials consumed in the city the ghgs from food alone in 2030 equate to 3 9 t co2e capita therefore it is of paramount importance to address the indirect scope 3 ghgs when considering the urban carbon footprint if we expect cities to contribute to limiting global anthropogenic ghgs the following scenarios are developed based on possible policies that would mitigate scope 3 ghgs from the city s food and material flows it must be noted that comparisons of per capita emissions should be made cautiously due to this model omitting some minor sectors in reality the difference between actual emissions and targets is expected to be even higher than estimated here based on the average ghg allowance per capita in 2030 needed to reach the 1 5 c warming limit montreal needs to reach 7 0 mt co2e yr by 2030 a 77 reduction from the projected value of 30 9 shown in table 7 this figure is in line with similar regional reduction analyses liu raftery 2021 3 2 mitigation scenarios results are given for three mitigation scenarios and the baseline case as illustrated in fig 2 in 2018 montreal was responsible for 30 4 mt co2e total emissions the highest observed up from 27 4 mt in 2000 the baseline case is estimated to generate 30 9 mt co2e by 2030 showing the continued increase over each year in spite of the rollout of already confirmed climate policies over the forecasted period the portion of emissions occurring within the city is expected to amount to 22 reaching only 20 by 2030 this decrease in local emissions is largely due to the electrification of transport and building energy over the coming years the pbd scenario results in a downward shift to 26 2 mt co2e in 2030 of which 23 6 is expected to occur within montreal fig 2 shows rapid decrease in montreal s per capita ghgs from 2023 under the pbd scenario only 5 years into the simulation the pmc scenario estimates 30 1 mt co2e emitted in 2030 of which 22 8 is expected to occur within montreal the pmc scenario like the baseline scenario shows a continued increase in absolute ghg emissions in spite of the climate policies already scheduled over the coming decade the combined scenario pbd and pmc results in 25 4 mt co2e in 2030 of which 24 2 is expected to occur within montreal as shown in fig 2 the modelled scenarios show montreal s per capita emissions decrease steadily from 14 9 t co2e in 2000 to 13 8 t co2e in 2018 the baseline scenario predicts a further fall to 12 7 t co2e by 2030 a 9 8 t co2e capita overshoot from the 2 9 t co2e capita required to meet the 1 5 c paris agreement the pbd and pmc scenarios estimate reductions to 10 8 and 12 4 t co2e capita by 2030 respectively the combined scenario which estimates the largest absolute emissions reduction by 2030 predicts a further drop to 10 5 t co2e capita but this is still 7 6 t co2e capita over the paris agreement target for 1 5 c global warming this is shown by the dark red lines in fig 2 a d 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic urban metabolism in context application of the broad urban metabolism metaphor can be split into social urban metabolism material energy flow analysis and ecosystem metabolism newell cousins 2014 the concept was coined by karl marx in the context of social metabolism and later became a useful metaphor for material and energy flows the latter ecosystem metabolism has grown with the development of ecosystem service research and landscape and urban ecology while all three schools harness the metabolism metaphor thereby alluding to the consumption and waste aspects of social ecological systems they have existed in research silos rugani babí almenar elliot othoniel 2021 the model builds on earlier work at the intersection of social material energy and ecosystem flows elliot et al 2022 rugani et al 2020 this model which is novel in so far as it accounts for feedback loops between social ecological and economic systems reinforces the findings of existing comparable urban carbon assessment frameworks firstly such dynamic models are not available due to the high degree of novelty in dynamic urban forecasting models beloin saint pierre et al 2017 however retrospective urban metabolism studies are useful to understand the relative magnitude of direct versus indirect impacts the sectors they belong to and the size of impacts per capita the comparable study by goldstein et al 2013 developed the um lca method and thus compared the life cycle extended urban metabolism footprint of five cities they calculated the carbon footprint for greater toronto area at 16 6 t co2e person based on data from 1999 compared with the 14 9 t co2e person we identified for montreal in 2000 the 10 lower per capita carbon footprint in montreal is likely due to several reasons most importantly montreal and toronto have very different electricity mixes montreal s supply of electricity is one of the least carbon intensive electricity grids in the world the quebec electricity mix is one of the least ghg intensive in the world at 0 01188 kg co2e kwh while the ontario electricity mix is more than eight times more carbon intensive wernet et al 2016 additionally montreal agglomeration is a denser urban system than greater toronto area and as such we expect our results to be lower the former does not include border cities of laval and longueil while the latter includes four regional municipalities in addition to the toronto city statistics canada 2017b goldstein et al 2013 s study stopped short of analysing the carbon reduction potential of regulations however the subsequent study by elliot et al 2020 illustrated the historic influence of portugal and europe s policies on lisbon s energy related ghgs especially local ghgs while the influence was not enough for hopes of urban climate neutrality the results indicated the potential for demand side implementations when considering the wider urban metabolism including material flows the potential for demand side approaches also has potential for mitigating remote ghgs comparing the present study to said lisbon study we can conclude that implementations need to happen at both the consumer and producer ends of supply chains to effectively tackle urban carbon footprint challenges with this in mind this approach using system dynamics modelling to link social and ecological variables with policy suites contributes to the design of systems thinking climate mitigation plans by coupling socio ecological dynamics and accounting for the reinforcing effects of those dynamics 4 2 social contagion and climate change mitigation contagion theory has been used in sociology to demonstrate that environmental movements can be levered towards social tipping points vegan social movements eker reese obersteiner 2019 in social media barrios o neill 2021 and the uptake of solar panels baranzini et al 2017 it has not been applied to ideological movements such as veganism and how that can have co benefits for environmental impact reduction such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions application of social contagion of plant based diets in this paper shows a marked reduction in the foodprint of montreal over the next decade which is expected to increase as plant based and other lower carbon diets become more socially contagious in order to foster social contagion barriers should be removed from low carbon consumer decisions such as making plant based food choices available supporting social contagion of low carbon diets and environmentally less damaging food systems in general is known to have high potential for urban ghg reduction dorr goldstein horvath aubry gabrielle 2021 which in turn has been shown to have powerful influence on global food production systems chen long fath chen 2020 poore nemecek 2018 while our paper shows the strong potential for consumer food choices to reduce the urban foodprint incentivising such a movement is undermined by lack of political will goldstein et al 2017 there is however a convincing argument for policy aiming at increasing social contagion to reduce montreal s carbon footprint as demonstrated by elliot 2022 sensitivity of ghgs to changes in social contagion parameters is highly dependent on the reproduction rate r thus even positive nudging in government campaigns may induce rapid social contagion and diet related ghg reductions a second and more tangible challenge is the transfer of scientifically robust product information to the consumer ridoutt hendrie noakes 2017 life cycle assessment provides standardised methods for environmental product declarations epds which can be used to guide consumer purchasing decisions away from high carbon food assuming the consumer subscribes to this objective notarnicola et al 2017 however epds are optional and thus usually used by manufacturers to market their low carbon products rather than the other way around increasing the use of epds on carbon intensive food products may remove a barrier in the social contagion of plant based diets without the need for implementing restrictive and paternalistic policy goldstein et al 2017 4 3 circular economy and climate mitigation results show high potential to reduce embodied ghgs from urban material flows the pmc scenario limited to bitumen and aggregate in road construction mitigated 2 of the urban material ghg footprint this is a small part of montreal s carbon footprint but considering the circularisation only considers pavement materials the reason for exploring only the ghg reduction potential of pavement circularity is because the process of cold in situ recycling is already used in canada and is therefore a realistic area for change more broadly the construction sector is known to be a significant source of demolition waste and in europe contributes a third of ghg emissions gallego schmid chen sharmina mendoza 2020 there is potential to reduce ghgs by addressing other sectors such as food waste a recent review paper across a broader range of material flows found that between 30 50 of the footprint could be reduced gallego schmid et al 2020 these results provide a case for a generalised urban ghg reduction plan including aspects of circular material flows while only some flows may be appropriate for ghg mitigation plans it has also been shown by lidicker sathaye madanat and horvath 2013 that pavement resurfacing policy has an important role to play in life cycle ghgs of cities while nußholz nygaard rasmussen and milios 2019 described the potential of circular building materials to reduce a city s carbon footprint and went on to argue for innovation and urban policy with this in view davidescu apostu and paul 2020 promoted an umbrella urban circular economy and the role of urbanites in activating such a movement this ties nicely to the other ghg mitigation scenario presented in this present paper using socio ecological contagion to foster plant based foods replacing animal based foods it is already known that boycotting single use material flows can be achieved through nudging with information campaigns large infrastructure may not be in this category but the high ghg intensive flows such as textiles steel and cement could be considered in an urban wide ghg mitigation strategy as argued by christis athanassiadis and vercalsteren 2019 this approach to urban circular economy has especially interesting potential on footprints of consumption and production of urban food groundswell movements in the throes of socio ecological contagion may be the idea foci for both national and urban policy makers to effectively leverage to develop effective ghg reduction plans using circular economy principles lenton 2014 otto et al 2020 regardless of the approach taken it is now clear that within the framework of the 2015 paris agreement urban metabolic systems are important foci for ghg reduction strategies and some if not all of the ghg intensive urban metabolic flows require attention through the circular economy lens christis et al 2019 4 4 limitations for future advancements this research focuses on impacts to climate change using a systems thinking approach in doing so it opens a path to explore the systemic interactions across a wider range of life cycle impact categories using the basis that is dynamic urban metabolism urban sustainability as argued in this and other existing research reaches far beyond the city limits but we have only addressed that with regard to the city s ghgs adjacent urban sustainability research has already explored how a city s remote ghgs have synergistic feedback loops with habitat loss and therefore influence on biodiversity for example among other impacts remote activities such as food production often have reinforcing dynamics over multiple impact categories thus reducing burdens on habitat loss simultaneously more research is needed on this as well as emission factors specific to cities with regionalised data on upstream processes in order to map the row location of their impacts as the city s activities become more electrified and thus less local additionally our model is limited by its incomplete coverage of commercial sectors for example communication and information systems is a growing sector in montreal but it was not considered in this model digital and highly electrified sectors are responsible for scope 2 and 3 emissions so their omission manifests an under counting of ghgs in this study lastly the fixed emission factors used in this model do not account for improvements over time indeed some policies will lead to decreasing industrial emissions for instance which will lead to decreasing ghgs for some materials and products such as steel and concrete future work could include dynamic evolution of emission factors 5 conclusions in this research we developed a fit for purpose dynamic systems model for simulating future ghgs associated with the montreal city agglomeration we modelled montreal s carbon footprint between 2000 and 2018 against observed values and projected out to 2030 including ratified and anticipated policy changes that will affect the city s material and energy flows moreover projection period is modelled according to four scenarios business as usual social contagion of a plant based diet circular economy of pavement maintenance using cold in site recycling and a combination of the latter two ghg results are disaggregated by local generated in the city and remote or row generated outside the city by simultaneously modelling montreal s population growth the ghg per capita trend was compared to the anticipated 2030 global threshold of 2 9 tco2e per person needed to meet the 1 5 c paris agreement target baseline and pmc show little change in total emissions while pbd and combined scenarios show a decrease in total emissions all scenarios result in decreased per capita emissions reflecting both the absolute reductions in ghg emissions and the growing population the combined scenario shows the greatest ghg mitigation potential reaching 10 5 t co2e capita but remains 7 6 t above the 2 9 tco2e capita threshold a further finding is that while total emissions do not significantly increase under any modelled scenario the baseline and pmc scenario generate more ghgs outside the city reflecting the electrification impacts embodied in montreal s policies pertaining to future building and transport energy all scenarios result in lower ghg emissions in the city reflecting the policy bias to scope 1 emissions more work is needed to shift urban policy design from local to global in consideration of the globalised supply chains necessary in meeting the demands of city dwellers a wider range of life cycle impact categories should be pursued to measure the potential reinforcing effects on multiple environmental decision criteria such as habitat loss and water depletion these categories are also subject to local and remote impacts and expanding the system analysis in such a way may create a stronger argument for decarbonisation of global supply chains in cities with views to containing the city s environmental impacts in the realms of consumers at the city end of those supply chains facilitating change between social and ecological dynamics is shown in this study to be possible both with social contagion of groundswell movements and scaling up urban construction material circularity notwithstanding much more ghg reduction is needed to meet that 1 5 c per capita goal by 2030 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

24355,materials and energy consumed by urban systems are one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions measuring these flows and their associated emissions is necessary to estimate the impact of cities on climate change in the future in this research we developed a dynamic model for measuring the carbon footprint of cities urban metabolism using an integrated socio ecological systems approach illustrated with a case study in montreal we modelled the urban carbon footprint between 2000 and 2018 and simulated on to 2030 under four scenarios baseline increasing adoption of plant based diets pbd pavement road material circularity pmc and a combined approach of the latter two by simultaneously modelling montreal s population growth the ghg per capita trend was compared to the anticipated 2030 global threshold of 2 9 t co2e per person needed to meet the 1 5 c paris agreement target all scenarios result in decreased per capita emissions from 15 0 t co2e capita in 2018 in part due to the increasing urban population the baseline scenario estimates a decrease to 12 7 t co2e by 2030 the pbd and pmc scenarios estimate respective reductions to 10 8 and 12 4 t co2e capita by 2030 the combined scenario estimates a greater reduction to 10 5 t co2e capita but this is still 7 6 t co2e capita over the paris agreement target for 1 5 c global warming graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction human activities have already increased earth s average temperature by an estimated 1 c since preindustrial times this is expected to increase to 1 5 c between 2030 and 2052 under business as usual projections ipcc 2018 spatial variation in global warming means some regions will suffer more adverse and extreme climate impacts such as parts of canada warren 2014 the majority of activities generating the ghgs responsible for global warming are associated with urban living efforts to mitigate the causes and adapt to the impacts of climate change have been addressed in numerous global fora including cop21 in paris france 2015 this resulted in the ratification of the paris agreement currently ratified by 191 parties out of 197 the aim of the agreement is to limit global temperature increases article 2 of the agreement declares a maximum of 2 c warming from preindustrial times with a preferred limit of 1 5 c article 4 of the agreement details how the signatories aim to achieve this limit by reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions ghgs and increasing carbon sinks the 1 5 c warming limit equates to approximately 25 gt co2 equivalent per year by 2030 rogelj et al 2018 in 2019 43 1 gt co2e were released by human activities friedlingstein et al 2019 and projections indicate 55 gt co2e per year by 2030 unfccc 2015 by 2030 global population is projected to reach 8 5 billion people united nations 2019 with the cap of 25 gt co2e per year in 2030 the average contribution would need to be no more than 2 9 t co2e per person per year policy continues to be implemented aligned with decarbonisation to meet the paris agreement commitments for a 1 5 c global average temperature increase these policies are implemented at national provincial and city levels and tend to focus on direct emissions i e territorial ghg accounting ignoring upstream emissions that may not occur within the given territory elliot babí almenar rugani 2020 these policies typically focus on electrification of the transport sector and building energy which are known to be large sources of ghgs however large portions of the urban carbon footprint are embedded in resources that have little to no direct ghg emissions within the city and are thus often overlooked in ghg mitigation policies for example we know food cement and textiles generate large amounts of ghgs during the upstream stages of their supply chains poore nemecek 2018 zhang et al 2014 typically occurring in remote areas before being transported to the city to begin their use phase goldstein rasmussen 2018 this research hypothesises that the fervent focus on decarbonizing urban energy use contributes to an increase in ghgs exterior to the city and potentially increasing other types of environmental damage we test this hypothesis by exploring the resource flows in a case city and simulating the demand for those flows in the future and by linking those flows to life cycle emission factors distinguishing between their upstream and use phase impacts we then develop scenarios to illustrate the types of mitigation policies that would additionally reduce the embodied ghgs generated by cities one area of novelty in this research is the way in which we approach urban scope 2 and 3 ghgs with respect to sustainable urban planning scope 2 emissions are generated by activities that use electricity and scope 3 emissions are generated by upstream extractive and manufacturing activities hertwich wood 2018 in both cases these emissions typically occur outside the city limits efforts to integrate more systemic analytical frameworks have been heralded by a number of field experts for example pincetl bunje and holmes 2012 argued for a wider view of urban sustainability encompassing life cycle thinking political economy political ecology and ecosystem service assessments more recently a review by beloin saint pierre et al 2017 put forth a roadmap listing the types of model required for certain urban metabolism problems including system dynamics life cycle thinking and ecological network analysis these show a trend to understanding the complexity underlying indirect global impacts of cities a small number of methods have been developed to this end such as ecological footprint moore kissinger rees 2013 rees 1992 the um lca goldstein birkved quitzau hauschild 2013 and estimum elliot et al 2022 ecological footprint captures the combined land use and carbon footprint of a city into a single indicator this is useful for communicating the appropriated land area and carbon sink deficits of urban systems but is not tailored to the non linear dynamics needed for meeting future policy targets and mitigating trade offs between different impacts um lca uses a material and energy flow analysis extended by life cycle impact assessment to capture the array of impacts from different impact categories and distinguish between the direct urban level and indirect rest of world this method allows for an advanced analysis of trade offs between impact categories such as global warming potential and water depletion which may be competing objectives in developing urban sustainability policies this method is not predictive instead providing a barometer of the contemporary impacts related to the breadth of material and energy resource demands in a city estimum applies the um lca concept of distinguishing local and global impacts in multiple impacts categories to urban ecosystem service assessments it uses system dynamics to simulate future scenarios of trade offs but measures these in ecosystem service groups such as global climate regulation and global habitat maintenance it is limited in its spatial resolution of global impacts providing a binary urban global output of the location of cities impacts literature suggests better understanding is needed on dynamics between urban consumption and their remote impacts as well as the trade offs between different impact categories with cities becoming larger and hungrier for resources this understanding is necessary to develop robust and comprehensive sustainable urban plans for the 1 5 c degree global warming limit while minimising impacts to other important challenges such as water security rugani almenar elliot 2020 secondly this research advances the state of the art on integration of social contagion theory and environmental modelling little has been published on the intersection of these two disciplines a growing body of research purports the need to consider social tipping points to affect climate futures moser dilling 2007 russill nyssa 2009 but these are largely theoretical models as the concepts are a highly novel and b highly complex lenton 2014 otto et al 2020 social contagion theory which applies epidemiological modelling to social networks hodas lerman 2014 has been applied to the acceptance of solar photovoltaics baranzini carattini péclat 2017 ongoing work lays the path between changes in societal consumption at regional levels and the global paris agreement commitments liu raftery 2021 yet the vastly complex realm intersecting environmental modelling and paris agreement commitments remains wide open a gap that has been only approached theoretically from the social tipping points perspective this paper posits that social contagion theory may be useful to leverage climate social tipping points and thus mobilise society towards meeting global warming objectives in lieu of underwhelming political frameworks the structure of this paper follows a description of the method including definitions of scope and system boundary the modules in the integrated modelling framework and their respective assumptions data sources and equations the validation procedure and statistics and finally scenario development thereafter results are reported and discussed before recommendations and conclusions to promote a more systems thinking way of devising sustainable urban plans aligned to the paris agreement commitments 2 method 2 1 scope and system boundary we modelled montreal s carbon footprint between 2000 and 2018 against observed values and projected out to 2030 including ratified and anticipated policy changes that will affect the city s material and energy flows montreal is the largest city in the province of quebec and the second most populous city in canada it lies on an island in the saint lawrence river whose land area covers 497 km2 some of which belongs to independent municipalities collectively the cities occupying the island are referred to as the agglomeration of montreal this case study applies to the agglomeration of montreal rather than the city proper for ease of data acquisition and because the functionality of the city is not delineated by the municipal boundaries hereafter we refer to the agglomeration of montreal simply as montreal for readability 2 2 model framework the life cycle extended urban material energy flow model is based on the concept of coupled human and nature systems models hackenhaar babí almenar elliot rugani 2022 peng du liu hu 2016 it is a system dynamics model engineered in simile www simulistics com the model is composed of urban resource modules which simulate the per capita consumption of food electricity fossil fuels water construction materials and the generation of waste flows from those resources using population dynamics as a basis shifts to age and wealth cohorts over time influence the resource demands of the city for example younger people have different needs compared to older people while wealthier people have higher purchase power and appetite for luxury and more elastic consumerism the model works on a 1 year time step over time not only does the number of consumers change but so too do the types of consumers the environmental impacts of the simulated resource flows are estimated in two steps the upstream cradle to gate impacts are calculated using life cycle emission factors these are taken from ecoinvent wernet et al 2016 or literature where more appropriate and represent the impacts occurring outside the city rest of world row these impacts were calculated for the impact category gwp100 using the recipe 2016 mid point hierarchist method huijbregts et al 2017 the use phase impacts are estimated for urban processes such as tailpipe and flue emissions from burning fossil fuels in the city using direct emissions factors taken from the intergovernmental panel on climate change s emission factor database ipcc 2006 or literature where more appropriate these urban impacts are calculated as the product of each energy carrier s combustion emission factor and the amount of that energy carrier used in the year these combustion emission factors are taken from the ipcc efdb ipcc 2006 the overview of this framework is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 1 population dynamics population is one of the key drivers of the urban metabolism and thus the associated environmental impacts elliot rugani almenar niza 2018 moreover the age structure of the population influences the types of resources and activities the population engages with the population is therefore modelled in eight age cohorts whose members graduate to the next cohort until death death may occur during any cohort membership but the mortality rate of each cohort differs to reflect reality babies are born into the youngest age cohort but new immigrants also enter at each cohort it is assumed only the middle age cohort reproduces in the case of montreal fertility mortality and net immigration rates by age are taken from institut de la statistique du québec 2021c institut de la statistique du québec 2021a and statistics canada 2017a respectively immigration is calculated as the mean average between 2007 and 2017 initial population count for 2000 is taken from institut de la statistique du québec 2021b these values are shown in table 1 2 2 2 commercial and institutional energy dynamics the commercial and institutional module considers nine sectors wholesale trade retail trade offices health education information hospitality arts and storage each sector has different energy end uses among the nine sectors there are six energy end uses using a mix of three energy carriers electricity natural gas and fuel oil as shown in table 2 several dynamic cause effect relationships are used in this model the activity of the sectors change over time changes to wholesale retail offices information hospitality arts and storage activities are influenced by the economic productivity of the city modelled by gdp forecasts changes to health and education services are influenced by population changes using the population module described in section 2 2 1 historic urban energy flows are estimated by disaggregating provincial quebec energy data by the respective activity indicator either gdp or population these data provide the basis for model validation described below in section 2 3 the ghg emissions of each commercial and institutional sector is estimated from the energy demand of the activities subject to the type of energy used for those activities each energy end use has a specific emission factor the emission factors change as the city s technology stocks change technologies change over time due to policy interventions aimed at reducing the urban carbon footprint for example in montreal fuel oil combustion is to be phased out in the city by 2025 thus the fuel oil based technologies will be phased out and replaced by natural gas and electric technology based on the end use requirements for time steps between the announcement of a phase out policy and the phase out deadline the demand for the phasing out technology decreases as the phase out date approaches that technology will become less available meanwhile economies of scale will make the emerging technologies progressively cheaper however counteracting the changing of preferences is the changing of overall demand as population and economic production change presumed to increase within the modelled time horizon thus the demand for a certain activity might increase while the incumbent fuel technology is undergoing a phase out the model deals with this by setting a fuel use ceiling equal to the fuel consumption at the time of the policy announcement meanwhile energy intensity is determined by regression on energy end use over time which allows for trends in technological efficiency gains 2 2 3 transport dynamics the transport module considers freight and passenger movements the passenger part deals with the interaction of three different passenger transport modes light private vehicles lpv buses and light passenger rail aviation is included but does not interact directly with demand for the other passenger modes as they are not substitutable aviation is influenced by population growth alone demand for lpv bus and rail mobility is measured as passenger kilometres travelled pkts pkt for a given year is calculated as the product of the number of cars in use the load factor and the average kilometers driven per vehicle per year as used in the comprehensive energy use database nrcan 2020 load factor is the number of occupied seats divided by the number of available seats lpvs are assumed to have five available seats while buses have 50 lpv and bus load factor increases over time in quebec and we assume this holds true for montreal nrcan 2020 the total demand for passenger mobility is determined from observed historical relationship between population and pkts in quebec which was sourced from nrcan 2020 pkt demand can be supplied by buses lpv and bicycles the model shares the supply on the basis of what we refer to as loaded seats loaded seats are determined by multiplying the fleet by the seats per vehicle by the average load factor of a vehicle it is assumed the number of seats per vehicle does not change but the fleet is influenced by population and policy decisions load factor also changes and this is modelled according to the rate of change observed historically nrcan 2020 for every time step the model calculates the demand for mobility pkts and the loaded seats for lpvs buses and rail and apportions the mobility supply accordingly the lpv fleet changes over time the model considers three types of lpv standard internal combustion engine cars henceforth simply cars light passenger trucks lpts such as special utility vehicles also with internal combustion engines and electric cars ecs cars and lpts run on petroleum although the model has flexibility to include diesel and other fossil fuels other time the fleet changes according to a sigmoidal growth curve regression which assumes growing preference for lpts with waning preference for cars until the implementation of policy restrictions on fossil combusting vehicles in the case study of montreal fossil combusting private vehicles will not be sold after 2035 thus all fleet renewal after 2035 will be ecs similarly the bus fleet changes over time three types of bus are considered diesel buses hybrid diesel electric buses and electric buses these are assumed to have lifespans of around 800 000 kms as bus kilometres increase with their utilization buses are more rapidly retired and the fleet is renewed in this dynamic way in the case of montreal it is anticipated that diesel buses will no longer be purchased by the bus operator from 2025 meanwhile a combination of diesel hybrid and electric buses enter the fleet but thereafter only electric buses will be purchased the attributes used to model the vehicle fleets are shown in table 3 the petroleum diesel and electricity used by the collective fleets are summed in petajoules at each year the direct impacts are calculated depending on the fuel type and the mode in which it is used these impacts constitute the urban impacts the row impacts are calculated for each year as sum of the product of additions to the fleet and the system process emission factor for that type of vehicle and adding the product and the product of fuel imports and the system process emission factor for that type of fuel put another way all the fuel and vehicles entering the city each year contribute to row impacts while the combustion of those fuels contributes to the urban impacts the input data for the transport dynamics covering lpv bus and rail between 2000 2018 are available in supplementary table 1 a c the freight transport module includes only truck movements which accounted for more than 95 of quebec s freight energy use in 2018 nrcan 2020 demand for freight transport is influenced positively by urban gdp 2 2 4 residential energy dynamics the residential energy module includes the energy used in peoples homes transport energy is captured in the previous section energy is used in the residential sector by five end use categories space heating systems shs water heating systems whs appliances lighting and space cooling systems scs the types of energy used for the residential activities are shown in table 4 the energy used by these categories is modelled by first modelling the stock of those systems in this sense the stock is the city s inventory of each heating system the type of shs in a dwelling determines the fuel type and the energy efficiency as a system reaches the end of its lifespan it is replaced by either a new and more modern version of that system or it might be replaced by a different technology this is determined by market availability which is in this model influenced by implementations such as government regulation for example when it is announced that a technology will be phased out no new systems with that technology will be installed and those already in existence will run the course of their normal life before being replaced by a different technology the new shs installments are estimated as the sum of new dwellings and shs needing to be replaced multiplied by a vector of preferences for each of the possible shs types the number of new dwellings is estimated as half the number of new adults in the population the systems phased out is estimated as the ratio of stock to life expectancy for each system type estimates of system longevity are taken from tonkens 2020 the initial preference vector is calculated as the distribution of shs in 2000 in quebec the preferences adding to one each year after any shs that has been phased out e g heating oil boilers is set to zero in the preference vector and its value in the previous time step is shared between the remaining allowable shs types such as heat pumps space cooling involves some additional influential variables each of which are themselves dynamic average floor area of a dwelling influences demand for space cooling energy floor area of new dwellings is influenced by changes in personal wealth in this model we estimate the gdp and population at each time step creating a variable of gdp per capita the natural logarithm of the delta of these values is correlated to floor area of newly built dwellings the average floor area in a given year is the sum of floor area over all existing and new dwellings divided by the number of all existing and new dwellings meanwhile energy efficiency of scs is estimated by linear regression of observed values over time in quebec this assumes efficiency of quebec scs are representative of montreal room scs have a maximum efficiency of 12 while floor scs can reach 13 efficiency nrcan 2020 the weighted average of room and floor scs is calculated to do this the number of new scs units is estimated using a sigmoidal growth curve fitted to the observed preference to install new scs in quebec finally the cooling degree day cdd index which gradually increases linearly within the time period also influences energy used to cool dwellings this variable acknowledges warming of temperatures over time the energy use by scs is calculated by multi linear regression of observed energy use for scs on cdd index cooled floor area and weighted energy efficiency which has an adjusted r squared of 0 9236 2 2 5 material flow dynamics the flow rate of the materials is taken from vega azamar glaus hausler oropeza garcía and romero lópez 2013 whose emergy footprint of montreal reported an inventory of flow rates for the year 2005 while these single point data are old we assume these materials to be driven by infrastructure maintenance and largely consistent year on year due to lack of time series data to inform temporal dynamics we have extrapolated the 2005 data using montreal s gdp time series each of the material resources is linked to a global warming potential emission factor as described in section 2 2 2 2 6 water the water module considers residential and commercial water use residential water use is modelled per capita and thus linked to population change this is considered inelastic and the value is taken from rasifaghihi li and haghighat 2020 however this portion of water makes up approximately a thousandth of the urban water use in the case of montreal vega azamar et al 2013 for the most part water is consumed by the commercial and institutional sectors and water use changes therein are linked to economic productivity environmental impacts of water are taken from ecoinvent as 0 0002 kg co2e per kg of municipal tap water in quebec specifically 2 2 7 food the food module uses average consumption data per person the data used in the montreal case are taken from health canada 2018 average amounts of different foods are consumed in different quantities by different age groups the list of foods for each age group is given in supplementary table 2 as the age structure of the population changes so too does the food consumption profile of the city the total food consumption of the city is calculated for each year and the environmental impact is calculated as the sum of products of mass of each food type and the emission factor for each food type the emission factors are taken from poore and nemecek 2018 or ecoinvent wernet et al 2016 where appropriate emission factors for the remaining food types were supplemented from literature including pasta recchia cappelli cini garbati pegna boncinelli 2019 mushroom robinson winans kendall dlott dlott 2018 ice cream konstantas stamford azapagic 2019 baby food sieti schmidt rivera stamford azapagic 2019 confectionary miah et al 2018 soft drinks amienyo gujba stichnothe azapagic 2013 game meat fiala et al 2020 and margarine and shortening nilsson et al 2010 upstream food waste is captured in the emission factors however end of life food waste is not this is estimated using the end of life wastage per tonne of food consumed in canada gooch et al 2019 canadians consume 25 million tonnes of food annually of which 33 is wasted at or after the consumer gooch et al 2019 wastage occurs at different rates between types of food the waste of each food group is shown in table 5 below per tonne of food at consumer market 2 3 validation the model s validation period is 2000 to 2018 the simulated values are validated on historical material and energy flow data per capita the correlation coefficients for the response variables are shown in supplementary table 3 the correlation coefficients are used to calculate the standard error of forecast to demonstrate levels of confidence in simulated values for the forecast period 2019 2030 in section 3 2 4 principles of social contagion for socio ecological systems social contagion is the phenomenon of the spread of cultural spiritual ideological and political belief systems through social networks christakis fowler 2013 social contagion theory can be applied to study the spread of environmental decision making when a belief system spreads through a community it can become endemic or it can be short lived depending on the reproduction rate of the belief system and the recovery rate christakis fowler 2013 this in turn may affect economic choices and therefor has consequences for the environmental impacts of that community in the case of veganism which is the exclusion of animal products as far as practically possible there are consequences for the foodprint goldstein birkved fernández hauschild 2017 as veganism and the wider plant based trend is reproduced between agents in the community the proportion of food coming from animal sources decreases a large body of evidence already exists to show the environmental benefits associated with reducing animal based foods in our diets lynch johnston wharton 2018 poore nemecek 2018 as discussed by elliot 2022 this presents an opportunity to remove barriers to the reproduction rate in order to meaningfully reduce a city s foodprint this may be useful in the study of urban carbon metabolism as it can be used to test scenarios for future dietary change in a city and thus the inflow of food products and their associated remote environment impacts e g methane during farm activities this calculation involves two main cohorts the vegan cohort and the non vegan cohort agents move between these cohorts subject to their contact with members of the opposing cohort this movement is calculated using a dynamic reproduction rate number of people a vegan influences to join the vegan cohort within one time step a fixation rate proportion of those influenced who remain part of the vegan cohort for more than one time step furthermore these rates are influenced by the status quo a variable defined as the ratio of non vegans to the total population a scenario is developed and described in section 2 5 using the social contagion theory to test the environmental performance of montreal subject to shifts away from animal based foods 2 5 scenario development scenarios were developed to show how the model could be used to help decision makers analyse the impact of different potential mitigation actions the model discussed to this point described a baseline scenario the baseline scenario establishes a gap in montreal s future ghgs compared to the 1 5 c warming benchmark two alternative exploratory scenarios are subsequently developed to determine the scale of change needed to meet the 1 5 c warming benchmark a third scenario combines these two exploratory scenarios to show their additive effects each scenario investigates an important aspect of resource use in montreal determined by the rank of most ghg intensive activities under the baseline scenario the three scenarios are defined below more details on each of the scenario attributes can be found in supplementary table 4 2 5 1 pavement material circularity pmc the pavement material circularity pmc scenario is narrow in scope as the possibilities for resources circularity are almost limitless while at the same time each unique in how a city might adopt such principles this scenario deals with circularisation of road materials which is easily the largest solid mass flow water is an order of magnitude greater road construction and maintenance are also large end uses of materials in montreal virgin gravel and virgin bitumen are the main components of montreal s road pavements cold recycling of used road aggregate in bitumen emulsion mix is a method by which virgin materials are substituted by in situ reforming of the pavement with the old pavement hypothetically this may result in no demand for virgin aggregate and much reduced demand for bitumen which is the basis of this scenario under the baseline scenario 1 km of road resurfacing requires 655 t virgin aggregate and 23 t virgin bitumen under the cold recycling scenario 1 km of road resurfacing requires 6 t virgin bitumen for the emulsion mixture and 46 t water estimated based on nrcan 2005 thus for every tonne of virgin aggregate substituted a net saving of 0 0252 t of virgin bitumen is realised while an increase of 0 0573 t of water use road resurfacing rate was assumed based on montreal s annual demand of bitumen and it was assumed that all bitumen was used for roading 2 5 2 plant based diets pbd this scenario pertains to replacing animal based foods with plant based foods it is known that plant based foods typically generate fewer ghgs than their equivalent animal based foods poore nemecek 2018 the dietary change assumes two diet profiles standard canadian omnivore diet and plant based diet the standard canadian omnivore diet scod is similar to the standard canadian diet used in the business as usual scenario but each specifically plant based food type is set to zero grams per day each animal based food type is set to the eater value of grams per day rather than the population mean value health canada 2018 the plant based diet pbd uses the standard canadian diet as a basis each animal based product is set to zero grams per day each specifically plant based food value is calculated as the product of its calorific value and the sum of animal based foods it substitutes in this way both dietary profiles provide the same calories which is 2251 per day the model calculates a dietary profile for the city at each time step weighted by the number of adherents to each dietary programme the number of adherents is calculated using social contagion theory with a reproduction value r value which allows for an exponential uptake in pbd population as the diet becomes more contagious pbd population is then treated as fixed based on a fixation rate which determines the ratio who will remain on the pbd the remainder switch back to the scod r value and fixation rate for each age cohort were set at 1 and 0 75 respectively this is the combination for which the ghg capita plateaus toward the lower limit sensitivity analysis of r and f on ghg capita is available in supplementary table 5 reproduced from elliot 2022 initial pbd population in montreal is set at 2 3 based on a 2018 survey by charlebois somogyi and music 2018 the percent of pbd immigrants is set at 2 7 based on a global estimate by the economist 2019 3 results 3 1 business as usual table 6 below shows the average annual and cumulative ghgs for each urban activity for the historic period and the forecast period the activities are ranked by percentage contribution to the ghgs in 2030 food is anticipated to generate the highest portion of montreal s ghgs in 2030 which is an increase both in relative and in absolute terms compared to 2000 important absolute reductions are anticipated in the commercial institutional sectors due to electrification in contrast activities whose demands are less elastic food water construction and activities whose impacts are not influenced by montreal s electrification plans consumable materials are expected to be relatively stable and therefore increase their share of urban emissions in order to meet the paris agreement limit of 1 5 c global warming since preindustrial temperature the global citizen may generate 2 9 t co2e per person in 2030 rogelj et al 2018 as it stood in 2018 montreal s population generated around 15 t co2e per person and the projection of both ghgs and population lead to 12 7 t per person in 2030 this result takes into account the local policies for electrification and energy decarbonisation and yet it is still more than four times the average required to meet the 1 5 c warming limit results from this business as usual scenario show that by 2030 an increasing portion of montreal s carbon footprint is associated with remote activities 80 and the bulk of that 66 is linked to food and materials consumed in the city the ghgs from food alone in 2030 equate to 3 9 t co2e capita therefore it is of paramount importance to address the indirect scope 3 ghgs when considering the urban carbon footprint if we expect cities to contribute to limiting global anthropogenic ghgs the following scenarios are developed based on possible policies that would mitigate scope 3 ghgs from the city s food and material flows it must be noted that comparisons of per capita emissions should be made cautiously due to this model omitting some minor sectors in reality the difference between actual emissions and targets is expected to be even higher than estimated here based on the average ghg allowance per capita in 2030 needed to reach the 1 5 c warming limit montreal needs to reach 7 0 mt co2e yr by 2030 a 77 reduction from the projected value of 30 9 shown in table 7 this figure is in line with similar regional reduction analyses liu raftery 2021 3 2 mitigation scenarios results are given for three mitigation scenarios and the baseline case as illustrated in fig 2 in 2018 montreal was responsible for 30 4 mt co2e total emissions the highest observed up from 27 4 mt in 2000 the baseline case is estimated to generate 30 9 mt co2e by 2030 showing the continued increase over each year in spite of the rollout of already confirmed climate policies over the forecasted period the portion of emissions occurring within the city is expected to amount to 22 reaching only 20 by 2030 this decrease in local emissions is largely due to the electrification of transport and building energy over the coming years the pbd scenario results in a downward shift to 26 2 mt co2e in 2030 of which 23 6 is expected to occur within montreal fig 2 shows rapid decrease in montreal s per capita ghgs from 2023 under the pbd scenario only 5 years into the simulation the pmc scenario estimates 30 1 mt co2e emitted in 2030 of which 22 8 is expected to occur within montreal the pmc scenario like the baseline scenario shows a continued increase in absolute ghg emissions in spite of the climate policies already scheduled over the coming decade the combined scenario pbd and pmc results in 25 4 mt co2e in 2030 of which 24 2 is expected to occur within montreal as shown in fig 2 the modelled scenarios show montreal s per capita emissions decrease steadily from 14 9 t co2e in 2000 to 13 8 t co2e in 2018 the baseline scenario predicts a further fall to 12 7 t co2e by 2030 a 9 8 t co2e capita overshoot from the 2 9 t co2e capita required to meet the 1 5 c paris agreement the pbd and pmc scenarios estimate reductions to 10 8 and 12 4 t co2e capita by 2030 respectively the combined scenario which estimates the largest absolute emissions reduction by 2030 predicts a further drop to 10 5 t co2e capita but this is still 7 6 t co2e capita over the paris agreement target for 1 5 c global warming this is shown by the dark red lines in fig 2 a d 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic urban metabolism in context application of the broad urban metabolism metaphor can be split into social urban metabolism material energy flow analysis and ecosystem metabolism newell cousins 2014 the concept was coined by karl marx in the context of social metabolism and later became a useful metaphor for material and energy flows the latter ecosystem metabolism has grown with the development of ecosystem service research and landscape and urban ecology while all three schools harness the metabolism metaphor thereby alluding to the consumption and waste aspects of social ecological systems they have existed in research silos rugani babí almenar elliot othoniel 2021 the model builds on earlier work at the intersection of social material energy and ecosystem flows elliot et al 2022 rugani et al 2020 this model which is novel in so far as it accounts for feedback loops between social ecological and economic systems reinforces the findings of existing comparable urban carbon assessment frameworks firstly such dynamic models are not available due to the high degree of novelty in dynamic urban forecasting models beloin saint pierre et al 2017 however retrospective urban metabolism studies are useful to understand the relative magnitude of direct versus indirect impacts the sectors they belong to and the size of impacts per capita the comparable study by goldstein et al 2013 developed the um lca method and thus compared the life cycle extended urban metabolism footprint of five cities they calculated the carbon footprint for greater toronto area at 16 6 t co2e person based on data from 1999 compared with the 14 9 t co2e person we identified for montreal in 2000 the 10 lower per capita carbon footprint in montreal is likely due to several reasons most importantly montreal and toronto have very different electricity mixes montreal s supply of electricity is one of the least carbon intensive electricity grids in the world the quebec electricity mix is one of the least ghg intensive in the world at 0 01188 kg co2e kwh while the ontario electricity mix is more than eight times more carbon intensive wernet et al 2016 additionally montreal agglomeration is a denser urban system than greater toronto area and as such we expect our results to be lower the former does not include border cities of laval and longueil while the latter includes four regional municipalities in addition to the toronto city statistics canada 2017b goldstein et al 2013 s study stopped short of analysing the carbon reduction potential of regulations however the subsequent study by elliot et al 2020 illustrated the historic influence of portugal and europe s policies on lisbon s energy related ghgs especially local ghgs while the influence was not enough for hopes of urban climate neutrality the results indicated the potential for demand side implementations when considering the wider urban metabolism including material flows the potential for demand side approaches also has potential for mitigating remote ghgs comparing the present study to said lisbon study we can conclude that implementations need to happen at both the consumer and producer ends of supply chains to effectively tackle urban carbon footprint challenges with this in mind this approach using system dynamics modelling to link social and ecological variables with policy suites contributes to the design of systems thinking climate mitigation plans by coupling socio ecological dynamics and accounting for the reinforcing effects of those dynamics 4 2 social contagion and climate change mitigation contagion theory has been used in sociology to demonstrate that environmental movements can be levered towards social tipping points vegan social movements eker reese obersteiner 2019 in social media barrios o neill 2021 and the uptake of solar panels baranzini et al 2017 it has not been applied to ideological movements such as veganism and how that can have co benefits for environmental impact reduction such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions application of social contagion of plant based diets in this paper shows a marked reduction in the foodprint of montreal over the next decade which is expected to increase as plant based and other lower carbon diets become more socially contagious in order to foster social contagion barriers should be removed from low carbon consumer decisions such as making plant based food choices available supporting social contagion of low carbon diets and environmentally less damaging food systems in general is known to have high potential for urban ghg reduction dorr goldstein horvath aubry gabrielle 2021 which in turn has been shown to have powerful influence on global food production systems chen long fath chen 2020 poore nemecek 2018 while our paper shows the strong potential for consumer food choices to reduce the urban foodprint incentivising such a movement is undermined by lack of political will goldstein et al 2017 there is however a convincing argument for policy aiming at increasing social contagion to reduce montreal s carbon footprint as demonstrated by elliot 2022 sensitivity of ghgs to changes in social contagion parameters is highly dependent on the reproduction rate r thus even positive nudging in government campaigns may induce rapid social contagion and diet related ghg reductions a second and more tangible challenge is the transfer of scientifically robust product information to the consumer ridoutt hendrie noakes 2017 life cycle assessment provides standardised methods for environmental product declarations epds which can be used to guide consumer purchasing decisions away from high carbon food assuming the consumer subscribes to this objective notarnicola et al 2017 however epds are optional and thus usually used by manufacturers to market their low carbon products rather than the other way around increasing the use of epds on carbon intensive food products may remove a barrier in the social contagion of plant based diets without the need for implementing restrictive and paternalistic policy goldstein et al 2017 4 3 circular economy and climate mitigation results show high potential to reduce embodied ghgs from urban material flows the pmc scenario limited to bitumen and aggregate in road construction mitigated 2 of the urban material ghg footprint this is a small part of montreal s carbon footprint but considering the circularisation only considers pavement materials the reason for exploring only the ghg reduction potential of pavement circularity is because the process of cold in situ recycling is already used in canada and is therefore a realistic area for change more broadly the construction sector is known to be a significant source of demolition waste and in europe contributes a third of ghg emissions gallego schmid chen sharmina mendoza 2020 there is potential to reduce ghgs by addressing other sectors such as food waste a recent review paper across a broader range of material flows found that between 30 50 of the footprint could be reduced gallego schmid et al 2020 these results provide a case for a generalised urban ghg reduction plan including aspects of circular material flows while only some flows may be appropriate for ghg mitigation plans it has also been shown by lidicker sathaye madanat and horvath 2013 that pavement resurfacing policy has an important role to play in life cycle ghgs of cities while nußholz nygaard rasmussen and milios 2019 described the potential of circular building materials to reduce a city s carbon footprint and went on to argue for innovation and urban policy with this in view davidescu apostu and paul 2020 promoted an umbrella urban circular economy and the role of urbanites in activating such a movement this ties nicely to the other ghg mitigation scenario presented in this present paper using socio ecological contagion to foster plant based foods replacing animal based foods it is already known that boycotting single use material flows can be achieved through nudging with information campaigns large infrastructure may not be in this category but the high ghg intensive flows such as textiles steel and cement could be considered in an urban wide ghg mitigation strategy as argued by christis athanassiadis and vercalsteren 2019 this approach to urban circular economy has especially interesting potential on footprints of consumption and production of urban food groundswell movements in the throes of socio ecological contagion may be the idea foci for both national and urban policy makers to effectively leverage to develop effective ghg reduction plans using circular economy principles lenton 2014 otto et al 2020 regardless of the approach taken it is now clear that within the framework of the 2015 paris agreement urban metabolic systems are important foci for ghg reduction strategies and some if not all of the ghg intensive urban metabolic flows require attention through the circular economy lens christis et al 2019 4 4 limitations for future advancements this research focuses on impacts to climate change using a systems thinking approach in doing so it opens a path to explore the systemic interactions across a wider range of life cycle impact categories using the basis that is dynamic urban metabolism urban sustainability as argued in this and other existing research reaches far beyond the city limits but we have only addressed that with regard to the city s ghgs adjacent urban sustainability research has already explored how a city s remote ghgs have synergistic feedback loops with habitat loss and therefore influence on biodiversity for example among other impacts remote activities such as food production often have reinforcing dynamics over multiple impact categories thus reducing burdens on habitat loss simultaneously more research is needed on this as well as emission factors specific to cities with regionalised data on upstream processes in order to map the row location of their impacts as the city s activities become more electrified and thus less local additionally our model is limited by its incomplete coverage of commercial sectors for example communication and information systems is a growing sector in montreal but it was not considered in this model digital and highly electrified sectors are responsible for scope 2 and 3 emissions so their omission manifests an under counting of ghgs in this study lastly the fixed emission factors used in this model do not account for improvements over time indeed some policies will lead to decreasing industrial emissions for instance which will lead to decreasing ghgs for some materials and products such as steel and concrete future work could include dynamic evolution of emission factors 5 conclusions in this research we developed a fit for purpose dynamic systems model for simulating future ghgs associated with the montreal city agglomeration we modelled montreal s carbon footprint between 2000 and 2018 against observed values and projected out to 2030 including ratified and anticipated policy changes that will affect the city s material and energy flows moreover projection period is modelled according to four scenarios business as usual social contagion of a plant based diet circular economy of pavement maintenance using cold in site recycling and a combination of the latter two ghg results are disaggregated by local generated in the city and remote or row generated outside the city by simultaneously modelling montreal s population growth the ghg per capita trend was compared to the anticipated 2030 global threshold of 2 9 tco2e per person needed to meet the 1 5 c paris agreement target baseline and pmc show little change in total emissions while pbd and combined scenarios show a decrease in total emissions all scenarios result in decreased per capita emissions reflecting both the absolute reductions in ghg emissions and the growing population the combined scenario shows the greatest ghg mitigation potential reaching 10 5 t co2e capita but remains 7 6 t above the 2 9 tco2e capita threshold a further finding is that while total emissions do not significantly increase under any modelled scenario the baseline and pmc scenario generate more ghgs outside the city reflecting the electrification impacts embodied in montreal s policies pertaining to future building and transport energy all scenarios result in lower ghg emissions in the city reflecting the policy bias to scope 1 emissions more work is needed to shift urban policy design from local to global in consideration of the globalised supply chains necessary in meeting the demands of city dwellers a wider range of life cycle impact categories should be pursued to measure the potential reinforcing effects on multiple environmental decision criteria such as habitat loss and water depletion these categories are also subject to local and remote impacts and expanding the system analysis in such a way may create a stronger argument for decarbonisation of global supply chains in cities with views to containing the city s environmental impacts in the realms of consumers at the city end of those supply chains facilitating change between social and ecological dynamics is shown in this study to be possible both with social contagion of groundswell movements and scaling up urban construction material circularity notwithstanding much more ghg reduction is needed to meet that 1 5 c per capita goal by 2030 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

24356,life is organized into more or less well defined organizational levels connected both horizontally and vertically our knowledge is richer along the horizontal levels e g inter specific interactions in multispecies communities while vertical thinking e g individual level variability of the prey in a predator prey interaction is more challenging more often crossing disciplinary borders this review overviews the major challenges concepts and network analysis related methods related to studying vertical processes giving a number of examples it is argued the network theory is essentially about linking parts to the whole and this is equivalent to connecting units at one level to a larger unit at the next level mostly but not only social networks food webs and landscape graphs are discussed methods and concepts in network research both classical and recently emerged for supporting this vertical thinking are discussed keywords network biological organization hierarchy part to whole data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 hierarchy life on earth is organized into levels these range from cells to meta ecosystems with several clear and more ambiguous intermediate levels similar entities interacting at one level build up an unit at the next higher level and each higher level entity is composed of several entities interacting at one level below a system at one scale is a part of another system at a higher scale up and down the hierarchy levin 1992 these system subsystem relationships are an important source of knowledge and understanding in various areas of biology from cell biology to ecology the main questions are the mutual relationships between parts and the whole miller 2008 first considering bottom up concerns how can individual components build up the whole system and how do the properties of a system depend on this allen and starr 1982 o neill et al 1986 second from a top down perspective how do the functioning and success of the parts depend on the constraints imposed by the whole system they belong to the main question addressed in this review is how are these hierarchical levels interconnected vertically and what are the challenges here müller 1992 scientific knowledge is mostly focused within the horizontal levels of biological organization for example cell biology knows a lot about proteins involved in signal transduction networks metabolites in metabolic networks and genes in gene regulation networks ma and zeng 2003 ethology and socio biology is studying individual organisms interacting in a social group forming social networks that characterize social groups krause and ruxton 2002 croft et al 2008 in community ecology research is focused on interacting species coexisting in a food web a local community is connected to others by spatial processes forming metacommunities objects of landscape ecology and the highest level of the biosphere discussed here all of these disciplines are interested in one maybe also in the neighbour levels crossing borders horizontally is challenging enough in most cases for example linking population dynamics and biogeochemistry jörgensen 2008 however vertical issues come up frequently and in all of these disciplines we do not have well established standard techniques to look at the vertical links jordán and jörgensen 2012 a review on quite a few attempts with a historical overview conceptual clarification e g hypergraph multigraph multi layer network interconnected network and a number of examples identifies topological indices e g global inter clustering coefficient global overlap developed for studying these vertical system subsystem relationships kivelä et al 2014 the lack of standard approaches is clear especially if three or more levels are addressed at the same time methodologically speaking we can say that network analysis is a great tool to approach this issue graph nodes and the graph being at two different horizontal levels of organization further saying that networks are not functioning independently in isolation but they are also connected to each other jörgensen and nielsen 2015 is equivalent to making two vertical steps in the organization the vertical levels of organization is a network of networks of networks issue one can also ask how do these networks interact either competitively or mutualistically beyond simply asking how they are connected this may lead to thermodynamical considerations about the efficiency of using resources and possible darwinian processes of selection this is the basis of the proposed ecological law of thermodynamics jörgensen 2012 from a systems perspective the dynamics of hierarchy can be described as the interactions and success of holons ratzé et al 2007 for sure evolutionary dynamics should not be addressed and cannot be understood at a single organizational levels vertical connections amongst horizontal levels may be at the heart of the problem of linking ecology and evolution proulx et al 2005 miller 2008 this is a more appropriate approach than simply considering the difference between ecology and evolution as only a matter of time scales this review is mostly focused on ecological systems yet supposing that ecology is the science of coexistence network issues linking interacting parts to wholes are always ecological issues to some extent in this sense proteins forming a signal transduction network have their ecology similar to cell types in a cancer ecosystem basanta and anderson 2013 this is a broader definition of ecology contradicting the views of hardcore ecologists defending the concept of the ecosystem from other disciplines like an innovation ecosystem ritala and almpanopoulou 2017 so it is suggested that linking cells to the biosphere if we always follow system subsystem relationships is pure ecology we can only assume that a broad minded thinker such as ernst haeckel would be open and supportive of such an encompassing use of his term this review is focused on interactions and networks acknowledging other aspects of systems theory including spatio temporal scales continuity membership and boundaries miller 2008 since we focus on connections and interactions it seems to go against the very principles to try to organize it linearly into chapters and subchapters yet for convenience this will be tried and a storyline will be provided although a storynetwork would be much more logical 2 vertical challenges horizontal thinking discussing problems at a single particular organizational level is increasingly challenged in food web research individual level variability in heterogeneous populations e g hampton and fournier 2001 calls for better connecting individuals and populations considering population structure in terms of demography trait distributions and interactions i e social networks this would help to refine the black box approach of earlier models where populations were predominantly considered a set of identical individuals considering individual level heterogeneity e g age structure trait distribution social organization can help to better descibe the trophic or spatial behaviour of populations for example in a predator prey interaction on the contrary understanding social behaviour may strongly depend on whether ecology is considered including both environmental parameters e g nutrient availability for prairie dogs jordán et al 2021 and interspecific interactions e g social cohesion and predation pressure barton et al 1996 in these cases considering mechanisms acting at higher levels are relevant or even indispensable for better describing lower level patterns beyond invididuals populations and multi species systems the need for vertical connections spans across all levels of biological organization metabolic coupling amongst a few bacterial species can be crucial for the functioning of whole communities of micro organisms freilich et al 2011 regimbeau et al 2022 and large scale spatial processes may constraint local community dynamics estes et al 1998 the variability of network structure is a crucial issue at each horizontal level first because of the methodological difficulties node composition in the network changes over time it is not easy to define the appropriate time window i e temporal resolution for best describing the relevant processes and the same for spatial scales i e how large is the network in a geographic sense yet if properly defined comparing several networks may show typical constant and atypical variable properties second because of variable network properties in space and time one can much better understand the adaptive potential at the system level but the source of variability may be found at other levels for example changes of individual behavioural strategies can result in very different social networks also prey switching mccard et al 2021 and omnivory kortsch et al 2019 generate a larger variability of pattern and networks multiple networks along spatial ortiz and wolff 2002 temporal baird and ulanowicz 1989 borrett et al 2006 spatio temporal kitching 1987 warren 1989 or other gradients ulanowicz 1996 are useful for understanding variability but their differences should be understood scaling issues frequently call for connecting different levels for example by aggregation fritsch et al 2020 scaling issues may be related to network structure for example in landscape graphs keitt et al 1997 the spatial structure of habitats is highly species specific so constructing a general landscape graph for a multispecies ecosystem must be based on some consensus on the dominant scale of spatial processes clearly what is a habitat network for soil invertebrates is only a habitat patch for birds or mammals in this case considering critically important community level processes or even identifying keystone species can be very helpful to define the most relevant spatial scale for the functionally best description of metacommunity dynamics multi level analyses of different networks are needed also in a variety of other disciplines including learning and knowledge management for organizations beeby and booth 2000 the adaptive capacity of governance regimes pahl wostl 2009 competition and cooperation in industrial systems farrell et al 1998 mapping part whole hierarchies into connectionist ai networks hinton 1990 industrial and urban metabolism zhang et al 2010 and security issues jordán 2008 also multi level thinking is essential for aproaching several problems of ecology from disturbance pickett et al 1989 to the additivity of multiple disturbances móréh et al 2021 3 vertical links from molecules to the biosphere this chapter gives a number of examples structured along organizational levels as clearly as possible approaching particular problems is like playing chutes ad ladders on these vertical strings i note here the difference between matching top down and bottom up processes in food web research hunter and price 1992 both correspond to horizontal effects in the present context different network types belonging to various organizational levels have rich literature signal transduction networks wang and albert 2011 gene regulation networks dobrin et al 2004 metabolic networks ma and zeng 2003 microbiome networks turnbaugh et al 2017 animal social networks krause et al 2007 food webs pimm 1982 other ecological interaction networks olff et al 2009 thébault and fontaine 2010 and metacommunity networks meliá et al 2016 all have vertical links to the next or even further levels in the hierarchy of life beyond studying these networks separately one may purely compare them suh 2005 jordán et al 2010 saavedra et al 2011 or link them in network models even dynamically scotti et al 2013 scotti and jordán 2017 defining a finite set of organizational levels may be an endless problem and this paper does not want to go into this direction the overview below is not complete in any sense but offers a hopefully inspiring set of example for the multiplicity of vertical connections amongst some organizational levels with many examples fig 1 studying the multiplicity of these processes we may much better understand hierarchy fig 2 shows the hierarchical nested nature of these systems networks where nodes compose a network and in turn the network is a node in a higher level network 3 1 molecules to cells and species phylogenetically different organisms have largely different but characteristic metabolic networks ma and zeng 2003 where average path length differs for bacteria and eukaryotes and archaea the topology of metabolic links can be thus arranged in different ways yet some other higher level structures are similar for all domains i e small world property the positional importance of particular metabolites in the whole network correlates with their phylogenetic profile adding a functional aspect to the node to network topological relationship liu et al 2007 the functioning of the metabolic system is quite directly linked to various phenotypic traits of the organism with major consequences on its ecological relationships nisbet et al 2000 this may also lead to predictive models focusing on the constraints acting on community assembly van de waal et al 2018 ecological stoichiometry may be one of the few research areas where vertical linkages amongst organizational levels are studied in mechanistic details sterner et al 1992 elser et al 2000 sterner and elser 2003 position of proteins in protein protein interaction networks may also help to understand their functional importance and conservativism jeong et al 2001 mihalik and csermely 2011 or infer their pleiotropic effects nguyen et al 2011 molecular chaperones are known for being hubs in protein protein interaction networks involved mostly in weak interactions korcsmáros et al 2007 3 2 cells to organs the patterns of connected neurons is clearly essential for the functioning of the brain and large scale topological features of neural networks basic design principles have been discussed decades ago ashby 1960 connections are clearly important in the nervous system but also in other tissues in embryonic epithelia the number of neighbours seems to correlate well with collective cell behaviour sandersius et al 2011 simple topological features thus determine to some extent functioning at a higher level major structures may also depend on local developmental rules cell adhesion properties define the topology and the three dimensional architecture of tissues and ultimately of organs goodwin and nelson 2017 3 3 microbes to the microbiome of the invidual there is growing evidence that the health and behaviour of individual organisms may largely depend on the composition and functioning of their gut microbiome in many cases the gut microbiome acts as an interface between the environment including food quality and the fitness of the individual hegg et al 2021 interestingly this may be largely independent of the host genotype with a strong environmental determination hegg et al 2021 microbial diversity may be an important component of biodiversity with effects up to the level of whole ecosystems torsvik and øvreås 2002 interaction patterns connect co occurring microorganisms in large networks faust et al 2012 potentially with key organisms dominating the dynamics of the system berry and widder 2014 jordán et al 2015 the structure of microbial communities the social network of conflict and cooperation may depend on external input zengler and zaramela 2018 suggesting that mapping both the causes and the consequences of systemic properties are important for linking different levels 3 4 individuals to social groups in species of a relatively high level of sociality the success and behaviour of individuals can be better understood if their place in the social structure is known e g for sexual interactions edenbrow et al 2011 also group behaviour can be interpreted better in view of the invidivuals that compose the social group in primitively eusocial insects the mechanism of queen choice and the determination of the new queen is a major issue to solve bhadra and gadagkar 2008 and the network position of individuals may play a role here bhadra and jordán 2013 some individuals may play an outstandingly important role in the group for example by policing flack et al 2006 making a large impact on the structure of the social network research on the role individual organisms play in social groups is evolving from focusing almost exclusively on dominance hierarchies pecking orders to multi networks of several interaction types 3 5 social groups to populations it is not always easy to make a diference between social groups and local populations the border is particularly unclear for fission fusion societies elephants de silva et al 2011 vance et al 2009 where the environment e g rainfall seasonality has a large effect on social structure at fine time scales fission of social groups related to demographic effects may cause genetic differentiation of a local population melnick kidd 1983 in some cases the mating system is the key to linking social groups and local populations for example closely related females may dominate in a social group and mobile males connect the different groups of the population lacey and wieczorek 2004 3 6 social groups to inter specific interactions whether and how sociality and social network properties can influence and be influenced by various inter specific interactions is an emerging question in fact this problem links three levels as individual behaviour determines the social network that in turn has an effect on predators or on the prey for example looking from the top down one of the actual challenges in food web research is considering individual level variability instead of considering interactiong populations as black boxes with homogeneous particles within a population widely different distributions can be experienced for age possible with life stage specific consequences on mortality davies et al 2014 health conditions hallier and gaertner 2008 and many other traits e g mobility considering the structure of the group one can make a difference between individuals also based on their social network position as the way individuals are connected to each other may influence the properties of the social group it is not surprising that this may be linked to inter specific interactions predation parasitism competition higher predation pressure may decrease the number of male male associations edenbrow et al 2011 and predation risk can change the frequency of behavioural patterns blumstein 1998 for example by preferring behaviours performed closer to refugia social network position of prey also influences the sense of security central individuals feel more secure and produce noisier calls fuong and blumstein 2019 while vigilance itself has not been shown to correlate with network position mady and blumstein 2017 paper wasps respond differently to various predators like ants or vespidae gadagkar 2001 having stronger defence against ants but the social network can also be reorganized in the presence of vespa the social networks of various prey species are different as a function of predator pressure barton et al 1996 hasenjager and dugatkin 2017 the relationship between the success of individuals and social groups the organization of group structure and the optimization and group size can be quite complicated krause and ruxton 2002 anti predator behaviour is an emergent benefit in groups but also the attack rate can be higher in case of groups but social transmission of information works also for predators learning about prey defence hämäläinen et al 2021 fisheries as a special form of predation can selectively influence the stock population and its social network for example juvenile females may occupy more central network positions williams and lusseau 2006 this link is strongly bidirectional from the bottom up different behaviour of juvenile and adult fish influence the success of various fisheries regimes for example juvenile yellowfin tuna is expected to be positioned closer to fish aggregating devices ménard et al 2000 the social network of the predator may also heavily depend on the prey species killer whale social networks are more interconnected in the years of higher salmon abundance foster et al 2012 and in turn this may influence the maintenance of cooperation and the transmission of information and disease the success of parasites may depend on their transmission rates so the strength of host parasite interactions may depend on social network structure there is increasing evidence that social network topology e g clustering modularity does influence the spread of diseases krause et al 2007 naug 2008 rushmore et al 2017 this may also have a seasonal aspect in the case of a tumour related disease hamede et al 2009 beyond tumors also the spread of tuberculosis has been shown to depend on the social network temporally stable ones in this case drewe et al 2011 in this latter case also the type of the interaction was shown to be important transmission probability was correlated more with grooming than with agression there was also a difference between donors and recipients of the grooming acts competiton for space use may have an effect on the social networks of the competing species lewis et al 2017 although not expressed explicitly in terms of social network topology the level of sociality has been shown to be related to niche breadth and inter specific competition bison et al 2015 3 7 individuals to ecosystems considering intra specific heterogeneity amongst individuals may help a lot to understand food webs and ecosystem level patterns genetic phenotypic e g metabolic rates and behavioural variability often lead to speciation reorganizing inter specific interactions and their networks melian et al 2011 trait based analyses are increasingly helpful not only for making difference amongst species but also amongst individuals novel techniques e g next generation sequencing will strongly support this research direction in the future for eastern baltic cod gadus morhua individual level variability of metabolic processes has been shown to influence behaviour and inter specific interactions pierce et al 2017 some individuals may have a disproportionately large effect on system level processes and patterns qualifying as keystone individuals modlmeier et al 2014 their role can be related to reproduction information processing finding resources dispersing to novel areas managing conflicts or just keeping the social group coherent see modlmeier et al 2014 and references therein finding keystone individuals is probably more likely in small populations of large bodied keystone species but examples abound even for insects the structural compexity of habitats can influence social and reproductive behaviour having an effect on social network structure edenbrow et al 2011 for damselflies the habitat combined with the diet strongly affects individual behaviour and social structure pelagic feeders form shoals frequently while benthic feeders are typically solitary and territorial gajdzik et al 2016 3 8 species to ecosystems the question what do species do in ecosystems is a classical one lawton 1994 species do interact by various interaction types including predator prey interactions competition host parasite parasitoid plant pollinator plant seed disperser and mutualistic interactions olff et al 2009 since the various interaction types amongst coexisting species glue them together in ecological networks we may be interested both in how does the ecology of species depend on the community and how does the functioning of the community depend on some of the constituent species biological information traits demography genetics on individual species can be interpreted independently of the interaction network ecosystem engineers lawton and jones 1995 or compared to their position in the interaction network as positioning the parts within the whole according to some approaches its network position is the definition and quantification of the role of a particular species in the community luczkovich et a 2003 cirtwill et al 2018 jordán et al 2009 dynamical models then help to analyse in details often in a mechanistic way the real effects of individual species on community dynamics this is the classical problem of linking to structure to dynamics structure understood locally as the node positions in food webs for example pimm 1980 jordán et al 2008 fábián 2021 in some cases occupying a characteristic network position clearly implies importance wasp waist species cury et al 2000 the importance of these key species may sometimes become clear only after the loss of the particular species keyes et al 2021 in a temporal perspective one may study the roles individual species play in community assembly or succession uribe et al 2021 these dynamics may often lead to characteristic higher order patterns of multi species communities menge 1995 possible led by dominant or keystone species having larger than average effects on patterns at higher levels some species are positioned in such a way that these are able to switch between energy pathways pushing the whole community to an alternative state d alelio et al 2019 in many cases the question is not how are species linked to the whole community only to some intermediate level of higher level organization food web modules models gjata et al 2012 and experiments brose et al 2005 show that the really functional effects of species range up to roughly three steps along indirect chain effects this means that local network neighbourhoods autocatalytic cycles ulanowicz 1995 and interaction modules may be more functional than either individual species or multi species communities at this scale feedbacks ulanowicz 1995 and other dependencies are clearer patten and odum 1981 even if we only consider indirect effects up to three steps non local causalities emerge ulanowicz 1988 patten 1991 lászló 2004 zhao et al 2016 when interactions are patterned by habitat differences e g benthis vs pelagic krause et al 2003 or by body size and phylogeny rezende et al 2009 larger compartments may also appear the existence and arrangement of these compartments may have large consequences on community stability rezende et al 2009 and the functional organization and evolution of complex networks in general kovács et al 2010 it is also noted that in many cases we do not have clear and confirmed information about interactions but we are able to measure co occurrence of organisms this approach is used mostly for bacteria and other microorganisms chaffron et al 2021 but increasingly also for higher eukaryotes elo et al 2021 3 9 species to metacommunities a food web can also be a node in a higher level network metacommunities are local communities linked by spatial processes migration dispersal of several constituent species polis et al 1997a holyoak et al 2005 mccann et al 2005 rooney et al 2008 in a classical model well defined and spatially discrete habitat patches are inhabited by fairly mobile species that are interacting with each other and use the whole landscape by the dispersal of individuals although the situation is not always so nice for understanding the dynamics of many species and many species interactions considering multiple patches is essential patchiness mobility and fragmentation all have serious consequences on food webs in most cases these are selective for various species meliá et al 2016 fragmentation may mostly and most rapidly influence top predators kruess and tscharntke 1994 zabel and tscharntke 1998 crooks and soulé 1999 komonen 2000 in plant leaf miner communities fragmentation selectively causes larger species loss for specialist parasitoids and higher trophic levels cagnolo et al 2009 selectively altering food web structure will have further cascading consequences like weakening or strengthening biological control crooks and soulé 1999 the interference of various mechanisms like competition and dispersal may be a strong evolutionary force calling for various strategies thomas 2000 food web complexity may be partly a result of spatial processes where colonization rates and dispersal scales together shape network branching provided by omnivore and generalist species pillai et al 2011 in order to better assess the relevant spatiotemporal scales of dispersal novel methods are used for example lagrangian particle tracking the obtained connectivity metrics can shed light on critically important coral reef patches for maintaining connectivity and determine the length of pelagic larval duration clusters gamoyo et al 2019 on large scales in space and time range size and trophic position are quite strongly correlated as a consequence of selective survival at higher levels hamm and drossel 2021 in a multi species evolutionary system synchronization of fluctuations environmental effects and dispersal rates can jointly contribute to stability gouhier et al 2010 in some cases only a single or a few species are responsible for maintaining the connectivity between distant habitats yet the effect is important for example capelin migration can establish strong links between various marine systems huse and ellingsen 2008 conversely a few resident species may be responsible for the large scale movement of many others like krill hotspots in underwater canyons of the california current support several fish seabird and mammals by food provision santora et al 2018 in this case both the krill is a key organism and the canyons are key habitat patches moreover even if several species are responsible for the connections their early developmental stages might be really important the dispersal of pelagic larvae is the key to the spatial ecology of several benthic marine species cowen and sponaugle 2009 these spatial subsidies may then be responsible for population dynamics and inter specific interactions connectivity should thus be increasingly considered in conservation management for example in designing marine protected areas ospina alvarez et al 2020 lagrangian methods are helpful here to infer dispersal networks and build multispecies metacommunity models the structure of the connectivity network can have experimentally demonstrated effects on parasitism competition and predation food web complexity influencing the system at a higher level murakami et al 2008 inter specific interactions can be most sensitive to the selectivity of spatial dynamics if dispersal rates are different for the interacting partners guzman and srivastava 2020 predators and prey in phytotelma communities were shown to have a dispersal range of 350 m and 25 km respectively various traits body size trophic status dispersal rate have been shown to correlate with co occurrence patterns in metacommunities small sized species at lower trophic levels have limited dispersal potential and they form strongly linked subgroups while large sized species at higher trophic levels disperse more and ensure the spatial coupling of subgroups increasing metacommunity cohesion borthagaray et al 2014 it is noted that since various species use different spatiotemporal scales sampling a metacommunity network at multiple trophic levels is not easy mcleod et al 2021 apart of living organisms material transfers between different habitats can be equally important for example vegetation on semi arid islands may entirely depend on marine input polis et al 1997b in this case scavengers can be considered the organisms that establish the linkage between different habitats isolation may be more prevalent in terrestrial systems the structure and composition of plant frugivore mutualistic networks may depend on how connected the habitat patch the inhabit is missing species and interactions of the regional species pool can cause higher modularity compared to networks describing local communities in more connected habitats but the general structure is remarkably similar due to a few generalist bird species buitron jurado and sanz 2021 4 linking parts to the whole concepts and methods 4 1 concepts vertical thinking needs novel concepts and this was recognized decades ago for example ecosystems ecologists tended to think decades ago that approaching some particular problems focusing on a single species is not enough but studying the whole community may not be absolutely neccessary relevant subcommunities sets of coexisting species were proposed to be useful study objects these include the environ the subsystems of incoming and outgoing direct and indirect effects patten 1981 and the holon as a horizontal unit ratzé et al 2007 inspired by these and combined with network metrics the trophic field jordán 2001 quantifies the range of interactors influenced to various extent possibly divided into strong and weak partners as a function of a threshold jordán et al 2009 based on the concept of keystone species complexes daily et al 1993 and combined with the centrality of node groups everett and borgatti 1999 food web cores were suggested to potentially play important roles in ecosystem dynamics jordán et al 2019 the approach of connectivism is also based on multilevel analysis focusing on vertical connections amongst organizational levels not only in biology also in learning theory for example 4 2 methods of network analysis the part to whole relation is modelled by the node to graph relation in network analysis to see how a node is positioned in a graph suggests an idea and a measure what is the role of the part in the structre and functioning of the whole lau et al 2017 some network properties e g density have relevance and are used for almost all types of networks while others have been developed and applied only for particular network types see table 1 for some examples most measures of network position stem from some combinations of degree and distance the simplest way to characterize how a node is linked to a graph is to determine its degree the number of directly connected parts another basic information is whether the node is in the centre or towards to periphery in terms of distance to others a graph can be analysed by local node level measures e g node degree and also by global network level measures e g density when the node to graph relationship is to be understood one can be mostly interested in mesoscale network metrics e g modules centrality indices considering indirect effects one of the most straightforward ways how to links parts to whole is to quantify the centrality positional importance of nodes in graphs highly connected nodes hubs appear in most networks types and it has been shown that they may be of crucial imporance for the vulnerability of the whole system albert et al 2000 these key elements play a major role in establishing vertical connections to higher organizational levels various measures have been suggested in the past decades to find nodes in the middle of a network estrada 2007 also key positions in some derived versions of networks e g dominator trees allesina and bodini 2004 causality graphs jordán et al 2014 may turn out to be of high importance in ecosystem functoning moreover central groups of individuals in a social group borgatti 2006 and central groups of species in ecological communities ortiz et al 2017 jordán et al 2019 are getting increasing attention the issue of group cenrality has solid mathematical basis everett and borgatti 1999 and motivation from the field keystone species complex daily et al 1993 some nodes are of crucial importance mostly from a dynamical and or comparative point of view for example certain marine organisms may change their feeding behavoir switching between energy pathways stibor et al 2004 and occasionally they drive the whole system towards an alternative stable state d alelio et al 2019 certain species are responsible for connecting the lower and higher levels of food webs link species dale and beyeler 2001 wasp waist species cury et al 2000 models have shown that advantageous stable reliable food web structures can support the system only if there is enough flexibility e g prey switching jordán et al 2003 beyond studying graph nodes in crucial e g central positions one may be interested in the uniqueness of network positions this can be considered as another aspect of importance nodes in central positions interact richly while nodes in unique position are probably non replaceable similarity of neighbourhoods is thus an approach to quantify redundancy luczkovich et al 2003 jordán et al 2009 lai et al 2021 lin and liu 2021 nodes in unique positions can include link species in food webs or brokers in social networks these are highly non redundant parts of the system in various disciplines different network measures seem to be more suitable this is influenced also by history but mostly of course by the relevance of indices for example food web research focused on connectance cohen 1978 for decades with hot debates on what does it actually imply in social network analysis transitivity is a measure of old tradition farine and whitehead 2015 metacommunity ecology often emphasizes nestedness azeria and kolasa 2008 and metrics sensitive to connectedness jamoneau et al 2012 structural holes were studied in food webs sugihara 1984 and human social networks burt 1995 a range of system level network properties have been proposed in systems ecology decades ago e g hannon 1973 finn 1976 there is a great interest in cross seminating different methods amongst disciplines yet it is not guaranteed that every network analytical tool is relevant for every types of networks for example landscape graphs are spatial networks realized in the two dimensional plane and this is a strong constraint on their topology in terms of both which indices to use and what are the values for the shared indices computing the clustering coefficient of nodes in network realized in space for example should consider some upper limit on the number of neighbours on the contrary in a social network of individuals theoretically every individual can be a friend of every other one without these spatial constraints in different ways there is a shared interest in loops in different disciplines in social networks both human and animal loop sign can be of interest doreian and mrvar 1996 wey et al 2019 for food webs loop analysis was developed to gain simple qualitative results on the ultimate sign of effects levins 1974 dambacher et al 2002 ortiz et al 2015 bodini and clerici 2016 also in weighted food webs weight distribution in loops of different size was one approach to quantify stability de ruiter et al 1995 neutel et al 2002 loops are of interest for cybernetics and dynamical control as feedbacks of different sign have different consequences on functioning the relevant range of cascading effects i e the length of functional indirect interactions is a crucial question related to the meso scale view it has been shown that typically it is around 3 steps where indirect effects still matter brose et al 2005 but we know well documented indirect chain effects for much longer pathways estes et al 1998 arguments for indirect determination patten 1991 support the increasing interest in experimental and theoretical reserch on indirect interactions along the lines of the meso scale view network modules motifs compartments are increasingly studied in molecular networks holme et al 2003 social networks sah et al 2017 food webs guimerá et al 2010 leger et al 2015 and complex networks in general communities lancichinetti et al 2009 modular design is consider today as an universal design principle for complex networks especially with hierarchical organization wu and david 2002 modules have important roles in isolating the spread of diseases providing short feedbacks and defining smaller communities of nodes interest in the networks of networks emerged in different disciplines leading towards methodological integration for example the role of network fragmentation was recognised in both community ecology and landscape ecology discussed in parallel gonzalez et al 2011 multinetworks represent different interaction types amongst a set of agents multiplex battiston et al 2014 multilayer boccaletti et al 2014 kivelä et al 2014 their analysis is increasingly important for animal social networks e g dominance communication connectivity fragmentation lusseau 2003 koglmüller 2019 food webs completed by non trophic interactions bertness and shumway 1993 memmott 1999 bruno et al 2003 pocock et al 2011 pilosof et al 2017 and also landscape graphs e g dispersal physical connectivity baguette et al 2013 this may lead to parallel multiple edges amongst a pair of nodes multigraph for example both herbivory competition and pollination between possible the same partners bronstein 1994 when different types of networks are connected through a pair of nodes one from each network we can study interdependent interconnected networks loss of nodes or function in one network can cascade to the other network across these linking node pairs possibly causing also there changes gao et al 2012 in case of interdependent networks the joint dynamics is different from the dynamics of the two networks in isolation buldyrev et al 2010 danziger et al 2019 interconnected networks can be composed of both horizontal e g two social networks a gene regulation network and a signal transduction network and vertical networks e g a social network and a food web 4 3 other methods hierarchical multi scale and multi level processes can be studied in a bayesian framework and by machine learning tools mccaslin et al 2021 these help in the identification and interpretation of complex patterns caused by the multiplicity of interacting processes individual based agent based modelling ibm supports vertical modelling both in network models scotti et al 2013 and in general grimm and railsback 2005 deangelis and mooij 2005 since individual organisms are involved in multiple processes acting on several organization levels e g dominance in a social network predation in a trophic network dispersal in a spatial network ibm can naturally establish vertical links also mechanistically in this case the invididual agents are really individuals in a biological sense traditionally and still most typically social trophic and spatial interactions were considered in different frameworks in social networks in food webs and in metapopulation or metacommunity networks respectively ibms can intuitively and also very efficiently link these processes to offer a unified model focused on the level of the individual organism for example in the hierarchical stochastic ibm model of scotti et al 2013 every individual can be involved in social trophic and spatial processes with pre defined probabilities at each simulation step based on this approach one can explicity study wide ranging vertical effects like the effect of adding new social interactions on the spatial variability in metacommunity patches or vice versa it is noted however that the excitement of this approach is limited by the availability of data to parameterize simulation models this envisions a new research direction towards the analysis of agent based complex systems acs grimm et al 2005 an et al 2021 especially if standard protocols can be defined and widely used grimm et al 2006 individual based approaches may represent different sources of variability in greater detail than classical differential equation and difference equation models process algebra models jordán et al 2011 have been used to dynamically link multiple organizational levels scotti et al 2013 biologically speaking these are or can be made equivalent to individual based models where individual organisms can be involved in several processs at different organizational levels the above considerations concepts and methods are increasingly discussed in the literature e g gao et al 2014 in biology these are almost exclusively conceptual and or methodological papers e g fortin et al 2021 with no convincing case study yet demonstrating the power of topological metrics developed for and dedicated to vertical connections e g global inter clustering coefficient however a general interest in key habitat patches pereira et al 2017 key species jordán et al 2015 key individuals modlmeier et al 2014 key proteins nguyen et al 2011 and key genes bascompte et al 2022 shows the need for using topological measures for establishing these vertical connections 5 the individual organism somewhere in the middle of the ladder science often also falls into the trap of separating infra individual and supra individual biology leaving not too much in between webster and goodwin 1982 after the decades of molecular dominance in biology and the spectacular development of ecology currently we may see some kind of welcomed convergence systems biology offers models to put together molecular and cellular knowledge to build up the individual organism kitano 2002 while ecology is more interested in individual level heterogeneity bolnick et al 2003 tearing apart populations where vertical links can be considered as a chain of emergent properties cf el hani and emmeche 2000 this may help to fill the gap in the middle the traditionally under developed organismic centric view on biology goodwin 1989 facilitated also by the advances in the methodology of individual based modelling an integrative and composable approach today more and more applications can be seen where different organization levels are mutually help understanding being smartly connected instead of competing for the choice of biologists and the level of the individual organism seems to be more and more frequently in the focus with important relevance to adaptation and evolution west and kiers 2009 nicholson 2014 ketterson 2020 future ecology and systems based conservation although taking a whole system perspective should and will be capable of better explaining the individual linked both to its metabolism and to its ecosystem models and experiments should not make only one jump on the ladder upwards or downwards instead they should consider as much as possible the wide ranging relationships from molecules to the biosphere metabolic ecosystem models trait based ecology and individual based models all support this direction this kind of multi disciplinarity is not at the expense of details rather it can really provide a basis for understanding the mechanistic details of co existence 6 conclusions our knowledge is deeper and our confidence is stronger when thinking horizontally disciplinary borders and expertise support this convenience vertical thinking is probably more often inter disciplinary than horizontal one but connecting different organizational levels is not a luxury it is a need we increasingly see environmental effects causing changes at several levels calling for multi level ecosystem management mcdonald madden et al 2016 also hierarchical organization seems to be able to dampen the higher level effects of disturbances orginated at lower levels jörgensen et al 2016 in the era of global changes driven by multiple drivers it is increasingly imperative to think at several levels in a parallel connected and integrative way various direct and indirect effects propagate both horizontally e g from terrestrial to marine ecosystems and vertically e g from genes to landscapes and the biosphere was probably never such a strongly connected socio ecological system by feedback loops and other control mechanisms human influence should not be cnsidered as a next layer instead anthropogenetic effects disturb hierarchical ecological systems at multiple all layers the selectivity of fisheries was mentioned above directly influencing a number of selected commercially important target species in a marine food web but one could add also developmental stage specific fisheries selectively removing juvenile individuals from the population forestry with variable management scenarios for different habitat patches or probiotics selectively supporting microorganisms in the gut microbiota in all of these cases vertical effects cascade up and down functionally connecting different organizational levels if there is a novel layer implemented in a socio ecological system that is the economic system e g the global trade network interconnected with the ecological systems discussed here hannesson et al 1998 mullon 2014 glaum et al 2020 an operative approach to managing this multi level complexity combining horizontal and vertical thinking is to determine quantify and focus on key nodes in networks being a key agent molecule individual species reflects horizontal interactions within an organizational level but in a functional sense these key agents might have major impact on the next higher level cell social group community moreover the structural importance of particular nodes can only be revealed if interconnected networks are considered nodes of mean centrality can turn out to be central only in an extended network vaggi et al 2012 sharma et al 2022 it is not only about simplification and hopefully easier understanding it is also about controllability predictablity and management or at least this research direction may lead to these latter aims in a sense this is trivial and had been recognized by studies on hub proteins in the cell alpha males in social hierarchies keystone species in food webs and core habitats the challenge is to use the latest databases combined with novel methods of network analysis and to explicitly focus on vertical links connecting organizational levels concepts and methods are almost ready to use for ecologists fortin et al 2021 what is needed in the future is a series of case studies demonstrating the use and importance of network analytical tools developed for studying vertically connected networks e g global inter clustering coefficient global overlap see kivelä et al 2014 ideally network modelling exercises should go hand in hand with experimental research i e predicting and quantifying the effects of knock outs of lower level agents on higher level patterns or vice versa credit authorship contribution statement the sole author

24356,life is organized into more or less well defined organizational levels connected both horizontally and vertically our knowledge is richer along the horizontal levels e g inter specific interactions in multispecies communities while vertical thinking e g individual level variability of the prey in a predator prey interaction is more challenging more often crossing disciplinary borders this review overviews the major challenges concepts and network analysis related methods related to studying vertical processes giving a number of examples it is argued the network theory is essentially about linking parts to the whole and this is equivalent to connecting units at one level to a larger unit at the next level mostly but not only social networks food webs and landscape graphs are discussed methods and concepts in network research both classical and recently emerged for supporting this vertical thinking are discussed keywords network biological organization hierarchy part to whole data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 hierarchy life on earth is organized into levels these range from cells to meta ecosystems with several clear and more ambiguous intermediate levels similar entities interacting at one level build up an unit at the next higher level and each higher level entity is composed of several entities interacting at one level below a system at one scale is a part of another system at a higher scale up and down the hierarchy levin 1992 these system subsystem relationships are an important source of knowledge and understanding in various areas of biology from cell biology to ecology the main questions are the mutual relationships between parts and the whole miller 2008 first considering bottom up concerns how can individual components build up the whole system and how do the properties of a system depend on this allen and starr 1982 o neill et al 1986 second from a top down perspective how do the functioning and success of the parts depend on the constraints imposed by the whole system they belong to the main question addressed in this review is how are these hierarchical levels interconnected vertically and what are the challenges here müller 1992 scientific knowledge is mostly focused within the horizontal levels of biological organization for example cell biology knows a lot about proteins involved in signal transduction networks metabolites in metabolic networks and genes in gene regulation networks ma and zeng 2003 ethology and socio biology is studying individual organisms interacting in a social group forming social networks that characterize social groups krause and ruxton 2002 croft et al 2008 in community ecology research is focused on interacting species coexisting in a food web a local community is connected to others by spatial processes forming metacommunities objects of landscape ecology and the highest level of the biosphere discussed here all of these disciplines are interested in one maybe also in the neighbour levels crossing borders horizontally is challenging enough in most cases for example linking population dynamics and biogeochemistry jörgensen 2008 however vertical issues come up frequently and in all of these disciplines we do not have well established standard techniques to look at the vertical links jordán and jörgensen 2012 a review on quite a few attempts with a historical overview conceptual clarification e g hypergraph multigraph multi layer network interconnected network and a number of examples identifies topological indices e g global inter clustering coefficient global overlap developed for studying these vertical system subsystem relationships kivelä et al 2014 the lack of standard approaches is clear especially if three or more levels are addressed at the same time methodologically speaking we can say that network analysis is a great tool to approach this issue graph nodes and the graph being at two different horizontal levels of organization further saying that networks are not functioning independently in isolation but they are also connected to each other jörgensen and nielsen 2015 is equivalent to making two vertical steps in the organization the vertical levels of organization is a network of networks of networks issue one can also ask how do these networks interact either competitively or mutualistically beyond simply asking how they are connected this may lead to thermodynamical considerations about the efficiency of using resources and possible darwinian processes of selection this is the basis of the proposed ecological law of thermodynamics jörgensen 2012 from a systems perspective the dynamics of hierarchy can be described as the interactions and success of holons ratzé et al 2007 for sure evolutionary dynamics should not be addressed and cannot be understood at a single organizational levels vertical connections amongst horizontal levels may be at the heart of the problem of linking ecology and evolution proulx et al 2005 miller 2008 this is a more appropriate approach than simply considering the difference between ecology and evolution as only a matter of time scales this review is mostly focused on ecological systems yet supposing that ecology is the science of coexistence network issues linking interacting parts to wholes are always ecological issues to some extent in this sense proteins forming a signal transduction network have their ecology similar to cell types in a cancer ecosystem basanta and anderson 2013 this is a broader definition of ecology contradicting the views of hardcore ecologists defending the concept of the ecosystem from other disciplines like an innovation ecosystem ritala and almpanopoulou 2017 so it is suggested that linking cells to the biosphere if we always follow system subsystem relationships is pure ecology we can only assume that a broad minded thinker such as ernst haeckel would be open and supportive of such an encompassing use of his term this review is focused on interactions and networks acknowledging other aspects of systems theory including spatio temporal scales continuity membership and boundaries miller 2008 since we focus on connections and interactions it seems to go against the very principles to try to organize it linearly into chapters and subchapters yet for convenience this will be tried and a storyline will be provided although a storynetwork would be much more logical 2 vertical challenges horizontal thinking discussing problems at a single particular organizational level is increasingly challenged in food web research individual level variability in heterogeneous populations e g hampton and fournier 2001 calls for better connecting individuals and populations considering population structure in terms of demography trait distributions and interactions i e social networks this would help to refine the black box approach of earlier models where populations were predominantly considered a set of identical individuals considering individual level heterogeneity e g age structure trait distribution social organization can help to better descibe the trophic or spatial behaviour of populations for example in a predator prey interaction on the contrary understanding social behaviour may strongly depend on whether ecology is considered including both environmental parameters e g nutrient availability for prairie dogs jordán et al 2021 and interspecific interactions e g social cohesion and predation pressure barton et al 1996 in these cases considering mechanisms acting at higher levels are relevant or even indispensable for better describing lower level patterns beyond invididuals populations and multi species systems the need for vertical connections spans across all levels of biological organization metabolic coupling amongst a few bacterial species can be crucial for the functioning of whole communities of micro organisms freilich et al 2011 regimbeau et al 2022 and large scale spatial processes may constraint local community dynamics estes et al 1998 the variability of network structure is a crucial issue at each horizontal level first because of the methodological difficulties node composition in the network changes over time it is not easy to define the appropriate time window i e temporal resolution for best describing the relevant processes and the same for spatial scales i e how large is the network in a geographic sense yet if properly defined comparing several networks may show typical constant and atypical variable properties second because of variable network properties in space and time one can much better understand the adaptive potential at the system level but the source of variability may be found at other levels for example changes of individual behavioural strategies can result in very different social networks also prey switching mccard et al 2021 and omnivory kortsch et al 2019 generate a larger variability of pattern and networks multiple networks along spatial ortiz and wolff 2002 temporal baird and ulanowicz 1989 borrett et al 2006 spatio temporal kitching 1987 warren 1989 or other gradients ulanowicz 1996 are useful for understanding variability but their differences should be understood scaling issues frequently call for connecting different levels for example by aggregation fritsch et al 2020 scaling issues may be related to network structure for example in landscape graphs keitt et al 1997 the spatial structure of habitats is highly species specific so constructing a general landscape graph for a multispecies ecosystem must be based on some consensus on the dominant scale of spatial processes clearly what is a habitat network for soil invertebrates is only a habitat patch for birds or mammals in this case considering critically important community level processes or even identifying keystone species can be very helpful to define the most relevant spatial scale for the functionally best description of metacommunity dynamics multi level analyses of different networks are needed also in a variety of other disciplines including learning and knowledge management for organizations beeby and booth 2000 the adaptive capacity of governance regimes pahl wostl 2009 competition and cooperation in industrial systems farrell et al 1998 mapping part whole hierarchies into connectionist ai networks hinton 1990 industrial and urban metabolism zhang et al 2010 and security issues jordán 2008 also multi level thinking is essential for aproaching several problems of ecology from disturbance pickett et al 1989 to the additivity of multiple disturbances móréh et al 2021 3 vertical links from molecules to the biosphere this chapter gives a number of examples structured along organizational levels as clearly as possible approaching particular problems is like playing chutes ad ladders on these vertical strings i note here the difference between matching top down and bottom up processes in food web research hunter and price 1992 both correspond to horizontal effects in the present context different network types belonging to various organizational levels have rich literature signal transduction networks wang and albert 2011 gene regulation networks dobrin et al 2004 metabolic networks ma and zeng 2003 microbiome networks turnbaugh et al 2017 animal social networks krause et al 2007 food webs pimm 1982 other ecological interaction networks olff et al 2009 thébault and fontaine 2010 and metacommunity networks meliá et al 2016 all have vertical links to the next or even further levels in the hierarchy of life beyond studying these networks separately one may purely compare them suh 2005 jordán et al 2010 saavedra et al 2011 or link them in network models even dynamically scotti et al 2013 scotti and jordán 2017 defining a finite set of organizational levels may be an endless problem and this paper does not want to go into this direction the overview below is not complete in any sense but offers a hopefully inspiring set of example for the multiplicity of vertical connections amongst some organizational levels with many examples fig 1 studying the multiplicity of these processes we may much better understand hierarchy fig 2 shows the hierarchical nested nature of these systems networks where nodes compose a network and in turn the network is a node in a higher level network 3 1 molecules to cells and species phylogenetically different organisms have largely different but characteristic metabolic networks ma and zeng 2003 where average path length differs for bacteria and eukaryotes and archaea the topology of metabolic links can be thus arranged in different ways yet some other higher level structures are similar for all domains i e small world property the positional importance of particular metabolites in the whole network correlates with their phylogenetic profile adding a functional aspect to the node to network topological relationship liu et al 2007 the functioning of the metabolic system is quite directly linked to various phenotypic traits of the organism with major consequences on its ecological relationships nisbet et al 2000 this may also lead to predictive models focusing on the constraints acting on community assembly van de waal et al 2018 ecological stoichiometry may be one of the few research areas where vertical linkages amongst organizational levels are studied in mechanistic details sterner et al 1992 elser et al 2000 sterner and elser 2003 position of proteins in protein protein interaction networks may also help to understand their functional importance and conservativism jeong et al 2001 mihalik and csermely 2011 or infer their pleiotropic effects nguyen et al 2011 molecular chaperones are known for being hubs in protein protein interaction networks involved mostly in weak interactions korcsmáros et al 2007 3 2 cells to organs the patterns of connected neurons is clearly essential for the functioning of the brain and large scale topological features of neural networks basic design principles have been discussed decades ago ashby 1960 connections are clearly important in the nervous system but also in other tissues in embryonic epithelia the number of neighbours seems to correlate well with collective cell behaviour sandersius et al 2011 simple topological features thus determine to some extent functioning at a higher level major structures may also depend on local developmental rules cell adhesion properties define the topology and the three dimensional architecture of tissues and ultimately of organs goodwin and nelson 2017 3 3 microbes to the microbiome of the invidual there is growing evidence that the health and behaviour of individual organisms may largely depend on the composition and functioning of their gut microbiome in many cases the gut microbiome acts as an interface between the environment including food quality and the fitness of the individual hegg et al 2021 interestingly this may be largely independent of the host genotype with a strong environmental determination hegg et al 2021 microbial diversity may be an important component of biodiversity with effects up to the level of whole ecosystems torsvik and øvreås 2002 interaction patterns connect co occurring microorganisms in large networks faust et al 2012 potentially with key organisms dominating the dynamics of the system berry and widder 2014 jordán et al 2015 the structure of microbial communities the social network of conflict and cooperation may depend on external input zengler and zaramela 2018 suggesting that mapping both the causes and the consequences of systemic properties are important for linking different levels 3 4 individuals to social groups in species of a relatively high level of sociality the success and behaviour of individuals can be better understood if their place in the social structure is known e g for sexual interactions edenbrow et al 2011 also group behaviour can be interpreted better in view of the invidivuals that compose the social group in primitively eusocial insects the mechanism of queen choice and the determination of the new queen is a major issue to solve bhadra and gadagkar 2008 and the network position of individuals may play a role here bhadra and jordán 2013 some individuals may play an outstandingly important role in the group for example by policing flack et al 2006 making a large impact on the structure of the social network research on the role individual organisms play in social groups is evolving from focusing almost exclusively on dominance hierarchies pecking orders to multi networks of several interaction types 3 5 social groups to populations it is not always easy to make a diference between social groups and local populations the border is particularly unclear for fission fusion societies elephants de silva et al 2011 vance et al 2009 where the environment e g rainfall seasonality has a large effect on social structure at fine time scales fission of social groups related to demographic effects may cause genetic differentiation of a local population melnick kidd 1983 in some cases the mating system is the key to linking social groups and local populations for example closely related females may dominate in a social group and mobile males connect the different groups of the population lacey and wieczorek 2004 3 6 social groups to inter specific interactions whether and how sociality and social network properties can influence and be influenced by various inter specific interactions is an emerging question in fact this problem links three levels as individual behaviour determines the social network that in turn has an effect on predators or on the prey for example looking from the top down one of the actual challenges in food web research is considering individual level variability instead of considering interactiong populations as black boxes with homogeneous particles within a population widely different distributions can be experienced for age possible with life stage specific consequences on mortality davies et al 2014 health conditions hallier and gaertner 2008 and many other traits e g mobility considering the structure of the group one can make a difference between individuals also based on their social network position as the way individuals are connected to each other may influence the properties of the social group it is not surprising that this may be linked to inter specific interactions predation parasitism competition higher predation pressure may decrease the number of male male associations edenbrow et al 2011 and predation risk can change the frequency of behavioural patterns blumstein 1998 for example by preferring behaviours performed closer to refugia social network position of prey also influences the sense of security central individuals feel more secure and produce noisier calls fuong and blumstein 2019 while vigilance itself has not been shown to correlate with network position mady and blumstein 2017 paper wasps respond differently to various predators like ants or vespidae gadagkar 2001 having stronger defence against ants but the social network can also be reorganized in the presence of vespa the social networks of various prey species are different as a function of predator pressure barton et al 1996 hasenjager and dugatkin 2017 the relationship between the success of individuals and social groups the organization of group structure and the optimization and group size can be quite complicated krause and ruxton 2002 anti predator behaviour is an emergent benefit in groups but also the attack rate can be higher in case of groups but social transmission of information works also for predators learning about prey defence hämäläinen et al 2021 fisheries as a special form of predation can selectively influence the stock population and its social network for example juvenile females may occupy more central network positions williams and lusseau 2006 this link is strongly bidirectional from the bottom up different behaviour of juvenile and adult fish influence the success of various fisheries regimes for example juvenile yellowfin tuna is expected to be positioned closer to fish aggregating devices ménard et al 2000 the social network of the predator may also heavily depend on the prey species killer whale social networks are more interconnected in the years of higher salmon abundance foster et al 2012 and in turn this may influence the maintenance of cooperation and the transmission of information and disease the success of parasites may depend on their transmission rates so the strength of host parasite interactions may depend on social network structure there is increasing evidence that social network topology e g clustering modularity does influence the spread of diseases krause et al 2007 naug 2008 rushmore et al 2017 this may also have a seasonal aspect in the case of a tumour related disease hamede et al 2009 beyond tumors also the spread of tuberculosis has been shown to depend on the social network temporally stable ones in this case drewe et al 2011 in this latter case also the type of the interaction was shown to be important transmission probability was correlated more with grooming than with agression there was also a difference between donors and recipients of the grooming acts competiton for space use may have an effect on the social networks of the competing species lewis et al 2017 although not expressed explicitly in terms of social network topology the level of sociality has been shown to be related to niche breadth and inter specific competition bison et al 2015 3 7 individuals to ecosystems considering intra specific heterogeneity amongst individuals may help a lot to understand food webs and ecosystem level patterns genetic phenotypic e g metabolic rates and behavioural variability often lead to speciation reorganizing inter specific interactions and their networks melian et al 2011 trait based analyses are increasingly helpful not only for making difference amongst species but also amongst individuals novel techniques e g next generation sequencing will strongly support this research direction in the future for eastern baltic cod gadus morhua individual level variability of metabolic processes has been shown to influence behaviour and inter specific interactions pierce et al 2017 some individuals may have a disproportionately large effect on system level processes and patterns qualifying as keystone individuals modlmeier et al 2014 their role can be related to reproduction information processing finding resources dispersing to novel areas managing conflicts or just keeping the social group coherent see modlmeier et al 2014 and references therein finding keystone individuals is probably more likely in small populations of large bodied keystone species but examples abound even for insects the structural compexity of habitats can influence social and reproductive behaviour having an effect on social network structure edenbrow et al 2011 for damselflies the habitat combined with the diet strongly affects individual behaviour and social structure pelagic feeders form shoals frequently while benthic feeders are typically solitary and territorial gajdzik et al 2016 3 8 species to ecosystems the question what do species do in ecosystems is a classical one lawton 1994 species do interact by various interaction types including predator prey interactions competition host parasite parasitoid plant pollinator plant seed disperser and mutualistic interactions olff et al 2009 since the various interaction types amongst coexisting species glue them together in ecological networks we may be interested both in how does the ecology of species depend on the community and how does the functioning of the community depend on some of the constituent species biological information traits demography genetics on individual species can be interpreted independently of the interaction network ecosystem engineers lawton and jones 1995 or compared to their position in the interaction network as positioning the parts within the whole according to some approaches its network position is the definition and quantification of the role of a particular species in the community luczkovich et a 2003 cirtwill et al 2018 jordán et al 2009 dynamical models then help to analyse in details often in a mechanistic way the real effects of individual species on community dynamics this is the classical problem of linking to structure to dynamics structure understood locally as the node positions in food webs for example pimm 1980 jordán et al 2008 fábián 2021 in some cases occupying a characteristic network position clearly implies importance wasp waist species cury et al 2000 the importance of these key species may sometimes become clear only after the loss of the particular species keyes et al 2021 in a temporal perspective one may study the roles individual species play in community assembly or succession uribe et al 2021 these dynamics may often lead to characteristic higher order patterns of multi species communities menge 1995 possible led by dominant or keystone species having larger than average effects on patterns at higher levels some species are positioned in such a way that these are able to switch between energy pathways pushing the whole community to an alternative state d alelio et al 2019 in many cases the question is not how are species linked to the whole community only to some intermediate level of higher level organization food web modules models gjata et al 2012 and experiments brose et al 2005 show that the really functional effects of species range up to roughly three steps along indirect chain effects this means that local network neighbourhoods autocatalytic cycles ulanowicz 1995 and interaction modules may be more functional than either individual species or multi species communities at this scale feedbacks ulanowicz 1995 and other dependencies are clearer patten and odum 1981 even if we only consider indirect effects up to three steps non local causalities emerge ulanowicz 1988 patten 1991 lászló 2004 zhao et al 2016 when interactions are patterned by habitat differences e g benthis vs pelagic krause et al 2003 or by body size and phylogeny rezende et al 2009 larger compartments may also appear the existence and arrangement of these compartments may have large consequences on community stability rezende et al 2009 and the functional organization and evolution of complex networks in general kovács et al 2010 it is also noted that in many cases we do not have clear and confirmed information about interactions but we are able to measure co occurrence of organisms this approach is used mostly for bacteria and other microorganisms chaffron et al 2021 but increasingly also for higher eukaryotes elo et al 2021 3 9 species to metacommunities a food web can also be a node in a higher level network metacommunities are local communities linked by spatial processes migration dispersal of several constituent species polis et al 1997a holyoak et al 2005 mccann et al 2005 rooney et al 2008 in a classical model well defined and spatially discrete habitat patches are inhabited by fairly mobile species that are interacting with each other and use the whole landscape by the dispersal of individuals although the situation is not always so nice for understanding the dynamics of many species and many species interactions considering multiple patches is essential patchiness mobility and fragmentation all have serious consequences on food webs in most cases these are selective for various species meliá et al 2016 fragmentation may mostly and most rapidly influence top predators kruess and tscharntke 1994 zabel and tscharntke 1998 crooks and soulé 1999 komonen 2000 in plant leaf miner communities fragmentation selectively causes larger species loss for specialist parasitoids and higher trophic levels cagnolo et al 2009 selectively altering food web structure will have further cascading consequences like weakening or strengthening biological control crooks and soulé 1999 the interference of various mechanisms like competition and dispersal may be a strong evolutionary force calling for various strategies thomas 2000 food web complexity may be partly a result of spatial processes where colonization rates and dispersal scales together shape network branching provided by omnivore and generalist species pillai et al 2011 in order to better assess the relevant spatiotemporal scales of dispersal novel methods are used for example lagrangian particle tracking the obtained connectivity metrics can shed light on critically important coral reef patches for maintaining connectivity and determine the length of pelagic larval duration clusters gamoyo et al 2019 on large scales in space and time range size and trophic position are quite strongly correlated as a consequence of selective survival at higher levels hamm and drossel 2021 in a multi species evolutionary system synchronization of fluctuations environmental effects and dispersal rates can jointly contribute to stability gouhier et al 2010 in some cases only a single or a few species are responsible for maintaining the connectivity between distant habitats yet the effect is important for example capelin migration can establish strong links between various marine systems huse and ellingsen 2008 conversely a few resident species may be responsible for the large scale movement of many others like krill hotspots in underwater canyons of the california current support several fish seabird and mammals by food provision santora et al 2018 in this case both the krill is a key organism and the canyons are key habitat patches moreover even if several species are responsible for the connections their early developmental stages might be really important the dispersal of pelagic larvae is the key to the spatial ecology of several benthic marine species cowen and sponaugle 2009 these spatial subsidies may then be responsible for population dynamics and inter specific interactions connectivity should thus be increasingly considered in conservation management for example in designing marine protected areas ospina alvarez et al 2020 lagrangian methods are helpful here to infer dispersal networks and build multispecies metacommunity models the structure of the connectivity network can have experimentally demonstrated effects on parasitism competition and predation food web complexity influencing the system at a higher level murakami et al 2008 inter specific interactions can be most sensitive to the selectivity of spatial dynamics if dispersal rates are different for the interacting partners guzman and srivastava 2020 predators and prey in phytotelma communities were shown to have a dispersal range of 350 m and 25 km respectively various traits body size trophic status dispersal rate have been shown to correlate with co occurrence patterns in metacommunities small sized species at lower trophic levels have limited dispersal potential and they form strongly linked subgroups while large sized species at higher trophic levels disperse more and ensure the spatial coupling of subgroups increasing metacommunity cohesion borthagaray et al 2014 it is noted that since various species use different spatiotemporal scales sampling a metacommunity network at multiple trophic levels is not easy mcleod et al 2021 apart of living organisms material transfers between different habitats can be equally important for example vegetation on semi arid islands may entirely depend on marine input polis et al 1997b in this case scavengers can be considered the organisms that establish the linkage between different habitats isolation may be more prevalent in terrestrial systems the structure and composition of plant frugivore mutualistic networks may depend on how connected the habitat patch the inhabit is missing species and interactions of the regional species pool can cause higher modularity compared to networks describing local communities in more connected habitats but the general structure is remarkably similar due to a few generalist bird species buitron jurado and sanz 2021 4 linking parts to the whole concepts and methods 4 1 concepts vertical thinking needs novel concepts and this was recognized decades ago for example ecosystems ecologists tended to think decades ago that approaching some particular problems focusing on a single species is not enough but studying the whole community may not be absolutely neccessary relevant subcommunities sets of coexisting species were proposed to be useful study objects these include the environ the subsystems of incoming and outgoing direct and indirect effects patten 1981 and the holon as a horizontal unit ratzé et al 2007 inspired by these and combined with network metrics the trophic field jordán 2001 quantifies the range of interactors influenced to various extent possibly divided into strong and weak partners as a function of a threshold jordán et al 2009 based on the concept of keystone species complexes daily et al 1993 and combined with the centrality of node groups everett and borgatti 1999 food web cores were suggested to potentially play important roles in ecosystem dynamics jordán et al 2019 the approach of connectivism is also based on multilevel analysis focusing on vertical connections amongst organizational levels not only in biology also in learning theory for example 4 2 methods of network analysis the part to whole relation is modelled by the node to graph relation in network analysis to see how a node is positioned in a graph suggests an idea and a measure what is the role of the part in the structre and functioning of the whole lau et al 2017 some network properties e g density have relevance and are used for almost all types of networks while others have been developed and applied only for particular network types see table 1 for some examples most measures of network position stem from some combinations of degree and distance the simplest way to characterize how a node is linked to a graph is to determine its degree the number of directly connected parts another basic information is whether the node is in the centre or towards to periphery in terms of distance to others a graph can be analysed by local node level measures e g node degree and also by global network level measures e g density when the node to graph relationship is to be understood one can be mostly interested in mesoscale network metrics e g modules centrality indices considering indirect effects one of the most straightforward ways how to links parts to whole is to quantify the centrality positional importance of nodes in graphs highly connected nodes hubs appear in most networks types and it has been shown that they may be of crucial imporance for the vulnerability of the whole system albert et al 2000 these key elements play a major role in establishing vertical connections to higher organizational levels various measures have been suggested in the past decades to find nodes in the middle of a network estrada 2007 also key positions in some derived versions of networks e g dominator trees allesina and bodini 2004 causality graphs jordán et al 2014 may turn out to be of high importance in ecosystem functoning moreover central groups of individuals in a social group borgatti 2006 and central groups of species in ecological communities ortiz et al 2017 jordán et al 2019 are getting increasing attention the issue of group cenrality has solid mathematical basis everett and borgatti 1999 and motivation from the field keystone species complex daily et al 1993 some nodes are of crucial importance mostly from a dynamical and or comparative point of view for example certain marine organisms may change their feeding behavoir switching between energy pathways stibor et al 2004 and occasionally they drive the whole system towards an alternative stable state d alelio et al 2019 certain species are responsible for connecting the lower and higher levels of food webs link species dale and beyeler 2001 wasp waist species cury et al 2000 models have shown that advantageous stable reliable food web structures can support the system only if there is enough flexibility e g prey switching jordán et al 2003 beyond studying graph nodes in crucial e g central positions one may be interested in the uniqueness of network positions this can be considered as another aspect of importance nodes in central positions interact richly while nodes in unique position are probably non replaceable similarity of neighbourhoods is thus an approach to quantify redundancy luczkovich et al 2003 jordán et al 2009 lai et al 2021 lin and liu 2021 nodes in unique positions can include link species in food webs or brokers in social networks these are highly non redundant parts of the system in various disciplines different network measures seem to be more suitable this is influenced also by history but mostly of course by the relevance of indices for example food web research focused on connectance cohen 1978 for decades with hot debates on what does it actually imply in social network analysis transitivity is a measure of old tradition farine and whitehead 2015 metacommunity ecology often emphasizes nestedness azeria and kolasa 2008 and metrics sensitive to connectedness jamoneau et al 2012 structural holes were studied in food webs sugihara 1984 and human social networks burt 1995 a range of system level network properties have been proposed in systems ecology decades ago e g hannon 1973 finn 1976 there is a great interest in cross seminating different methods amongst disciplines yet it is not guaranteed that every network analytical tool is relevant for every types of networks for example landscape graphs are spatial networks realized in the two dimensional plane and this is a strong constraint on their topology in terms of both which indices to use and what are the values for the shared indices computing the clustering coefficient of nodes in network realized in space for example should consider some upper limit on the number of neighbours on the contrary in a social network of individuals theoretically every individual can be a friend of every other one without these spatial constraints in different ways there is a shared interest in loops in different disciplines in social networks both human and animal loop sign can be of interest doreian and mrvar 1996 wey et al 2019 for food webs loop analysis was developed to gain simple qualitative results on the ultimate sign of effects levins 1974 dambacher et al 2002 ortiz et al 2015 bodini and clerici 2016 also in weighted food webs weight distribution in loops of different size was one approach to quantify stability de ruiter et al 1995 neutel et al 2002 loops are of interest for cybernetics and dynamical control as feedbacks of different sign have different consequences on functioning the relevant range of cascading effects i e the length of functional indirect interactions is a crucial question related to the meso scale view it has been shown that typically it is around 3 steps where indirect effects still matter brose et al 2005 but we know well documented indirect chain effects for much longer pathways estes et al 1998 arguments for indirect determination patten 1991 support the increasing interest in experimental and theoretical reserch on indirect interactions along the lines of the meso scale view network modules motifs compartments are increasingly studied in molecular networks holme et al 2003 social networks sah et al 2017 food webs guimerá et al 2010 leger et al 2015 and complex networks in general communities lancichinetti et al 2009 modular design is consider today as an universal design principle for complex networks especially with hierarchical organization wu and david 2002 modules have important roles in isolating the spread of diseases providing short feedbacks and defining smaller communities of nodes interest in the networks of networks emerged in different disciplines leading towards methodological integration for example the role of network fragmentation was recognised in both community ecology and landscape ecology discussed in parallel gonzalez et al 2011 multinetworks represent different interaction types amongst a set of agents multiplex battiston et al 2014 multilayer boccaletti et al 2014 kivelä et al 2014 their analysis is increasingly important for animal social networks e g dominance communication connectivity fragmentation lusseau 2003 koglmüller 2019 food webs completed by non trophic interactions bertness and shumway 1993 memmott 1999 bruno et al 2003 pocock et al 2011 pilosof et al 2017 and also landscape graphs e g dispersal physical connectivity baguette et al 2013 this may lead to parallel multiple edges amongst a pair of nodes multigraph for example both herbivory competition and pollination between possible the same partners bronstein 1994 when different types of networks are connected through a pair of nodes one from each network we can study interdependent interconnected networks loss of nodes or function in one network can cascade to the other network across these linking node pairs possibly causing also there changes gao et al 2012 in case of interdependent networks the joint dynamics is different from the dynamics of the two networks in isolation buldyrev et al 2010 danziger et al 2019 interconnected networks can be composed of both horizontal e g two social networks a gene regulation network and a signal transduction network and vertical networks e g a social network and a food web 4 3 other methods hierarchical multi scale and multi level processes can be studied in a bayesian framework and by machine learning tools mccaslin et al 2021 these help in the identification and interpretation of complex patterns caused by the multiplicity of interacting processes individual based agent based modelling ibm supports vertical modelling both in network models scotti et al 2013 and in general grimm and railsback 2005 deangelis and mooij 2005 since individual organisms are involved in multiple processes acting on several organization levels e g dominance in a social network predation in a trophic network dispersal in a spatial network ibm can naturally establish vertical links also mechanistically in this case the invididual agents are really individuals in a biological sense traditionally and still most typically social trophic and spatial interactions were considered in different frameworks in social networks in food webs and in metapopulation or metacommunity networks respectively ibms can intuitively and also very efficiently link these processes to offer a unified model focused on the level of the individual organism for example in the hierarchical stochastic ibm model of scotti et al 2013 every individual can be involved in social trophic and spatial processes with pre defined probabilities at each simulation step based on this approach one can explicity study wide ranging vertical effects like the effect of adding new social interactions on the spatial variability in metacommunity patches or vice versa it is noted however that the excitement of this approach is limited by the availability of data to parameterize simulation models this envisions a new research direction towards the analysis of agent based complex systems acs grimm et al 2005 an et al 2021 especially if standard protocols can be defined and widely used grimm et al 2006 individual based approaches may represent different sources of variability in greater detail than classical differential equation and difference equation models process algebra models jordán et al 2011 have been used to dynamically link multiple organizational levels scotti et al 2013 biologically speaking these are or can be made equivalent to individual based models where individual organisms can be involved in several processs at different organizational levels the above considerations concepts and methods are increasingly discussed in the literature e g gao et al 2014 in biology these are almost exclusively conceptual and or methodological papers e g fortin et al 2021 with no convincing case study yet demonstrating the power of topological metrics developed for and dedicated to vertical connections e g global inter clustering coefficient however a general interest in key habitat patches pereira et al 2017 key species jordán et al 2015 key individuals modlmeier et al 2014 key proteins nguyen et al 2011 and key genes bascompte et al 2022 shows the need for using topological measures for establishing these vertical connections 5 the individual organism somewhere in the middle of the ladder science often also falls into the trap of separating infra individual and supra individual biology leaving not too much in between webster and goodwin 1982 after the decades of molecular dominance in biology and the spectacular development of ecology currently we may see some kind of welcomed convergence systems biology offers models to put together molecular and cellular knowledge to build up the individual organism kitano 2002 while ecology is more interested in individual level heterogeneity bolnick et al 2003 tearing apart populations where vertical links can be considered as a chain of emergent properties cf el hani and emmeche 2000 this may help to fill the gap in the middle the traditionally under developed organismic centric view on biology goodwin 1989 facilitated also by the advances in the methodology of individual based modelling an integrative and composable approach today more and more applications can be seen where different organization levels are mutually help understanding being smartly connected instead of competing for the choice of biologists and the level of the individual organism seems to be more and more frequently in the focus with important relevance to adaptation and evolution west and kiers 2009 nicholson 2014 ketterson 2020 future ecology and systems based conservation although taking a whole system perspective should and will be capable of better explaining the individual linked both to its metabolism and to its ecosystem models and experiments should not make only one jump on the ladder upwards or downwards instead they should consider as much as possible the wide ranging relationships from molecules to the biosphere metabolic ecosystem models trait based ecology and individual based models all support this direction this kind of multi disciplinarity is not at the expense of details rather it can really provide a basis for understanding the mechanistic details of co existence 6 conclusions our knowledge is deeper and our confidence is stronger when thinking horizontally disciplinary borders and expertise support this convenience vertical thinking is probably more often inter disciplinary than horizontal one but connecting different organizational levels is not a luxury it is a need we increasingly see environmental effects causing changes at several levels calling for multi level ecosystem management mcdonald madden et al 2016 also hierarchical organization seems to be able to dampen the higher level effects of disturbances orginated at lower levels jörgensen et al 2016 in the era of global changes driven by multiple drivers it is increasingly imperative to think at several levels in a parallel connected and integrative way various direct and indirect effects propagate both horizontally e g from terrestrial to marine ecosystems and vertically e g from genes to landscapes and the biosphere was probably never such a strongly connected socio ecological system by feedback loops and other control mechanisms human influence should not be cnsidered as a next layer instead anthropogenetic effects disturb hierarchical ecological systems at multiple all layers the selectivity of fisheries was mentioned above directly influencing a number of selected commercially important target species in a marine food web but one could add also developmental stage specific fisheries selectively removing juvenile individuals from the population forestry with variable management scenarios for different habitat patches or probiotics selectively supporting microorganisms in the gut microbiota in all of these cases vertical effects cascade up and down functionally connecting different organizational levels if there is a novel layer implemented in a socio ecological system that is the economic system e g the global trade network interconnected with the ecological systems discussed here hannesson et al 1998 mullon 2014 glaum et al 2020 an operative approach to managing this multi level complexity combining horizontal and vertical thinking is to determine quantify and focus on key nodes in networks being a key agent molecule individual species reflects horizontal interactions within an organizational level but in a functional sense these key agents might have major impact on the next higher level cell social group community moreover the structural importance of particular nodes can only be revealed if interconnected networks are considered nodes of mean centrality can turn out to be central only in an extended network vaggi et al 2012 sharma et al 2022 it is not only about simplification and hopefully easier understanding it is also about controllability predictablity and management or at least this research direction may lead to these latter aims in a sense this is trivial and had been recognized by studies on hub proteins in the cell alpha males in social hierarchies keystone species in food webs and core habitats the challenge is to use the latest databases combined with novel methods of network analysis and to explicitly focus on vertical links connecting organizational levels concepts and methods are almost ready to use for ecologists fortin et al 2021 what is needed in the future is a series of case studies demonstrating the use and importance of network analytical tools developed for studying vertically connected networks e g global inter clustering coefficient global overlap see kivelä et al 2014 ideally network modelling exercises should go hand in hand with experimental research i e predicting and quantifying the effects of knock outs of lower level agents on higher level patterns or vice versa credit authorship contribution statement the sole author

24357,reconstructions of the spatiotemporal dynamics of human dispersal away from evolutionary origins in africa are important for determining the ecological consequences of the arrival of anatomically modern humans in naïve landscapes and interpreting inferences from ancient genomes on indigenous population history while efforts have been made to independently validate these projections against the archaeological record and contemporary measures of genetic diversity there has been no comprehensive assessment of how parameter values and choice of palaeoclimate model affect projections of early human migration we simulated human migration into north america with a process explicit migration model using simulated palaeoclimate data from two different atmosphere ocean general circulation models and did a sensitivity analysis on the outputs using a machine learning algorithm we found that simulated human migration into north america was more sensitive to uncertainty in demographic parameters than choice of atmosphere ocean general circulation model used for simulating climate human interactions our findings indicate that the accuracy of process explicit human migration models will be improved with further research on the population dynamics of ancient humans and that uncertainties in model parameters must be considered in estimates of the timing and rate of human colonisation and their consequence on biodiversity keywords human migration sensitivity analysis process explicit model paleoecology macroecology data availability data are available on figshare and have been cited in the text 1 introduction early human migration has been reconstructed indirectly beyer et al 2021 correlatively giampoudakis et al 2017 and process explicitly timmermann and friedrich 2016 allowing pathways for the expansion of modern humans to be identified by inferring or modelling relationships between climatic conditions occupancy and population growth eriksson et al 2012 steele et al 1998 process explicit models have advantages over correlative reconstructions and inferences based on climate metrics because they explicitly capture demographic responses to changing climatic and environmental conditions in model simulations pilowsky et al 2022 however they are generally data intensive with complex model structures often resulting in high variability amongst simulations of early human migration owing to large uncertainties in underlying demographic parameters timmermann and friedrich 2016 furthermore most models are fitted to a single set of simulated climatic reconstructions it is unclear how different assumptions and biases in paleoclimate simulations solomon et al 2007 affect model projections of human migration and how important these effects are relative to uncertainties in demographic parameters sensitivity analyses can help improve projections of human expansion from process explicit macroecology models by identifying parameters that contribute the most to model output those that are insignificant and can be potentially omitted from the model and those that need refining to improve model accuracy hamby 1994 the climate informed spatial genetic model cisgem is one example of a process explicit model of human dispersal out of africa which has been validated using genetic distances between contemporary human populations eriksson et al 2012 its outputs include human arrival times on non african continents and islands as well as spatial maps of effective population size a proxy for relative abundance fordham et al 2014 from 120 kg years before present ka bp the simulated outputs of cisgem have been used to parametrise and inform other models of phenomena including megafaunal extinctions fordham et al 2022 and species range dynamics canteri et al 2022 however cisgem has never been subjected to a sensitivity analysis meaning there is no knowledge of the importance of demographic parameters and climatic conditions on model projections here we simulate human migration into north america in the pleistocene using cisgem parametrised with two widely used atmosphere ocean general circulation models aogcms the hadley centre coupled model version 3 hadcm3 singarayer and valdes 2010 and the community climate system model version 3 ccsm3 yeager et al 2006 transient climate evolution trace 21ka simulation z liu et al 2009 we do a sensitivity analysis to determine whether well established structural and projection differences in these two palaeoclimate models burke et al 2018 kageyama et

model we modelled the peopling of north america using cisgem climate informed spatial genetic model which is a process and spatially explicit population model of global human migration during the late pleistocene and holocene eriksson et al 2012 the model is driven by demographic processes responding to glacial interglacial ice land sea dynamics and spatiotemporal variation in net primary productivity that affects carrying capacities the latter has been shown to be an important driver of population density for hunter gatherers tallavaara et al 2018 but see zhu et al 2021 previous model testing has shown that cisgem accurately reconstructs global genetic diversity and human arrival times on the non african continents eriksson et al 2012 raghavan et al 2015 see supplementary information for more details on the model structure of cisgem model parameters in cisgem have been optimised using pattern orientated modelling methods grimm et al 2005 and approximate bayesian computation csilléry et al 2010 in this study we used the posterior ranges of optimised model parameters to generate 4950 plausible cisgem models each with different parameter values table s1 these posterior ranges have been used elsewhere to reconstruct human migration rates in north america and eurasia using cisgem canteri et al 2022 fordham et al 2022 we used latin hypercube sampling to generate a stratified random subset of parameter input values for simulations by specifying the posterior range for each parameter and sampling all portions of the distributions stein 1987 we then ran each of these models using palaeoclimate data from two aogcms and did a global sensitivity analysis antoniadis et al 2021 to determine the influence of demographic parameters and climate model parametrisation on cisgem projections of human colonisation of north america figure s2 2 2 climate data plausible models n 4950 were simulated using palaeoclimate aogcm data from hadcm3 singarayer and valdes 2010 and the ccsm3 trace 21ka simulation z liu et al 2009 these two palaeoclimate models were chosen because their climatic outputs are most frequently used in macroecological models blois et al 2013 theodoridis et al 2020 including approaches that simulate colonisation and extinction processes canteri et al 2022 fordham et al 2022 he et al 2013 their high usage in ecological models reflects their temporal coverage which tends to be more continuous than many other widely accessible paleoclimate datasets armstrong et al 2019 s c brown et al 2020 fordham et al 2017 many of which are limited to widely spaced snapshots of key climatic periods j l brown et al 2018 lima ribeiro et al 2015 while projections from the hadcm3 have been shown to be congruent with those from the ccsm3 trace 21ka simulation for some climatic parameters in some regions and time points armstrong et al 2019 there are important local to regional differences between projections from these aogcms burke et al 2018 kageyama et al 2018 including in north america fig 1 unlike the trace 21ka simulation the hadcm3 is not a fully transient climate model meaning that outputs from hadcm3 are climate snapshots rather than continuous projections climate snapshots from the hadcm3 outputs separated by 1 ka were temporally downscaled to 25 year timesteps to match the timestep of cisgem simulations using a stochastic weather generator which draws random values from empirical distributions adjusted to fit the temperature and precipitation intervals found in the climate data semenov and barrow 2002 the grid cell resolution of hadcm3 data is 3 75 longitude 2 5 latitude forcings include orbitally forced insolation changes changes in long lived greenhouse gases and meltwater from evolving ice sheets these are the same forcings used in trace 21ka with a key difference that hadcm3 does not account for vegetation air ocean interactions collins et al 2006 the trace 21ka simulation z liu et al 2009 uses the ccsm3 yeager et al 2006 to reconstruct daily global climate conditions at a spatial resolution of 3 75 longitude 3 75 latitude over land and sea for the last 21 000 years it accurately reproduces major climatic features associated with the most recent deglaciation event z liu et al 2009 and predicts present day climate patterns with verified hindcast skill fordham et al 2017 importantly both hadcm3 and trace 21ka model ice sheet dynamics using the ice 5 g reconstruction peltier 2004 meaning that ice sheet barriers to human dispersal in cisgem models were identical in simulations regardless of palaeoclimate model movie s1 we spatially downscaled data from both models to the equal area resolution of cisgem 100 km width see supplementary information for details 2 3 simulations we ran a single replicate of cisgem for each combination of plausible parameters and recorded the simulated effective population size at each hex cell and time point previously it has been shown that running a single simulation iteration per parameter sample is optimal for sensitivity analysis if the parameter space is extensively sampled prowse et al 2016 all simulations were global began at the same starting location in east africa at 120 ka bp and proceeded until present 0 bp 1950 c e at 25 year time steps eriksson et al 2012 we identified a priori time of movement out of alaska and rate of expansion through north america as two important metrics of regional human migration that are likely to be sensitive to changes in demographic parameters and variation in climate model projections this is because climatic change facilitated the initial movement of people into north america becerra valdivia and higham 2020 and the speed of this movement was constrained by demographic processes and their interaction with climate and environmental conditions timmermann and friedrich 2016 we calculated time of movement out of alaska after 19 ka bp and rate of expansion through north america 14 7 to 11 ka bp for each projection movement out of alaska was calculated as the time when the population weighted centroid of the leading edge of the human range watts et al 2013 crossed 130 w or 51 n rate of expansion through north america was calculated as the rate of movement in kilometres per year of the population weighted centroid of the leading edge of the human range see supplementary information for more details on how these variables were calculated cisgem projections of time of movement out of alaska were independently validated using inferences of the timing of arrival of clovis culture in north america 13 250 to 12 800 years bp waters and stafford 2007 2 4 sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters contribute most to model projections of human expansion in north america we did a global sensitivity analysis using our summary metrics of time of movement out of alaska and rate of expansion through north america antoniadis et al 2021 sensitivity analyses were done in two ways i using only cisgem models simulated using hadcm3 climate data demographic only sensitivity analysis ii using models simulated with climate and precipitation data from hadcm3 and ccsm3 trace 21ka palaeoclimate models demographic climate sensitivity analysis this two step approach was done because cisgem were originally optimised using hadcm3 climate data eriksson et al 2012 the sensitivity analysis did not account for potentially important structural uncertainties in cisgem including human generation length and the simulated sequence of modelled demographic processes we determined the sensitivity of timing of movement out of alaska and expansion rate using random forest learning methods antoniadis et al 2021 following techniques established for process explicit macroecology models pearson et al 2014 we tuned the hyperparameters using k fold cross validation choosing number of variables sampled per split and minimum node size by minimizing rmse rmse 478 13 6 for exit from alaska and rmse 479 15 3 for expansion rate we assessed variable importance using unscaled permutation importance strobl et al 2007 see supplementary information for details 3 results while range size of humans in north america varied according to aogcm fig 1 time of movement out of alaska and rate of human migration were most sensitive to uncertainty in key demographic parameters fig 2 the demographic only sensitivity analysis done using hadcm3 model based simulations only revealed i time of movement out of alaska was most sensitive to colonisation rate upper net primary productivity threshold for carrying capacity and population growth rate while ii population weighted rate of expansion was most sensitive to population growth rate and colonisation rate fig 2 this order of relative importance remained unchanged when the sensitivity analysis was done on simulations with varying temperature and precipitation inputs from the two aogcms demographic climate sensitivity analysis fig 2 this indicates a relatively low sensitivity of cisgem projections to pronounced differences in palaeoclimate conditions in north america according to aogcm fig 1 when compared to uncertainties in demographic model parameters independent tests of cisgem projections of time of movement out from alaska showed that simulations of land migration from cisgem parametrised with trace21 ka climate data gave a median exit date from alaska that was closer to the estimated clovis arrival median 14 375 years bp mad 482 compared to simulations parametrised with hadcm3 data median 15 000 years bp mad 111 the difference for trace 21ka and hadcm3 was 1144 years 95 confidence interval ci 1138 1150 years and 1682 years ci 1663 1700 years respectively model projections of migration patterns into north america and relative ne for both models can be accessed on figshare pilowsky et al 2022 4 conclusions while projections of the peopling of north america from process explicit models vary in response to two choices of aogcm uncertainties in key demographic parameters have a disproportionately larger influence on simulations of time of movement out of alaska and rate of expansion through north america this shows the likely importance of considering uncertainties in the demographic parameters of process explicit model projections of timing rate and mechanisms of initial human expansion across continents raghavan et al 2015 and the broader ecological consequences of human colonisation on biodiversity canteri et al 2022 fordham et al 2022 while arrival times of humans in different regions have been established archaeologically with reasonable certainty goebel et al 2008 groucutt et al 2015 and dispersal rates have been inferred from genomic analysis of adna rasmussen et al 2011 the pattern of human growth and expansion has been more difficult to reconstruct at fine spatiotemporal scales consequently projections of early human migration across continents are still uncertain h liu et al 2006 this is partly because of overly simplistic parametrisation of the relationship between net primary productivity and population growth zhu et al 2021 and large uncertainties in other demographic parameters including dispersal french et al 2021 resolving these issues should be a priority given how sensitive the rate of human movement in north america is to rates of population growth and colonisation promising avenues of research that could reduce uncertainty in early human demography include bayesian analysis of spatiotemporal distributions of radiocarbon dates price et al 2020 phylogenetic analysis of the human palaeoproteome which is more resistant to degradation over long timescales compared to the palaeogenome welker 2018 and sampling of environmental dna which can detect arrival and movement of small populations better than the archaeological or fossil record wang et al 2021 our finding that uncertainty in projections of human migration from process explicit models is only weakly sensitive to the choice of underlying palaeoclimate model is in stark contrast to findings for correlative models of species distributions beaumont et al 2007 tuck et al 2006 which model demographic processes implicitly not explicitly pilowsky et al 2022 when interpreting the generality of this result it is important to recognise that cisgem simulates pathways for the global expansion of modern humans therefore in other regions and time periods the parametrisation of palaeoclimate could have a larger effect on human migration especially since migration occurred at different rates in different regions while we tested the sensitivity of cisgem to palaeoclimate uncertainty using two aogcms with very different climate sensitivities masson delmotte et al 2013 spatiotemporal uncertainty could potentially be greater in north america if more models were considered nevertheless our results highlight the

to aogcm fig 1 when compared to uncertainties in demographic model parameters independent tests of cisgem projections of time of movement out from alaska showed that simulations of land migration from cisgem parametrised with trace21 ka climate data gave a median exit date from alaska that was closer to the estimated clovis arrival median 14 375 years bp mad 482 compared to simulations parametrised with hadcm3 data median 15 000 years bp mad 111 the difference for trace 21ka and hadcm3 was 1144 years 95 confidence interval ci 1138 1150 years and 1682 years ci 1663 1700 years respectively model projections of migration patterns into north america and relative ne for both models can be accessed on figshare pilowsky et al 2022 4 conclusions while projections of the peopling of north america from process explicit models vary in response to two choices of aogcm uncertainties in key demographic parameters have a disproportionately larger influence on simulations of time of movement out of alaska and rate of expansion through north america this shows the likely importance of considering uncertainties in the demographic parameters of process explicit model projections of timing rate and mechanisms of initial human expansion across continents raghavan et al 2015 and the broader ecological consequences of human colonisation on biodiversity canteri et al 2022 fordham et al 2022 while arrival times of humans in different regions have been established archaeologically with reasonable certainty goebel et al 2008 groucutt et al 2015 and dispersal rates have been inferred from genomic analysis of adna rasmussen et al 2011 the pattern of human growth and expansion has been more difficult to reconstruct at fine spatiotemporal scales consequently projections of early human migration across continents are still uncertain h liu et al 2006 this is partly because of overly simplistic parametrisation of the relationship between net primary productivity and population growth zhu et al 2021 and large uncertainties in other demographic parameters including dispersal french et al 2021 resolving these issues should be a priority given how sensitive the rate of human movement in north america is to rates of population growth and colonisation promising avenues of research that could reduce uncertainty in early human demography include bayesian analysis of spatiotemporal distributions of radiocarbon dates price et al 2020 phylogenetic analysis of the human palaeoproteome which is more resistant to degradation over long timescales compared to the palaeogenome welker 2018 and sampling of environmental dna which can detect arrival and movement of small populations better than the archaeological or fossil record wang et al 2021 our finding that uncertainty in projections of human migration from process explicit models is only weakly sensitive to the choice of underlying palaeoclimate model is in stark contrast to findings for correlative models of species distributions beaumont et al 2007 tuck et al 2006 which model demographic processes implicitly not explicitly pilowsky et al 2022 when interpreting the generality of this result it is important to recognise that cisgem simulates pathways for the global expansion of modern humans therefore in other regions and time periods the parametrisation of palaeoclimate could have a larger effect on human migration especially since migration occurred at different rates in different regions while we tested the sensitivity of cisgem to palaeoclimate uncertainty using two aogcms with very different climate sensitivities masson delmotte et al 2013 spatiotemporal uncertainty could potentially be greater in north america if more models were considered nevertheless our results highlight the

dengue cases have increased from 505 400 in 2000 to 5 2 million in 2019 the death toll rose from 960 in 2000 to 4032 in 2015 who 2020 in mainland china fig s1 for study area dengue outbreaks have been recorded every year in the recent past with more than 80 000 cases occurring during 2014 2019 of which 74 370 were indigenous the remaining 15 187 of these indigenous cases were reported in 2019 fig

climate change on the duration of the dengue transmission process has not been considered when assessing df s future pattern this results in a research gap as dengue transmission changes in duration and patterns may affect the potential increase in the number of cases and geographic range of dengue colón gonzález et al 2018 an efficient mechanistic model has potentiality to fill up this gap is the phenology timing models which calculate the number of successful life cycle completions i e the number of generations per period based on laboratory experiments of climate dependent development rates jönsson et al 2013 phenology models have first been considered in the agriculture field to predict invasive pest establishments jarvis et al 2001 jönsson et al 2013 welch et al 2015 and recently been successfully applied to invasive vector born epidemic diseases for human to examine the ecological suitability of developing dengue vector aedes aegypti iwamura et al 2020 phenology models distinguish themselves from other mechanistic models by their ability to specify the commencement of dengue transmission process therefore its duration acts as an important tool to understand the effect of climate change on the spread of dengue outbreaks in this work we first develop a phenology model driven by daily climate data to explore the present and future dengue patterns in response to climate change in mainland china our model calculates the total number of successful dengue epidemic process completion depc over a specific time period under different climatic conditions we aim to predict 1 the areas with suitable climate for dengue vector of the mosquito aedes albopictus to develop and for dengue virus to transmit 2 the length of season suitable for dengue virus to spread and 3 the intensity of depc the average of depc over a given period for different provinces in mainland china under various future climate change scenarios 2 methods here we develop a novel model to predict the transmission potential of dengue fever based on an existing phenology model that was applied to evaluate the suitability for the development of the mosquito aedes aegypti by calculating the number of successful life cycle completions lcc iwamura et al 2020 the larger the number of lcc the more suitable the mosquito to develop its abundance we first update this existing model to make it suitable for predicting the climatic suitability of the mosquito aedes albopitctus which is the primary vector of dengue in mainland china wu et al 2011 and then extend it to predict the climatic suitability of dengue transmission the model diagram is schematically illustrated in fig 1 our model consists of two compartments for predicting environmental suitability of mosquito development and of dengue transmission dashed box in fig 1 the first compartment considers all mosquito s life cycle stages from egg hatching immature development blood feeding to oviposition the second compartment incorporates all the processes of dengue transmission e g blood meal extrinsic incubation period infectious lifespan intrinsic incubation period it starts from adult mosquitoes taking the first blood meal by biting an imported to the occurrence of the first indigenous dengue case the larger the number of depc the more likely dengue transmission occurs and spreads faster thus our model is characterized by the ability to calculate the viability of the completion of each developmental stage and determines the total number of successful depcs over a period year season month under climatic conditions this novelty allows our outcome to act as an indicator of development intensity which is theoretically related to the probability of occurrence and spread of dengue in specific times and locations we apply the first compartment model to predict the suitability for aedes albopictus once an area is predicted to be climatically suitable for the mosquitoes we then proceed with the second compartment model to examine the suitability for dengue virus transmission for both compartments climate conditions for different mosquito developing stages and different dengue transmission stages are formulated based on temperature thresholds and the associated temperature dependent rates during mosquito development and virus transmission which are specified below in detail eggs hatching the cold kill condition is used to test the survival probability of an egg during the winter period and mark the beginning of a period of unsuitably cold temperatures this condition is imposed on both the temperature and duration of the cold period the cold kill temperature is set with the condition of 0 c for 152 days thomas et al 2012 mogi 2011 hanson and craig 1995 alternatively if the average daily temperature is 0 for 152 days the egg dies and cannot proceed with the life cycle otherwise the eggs will live until hatch the minimum threshold temperature for egg hatching is set at 10 5 c and the cumulative degree day cdd is 13 8 c healy et al 2019 thus the number of days required for eggs hatching d e h is given as follows 1 d eh eggs extinction if t 0 for 150 days 13 8 t 10 5 if t 10 5 immature development larvae pupae suppose that the eggs hatch and the cumulative degree days for the same minimum threshold 10 5 c reach 172 c in that case the aquatic stages complete and the juvenile mosquitoes develop into adult mosquitoes healy et al 2019 the precipitation threshold for these immature aquatic stages is set at 200 mm of annual rainfall waldock et al 2013 the cdd is given as in eq 2 healy et al 2019 and mdt i is the mean daily temperature of the i th day and t t h r min is the minimum temperature threshold if the mean daily temperature in a given day i mdt i is less than the minimum temperature threshold t t h r min or greater than the maximum temperature threshold t t h r max then mdt i t t h r min is set zero when cdd becomes more prominent than the established cdd required for mosquito development the development is assumed to be successful and the model moves on to the next life stage otherwise the life cycle fails to complete 2 c d d i m d t i t t h r min blood feeding the pre blood meal period is from the adult emergence until taking the first blood meal this period is temperature sensitive and conditioned as follows metelmann et al 2021 3 d b f 83 85 4 89 t 0 08 t 2 we assume that mosquitoes take an infectious blood meal from a viremic human host in this stage oviposition after blood feeding adult mosquitoes go through a temperature sensitive gonotrophic cycle gc to gestate and lay eggs this stage is conditioned as in eq 4 delatte et al 2009 4 d gc 8 days at t 20 c 4 days at t 25 c 3 days at t 30 c 4 days at t 35 c infected mosquitoes the extrinsic incubation period n is the viral incubation period from when mosquitoes take a viremic blood meal to become infectious temperature is a critical factor for this period and the n is set by eq 5 watts et al 1987 5 n k t c where k is the required accumulated temperature 165 2 c for dengue virus to devolve within the mosquito and c is the minimum temperature threshold 11 9 c for development fan and young 2019 non dengue case susceptible humans are assumed to be bitten by an infected mosquito in this stage the necessary condition for this stage is that the virus infectious lifespan l i is 1day alternatively the mosquitoes need to survive for more than 1 day after being infected to transmit pathogens macdonald 1956 the infectious life span is calculated by eq 6 6 l i p n ln p p exp μ μ 0 8692 0 1590 t 0 01116 t 2 3 40 10 4 t 3 3 809 10 6 t 4 where n is the extrinsic incubation period and p the daily survival rates and µ the mortality rate yang et al 2009 indigenous dengue case the intrinsic incubation period iip is when an infected mosquito bites a human to the onset of symptoms due to the infection the mean of iip is estimated as 5 9 days chan and johansson 2012 the minimum temperature threshold for the adult mosquito to be active 9 c is also considered in all adult mosquito stages pre blood extrinsic incubation period infection lifespan roiz et al 2010 the maximum temperature threshold is set as a daily temperature above 40 c for 1 day and applied to all life stages delatte et al 2009 waldock et al 2013 our model calculates the total number of successful depc over some time under climate data we applied the model over three periods 1 over a year under historical climate data to evaluate the model by comparing its output with the actual dengue cases data and to set the threshold of depc then under future climate data to predict the geographical distributions of dengue 2 over a month to predict the changes of dengue season length 3 over the period from may to december to predict the intensity of depc the dependence of mosquito development the dengue virus transmission stages lcc and depc on temperature are shown in fig s3 matlab and arc gis 10 8 were used in calculating analyzing and drawing for the present study 3 data for the presence records of aedes albopictus the occurrence data were collected from the national institute for communicable disease control and prevention china cdc at the county level and then regrouped at the city level for the occurrence of indigenous dengue case data were collected from china cdc for 2014 2019 yue et al 2019 2021 monthly and annual climate grid historical and future ssps rcps data were obtained from climate data store 2021 the coupled shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways ssps rcps climate scenarios from the coupled model intercomparison project 6 cmip6 o neill et al 2014 b c 2016 under the climate system model of the beijing climate center bcccsm1 1 model wu

b c o neill et al 2016 we selected ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 to cover the low medium and high temperature and precipitation change 4 results 4 1 model validation the kappa agreement has been widely used to test the reliability of model predictions and a kappa coefficient greater than 0 6 the larger the better indicates that model outputs are reliable mchugh 2012 we employed this approach to validate our model fig 2 for the environmental suitability of mosquito development we compared the reported occurrence of aedes albopictus in 2019 to the model output i e lcc under the climate in 2019 in fig 2a we found a kappa coefficient of 0 89 for those areas with lcc 0 implying a good agreement between mosquito distribution and model projection note that there are some cities e g liaoning province where aedes albopictus was recorded but lcc is predicted to be zero this may be because we used the average daily temperature ignoring the diurnal temperature the average daily temperatures for these cities ranged between 7 and 10 c less than the minimum threshold for mosquitoes to develop for environmental suitability of dengue virus transmission we collected the indigenous dengue case records in mainland china from 2014 to 2019 and compared them to our model output depc in fig 2b among 118 cities with recorded indigenous dengue cases we found just 10 cities of depc 0 and the kappa coefficient is 0 78 for cities with depc 0 suggesting a good agreement with the records therefore the measures of lcc 0 and depc 0 can be accepted as the stable thresholds for the environmental suitability of mosquito development and dengue virus transmission this implies that our model can create an index that predicts how dengue and its vector may spread and distribute in the future as a result of climate change 4 2 geographical expansion of aedes albopictus and dengue transmission the predicted regions of aedes albopictus and dengue in fig 2 form a baseline pattern future projections of the geographical expansion in the climatic suitability of aedes albopictus and dengue under different climate change scenarios are presented in fig 3 the geographical distribution of aedes albopictus is predicted to expand slowly both northward to liaoning province and westward to xinjiang province over the coming years under all climate change scenarios fig 3a however the most remarkable expansion is predicted to occur under ssp585 where around half of mainland china becomes suitable for aedes albopictus to develop fig s5 accompanied with an invasion of aedes albopictus areas suitable for dengue virus to transmit are predicted to increase considerably in the future fig 3b up to 1 02 million km2 more than the baseline case under ssp585 1 76 million km2 fig s5 however there are three interesting observations firstly the dominant climate change scenario that drives the expansion of dengue varies with time e g ssp245 in 2060 but ssp585 for other years secondly the dominant climate change scenario might differ between driving aedes albopictus and dengue expansion e g ssp245 for mosquito expansion in 2040 but ssp585 for dengue expansion finally most of the newly added risk areas of aedes albopictus are predicted to be free from dengue 4 3 dengue season length the predicted change in the length of dengue season for selected representative provinces is illustrated in fig 4 clearly under the baseline cases dengue season for the provinces in the south southeast and southwest is generally over half a year ranging from may to september fig s6 driven by climate change dengue length increases for all considered provinces albeit different it is worth mentioning that hainan province is predicted to have a suitable climate over the year except in february while the western part tibet and qinghai remains free from dengue except in a small area in the south of tibet and north of qinghai fig s7 4 4 intensity of depc we now consider how fast the dengue virus can transmit this can be measured by the intensity of depc which is defined as the average of depc over a given period since the indigenous dengue cases are generally recorded from june to december in china yue et al 2019 lin et al 2020 and adult mosquitoes typically start to be active from may zhou et al 2021 we calculated the intensity of depc over the period from may to december for each year fig 5 shows the change of intensity of depc for provinces with recorded aedes albopictus in the baseline cases on the one hand for provinces with recorded indigenous dengue cases in the baseline cases fig 5a the overall trend of depc intensity is predicted to increase over the coming years with a small fluctuation particularly under the climate scenario ssp585 interestingly the most significant increase of depc intensity is predicted to occur at temperate areas e g shandong rather than at trophic areas e g guangzhou hainan on the other hand a similar trend can be observed for provinces with only recorded aedes albopitus i e no recorded indigenous dengue cases fig 5b although these areas have not reported indigenous dengue cases the dpecs indicate a high potential of dengue virus transmission however the province of tibet is predicted to remain safe under all climate scenarios 5 discussion with global warming the challenge of understanding the response of dengue to climate changes remains significant climate mosquito and dengue models are fundamental for projecting spatial temporal patterns of dengue transmission li et al 2018 for the first time we developed a phenology model driven by daily climate data to understand the future spatial spread of dengue and its vector aedes albopictus by predicting the climatic suitability for vector development further the model describes the dengue virus transmission under historical and different climate scenarios our model can evaluate the effect of climate change on the duration of the dengue transmission process mosquito life cycle thereby calculating the number of successful depc lcc over a period both aedes mosquitoes aegypti albopictus transmit dengue virus in mainland china wu et al 2010 but aedes albopictus is the primary dengue vector wu et al 2011 our model predicted that aedes albopictus moves northward and westward but the speed varies remarkably with underlying climate change scenarios fig 3a up to 2070 the areas suitable for the mosquitoes dominantly lie in the south and east of mainland china and a considerable increase occurs in 2080 particularly under the climate scenario ssp585 these observations are consistent with previous studies that future climate change promotes the expansion of aedes albopictus more than the current distribution kamal et al 2018 liu et al 2019 kraemer et al 2019 nonetheless our model showed that the spatial expansion is relatively limited by the middle of this century fig 3a compared to previous predictions that there was expected to be a significant expansion in the north kraemer et al 2019 and northeast liu et al 2019 this may be because of two reasons on the one hand their models accounted for land use liu et al 2019 and human mobility kraemer et al 2019 which have a direct effect on mosquito distribution roche et al 2015 steiger et al 2016 on the other hand breading sites at aquatic stages might be limited by the expected decrease in precipitation and increase in potential evapotranspiration in north china under cmip6 ssps rcps scenarios compared to cmip5 rcps scenarios su et al 2021 li et al 2021 dengue virus transmission shows a different expansion trend compared to aedes albopitus while the latter is predicted to mostly moving towards the northwest the former primarily towards the north up to shandong henan hebei tianjin beijing and even liaoning fig 3b moreover most of the newly added risk regions of dengue lies in the region where aedes albopictus already exists in the baseline situation unlike other model predictions of a significant increase in risk area of dengue fan and young 2019 the model outcomes indicate that the spatial patterns of mosquitoes to infer the potential risk region of dengue may bring about significant bias including imprecise spreading direction e g dengue patterns from 2040 to 2060 in fig 3b further there remains a provision of overestimation of risk areas e g dengue pattern in 2080 in fig 3b along with the spatial expansion of the dengue virus more extended seasons and more vigorous intensity of dengue transmission are predicted to occur in the future of mainland china fig 4 and 5 well agreeing with previous studies zheng et al 2019 metelmann et al 2021 nonetheless our model showed that more and more areas might experience more than half years for dengue virus transmission e g jiangsu yunnan fujian and the southern cities may be even at risk of the whole year e g hainan hence increasing efforts on vector controls are called for particularly in the areas with a long season and high intensity of depc especially in guangdong guangxi and yunnan these areas are with import destination of overseas cases and export origin of domestic imported dengue cases yue et al 2019 2021 our model further showed that while there have been no recorded indigenous dengue cases in guizhou and hebei these two provinces are predicted with high intensity therefore early preparation of prevention is necessary our model may suffer from the following limitations first we merely used the average daily temperature we ignored the impact of the diurnal temperature range dtr on the development of aquatic stages zapletal et al 2018 and on the infection as well as transmission probability of mosquito lambrechts et al 2011 previous studies suggested that large dtr is detrimental for mosquito survival and therefore for dengue transmission carrington et al 2013a 2013b which is particularly relevant to china s west and north areas in addition to temperature other climatic and environmental factors also affect mosquito development and or dengue virus transmission for example changes in land use enable aedes albopictus to live in a wider geographical region in southern china liu et al 2019 the relative humidity is also predicted to have an evident effect on the incidence of dengue fever wu et al 2007 2018 and it was reported that rising humidity would increase vector survival rate therefore prolonging the time to feed effectively on an infective host second the change in human population growth is also not considered which may bias the prediction a little bit particularly in the areas with low population density our previous study disclosed a significant trade off between climatic and human population impacts on the spreading of mosquitoes abdalgader et al 2022 finally human mobility serves as an essential driver in promoting the spatial spread of dengue zhu et al 2019 kiang et al 2021 and should be taken into account in future study in conclusion a novel mechanistic phenology model was developed and showed great power in predicting the spatial temporal distribution of the dengue virus our model prediction indicates that climate changes facilitate the expansion of dengue and its vector the mosquito aedes albopictus in the future of mainland china however the expansion pattern of the dengue virus does not closely correlate with that of mosquitoes while mosquito expansion is expected to crawl northwest gradually over the coming decades the dengue expansion mainly lies in the northeast of mainland china more extended dengue season and higher intensity of dengue transmission are predicted for most areas with a presence of mosquitoes in the baseline case these projections help develop targeted

patz et al 1998 medlock et al 2006 andraud et al 2013 liu helmersson et al 2014 j 2016 mordecai et al 2017 lee et al 2018 ryan et al 2019 paul et al 2021 however among all these studies the impact of climate change on the duration of the dengue transmission process has not been considered when assessing df s future pattern this results in a research gap as dengue transmission changes in duration and patterns may affect the potential increase in the number of cases and geographic range of dengue colón gonzález et al 2018 an efficient mechanistic model has potentiality to fill up this gap is the phenology timing models which calculate the number of successful life cycle completions i e the number of generations per period based on laboratory experiments of climate dependent development rates jönsson et al 2013 phenology models have first been considered in the agriculture field to predict invasive pest establishments jarvis et al 2001 jönsson et al 2013 welch et al 2015 and recently been successfully applied to invasive vector born epidemic diseases for human to examine the ecological suitability of developing dengue vector aedes aegypti iwamura et al 2020 phenology models distinguish themselves from other mechanistic models by their ability to specify the commencement of dengue transmission process therefore its duration acts as an important tool to understand the effect of climate change on the spread of dengue outbreaks in this work we first develop a phenology model driven by daily climate data to explore the present and future dengue patterns in response to climate change in mainland china our model calculates the total number of successful dengue epidemic process completion depc over a specific time period under different climatic conditions we aim to predict 1 the areas with suitable climate for dengue vector of the mosquito aedes albopictus to develop and for dengue virus to transmit 2 the length of season suitable for dengue virus to spread and 3 the intensity of depc the average of depc over a given period for different provinces in mainland china under various future climate change scenarios 2 methods here we develop a novel model to predict the transmission potential of dengue fever based on an existing phenology model that was applied to evaluate the suitability for the development of the mosquito aedes aegypti by calculating the number of successful life cycle completions lcc iwamura et al 2020 the larger the number of lcc the more suitable the mosquito to develop its abundance we first update this existing model to make it suitable for predicting the climatic suitability of the mosquito aedes albopitctus which is the primary vector of dengue in mainland china wu et al 2011 and then extend it to predict the climatic suitability of dengue transmission the model diagram is schematically illustrated in fig 1 our model consists of two compartments for predicting environmental suitability of mosquito development and of dengue transmission dashed box in fig 1 the first compartment considers all mosquito s life cycle stages from egg hatching immature development blood feeding to oviposition the second compartment incorporates all the processes of dengue transmission e g blood meal extrinsic incubation period infectious lifespan intrinsic incubation period it starts from adult mosquitoes taking the first blood meal by biting an imported to the occurrence of the first indigenous dengue case the larger the number of depc the more likely dengue transmission occurs and spreads faster thus our model is characterized by the ability to calculate the viability of the completion of each developmental stage and determines the total number of successful depcs over a period year season month under climatic conditions this novelty allows our outcome to act as an indicator of development intensity which is theoretically related to the probability of occurrence and spread of dengue in specific times and locations we apply the first compartment model to predict the suitability for aedes albopictus once an area is predicted to be climatically suitable for the mosquitoes we then proceed with the second compartment model to examine the suitability for dengue virus transmission for both compartments climate conditions for different mosquito developing stages and different dengue transmission stages are formulated based on temperature thresholds and the associated temperature dependent rates during mosquito development and virus transmission which are specified below in detail eggs hatching the cold kill condition is used to test the survival probability of an egg during the winter period and mark the beginning of a period of unsuitably cold temperatures this condition is imposed on both the temperature and duration of the cold period the cold kill temperature is set with the condition of 0 c for 152 days thomas et al 2012 mogi 2011 hanson and craig 1995 alternatively if the average daily temperature is 0 for 152 days the egg dies and cannot proceed with the life cycle otherwise the eggs will live until hatch the minimum threshold temperature for egg hatching is set at 10 5 c and the cumulative degree day cdd is 13 8 c healy et al 2019 thus the number of days required for eggs hatching d e h is given as follows 1 d eh eggs extinction if t 0 for 150 days 13 8 t 10 5 if t 10 5 immature development larvae pupae suppose that the eggs hatch and the cumulative degree days for the same minimum threshold 10 5 c reach 172 c in that case the aquatic stages complete and the juvenile mosquitoes develop into adult mosquitoes healy et al 2019 the precipitation threshold for these immature aquatic stages is set at 200 mm of annual rainfall waldock et al 2013 the cdd is given as in eq 2 healy et al 2019 and mdt i is the mean daily temperature of the i th day and t t h r min is the minimum temperature threshold if the mean daily temperature in a given day i mdt i is less than the minimum temperature threshold t t h r min or greater than the maximum temperature threshold t t h r max then mdt i t t h r min is set zero when cdd becomes more prominent than the established cdd required for mosquito development the development is assumed to be successful and the model moves on to the next life stage otherwise the life cycle fails to complete 2 c d d i m d t i t t h r min blood feeding the pre blood meal period is from the adult emergence until taking the first blood meal this period is temperature sensitive and conditioned as follows metelmann et al 2021 3 d b f 83 85 4 89 t 0 08 t 2 we assume that mosquitoes take an infectious blood meal from a viremic human host in this stage oviposition after blood feeding adult mosquitoes go through a temperature sensitive gonotrophic cycle gc to gestate and lay eggs this stage is conditioned as in eq 4 delatte et al 2009 4 d gc 8 days at t 20 c 4 days at t 25 c 3 days at t 30 c 4 days at t 35 c infected mosquitoes the extrinsic incubation period n is the viral incubation period from when mosquitoes take a viremic blood meal to become infectious temperature is a critical factor for this period and the n is set by eq 5 watts et al 1987 5 n k t c where k is the required accumulated temperature 165 2 c for dengue virus to devolve within the mosquito and c is the minimum temperature threshold 11 9 c for development fan and young 2019 non dengue case susceptible humans are assumed to be bitten by an infected mosquito in this stage the necessary condition for this stage is that the virus infectious lifespan l i is 1day alternatively the mosquitoes need to survive for more than 1 day after being infected to transmit pathogens macdonald 1956 the infectious life span is calculated by eq 6 6 l i p n ln p p exp μ μ 0 8692 0 1590 t 0 01116 t 2 3 40 10 4 t 3 3 809 10 6 t 4 where n is the extrinsic incubation period and p the daily survival rates and µ the mortality rate yang et al 2009 indigenous dengue case the intrinsic incubation period iip is when an infected mosquito bites a human to the onset of symptoms due to the infection the mean of iip is estimated as 5 9 days chan and johansson 2012 the minimum temperature threshold for the adult mosquito to be active 9 c is also considered in all adult mosquito stages pre blood extrinsic incubation period infection lifespan roiz et al 2010 the maximum temperature threshold is set as a daily temperature above 40 c for 1 day and applied to all life stages delatte et al 2009 waldock et al 2013 our model calculates the total number of successful depc over some time under climate data we applied the model over three periods 1 over a year under historical climate data to evaluate the model by comparing its output with the actual dengue cases data and to set the threshold of depc then under future climate data to predict the geographical distributions of dengue 2 over a month to predict the changes of dengue season length 3 over the period from may to december to predict the intensity of depc the dependence of mosquito development the dengue virus transmission stages lcc and depc on temperature are shown in fig s3 matlab and arc gis 10 8 were used in calculating analyzing and drawing for the present study 3 data for the presence records of aedes albopictus the occurrence data were collected from the national institute for communicable disease control and prevention china cdc at the county level and then regrouped at the city level for the occurrence of indigenous dengue case data were collected from china cdc for 2014 2019 yue et al 2019 2021 monthly and annual climate grid historical and future ssps rcps data were obtained from climate data store 2021 the coupled shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways ssps rcps climate scenarios from the coupled model intercomparison project 6 cmip6 o neill et al 2014 b c 2016 under the climate system model of the beijing climate center bcccsm1 1 model wu et al 2019 fig s4 shows the future projections of climate changes temperature and precipitation in mainland china under ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp126 ssp2 rcp4 5 ssp245 ssp3 rcp7 0 ssp370 and ssp5 rcp8 5 ssp585 b c o neill et al 2016 we selected ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 to cover the low medium and high temperature and precipitation change 4 results 4 1 model validation the kappa agreement has been widely used to test the reliability of model predictions and a kappa coefficient greater than 0 6 the larger the better indicates that model outputs are reliable mchugh 2012 we employed this approach to validate our model fig 2 for the environmental suitability of mosquito development we compared the reported occurrence of aedes albopictus in 2019 to the model output i e lcc under the climate in 2019 in fig 2a we found a kappa coefficient of 0 89 for those areas with lcc 0 implying a good agreement between mosquito distribution and model projection note that there are some cities e g liaoning province where aedes albopictus was recorded but lcc is predicted to be zero this may be because we used the average daily temperature ignoring the diurnal temperature the average daily temperatures for these cities ranged between 7 and 10 c less than the minimum threshold for mosquitoes to develop for environmental suitability of dengue virus transmission we collected the indigenous dengue case records in mainland china from 2014 to 2019 and compared them to our model output depc in fig 2b among 118 cities with recorded indigenous dengue cases we found just 10 cities of depc 0 and the kappa coefficient is 0 78 for cities with depc 0 suggesting a good agreement with the records therefore the measures of lcc 0 and depc 0 can be accepted as the stable thresholds for the environmental suitability of mosquito development and dengue virus transmission this implies that our model can create an index that predicts how dengue and its vector may spread and distribute in the future as a result of climate change 4 2 geographical expansion of aedes albopictus and dengue transmission the predicted regions of aedes albopictus and dengue in fig 2 form a baseline pattern future projections of the geographical expansion in the climatic suitability of aedes albopictus and dengue under different climate change scenarios are presented in fig 3 the geographical distribution of aedes albopictus is predicted to expand slowly both northward to liaoning province and westward to xinjiang province over the coming years under all climate change scenarios fig 3a however the most remarkable expansion is predicted to occur under ssp585 where around half of mainland china becomes suitable for aedes albopictus to develop fig s5 accompanied with an invasion of aedes albopictus areas suitable for dengue virus to transmit are predicted to increase considerably in the future fig 3b up to 1 02 million km2 more than the baseline case under ssp585 1 76 million km2 fig s5 however there are three interesting observations firstly the dominant climate change scenario that drives the expansion of dengue varies with time e g ssp245 in 2060 but ssp585 for other years secondly the dominant climate change scenario might differ between driving aedes albopictus and dengue expansion e g ssp245 for mosquito expansion in 2040 but ssp585 for dengue expansion finally most of the newly added risk areas of aedes albopictus are predicted to be free from dengue 4 3 dengue season length the predicted change in the length of dengue season for selected representative provinces is illustrated in fig 4 clearly under the baseline cases dengue season for the provinces in the south southeast and southwest is generally over half a year ranging from may to september fig s6 driven by climate change dengue length increases for all considered provinces albeit different it is worth mentioning that hainan province is predicted to have a suitable climate over the year except in february while the western part tibet and qinghai remains free from dengue except in a small area in the south of tibet and north of qinghai fig s7 4 4 intensity of depc we now consider how fast the dengue virus can transmit this can be measured by the intensity of depc which is defined as the average of depc over a given period since the indigenous dengue cases are generally recorded from june to december in china yue et al 2019 lin et al 2020 and adult mosquitoes typically start to be active from may zhou et al 2021 we calculated the intensity of depc over the period from may to december for each year fig 5 shows the change of intensity of depc for provinces with recorded aedes albopictus in the baseline cases on the one hand for provinces with recorded indigenous dengue cases in the baseline cases fig 5a the overall trend of depc intensity is predicted to increase over the coming years with a small fluctuation particularly under the climate scenario ssp585 interestingly the most significant increase of depc intensity is predicted to occur at temperate areas e g shandong rather than at trophic areas e g guangzhou hainan on the other hand a similar trend can be observed for provinces with only recorded aedes albopitus i e no recorded indigenous dengue cases fig 5b although these areas have not reported indigenous dengue cases the dpecs indicate a high potential of dengue virus transmission however the province of tibet is predicted to remain safe under all climate scenarios 5 discussion with global warming the challenge of understanding the response of dengue to climate changes remains significant climate mosquito and dengue models are fundamental for projecting spatial temporal patterns of dengue transmission li et al 2018 for the first time we developed a phenology model driven by daily climate data to understand the future spatial spread of dengue and its vector aedes albopictus by predicting the climatic suitability for vector development further the model describes the dengue virus transmission under historical and different climate scenarios our model can evaluate the effect of climate change on the duration of the dengue transmission process mosquito life cycle thereby calculating the number of successful depc lcc over a period both aedes mosquitoes aegypti albopictus transmit dengue virus in mainland china wu et al 2010 but aedes albopictus is the primary dengue vector wu et al 2011 our model predicted that aedes albopictus moves northward and westward but the speed varies remarkably with underlying climate change scenarios fig 3a up to 2070 the areas suitable for the mosquitoes dominantly lie in the south and east of mainland china and a considerable increase occurs in 2080 particularly under the climate scenario ssp585 these observations are consistent with previous studies that future climate change promotes the expansion of aedes albopictus more than the current distribution kamal et al 2018 liu et al 2019 kraemer et al 2019 nonetheless our model showed that the spatial expansion is relatively limited by the middle of this century fig 3a compared to previous predictions that there was expected to be a significant expansion in the north kraemer et al 2019 and northeast liu et al 2019 this may be because of two reasons on the one hand their models accounted for land use liu et al 2019 and human mobility kraemer et al 2019 which have a direct effect on mosquito distribution roche et al 2015 steiger et al 2016 on the other hand breading sites at aquatic stages might be limited by the expected decrease in precipitation and increase in potential evapotranspiration in north china under cmip6 ssps rcps scenarios compared to cmip5 rcps scenarios su et al 2021 li et al 2021 dengue virus transmission shows a different expansion trend compared to aedes albopitus while the latter is predicted to mostly moving towards the northwest the former primarily towards the north up to shandong henan hebei tianjin beijing and even liaoning fig 3b moreover most of the newly added risk regions of dengue lies in the region where aedes albopictus already exists in the baseline situation unlike other model predictions of a significant increase in risk area of dengue fan and young 2019 the model outcomes indicate that the spatial patterns of mosquitoes to infer the potential risk region of dengue may bring about significant bias including imprecise spreading direction e g dengue patterns from 2040 to 2060 in fig 3b further there remains a provision of overestimation of risk areas e g dengue pattern in 2080 in fig 3b along with the spatial expansion of the dengue virus more extended seasons and more vigorous intensity of dengue transmission are predicted to occur in the future of mainland china fig 4 and 5 well agreeing with previous studies zheng et al 2019 metelmann et al 2021 nonetheless our model showed that more and more areas might experience more than half years for dengue virus transmission e g jiangsu yunnan fujian and the southern cities may be even at risk of the whole year e g hainan hence increasing efforts on vector controls are called for particularly in the areas with a long season and high intensity of depc especially in guangdong guangxi and yunnan these areas are with import destination of overseas cases and export origin of domestic imported dengue cases yue et al 2019 2021 our model further showed that while there have been no recorded indigenous dengue cases in guizhou and hebei these two provinces are predicted with high intensity therefore early preparation of prevention is necessary our model may suffer from the following limitations first we merely used the average daily temperature we ignored the impact of the diurnal temperature range dtr on the development of aquatic stages zapletal et al 2018 and on the infection as well as transmission probability of mosquito lambrechts et al 2011 previous studies suggested that large dtr is detrimental for mosquito survival and therefore for dengue transmission carrington et al 2013a 2013b which is particularly relevant to china s west and north areas in addition to temperature other climatic and environmental factors also affect mosquito development and or dengue virus transmission for example changes in land use enable aedes albopictus to live in a wider geographical region in southern china liu et al 2019 the relative humidity is also predicted to have an evident effect on the incidence of dengue fever wu et al 2007 2018 and it was reported that rising humidity would increase vector survival rate therefore prolonging the time to feed effectively on an infective host second the change in human population growth is also not considered which may bias the prediction a little bit particularly in the areas with low population density our previous study disclosed a significant trade off between climatic and human population impacts on the spreading of mosquitoes abdalgader et al 2022 finally human mobility serves as an essential driver in promoting the spatial spread of dengue zhu et al 2019 kiang et al 2021 and should be taken into account in future study in conclusion a novel mechanistic phenology model was developed and showed great power in predicting the spatial temporal distribution of the dengue virus our model prediction indicates that climate changes facilitate the expansion of dengue and its vector the mosquito aedes albopictus in the future of mainland china however the expansion pattern of the dengue virus does not closely correlate with that of mosquitoes while mosquito expansion is expected to crawl northwest gradually over the coming decades the dengue expansion mainly lies in the northeast of mainland china more extended dengue season and higher intensity of dengue transmission are predicted for most areas with a presence of mosquitoes in the baseline case these projections help develop targeted

24359,the functional diversity of local plant communities is considered to be an important driver of ecosystem resistance and resilience various landscape characteristics can influence local functional diversity but their relative importance is poorly understood we used a spatially explicit grassland model transpop to simulate competition between 19 functional plant strategies as defined by grime s c s r framework each with different affinities for levels of nutrient availability n and disturbance d first we explore the effects of n and d levels on strategy preference subsequently we studied functional diversity in patchy landscapes with various levels of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics with patches differing in n and d we evaluated the relative importance of these factors in determining the functional diversity of permanent grasslands of the temperate climatic zone simulated n and d optima for occurrence of strategies matched those of grime perpendicular n and d gradients were twice as diverse as correlated configurations the results show that heterogeneity in n and d was the most important factor determining strategy diversity followed by environmental dynamics connectivity and patch size grasslands with large heterogeneity and patch size have a high functional diversity whereas high values for dynamics and connectivity had in general a negative impact on functional diversity the frequent occurrence of significant interactions among characteristics suggests that the optimal spatial design of landscapes with respect to functional diversity is context dependent contrary to expectations connectivity generally had a negative effect on the diversity of plant strategies this was attributed to the fact that connectivity intensifies competition between strategies high connectivity and environmental dynamics low patch size and low heterogeneity intensifies interspecies competition and causes rapid species loss which strongly reduces resistance and resilience this shows that high species diversity in itself does not protect against diversity loss but that factors contributing to the maintenance of high diversity reduce the risk of species extinction and enable resistance and resilience keywords mass effects colonisation limitation metacommunity model species sorting dispersal seedbank data availability published data were used for parameterization of the model 1 introduction 1 1 functional diversity resistance and resilience the functional diversity of local grassland communities the number of functionally disparate species within a community is considered to be an important driver of ecosystem resistance and resilience i e the ability of an ecosystem to deal with environmental change or to return to its former state after disturbances fischer et al 2006 holling 1973 isbell et al 2015 schweiger et al 2019 ecosystems with a high diversity of functional groups are better able to respond to disturbances and temporary environmental change because there is a greater probability of there being species tolerant of a certain disturbance or environmental change in the local species pool craven et al 2018 folke et al 2004 loreau et al 2001 another factor that determines resistance and resilience at a larger spatial scale is the availability of such species in the regional species pool a form of ecological memory bengtsson et al 2003 sterk et al 2016 species that have become less abundant or locally extinct can be recruited from elsewhere through dispersal or from the seedbank peterson 2002 wisnoski et al 2019 enabling them to re enter the ecosystem dispersal ability and seed longevity dormancy are therefore considered to be crucial traits of plant species enabling them to cope with disturbance and environmental change there are various landscape characteristics that can influence the functional diversity of local plant communities but their relative importance is still poorly understood leibold et al 2017 which in turn might hamper conservation efforts chase et al 2020 1 2 extinction and colonisation the local diversity of grassland communities is governed by two processes colonisation by new species and the extinction of established species colonisation by new species is enhanced by high connectivity between habitat patches damschen et al 2019 ozinga et al 2009 while extinction is governed by local environmental change interspecies competition schippers et al 2015a and disturbances muller et al 2014 plants with dormant seeds however may recover from disturbances by reestablishment from the seedbank scott and morgan 2012 shea et al 2010 interspecies competition is governed to a large extent by local nutrient availability roeling et al 2018 schippers et al 1999 at low nutrient availability plants with an efficient nutrient economy outcompete fast growing species whereas at high nutrient availability fast growing species outperform species with an efficient nutrient economy through resource pre emption hetzer et al 2021 poorter et al 1990 schippers and kropff 2001 the diversity and species composition of local plant communities are thus determined both by processes that operate on a local scale e g environmental filtering and biotic interactions and by processes that operate on a higher spatial scale e g connectivity and processes related to habitat heterogeneity leibold et al 2017 2004 traditionally these two scales have been studied separately but the emergence of metacommunity models enables us to combine both scales because these models keep track of local and spatial processes simultaneously chase et al 2020 however although such scale explicit approaches offer great potential for generalisations often they do not incorporate information on functional diversity 1 3 grime s vegetation theory grime campbell and grime 1992 grime 1979 2001 developed the c s r framework of three fundamental strategies of plant species in response to nutrient availability and disturbance see also moulin et al 2021 competitors c dominate at low disturbance and high nutrients stress tolerators s are abundant at low disturbance and low nutrients while ruderals r survive at high disturbance and high nutrients grime s c s r framework assumes a three way trade off between competition for resources c endurance of resource limitation s and recovery after disturbance r from this he derived seven strategies c s r cs cr sr csr in which cs cr sr and csr strategies have intermediate characteristics of c s and r subsequently he defined 12 crossover strategies to produce a total of 19 strategies adapted to specific disturbance and nutrient regimes grime 2001 predicted that a greater resilience in r and c strategies on the basis of their faster rates of resource capture and growth on the other hand a greater resistance is expected for the s strategy due to their longevity and better tolerance of harsh conditions e g low nutrient availability moreover he predicted that both resistance and resilience will be higher in communities with a higher functional diversity this is consistent with experimental results in grasslands in the uk grime et al 2000 and the results from a global metanalysis of the results from we use data from 39 grassland biodiversity experiments craven et al 2018 1 4 spatial vegetation modelling diversity lattice based models are frequently used to describe vegetation dynamics these models include tree based and plant based gap modelling in which seed and seedlings compete for a gap in a mature vegetation cover coffin and lauenroth 1990 elzein et al 2020 kellomäki and väisänen 1991 morin et al 2020 peters 2002 reynolds et al 2001 when these models are applied to multiple species they may generate insight into the factors affecting species dominance and diversity for instance schippers et al 2001 used a lattice based gap model transpop to simulate competition and coexistence between perennials and annuals with dormant and non dormant seeds at various disturbance levels they found a stable coexistence between strategies with dormant and non dormant seeds at intermediate levels of disturbance 1 5 approach various landscape characteristics can influence local functional diversity but their relative importance is poorly understood we studied the effects of connectivity spatial heterogeneity patch size and environmental dynamics on the functional diversity of permanent grasslands of the temperate climatic zone we used the spatially explicit metacommunity model transpop schippers 2001 that enables us to study long term species sorting in response to disturbance d as a starting point we extended this model with routines allowing inter plant competition affected by nutrients n this enabled us to study species response to both nutrients and disturbance we parameterised 19 herbaceous grassland species according to the c s r framework of grime first we tested strategy preferences for n and disturbance d in homogeneous landscapes and gradients of n and d subsequently we studied functional diversity in patchy landscapes with various levels of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics we define a patch as a group of adjacent cells having the same n and d level we used the model to evaluate the relative importance of these factors in determining the functional diversity in grasslands using the shannon diversity index more specifically we tested the following hypotheses 1 6 hypotheses 1 we expect that spatial heterogeneity in terms of nutrients and disturbance enhances diversity through species sorting across environmental gradients fournier et al 2017 gastauer et al 2021 as environmental diversity increases we expect more species will survive in these grasslands bergholz et al 2017 deák et al 2021 guo et al 2018 2 we expect that high connectivity across the landscape enabling high dispersal distances enhances species diversity in grasslands by shifting the balance between colonisation and local extinction towards colonisation wang and altermatt 2019 this enhanced colonisation stimulates plant species establishment in local communities increasing diversity ozinga et al 2009 3 we expect that high environmental dynamics involving changes in the nutrient availability and disturbance regime of grassland patches over time will cause rapid species loss because these changes disrupt the species sorting process fournier et al 2017 leibold and loeuille 2015 therefore we expect to find the highest functional diversity where the environmental dynamics is lowest 4 the distribution of patches in a grassland is also determined by its patch size which determines the grain size of the configurations patch size can be considered an important driver determining diversity and resilience schippers et al 2015b with increasing patch size we expect larger and therefore more robust local populations verboom et al 2010 as patch sizes become smaller interpatch distances become shorter which induces better colonisation debinski et al 2001 wang and altermatt 2019 in turn enhancing species persistence therefore we hypothesise that diversity is highest at intermediate patch sizes because of the combination of good survival and high recolonisation 5 we expect that the effects of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics are not independent of each other i e there are significant interactions between these factors this would imply that these effects are context dependent complex interaction effects might be an emergent property of metacommunities because local community dynamics and spatial processes influence each other leibold et al 2004 2 model description 2 1 spatial structure the population dynamics of grassland species in the temperate climatic zone were simulated using transpop a spatially explicit population model schippers at al 2001 in this model space is represented by a lattice in which individual cells represent sites where plants can establish die and reproduce the cell size is such that it can accommodate a single adult of a species or strategy but each cell has a seedbank that can contain seeds of all the grassland species this means that the cell size must be related to the plant size in the vegetation we assumed an area of 10 10 cm for an average adult plant adult plants produce seeds that are dispersed over all or part of the lattice we used a lattice of 300 300 cells with periodic boundaries to mimic a continuous grassland 2 2 demographic structure for herbaceous vegetation the temperate climatic zone is characterised by strong seasonal changes which determine the transitions between states balzarolo et al 2019 our model contains the following state variables the number of seeds of each species in each cell z and the adult type a present in each cell the abbreviations in brackets refer to fig 1 scheme at the end of each growing season adult plants produce seeds f az which subsequently disperse d p seeds arriving in a cell are added to the species specific seedbank of that cell in autumn or early spring a fraction of the seeds germinate p zj and become seedlings j these seedlings compete with each other based on seedling quantity and competitive strength to become an adult p ja seedlings can only become an adult in vegetation gaps where the old adult does not survive p aa by natural mortality or external disturbance d t sensu grime 1979 disturbances were applied at random and quantified as the fraction of cells where the adult plant is removed every year also neighbouring adults compete with each other depending on their affinity for nutrients p v this gives the model a simple dynamic structure governed by four plant traits the seed production per adult f az and the three transition probabilities 1 the probability that an adult will survive p aa 2 the probability that a seed will survive p zz and 3 the probability that a seed will germinate and become a seedling p zj fig 1 as the number of adults seedlings or seeds present at any time in any cell might be small all calculations involving numbers and probabilities are done in a demographically stochastic way resulting in discrete numbers of individuals present in each stage durrett and levin 1994 in the model one cell can contain only one adult so a mechanism must be defined to describe the process of adult recruitment p ja this is usually modelled as a lottery process fagerström 1988 lavorel and chesson 1995 in which the probability that a seed of a species will become adult is determined by the proportion of germinating seeds to simulate the adult recruitment in a cell first for each species the number of seedlings j is calculated from the number of seeds z and the germination probability p zj fig 1 1 j z p z j this stochastic calculation results in integer numbers of seedlings between 0 and z the probability p ja that a certain species i will become an adult is proportional to the number of seedlings of this species and its competitive strength k i 2 p j a i j i k i x 1 n j x k x where j i is the number of seedlings of species i in a cell and n is the total number of species in the model in our case n 19 note that the competitive strength is a function of the nutrient level see table 1 to account for vegetative competition we also introduce direct competition between adults fig 1 adult species compete for light nutrients and water and should have an overlap in their root zone and leaf area schippers and joenje 2002 therefore we let only the closest four neighbouring species interact each year we compare the competitive strength between an adult in a central cell k c and the competitive strength of the adults of the four surrounding cells k 1 4 the probability that the adult in the central cell will be taken over by species i of the surrounding adults is 3 p v i k i 4 k c j 1 4 k j assuming that the plant in the central cell is four times as powerful as its competitive strength because it is already established if surrounding species are equally competitive the probability that the central cell is replaced is 0 5 so a strategy in the central cell with the same competitive power k as the surrounding cell has a 50 probability to be replaced by one of the surrounding cells and in 50 of the cases the central cell is not replaced eq 3 2 3 strategy parameterisation the 19 plant strategies used in the model were permutations of grime s c s and r strategies table 1 and each strategy is represented by one species the demographic parameters are from schippers et al 2001 the competitors c and stress tolerators s received demographic parameters from perennials without a seedbank and the ruderals r received parameters from annuals with a seedbank important trade offs between strategies are that ruderals produce more seeds with a long lifespan which enables them to establish a seedbank whereas stress tolerators and competitors produce fewer seeds but these germinate on the first occasion however r adults are short lived whereas s and c adults are long lived the competitive power of the adults is derived from grime s c s r classification the c and r strategies have a competitive strength k of 1 at high nutrient levels and 0 at low nutrient levels whereas s has a competitive strength of 0 at high nutrients and 1 at low nutrient levels we assumed that intermediate strategies have intermediate parameters for their demography and competitive strength for example strategy cs has the same demographic parameters as the c and s strategists but their maximum competitive strength is reached at the mean nutrient values of c and s which is 0 5 strategy cr has the mean demographic parameters of the c and r strategies but their maximum competitive strength is reached at the same nutrient level as c and r table 1 2 4 connectivity we assumed homogeneous dispersal within a certain distance expressed as the number of cells at a connectivity of 1 the mother plants dispersed their seeds to a block of 3 3 cells at a connectivity of 100 the mother plants dispersed their seeds to a block of 201 201 cells around the central mother cell since dispersal is very variable within a strategy grime 2001 we made connectivity a site property the accessibility of the patch being determined by the frequency and effectiveness of dispersal vectors assuming equal dispersal in all strategies 3 simulations and results the model was initialised with the 19 strategies randomly distributed over an area of 300 300 cells in which each cell had a probability of 1 19 of being occupied by one adult of each of the 19 strategies to obtain near equilibrium values we evaluated the effects of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics on the functional diversity after 500 years 3 1 simulations in homogeneous grasslands to compare the simulations with grime s strategy preferences we performed a series of simulations in a homogeneous grassland of 300 300 cells with periodic boundaries column x 1 is connected to column x 300 row y 1 is connected to row y 300 we performed 2100 simulations at 20 nutrient levels between 0 05 and 1 0 and 21 disturbance levels between 0 and 1 0 at five connectivity levels 1 3 10 30 and 100 all strategies had equal connectivity we started all simulations with the 19 strategies equally randomly distributed to obtain the simulated strategy preference in terms of nutrients and disturbance we calculated the weighted average of nutrients and disturbance of each strategy in the final coverage we performed linear regression between the nutrients n and disturbance d preferences of grime and the simulated preferences the simulations show that connectivity had no effect on the competitive outcome the results show that 18 of the 19 strategies were able to dominate at various n and d values in the simulations fig 2 only the r strategy did not survive the full 500 years it survived for about 100 years at high nutrient and disturbance levels but was then outcompeted by the r cr strategy linear regression shows that the n and d preference in the model was significantly related to the preference for d coef 1 003 r 2 0 888 p 1 0e 7 and n coef 1 025 r 2 0 998 p 1 0e 17 coordinates as used in grime s c s r classification grime 1979 the species diversity of the homogeneous simulations after 500 years varied between 1 4 strategies and was on average 1 4 strategy per simulation 3 2 simulations in gradients we study competition and functional diversity in spatially explicit gradients of nutrients n and disturbance d with an orthogonal configuration n gradient perpendicular to the d gradient because gradients are not always fully independent e g large disturbances induce litter and the decomposition of litter generate plant available nutrients schippers 2002 we also study the effects of a n gradient positively correlated with the d gradient and a n gradient negatively correlated with the d gradient both gradients run linearly from 0 to 1 in 300 equal steps as in the preceding simulations we also varied the connectivity 1 3 10 30 and 100 cells we applied linear regression to evaluate the effects of connectivity and gradient orientation on strategy diversity the results show that the lattice with perpendicular gradients had a significantly higher diversity of strategies than the lattices with the correlated gradients p 2e 6 at low connectivity e g 3 the n and d preferences of the various strategies resemble those of the homogeneous cases compare figs 2 and 3 a from which we conclude that strategies are able to find and stay in their optimal n and d environments connectivity had a strong negative effect on diversity in the tested gradients fig 3 p 1e 4 probably because seeds from elsewhere invade suboptimal areas and may outcompete strategies in their optimal areas because of the high seed rain fig 3 3 3 simulations in patchy grasslands to investigate the role of spatial heterogeneity environmental dynamics patch size and connectivity on the functional diversity we introduce patches being a squared group of adjacent cells with the same values for nutrients n and disturbance d so in a single configuration the whole area is covered with patches of the same size in different configurations these patches may have different sizes longevity environmental dynamics connectivity and spatial variation in n and d values heterogeneity spatial heterogeneity was applied as a patch of equally parameterised cells for n and d with a certain dimension patch size expressed as allowed random deviation from n 0 5 and d 0 5 for example when the patch size was 10 the lattice of 300 300 cells was subdivided into 30 30 blocks patches of 10 10 cells and each patch received randomly drawn values for nutrient availability and disturbance fraction per year at high heterogeneity e g 0 5 these values were randomly drawn from the range 0 to 1 at low heterogeneity e g 0 125 these values were drawn from the range 0 375 to 0 625 environmental dynamics in this framework was applied as the frequency of recalculation of n and d in a patch if environmental dynamics is 1 the model recalculates all grassland patches with new n and d values with the same heterogeneity and size every year without changing the strategy and seed presence if environmental dynamics is 0 1 the model recalculates new grassland patches in terms of n and d every 10 years which means that the community has 10 years to adapt to the new configuration we ran the model for various heterogeneity levels 0 0 125 0 25 0 375 0 5 patch size 1 3 10 30 cells being 1 1 3 3 10 10 30 30 cells environmental dynamics 0 0 01 0 033 0 1 0 33 1 0 year 1 and connectivity 1 3 10 30 100 cells combinations yielding 500 simulations in total to filter out the strategies that belong to a certain condition we use standardized values of the shannon index of the functional diversity of the adult plants after 500 years to perform a linear regression the shannon index was chosen because it keeps track of strategy presence and abundance the results show that heterogeneity in terms of n and d was the most important factor determining strategy diversity followed by environmental dynamics connectivity and patch size table 2 fig 4 grasslands with high heterogeneity and patch size had a high functional diversity fig 4 while high values for dynamics and connectivity had in general a negative impact on the functional diversity all interactions were significant meaning that diversity responses change when predictor values changed for example at higher patch sizes 10 30 and intermediate dynamics 0 1 0 033 some connectivity even helped to increase diversity fig 4 g h k l despite the generally negative effect of connectivity on diversity fig 5 illustrates the effect of connectivity and grassland diversity on the final distribution of strategies it shows how at low connectivity the strategies clustered in compact monocultures at roughly the patch size whereas at higher connectivity the grassland heterogeneity block pattern was lost and accidental clusters of similar n and d determined local strategy dominance 4 discussion 4 1 approach we took a novel approach by using herbaceous plant strategies based on grime s c s r framework in a metacommunity model allowing us to study local and spatial processes simultaneously leibold et al 2004 the parameterised model was able to predict the strategy preferences for disturbance and nutrients published by grime 1979 grime 1979 very well fig 2 3a which shows the validity of our approach simulations in landscapes with n and d gradients showed that strategy survival is sorted along the n and d gradients producing high vegetation diversity when n and d gradients are perpendicular to each other this patchy survival pattern is enforced by relatively low rates of dispersal which were apparently still sufficient to enable different strategies to sort for optimal n and d levels fig 3a b c we focus on the effects of various factors on strategy diversity after a long time period 500 years to obtain near equilibrium values the advantage of such an approach is that we allow the sorting process to select strategies that survive over a long time but we miss the dynamics a comparison of temporal patterns might reveal addition insights for example on the succession and transient dynamics of strategies but this was beyond the scope of this paper 4 2 main results simulations in patchy landscapes show that environmental heterogeneity in terms of n and d was the most important factor determining strategy survival followed by environmental dynamics connectivity and patch size table 2 fig 5 high grassland heterogeneity and patch size led to high functional diversity fig 5 while high values for environmental dynamics and connectivity had in general a negative impact on the functional diversity of surviving strategies all first order interactions between the predictor values were significant indicating a change in response at different predictor levels 4 3 hypotheses from our first hypothesis we expect that spatial heterogeneity enhances functional diversity that as a grassland becomes more diverse in terms of nutrients n and disturbance d the number of functional strategies that will be able to survive will increase this is confirmed by our results at high spatial heterogeneity the species sorting process governs strategy survival leibold et al 2017 strategies survive in the patches where the environmental properties best fit their preferences for n and d local heterogeneity is regarded to be an important factor determining diversity in grasslands hovick et al 2015 krauss et al 2004 scott and baer 2019 that heterogeneity is the most important factor determining functional diversity can be understood from the fact that spatial heterogeneity determines spatially explicit habitat variation in terms of nutrients and disturbance a first requirement for the facilitation of strategies for example the diversity in the homogeneous simulation had on average 1 4 strategy per simulation range 1 to 4 whereas the diversity of high heterogeneity can be 18 fig 5 other factors can only be of importance if they affect high diversity cases at high heterogeneity levels because they cannot generate diversity solely from our second hypothesis we expect that high connectivity across the landscape enabling high dispersal distances enhances functional diversity in grasslands by shifting the balance between colonisation and local extinction in favour of the former our results however show the opposite higher connectivity generally reduces diversity this can be explained by the fact that increased connectivity increases not only the colonisation rate but also the degree of competitive interactions between residence and colonising strategies leading to a higher rate of competitive exclusion at high connectivity inducing a large seed rain colonising strategies may replace residential strategies even when the latter are superior competitors locally therefore colonising strategies can overcome local competitive exclusion in communities where they are poor competitors through immigration from communities where they are good competitors this is called the mass effect paradigm leibold et al 2004 at lower connectivity however competition is more local residential strategies are better at monopolising the resources in residential patches and the species sorting process predominates the occurrence of strategies in each patch is not only determined by habitat suitability but also by the accessibility of the patch within the landscape for highly fragmented landscapes it has been shown that the degree to which strategies occur in suitable habitat patches was increased by a greater capacity for long distance dispersal greater adult longevity and the capacity to build a persistent seedbank ozinga et al 2005 van der veken et al 2007 this indicates that the predictability of strategy composition from environmental conditions due to species sorting is reduced by both dispersal limitation and mass effects heino et al 2015 for dispersal to be effective a given strategy should still be present in other patches across the landscape which act like an external memory ogle et al 2015 this is also dependent on other landscape characteristics such as the availability of similar patches within the landscape in addition the effective dispersal of seeds depends on the availability and efficiency of dispersal vectors such as wind water and animals this aspect is not included in the model but a reduced availability of dispersal vectors has been shown to be an important driver of species losses ozinga et al 2009 when dispersal is limited in highly fragmented landscapes we expect connectivity to have a positive effect on diversity at intermediate connectivity strategies that match the local environmental conditions survive and we expect the highest diversity resulting from the species sorting process when there is high spatial heterogeneity but in landscapes with a high connectivity where seed loads from elsewhere might be high we expect a negative effect from connectivity on local diversity due to mass effects from our third hypothesis we expect that high environmental dynamics the potential of a patch to change in terms of nutrient availability and disturbance will cause rapid species loss because sorting strategies that select their matching patch have to start all over again after a change in conditions this will shift the dynamic balance between rates of colonisation and local extinction leading to a higher risk of regional extinction this is consistent with metapopulation theory hanski 1998 our results confirm this diversity was highest at lowest environmental dynamics environmental dynamics strongly disrupts the species sorting process leading to low diversity values strategies should after a reattribution event try to find their optimal habitat again to secure long term survival this might be risky and lead to species extinction we would expect ruderal strategies to be able to cope with the environmental dynamics because of their larger dispersal potential more seeds and their longer survival in the seedbank in our simulations at high environmental dynamics the stress tolerating ruderal sr is the dominant strategy with moderately ruderal properties and maximum competitive strength at intermediate nutrient levels apparently this intermediate strategy is superior here because its properties are adapted to the average n and d of dynamic grasslands allowing it to outcompete other strategies according to our fourth hypothesis we expect grasslands with intermediate patch size to have the highest diversity because they combine high colonisation with a relatively low extinction rate our simulations show however higher diversity levels in coarse grained landscapes especially at low connectivity levels fig 4 table 2 when connectivity levels in the simulations were high 100 diversity was low the good performance of a coarser grained landscape in combination with low connectivity can be explained by the fact that limited connectivity in combination with high patch sizes is responsible for seed dispersal within a patch already dominated by a single strategy this consolidates strategy persistence in patches but reduces interspecific competition that leads to strategy loss from our fifth hypotheses we expect that the effects of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics are not independent of each other i e there are significant interactions between these factors this would imply that these effects are context dependant complex interactions might be an emergent property of metacommunities because local community dynamics and spatial processes affect each other leibold et al 2004 patch heterogeneity showed strong negative interactions with both environmental dynamics and connectivity this was caused by the fact that high spatial heterogeneity causes high strategy diversity allowing a stronger negative response by environmental dynamics and connectivity in contrast patch size showed a positive interaction with heterogeneity indicating a stronger positive response of patch size at higher heterogeneity levels interaction between connectivity and environmental dynamics was also strong at intermediate environmental dynamics levels and at larger patch sizes simulations even show that some connectivity causes higher diversity indicating that connectivity at a certain level helps strategies to find suitable patches in changing grassland fig 4 g h k l at higher connectivity levels however diversity is reduced by increased interspecific competition induced by species rich seedbanks here mass produced offspring of accidental dominating strategies outperform other strategies in their optimal habitat bergholz et al 2017 schippers et al 2015a therefore we expect higher diversity at intermediate connectivity because dispersal is high enough to enable species to find suitable patches but is low enough to prevent dominance across the landscape by a few species due to mass effects here the balanced presence of multiple species in the seedbank allows species to sort for their optimal habitat heino et al 2015 wirth et al 2021 patch size negatively interacted with dynamics and connectivity which indicates that at decreasing dynamics and connectivity species richness was more strongly affected by higher patch sizes the large number of significant interactions suggests that the optimal spatial design of landscapes with respect to functional diversity is context dependent for nature policy this implies that effectiveness of measures to increase diversity is affected by codetermining factors 5 conclusions we found that strategy survival is affected by the orientation of the two gradients the perpendicular orientation creates more diversity in nutrients n and disturbance d combinations which provides more room for the survival of strategies than the two configurations in which the gradients are correlated run in the same direction we expect that gradients at acute angles but significantly larger than zero will produce similar diversity in n and d and will therefore generate the same strategy diversity as the perpendicular orientation clearly there are also other environmental gradients to consider such as moisture elevation salinity and light jiang et al 2012 kadmon 1995 schmidt et al 1996 that can also contribute to environmental and species diversity this means that from the species conservation context we should protect or create landscapes with multiple gradients because they are an important source of biodiversity the results of the patchy simulations show that grassland heterogeneity in terms of n and d was the most important factor determining strategy survival and diversity followed by environmental dynamics connectivity and patch size we therefore expect that high grassland heterogeneity and patch size will lead to high functional diversity in the field in contrast high values for environmental dynamics and connectivity will in general negatively affect the functional diversity in the field because all predictor interactions were significant we expect that diversity responds differently at different predictor levels for nature policy this implies that effectiveness of measures to increase diversity is affected by codetermining factors the functional diversity of local grassland communities is considered to be an important ecosystem property determining its resistance and resilience fischer et al 2006 holling 1973 isbell et al 2015 ecosystems with a high diversity in functional groups are better able to respond to temporary change because there is a higher probability that there are species present in the local species pool that can cope with a certain disturbance or environmental change folke et al 2004 in diverse communities sudden but temporary changes in nutrient availability and disturbance regime will select for species that can cope with these new environmental conditions at the cost of less appropriate strategies if this competitive exclusion is slow indicated by a large diversity at the end of the simulations diversity will not decline quickly and the previous species composition can be restored because most species are still present in remnant populations if competitive exclusion is fast rapid species loss occurs and the vegetation cannot return to the previous state high connectivity and environmental dynamics low patch size and low heterogeneity intensifies interspecies competition and causes rapid species loss which strongly reduces resistance and resilience this shows that high species diversity in itself does not protect against diversity loss but that factors contributing to the maintenance of high diversity reduce the risk of species extinction and foster resistance and resilience credit authorship contribution statement peter

24359,the functional diversity of local plant communities is considered to be an important driver of ecosystem resistance and resilience various landscape characteristics can influence local functional diversity but their relative importance is poorly understood we used a spatially explicit grassland model transpop to simulate competition between 19 functional plant strategies as defined by grime s c s r framework each with different affinities for levels of nutrient availability n and disturbance d first we explore the effects of n and d levels on strategy preference subsequently we studied functional diversity in patchy landscapes with various levels of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics with patches differing in n and d we evaluated the relative importance of these factors in determining the functional diversity of permanent grasslands of the temperate climatic zone simulated n and d optima for occurrence of strategies matched those of grime perpendicular n and d gradients were twice as diverse as correlated configurations the results show that heterogeneity in n and d was the most important factor determining strategy diversity followed by environmental dynamics connectivity and patch size grasslands with large heterogeneity and patch size have a high functional diversity whereas high values for dynamics and connectivity had in general a negative impact on functional diversity the frequent occurrence of significant interactions among characteristics suggests that the optimal spatial design of landscapes with respect to functional diversity is context dependent contrary to expectations connectivity generally had a negative effect on the diversity of plant strategies this was attributed to the fact that connectivity intensifies competition between strategies high connectivity and environmental dynamics low patch size and low heterogeneity intensifies interspecies competition and causes rapid species loss which strongly reduces resistance and resilience this shows that high species diversity in itself does not protect against diversity loss but that factors contributing to the maintenance of high diversity reduce the risk of species extinction and enable resistance and resilience keywords mass effects colonisation limitation metacommunity model species sorting dispersal seedbank data availability published data were used for parameterization of the model 1 introduction 1 1 functional diversity resistance and resilience the functional diversity of local grassland communities the number of functionally disparate species within a community is considered to be an important driver of ecosystem resistance and resilience i e the ability of an ecosystem to deal with environmental change or to return to its former state after disturbances fischer et al 2006 holling 1973 isbell et al 2015 schweiger et al 2019 ecosystems with a high diversity of functional groups are better able to respond to disturbances and temporary environmental change because there is a greater probability of there being species tolerant of a certain disturbance or environmental change in the local species pool craven et al 2018 folke et al 2004 loreau et al 2001 another factor that determines resistance and resilience at a larger spatial scale is the availability of such species in the regional species pool a form of ecological memory bengtsson et al 2003 sterk et al 2016 species that have become less abundant or locally extinct can be recruited from elsewhere through dispersal or from the seedbank peterson 2002 wisnoski et al 2019 enabling them to re enter the ecosystem dispersal ability and seed longevity dormancy are therefore considered to be crucial traits of plant species enabling them to cope with disturbance and environmental change there are various landscape characteristics that can influence the functional diversity of local plant communities but their relative importance is still poorly understood leibold et al 2017 which in turn might hamper conservation efforts chase et al 2020 1 2 extinction and colonisation the local diversity of grassland communities is governed by two processes colonisation by new species and the extinction of established species colonisation by new species is enhanced by high connectivity between habitat patches damschen et al 2019 ozinga et al 2009 while extinction is governed by local environmental change interspecies competition schippers et al 2015a and disturbances muller et al 2014 plants with dormant seeds however may recover from disturbances by reestablishment from the seedbank scott and morgan 2012 shea et al 2010 interspecies competition is governed to a large extent by local nutrient availability roeling et al 2018 schippers et al 1999 at low nutrient availability plants with an efficient nutrient economy outcompete fast growing species whereas at high nutrient availability fast growing species outperform species with an efficient nutrient economy through resource pre emption hetzer et al 2021 poorter et al 1990 schippers and kropff 2001 the diversity and species composition of local plant communities are thus determined both by processes that operate on a local scale e g environmental filtering and biotic interactions and by processes that operate on a higher spatial scale e g connectivity and processes related to habitat heterogeneity leibold et al 2017 2004 traditionally these two scales have been studied separately but the emergence of metacommunity models enables us to combine both scales because these models keep track of local and spatial processes simultaneously chase et al 2020 however although such scale explicit approaches offer great potential for generalisations often they do not incorporate information on functional diversity 1 3 grime s vegetation theory grime campbell and grime 1992 grime 1979 2001 developed the c s r framework of three fundamental strategies of plant species in response to nutrient availability and disturbance see also moulin et al 2021 competitors c dominate at low disturbance and high nutrients stress tolerators s are abundant at low disturbance and low nutrients while ruderals r survive at high disturbance and high nutrients grime s c s r framework assumes a three way trade off between competition for resources c endurance of resource limitation s and recovery after disturbance r from this he derived seven strategies c s r cs cr sr csr in which cs cr sr and csr strategies have intermediate characteristics of c s and r subsequently he defined 12 crossover strategies to produce a total of 19 strategies adapted to specific disturbance and nutrient regimes grime 2001 predicted that a greater resilience in r and c strategies on the basis of their faster rates of resource capture and growth on the other hand a greater resistance is expected for the s strategy due to their longevity and better tolerance of harsh conditions e g low nutrient availability moreover he predicted that both resistance and resilience will be higher in communities with a higher functional diversity this is consistent with experimental results in grasslands in the uk grime et al 2000 and the results from a global metanalysis of the results from we use data from 39 grassland biodiversity experiments craven et al 2018 1 4 spatial vegetation modelling diversity lattice based models are frequently used to describe vegetation dynamics these models include tree based and plant based gap modelling in which seed and seedlings compete for a gap in a mature vegetation cover coffin and lauenroth 1990 elzein et al 2020 kellomäki and väisänen 1991 morin et al 2020 peters 2002 reynolds et al 2001 when these models are applied to multiple species they may generate insight into the factors affecting species dominance and diversity for instance schippers et al 2001 used a lattice based gap model transpop to simulate competition and coexistence between perennials and annuals with dormant and non dormant seeds at various disturbance levels they found a stable coexistence between strategies with dormant and non dormant seeds at intermediate levels of disturbance 1 5 approach various landscape characteristics can influence local functional diversity but their relative importance is poorly understood we studied the effects of connectivity spatial heterogeneity patch size and environmental dynamics on the functional diversity of permanent grasslands of the temperate climatic zone we used the spatially explicit metacommunity model transpop schippers 2001 that enables us to study long term species sorting in response to disturbance d as a starting point we extended this model with routines allowing inter plant competition affected by nutrients n this enabled us to study species response to both nutrients and disturbance we parameterised 19 herbaceous grassland species according to the c s r framework of grime first we tested strategy preferences for n and disturbance d in homogeneous landscapes and gradients of n and d subsequently we studied functional diversity in patchy landscapes with various levels of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics we define a patch as a group of adjacent cells having the same n and d level we used the model to evaluate the relative importance of these factors in determining the functional diversity in grasslands using the shannon diversity index more specifically we tested the following hypotheses 1 6 hypotheses 1 we expect that spatial heterogeneity in terms of nutrients and disturbance enhances diversity through species sorting across environmental gradients fournier et al 2017 gastauer et al 2021 as environmental diversity increases we expect more species will survive in these grasslands bergholz et al 2017 deák et al 2021 guo et al 2018 2 we expect that high connectivity across the landscape enabling high dispersal distances enhances species diversity in grasslands by shifting the balance between colonisation and local extinction towards colonisation wang and altermatt 2019 this enhanced colonisation stimulates plant species establishment in local communities increasing diversity ozinga et al 2009 3 we expect that high environmental dynamics involving changes in the nutrient availability and disturbance regime of grassland patches over time will cause rapid species loss because these changes disrupt the species sorting process fournier et al 2017 leibold and loeuille 2015 therefore we expect to find the highest functional diversity where the environmental dynamics is lowest 4 the distribution of patches in a grassland is also determined by its patch size which determines the grain size of the configurations patch size can be considered an important driver determining diversity and resilience schippers et al 2015b with increasing patch size we expect larger and therefore more robust local populations verboom et al 2010 as patch sizes become smaller interpatch distances become shorter which induces better colonisation debinski et al 2001 wang and altermatt 2019 in turn enhancing species persistence therefore we hypothesise that diversity is highest at intermediate patch sizes because of the combination of good survival and high recolonisation 5 we expect that the effects of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics are not independent of each other i e there are significant interactions between these factors this would imply that these effects are context dependent complex interaction effects might be an emergent property of metacommunities because local community dynamics and spatial processes influence each other leibold et al 2004 2 model description 2 1 spatial structure the population dynamics of grassland species in the temperate climatic zone were simulated using transpop a spatially explicit population model schippers at al 2001 in this model space is represented by a lattice in which individual cells represent sites where plants can establish die and reproduce the cell size is such that it can accommodate a single adult of a species or strategy but each cell has a seedbank that can contain seeds of all the grassland species this means that the cell size must be related to the plant size in the vegetation we assumed an area of 10 10 cm for an average adult plant adult plants produce seeds that are dispersed over all or part of the lattice we used a lattice of 300 300 cells with periodic boundaries to mimic a continuous grassland 2 2 demographic structure for herbaceous vegetation the temperate climatic zone is characterised by strong seasonal changes which determine the transitions between states balzarolo et al 2019 our model contains the following state variables the number of seeds of each species in each cell z and the adult type a present in each cell the abbreviations in brackets refer to fig 1 scheme at the end of each growing season adult plants produce seeds f az which subsequently disperse d p seeds arriving in a cell are added to the species specific seedbank of that cell in autumn or early spring a fraction of the seeds germinate p zj and become seedlings j these seedlings compete with each other based on seedling quantity and competitive strength to become an adult p ja seedlings can only become an adult in vegetation gaps where the old adult does not survive p aa by natural mortality or external disturbance d t sensu grime 1979 disturbances were applied at random and quantified as the fraction of cells where the adult plant is removed every year also neighbouring adults compete with each other depending on their affinity for nutrients p v this gives the model a simple dynamic structure governed by four plant traits the seed production per adult f az and the three transition probabilities 1 the probability that an adult will survive p aa 2 the probability that a seed will survive p zz and 3 the probability that a seed will germinate and become a seedling p zj fig 1 as the number of adults seedlings or seeds present at any time in any cell might be small all calculations involving numbers and probabilities are done in a demographically stochastic way resulting in discrete numbers of individuals present in each stage durrett and levin 1994 in the model one cell can contain only one adult so a mechanism must be defined to describe the process of adult recruitment p ja this is usually modelled as a lottery process fagerström 1988 lavorel and chesson 1995 in which the probability that a seed of a species will become adult is determined by the proportion of germinating seeds to simulate the adult recruitment in a cell first for each species the number of seedlings j is calculated from the number of seeds z and the germination probability p zj fig 1 1 j z p z j this stochastic calculation results in integer numbers of seedlings between 0 and z the probability p ja that a certain species i will become an adult is proportional to the number of seedlings of this species and its competitive strength k i 2 p j a i j i k i x 1 n j x k x where j i is the number of seedlings of species i in a cell and n is the total number of species in the model in our case n 19 note that the competitive strength is a function of the nutrient level see table 1 to account for vegetative competition we also introduce direct competition between adults fig 1 adult species compete for light nutrients and water and should have an overlap in their root zone and leaf area schippers and joenje 2002 therefore we let only the closest four neighbouring species interact each year we compare the competitive strength between an adult in a central cell k c and the competitive strength of the adults of the four surrounding cells k 1 4 the probability that the adult in the central cell will be taken over by species i of the surrounding adults is 3 p v i k i 4 k c j 1 4 k j assuming that the plant in the central cell is four times as powerful as its competitive strength because it is already established if surrounding species are equally competitive the probability that the central cell is replaced is 0 5 so a strategy in the central cell with the same competitive power k as the surrounding cell has a 50 probability to be replaced by one of the surrounding cells and in 50 of the cases the central cell is not replaced eq 3 2 3 strategy parameterisation the 19 plant strategies used in the model were permutations of grime s c s and r strategies table 1 and each strategy is represented by one species the demographic parameters are from schippers et al 2001 the competitors c and stress tolerators s received demographic parameters from perennials without a seedbank and the ruderals r received parameters from annuals with a seedbank important trade offs between strategies are that ruderals produce more seeds with a long lifespan which enables them to establish a seedbank whereas stress tolerators and competitors produce fewer seeds but these germinate on the first occasion however r adults are short lived whereas s and c adults are long lived the competitive power of the adults is derived from grime s c s r classification the c and r strategies have a competitive strength k of 1 at high nutrient levels and 0 at low nutrient levels whereas s has a competitive strength of 0 at high nutrients and 1 at low nutrient levels we assumed that intermediate strategies have intermediate parameters for their demography and competitive strength for example strategy cs has the same demographic parameters as the c and s strategists but their maximum competitive strength is reached at the mean nutrient values of c and s which is 0 5 strategy cr has the mean demographic parameters of the c and r strategies but their maximum competitive strength is reached at the same nutrient level as c and r table 1 2 4 connectivity we assumed homogeneous dispersal within a certain distance expressed as the number of cells at a connectivity of 1 the mother plants dispersed their seeds to a block of 3 3 cells at a connectivity of 100 the mother plants dispersed their seeds to a block of 201 201 cells around the central mother cell since dispersal is very variable within a strategy grime 2001 we made connectivity a site property the accessibility of the patch being determined by the frequency and effectiveness of dispersal vectors assuming equal dispersal in all strategies 3 simulations and results the model was initialised with the 19 strategies randomly distributed over an area of 300 300 cells in which each cell had a probability of 1 19 of being occupied by one adult of each of the 19 strategies to obtain near equilibrium values we evaluated the effects of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics on the functional diversity after 500 years 3 1 simulations in homogeneous grasslands to compare the simulations with grime s strategy preferences we performed a series of simulations in a homogeneous grassland of 300 300 cells with periodic boundaries column x 1 is connected to column x 300 row y 1 is connected to row y 300 we performed 2100 simulations at 20 nutrient levels between 0 05 and 1 0 and 21 disturbance levels between 0 and 1 0 at five connectivity levels 1 3 10 30 and 100 all strategies had equal connectivity we started all simulations with the 19 strategies equally randomly distributed to obtain the simulated strategy preference in terms of nutrients and disturbance we calculated the weighted average of nutrients and disturbance of each strategy in the final coverage we performed linear regression between the nutrients n and disturbance d preferences of grime and the simulated preferences the simulations show that connectivity had no effect on the competitive outcome the results show that 18 of the 19 strategies were able to dominate at various n and d values in the simulations fig 2 only the r strategy did not survive the full 500 years it survived for about 100 years at high nutrient and disturbance levels but was then outcompeted by the r cr strategy linear regression shows that the n and d preference in the model was significantly related to the preference for d coef 1 003 r 2 0 888 p 1 0e 7 and n coef 1 025 r 2 0 998 p 1 0e 17 coordinates as used in grime s c s r classification grime 1979 the species diversity of the homogeneous simulations after 500 years varied between 1 4 strategies and was on average 1 4 strategy per simulation 3 2 simulations in gradients we study competition and functional diversity in spatially explicit gradients of nutrients n and disturbance d with an orthogonal configuration n gradient perpendicular to the d gradient because gradients are not always fully independent e g large disturbances induce litter and the decomposition of litter generate plant available nutrients schippers 2002 we also study the effects of a n gradient positively correlated with the d gradient and a n gradient negatively correlated with the d gradient both gradients run linearly from 0 to 1 in 300 equal steps as in the preceding simulations we also varied the connectivity 1 3 10 30 and 100 cells we applied linear regression to evaluate the effects of connectivity and gradient orientation on strategy diversity the results show that the lattice with perpendicular gradients had a significantly higher diversity of strategies than the lattices with the correlated gradients p 2e 6 at low connectivity e g 3 the n and d preferences of the various strategies resemble those of the homogeneous cases compare figs 2 and 3 a from which we conclude that strategies are able to find and stay in their optimal n and d environments connectivity had a strong negative effect on diversity in the tested gradients fig 3 p 1e 4 probably because seeds from elsewhere invade suboptimal areas and may outcompete strategies in their optimal areas because of the high seed rain fig 3 3 3 simulations in patchy grasslands to investigate the role of spatial heterogeneity environmental dynamics patch size and connectivity on the functional diversity we introduce patches being a squared group of adjacent cells with the same values for nutrients n and disturbance d so in a single configuration the whole area is covered with patches of the same size in different configurations these patches may have different sizes longevity environmental dynamics connectivity and spatial variation in n and d values heterogeneity spatial heterogeneity was applied as a patch of equally parameterised cells for n and d with a certain dimension patch size expressed as allowed random deviation from n 0 5 and d 0 5 for example when the patch size was 10 the lattice of 300 300 cells was subdivided into 30 30 blocks patches of 10 10 cells and each patch received randomly drawn values for nutrient availability and disturbance fraction per year at high heterogeneity e g 0 5 these values were randomly drawn from the range 0 to 1 at low heterogeneity e g 0 125 these values were drawn from the range 0 375 to 0 625 environmental dynamics in this framework was applied as the frequency of recalculation of n and d in a patch if environmental dynamics is 1 the model recalculates all grassland patches with new n and d values with the same heterogeneity and size every year without changing the strategy and seed presence if environmental dynamics is 0 1 the model recalculates new grassland patches in terms of n and d every 10 years which means that the community has 10 years to adapt to the new configuration we ran the model for various heterogeneity levels 0 0 125 0 25 0 375 0 5 patch size 1 3 10 30 cells being 1 1 3 3 10 10 30 30 cells environmental dynamics 0 0 01 0 033 0 1 0 33 1 0 year 1 and connectivity 1 3 10 30 100 cells combinations yielding 500 simulations in total to filter out the strategies that belong to a certain condition we use standardized values of the shannon index of the functional diversity of the adult plants after 500 years to perform a linear regression the shannon index was chosen because it keeps track of strategy presence and abundance the results show that heterogeneity in terms of n and d was the most important factor determining strategy diversity followed by environmental dynamics connectivity and patch size table 2 fig 4 grasslands with high heterogeneity and patch size had a high functional diversity fig 4 while high values for dynamics and connectivity had in general a negative impact on the functional diversity all interactions were significant meaning that diversity responses change when predictor values changed for example at higher patch sizes 10 30 and intermediate dynamics 0 1 0 033 some connectivity even helped to increase diversity fig 4 g h k l despite the generally negative effect of connectivity on diversity fig 5 illustrates the effect of connectivity and grassland diversity on the final distribution of strategies it shows how at low connectivity the strategies clustered in compact monocultures at roughly the patch size whereas at higher connectivity the grassland heterogeneity block pattern was lost and accidental clusters of similar n and d determined local strategy dominance 4 discussion 4 1 approach we took a novel approach by using herbaceous plant strategies based on grime s c s r framework in a metacommunity model allowing us to study local and spatial processes simultaneously leibold et al 2004 the parameterised model was able to predict the strategy preferences for disturbance and nutrients published by grime 1979 grime 1979 very well fig 2 3a which shows the validity of our approach simulations in landscapes with n and d gradients showed that strategy survival is sorted along the n and d gradients producing high vegetation diversity when n and d gradients are perpendicular to each other this patchy survival pattern is enforced by relatively low rates of dispersal which were apparently still sufficient to enable different strategies to sort for optimal n and d levels fig 3a b c we focus on the effects of various factors on strategy diversity after a long time period 500 years to obtain near equilibrium values the advantage of such an approach is that we allow the sorting process to select strategies that survive over a long time but we miss the dynamics a comparison of temporal patterns might reveal addition insights for example on the succession and transient dynamics of strategies but this was beyond the scope of this paper 4 2 main results simulations in patchy landscapes show that environmental heterogeneity in terms of n and d was the most important factor determining strategy survival followed by environmental dynamics connectivity and patch size table 2 fig 5 high grassland heterogeneity and patch size led to high functional diversity fig 5 while high values for environmental dynamics and connectivity had in general a negative impact on the functional diversity of surviving strategies all first order interactions between the predictor values were significant indicating a change in response at different predictor levels 4 3 hypotheses from our first hypothesis we expect that spatial heterogeneity enhances functional diversity that as a grassland becomes more diverse in terms of nutrients n and disturbance d the number of functional strategies that will be able to survive will increase this is confirmed by our results at high spatial heterogeneity the species sorting process governs strategy survival leibold et al 2017 strategies survive in the patches where the environmental properties best fit their preferences for n and d local heterogeneity is regarded to be an important factor determining diversity in grasslands hovick et al 2015 krauss et al 2004 scott and baer 2019 that heterogeneity is the most important factor determining functional diversity can be understood from the fact that spatial heterogeneity determines spatially explicit habitat variation in terms of nutrients and disturbance a first requirement for the facilitation of strategies for example the diversity in the homogeneous simulation had on average 1 4 strategy per simulation range 1 to 4 whereas the diversity of high heterogeneity can be 18 fig 5 other factors can only be of importance if they affect high diversity cases at high heterogeneity levels because they cannot generate diversity solely from our second hypothesis we expect that high connectivity across the landscape enabling high dispersal distances enhances functional diversity in grasslands by shifting the balance between colonisation and local extinction in favour of the former our results however show the opposite higher connectivity generally reduces diversity this can be explained by the fact that increased connectivity increases not only the colonisation rate but also the degree of competitive interactions between residence and colonising strategies leading to a higher rate of competitive exclusion at high connectivity inducing a large seed rain colonising strategies may replace residential strategies even when the latter are superior competitors locally therefore colonising strategies can overcome local competitive exclusion in communities where they are poor competitors through immigration from communities where they are good competitors this is called the mass effect paradigm leibold et al 2004 at lower connectivity however competition is more local residential strategies are better at monopolising the resources in residential patches and the species sorting process predominates the occurrence of strategies in each patch is not only determined by habitat suitability but also by the accessibility of the patch within the landscape for highly fragmented landscapes it has been shown that the degree to which strategies occur in suitable habitat patches was increased by a greater capacity for long distance dispersal greater adult longevity and the capacity to build a persistent seedbank ozinga et al 2005 van der veken et al 2007 this indicates that the predictability of strategy composition from environmental conditions due to species sorting is reduced by both dispersal limitation and mass effects heino et al 2015 for dispersal to be effective a given strategy should still be present in other patches across the landscape which act like an external memory ogle et al 2015 this is also dependent on other landscape characteristics such as the availability of similar patches within the landscape in addition the effective dispersal of seeds depends on the availability and efficiency of dispersal vectors such as wind water and animals this aspect is not included in the model but a reduced availability of dispersal vectors has been shown to be an important driver of species losses ozinga et al 2009 when dispersal is limited in highly fragmented landscapes we expect connectivity to have a positive effect on diversity at intermediate connectivity strategies that match the local environmental conditions survive and we expect the highest diversity resulting from the species sorting process when there is high spatial heterogeneity but in landscapes with a high connectivity where seed loads from elsewhere might be high we expect a negative effect from connectivity on local diversity due to mass effects from our third hypothesis we expect that high environmental dynamics the potential of a patch to change in terms of nutrient availability and disturbance will cause rapid species loss because sorting strategies that select their matching patch have to start all over again after a change in conditions this will shift the dynamic balance between rates of colonisation and local extinction leading to a higher risk of regional extinction this is consistent with metapopulation theory hanski 1998 our results confirm this diversity was highest at lowest environmental dynamics environmental dynamics strongly disrupts the species sorting process leading to low diversity values strategies should after a reattribution event try to find their optimal habitat again to secure long term survival this might be risky and lead to species extinction we would expect ruderal strategies to be able to cope with the environmental dynamics because of their larger dispersal potential more seeds and their longer survival in the seedbank in our simulations at high environmental dynamics the stress tolerating ruderal sr is the dominant strategy with moderately ruderal properties and maximum competitive strength at intermediate nutrient levels apparently this intermediate strategy is superior here because its properties are adapted to the average n and d of dynamic grasslands allowing it to outcompete other strategies according to our fourth hypothesis we expect grasslands with intermediate patch size to have the highest diversity because they combine high colonisation with a relatively low extinction rate our simulations show however higher diversity levels in coarse grained landscapes especially at low connectivity levels fig 4 table 2 when connectivity levels in the simulations were high 100 diversity was low the good performance of a coarser grained landscape in combination with low connectivity can be explained by the fact that limited connectivity in combination with high patch sizes is responsible for seed dispersal within a patch already dominated by a single strategy this consolidates strategy persistence in patches but reduces interspecific competition that leads to strategy loss from our fifth hypotheses we expect that the effects of heterogeneity patch size connectivity and environmental dynamics are not independent of each other i e there are significant interactions between these factors this would imply that these effects are context dependant complex interactions might be an emergent property of metacommunities because local community dynamics and spatial processes affect each other leibold et al 2004 patch heterogeneity showed strong negative interactions with both environmental dynamics and connectivity this was caused by the fact that high spatial heterogeneity causes high strategy diversity allowing a stronger negative response by environmental dynamics and connectivity in contrast patch size showed a positive interaction with heterogeneity indicating a stronger positive response of patch size at higher heterogeneity levels interaction between connectivity and environmental dynamics was also strong at intermediate environmental dynamics levels and at larger patch sizes simulations even show that some connectivity causes higher diversity indicating that connectivity at a certain level helps strategies to find suitable patches in changing grassland fig 4 g h k l at higher connectivity levels however diversity is reduced by increased interspecific competition induced by species rich seedbanks here mass produced offspring of accidental dominating strategies outperform other strategies in their optimal habitat bergholz et al 2017 schippers et al 2015a therefore we expect higher diversity at intermediate connectivity because dispersal is high enough to enable species to find suitable patches but is low enough to prevent dominance across the landscape by a few species due to mass effects here the balanced presence of multiple species in the seedbank allows species to sort for their optimal habitat heino et al 2015 wirth et al 2021 patch size negatively interacted with dynamics and connectivity which indicates that at decreasing dynamics and connectivity species richness was more strongly affected by higher patch sizes the large number of significant interactions suggests that the optimal spatial design of landscapes with respect to functional diversity is context dependent for nature policy this implies that effectiveness of measures to increase diversity is affected by codetermining factors 5 conclusions we found that strategy survival is affected by the orientation of the two gradients the perpendicular orientation creates more diversity in nutrients n and disturbance d combinations which provides more room for the survival of strategies than the two configurations in which the gradients are correlated run in the same direction we expect that gradients at acute angles but significantly larger than zero will produce similar diversity in n and d and will therefore generate the same strategy diversity as the perpendicular orientation clearly there are also other environmental gradients to consider such as moisture elevation salinity and light jiang et al 2012 kadmon 1995 schmidt et al 1996 that can also contribute to environmental and species diversity this means that from the species conservation context we should protect or create landscapes with multiple gradients because they are an important source of biodiversity the results of the patchy simulations show that grassland heterogeneity in terms of n and d was the most important factor determining strategy survival and diversity followed by environmental dynamics connectivity and patch size we therefore expect that high grassland heterogeneity and patch size will lead to high functional diversity in the field in contrast high values for environmental dynamics and connectivity will in general negatively affect the functional diversity in the field because all predictor interactions were significant we expect that diversity responds differently at different predictor levels for nature policy this implies that effectiveness of measures to increase diversity is affected by codetermining factors the functional diversity of local grassland communities is considered to be an important ecosystem property determining its resistance and resilience fischer et al 2006 holling 1973 isbell et al 2015 ecosystems with a high diversity in functional groups are better able to respond to temporary change because there is a higher probability that there are species present in the local species pool that can cope with a certain disturbance or environmental change folke et al 2004 in diverse communities sudden but temporary changes in nutrient availability and disturbance regime will select for species that can cope with these new environmental conditions at the cost of less appropriate strategies if this competitive exclusion is slow indicated by a large diversity at the end of the simulations diversity will not decline quickly and the previous species composition can be restored because most species are still present in remnant populations if competitive exclusion is fast rapid species loss occurs and the vegetation cannot return to the previous state high connectivity and environmental dynamics low patch size and low heterogeneity intensifies interspecies competition and causes rapid species loss which strongly reduces resistance and resilience this shows that high species diversity in itself does not protect against diversity loss but that factors contributing to the maintenance of high diversity reduce the risk of species extinction and foster resistance and resilience credit authorship contribution statement peter
