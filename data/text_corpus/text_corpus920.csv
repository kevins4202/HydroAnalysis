4600,this study examines the spatial and temporal variability of flow intermittence over the period 1970 2018 across four countries australia france uk and the conterminous usa intermittence no flow periods in 471 unregulated non perennial rivers were analyzed using flow data collected from 1356 gauging stations distributed across the four countries climate data were also analyzed to place findings within a climate change context intermittence of streamflow demonstrated high seasonality and showed regional differences an aridity index was the most relevant explanatory factor of flow intermittence at the global scale the more arid the climate the higher the probability of non perennial flow regimes flow intermittence was observed however in humid climate zones a global classification of intermittent rivers was developed that included all the facets of the flow regime this classification served as a basis for trend detection in annual frequency of no flows at the regional scale some but not all of the 14 examined regions in australia and the us displayed significant trends and most of them displayed an upward trend in the occurrence of no flow days keywords flow intermittence streamflow variability river flow classification trend analysis 1 introduction a large proportion of the channels comprising river networks globally cease flow or dry periodically larned et al 2010 datry et al 2014 leigh et al 2016 these systems collectively referred to here as intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams ires range from near perennial rivers with infrequent short periods of no flow to rivers experiencing flow only following episodic rainfall snelder et al 2013 the distribution of ires is changing due to climate change at the continental döll and schmied 2012 national sauquet et al 2020a and regional scales jaeger et al 2014 pumo et al 2015 de girolamo et al 2017 decreased minimum flows under climate driven changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation and runoff and increases in temperature could lead some perennial rivers to shift to non perennial flow regimes and further reduce the flow permanence of some intermittent rivers conversely many naturally intermittent rivers are becoming artificially perennial due to effluent recharge e g halaburka et al 2013 globally climate is a primary driver of streamflow patterns though geology topography and vegetation can also play dominant roles in space and time e g beaufort et al 2019 our global climate is not static but subject to variability on many timescales trend analysis is one method of assessing how rivers respond to these changes in climate the frequency of no flows for example is a key variable used to distinguish and classify ires in large areas experiencing semi arid to arid climate conditions e g kennard et al 2010 however flow intermittence is changing globally and some areas of the globe are experiencing increasing frequency of flow intermittence as they become semi arid while warmer climate conditions can create flowing conditions in winter indeed the duration timing and predictability of no flow events along with their frequency are all important determinants of biodiversity and ecosystem processes in both ires and their adjacent or downstream ecosystems e g leigh and datry 2016 detailed temporal descriptions of ires hydrology including the different facets of flow intermittence that follow a flow regime classification methodology are thus necessary not only to summarize the hydrological behavior of rivers at various time scales but also to support environmental monitoring water allocation decisions and environmental flow setting e g kennard et al 2010 perez saez et al 2017 d ambrosio et al 2017 to study flow patterns in rivers and how they change in time we generally rely on gauging stations as the primary source of data although flow data from gauging stations only represents the overall hydrology at discrete locations and indeed there is rarely more than one gauging station on a given intermittent river gauging stations remain our chief source of time series data for example the frequency of no flows is a fundamental consideration when defining a river as non perennial and thus is by far the most common metric used to characterize flow intermittence e g moliere et al 2009 smakhtin and toulouse 1998 bond et al 2010 poff and ward 1989 poff 1996 snelder et al 2013 eng et al 2015 however large scale comparison of gauging station data remains a challenge due to limitations in the length of available time series variability in the collection methods and reporting and lack of information on the degree of catchment alteration due to anthropogenic activity in many regions of the world e g giuntoli et al 2013 gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 harrigan et al 2018a yu et al 2018 yet a large scale synthesis is essential the scarcity of information on the occurrence of ires their flow regime patterns and the environmental conditions that produce those patterns are arguably the main reasons limiting their effective management snelder et al 2013 leigh et al 2016 characterizing the temporal hydrological patterns of ires is an essential element of large scale river management and research olden et al 2011 therefore an overarching classification is needed to understand how ires fit into a global continuum this classification has begun but to date has been regional or national for example kennard et al 2010 developed a classification of flow regimes for both perennial and non perennial rivers in australia while a study specifically on non perennial watersheds in the conterminous us primarily focused on seasonal occurrence of no flow in relation to climate but did not quantify different elements of the no flow regime using multiple metrics eng et al 2015 to address large scale patterns and trends in ires flow regimes we explore long term streamflow data from a large set of reference gauges across four countries spanning three continents these data combined with climate data are then used in a i qualitative comparison of flow intermittence showing overarching commonalities and differences in flow characteristics ii examination of the importance of climate as a driver of flow regimes iii classification of ires across all four countries using common metrics iv analysis of the trends in climate specifically aridity and winter temperature compared to trends in intermittence in time and space across the classifications this pan continental study complements the expanding body of literature that has classified ires in individual countries snelder et al 2013 kennard et al 2010 buttle et al 2012 and highlights commonalities and differences across ires 2 methods 2 1 selection of gauging stations daily discharge data were compiled using gauging station records from france uk australia and the conterminous united states us table 1 these stations form subsets extracted from the nationwide reference hydrologic networks of the four countries they were deeply screened and extensively used in global studies e g zhang et al 2016 for australia giuntoli et al 2013 hodgkins et al 2017 and renard and thyer 2019 for france harrigan et al 2018b gnann et al 2019 and smith et al 2019 for the uk archfield et al 2014 hammond et al 2018 and dudley et al 2020 for the us the selection procedures are not strictly the same however the gauging stations were chosen to primarily reflect near natural conditions for example only usgs gauging stations classified as reference by falcone 2011 were used according to the quantitative and qualitative criteria of falcone et al 2010 which included calculation of a gis based disturbance index visual inspection of topographic maps and imagery and use of information available in technical reports on human activities data quality was one of the stages of development of these networks for example the final selection of the french gauging stations stemmed from an iterative scheme including dialogue between researchers and data providers on monitoring conditions and possible non natural causes of change e g rating curve change constructions affecting the river change of the station location etc in the uk data quality was ensured by using gauging stations of the uk benchmark network ukbn2 classed suitable for the study of trends in low flows as by barker et al 2019 in their assessment of historical droughts for more details on the selection procedures see the references in table 1 three main criteria were imposed to select gauging stations that had i a minimum length of 30 years of data between 01 01 1970 and 31 12 2018 with 5 of missing data which resulted in the selection of gauging stations with at least 28 5 years of records not necessarily continuous ii no significant human influence on low flows and iii high quality measurements in discharge especially in low flows a 30 year record length with up to 5 missing data criterion i was considered the minimum to derive reliable statistics on hydrological extremes such as those related to severe low and no flows this matches the timespan conventionally adopted to derive reliable statistics for climate world meteorological organization convention wmo 1989 to satisfy criterion ii gauging stations monitoring discharge of rivers with natural flows or minor abstractions were selected from previously published datasets table 1 a total of 1356 gauging stations across the four countries met all three criteria for inclusion in the final dataset 2 2 characterising flow regimes for intermittent rivers hydrologically distinguishing perennial from intermittent rivers is not straightforward and perhaps in consequence several definitions can be found in the literature for example poff 1996 and eng et al 2015 considered a river intermittent if the mean number of zero flow days was 10 d yr and 15 d yr respectively poff 1996 stressed that the definition was rather arbitrary furthermore reynolds et al 2015 discriminated perennial from two classes of intermittent rivers considering a river as weakly intermittent when the mean number of zero flow d yr was 20 and strongly intermittent when it was 20 leigh and datry 2016 introduced the term moderately ires as intermediate between weakly and strongly ires to describe the results of a k means clustering on a combined european and australian dataset in which rivers within each cluster had a mean of 11 0 4 and 92 zero flow d yr respectively huxter and van meerveld 2012 suggested distinguishing almost intermittent rivers for which the minimum daily river flow is 5 l s from intermittent rivers for which zero flow conditions are observed national regulations also define intermittent rivers including criteria on the annual number of zero flow days see d ambrosio et al 2017 for italy and spain in this paper we considered a gauged river intermittent ir when the mean number of no flow days in its 1970 2018 record was 5 d yr a definition supported by previous research on flow regimes in the countries of interest we considered rivers with on average 5 d yr but a strictly positive frequency of no flow days in their record as weakly intermittent wir all other rivers were considered perennial pr the no flow days were defined as only those days for which the observed daily flow was 1 l s this accounted for potential false positive detection of no flows associated with measurement resolution constraints and uncertainty in discharge observations zimmer et al 2020 each gauging station was characterized in terms of its river flow regime using statistics derived from daily flow time series there is a wide range of hydrological metrics used to characterize river flow regimes e g smakhtin 2001 olden and poff 2003 a set of 19 hydrological metrics calculated from daily flow time series table 2 was selected for i their relevance for describing ires and ii their complementarity in describing the different components of river flow regimes magnitude duration timing frequency and rate of change of flows introduced by richter et al 1996 the computation of and coding used for these metrics is given in appendix a 2 3 climate metrics climate metrics were chosen first for their potential links to flow intermittence and second for their relevance regarding the ability to interpret results within a climate change context to this end metrics were selected based on their simplicity of calculation i e variables which could be easily derived from the outputs of the general circulation models the final set of climate metrics included for analysis was mean annual temperature mat total precipitation map an aridity index ai and mean winter temperature mwt ai is computed as follows 1 ai m a p m a p e t where mapet is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration respectively middleton and thomas 1997 cherlet et al 2018 and the unep classification consider a location hyper arid if ai 0 03 arid if 0 03 ai 0 2 semi arid if 0 2 ai 0 5 dry sub humid if 0 5 ai 0 65 and otherwise humid ai 0 65 in this application map and mapet are average values over the gauged basins due to limited access to climate data for all the gauging stations examined and to the need for consistency we used the gridded terraclimate product abatzoglou et al 2018 which is available at 4 km spatial resolution and 1 month temporal resolution back to 1950 monthly time series of each variable were extracted as watershed averaged means to watershed boundaries available from national gauging network repositories using the exactextractr r package baston 2020 where watershed boundaries were not available for a subset of the gauges the gauging location was used in combination with merit hydrography yamazaki et al 2019 to prepare watershed boundaries based on upstream contributing area monthly time series were then aggregated to annual and mean annual time series by calculating annual totals of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and means of maximum minimum mean and winter mean temperature where winter months for france the uk and usa are december january and february and for australia are june july and august the identification of the main climate drivers was based on the analysis of homogeneity within classes derived from the empirical distribution of climate metrics classes were first defined by n quantiles for n 1 evenly spaced cumulative probabilities 1 n 2 n n 1 n derived from the empirical distribution of each climate descriptor the proportion of each type of river ir for ir wir for wir and pr for pr within each class was then computed secondly the proportions ir wir and pr were computed for each class as well as the inter class variance related to each partition the three inter class variances measure the degree of separation between classes and the highest value indicates the highest discrimination power among the tested partitions four partitions of irs were derived from each of the four empirical distributions of the selected climate metrics mat map ai and mwt the samples of climate metrics were divided into 10 bins defined by the minimum the nine deciles and the maximum each class had the same size 135 or 136 gauged basins which is a size large enough to derive robust statistics 2 4 classification procedure we performed a simple classification based on a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis using ward s minimum variance method and the euclidean distance between metrics as similarity criteria note that the coordinates of the gauging stations were not included in the distance between clusters and that methods leading to contiguous regions e g assunção et al 2006 guo 2008 were not applied here instead our methods provide a purely hydrological characterization based on river flow regimes the classification was achieved using a subset of weakly correlated climate metrics and hydrological metrics from among those described above as identified by a principal component analysis pca performed on all the metrics and regression analyses among pairs of metrics olden and poff 2003 the three first principal components explained 63 of the total variance in the dataset including the 19 hydrological metrics and the two main climate drivers ai and mwt the first component had large positive loadings for f0 and for all flow metrics related to the duration metrics related to flow duration curve characteristics aridity and predictability were highly negatively correlated with the first axis the second principal component is positively correlated with all duration metrics and negatively correlated with frequency metrics metrics related to no flow events were weakly correlated with the third axis the final subset of hydrological metrics includes seven metrics f0 mediand sdd meann sdn θ r which focus specifically on no flow conditions the first metric f0 when expressed in terms of percentage of the time with no flow conditions can be interpreted as flow permanence and is an important determinant of river biodiversity statistics on the duration and number of no flow events mediand sdd mediann sdn provide information complementary to flow permanence on the dynamics of flow intermittence e g the way no flow events are distributed within the year and their average severity in terms of consecutive days without flow circular statistics r and θ were also calculated to characterize periodicity of phenomena which contain temporal seasonal components these metrics were initially developed to identify flood periods on the basis of the timing of annual maximal peak discharges e g burn 1997 castellarin et al 2001 and have been applied to characterize low flow periods when discharge falls below a critical threshold value e g prudhomme et al 2016 here r provides a measure of the regularity of no flow days while θ gives the mean date of no flow occurrence four metrics qp p 1 90 ic and mediandr derived from the flow duration curve describing low to high flow components two metrics drec and mediandr which are durational measures of time recession at the seasonal scale and of flood dynamics respectively the metrics related to no flow conditions are overrepresented in the list of selected metrics in accordance with the objective of characterizing flow regime of ires further transformations were applied to normalize metrics and reduce asymmetry in empirical distributions the metrics related to duration mediandr meand mediand sdd were log transformed qp p 1 90 were divided by the mean long term annual discharge before being square root transformed f0 mediann sdn drec and ic were square root transformed the mean date θ was transformed to allow comparison of the timing with no flow conditions accounting for the shift in seasons between the two hemispheres the variables r sin θ and r cos θ were used instead of r and θ to avoid an artificial break in winter induced by angles 2 5 trend analysis trends were investigated at the aggregated level of clusters of gauged basins to overcome some of the issues due to both spatial and temporal dependencies between sites the analysis was conducted using regional metrics following ribes et al 2019 here derived from the at site annual f0 first values were computed for each river and year and converted into non exceedance probabilities when annual f0 was available for more than eight irs the median of these annual values was then calculated for each homogeneous group of rivers and this regional metric was used to represent flow intermittence at the regional scale the regional metric was not available over the whole period 1970 2018 due to gaps in the discharge records trends in regional flow intermittence were evaluated using the non parametric modified mann kendall trend test accounting for autocorrelation in time series yue and wang 2004 the theil sen slope estimator theil 1950 sen 1968 and least squares linear regression for graphic representations the regional kendall test helsel and frans 2006 was applied to identify evidence of consistent trend at multiple locations the choice of the method is partly supported by results of renard et al 2008 showing on the basis of simulated fields that the method applied here is unbiased and well suited for regional stationarity analysis and performs as well as for example the regional average mann kendall test developed by yue and wang 2002 positive or negative slopes suggest trends of more or less frequent years with no flow conditions time series demonstrate statistically significant trends when p values obtained from the mann kendall test were less than the predetermined significance level 0 05 3 results 3 1 flow characteristics in irs a set of 471 stations 308 irs and 163 wirs out of the 1356 met the criteria for intermittence table 1 fig 1 record lengths of irs ranged from 28 7 to 49 years with continuous observations throughout the 1974 2014 period available for 80 of the stations the extended overlapping period enabled comparisons between flow statistics the drainage areas of irs ranged from 4 to 232 850 km2 with a dominant proportion of small to medium size catchments 50 have catchment areas of 110 650 km2 50 of irs recorded no flow for at least 10 of their record length of the flow regime statistics the median number of continuous periods with no flow days mediann showed the most heterogeneous pattern within countries particularly in the us not shown there were also distinct regional differences in the occurrence of continuous periods with no flow days within countries the proportion of prs was lowest in the uk and highest in australia where 73 of all stations recorded no flow days table 1 across all countries nearly 90 of the 471 irs and wirs were located in australia and the conterminous us the proportion of irs among the gauged rivers was distributed relatively evenly over australia except for the interior and central west where no perennial gauges were identified and values of f0 are markedly higher fig 1 most of the gauged basins with low values of f0 were located along the southern and eastern coast while high values were in central arid and semi arid australia in france most irs were located in the west and the south western coastal region and f0 was low throughout the country 50 of the irs demonstrate f0 above 9 d yr in the uk only three irs and four wirs were identified however one station demonstrated a high value of f0 173 d yr while the two others had values of f0 below 15 d yr in the us the interquartile range of f0 was 17 124 d yr with the majority of irs located on the west coast and in the central states i e in the great plains most of the high values of f0 were concentrated in the central part of the country flow intermittence was infrequently recorded in mountainous regions and absent from eastern mountain gauges flow intermittence was highly seasonal but seasonality also varied substantially from one country to another fig 2 most of the gauged irs 58 for australia all for france and uk 72 for the usa experienced on average no flow in summer and early autumn between june and september in the northern hemisphere and between december and march in the southern hemisphere in australia and the us gauged basins with θ mean date of no flow occurrence falling outside of summer periods tended to demonstrate low seasonality the median of r for these basins 0 36 for australia 0 32 for the us was lower than for basins with no flow periods on average in summer 0 58 for australia 0 66 for the us 3 2 climate as a driver of flow intermittence the partition based on ai resulted in the maximal inter variance of ir wir and pr the metric ai was globally the most suitable variable for discriminating irs from prs the climate metrics ranked second and third in terms of power of discrimination were the mean annual temperature mat and the total precipitation map respectively from the four climate metrics only ai and mwt are considered in the following analyses the metric mwt despite weak overall discriminating power was finally selected because it was the only climate metric that could distinguish between no flow conditions due to freezing versus no flow from other causes note that ai was square root transformed before using this climate metric in the clustering procedure to reduce asymmetry of the empirical distribution overall ir was higher when ai was lower i e when climate was more arid and ir was lower when ai was higher i e when climate was more humid fig 3 d this global tendency was shared across the countries however the distribution of irs differed among and within countries in particular with the pattern for australia contrasting from other countries fig 3a the contrasting results among countries in terms of discriminating irs from prs were due to non overlapping ranges in ai and the specificity in climate conditions e g the proportion of gauged basins with negative winter temperatures was the highest in the us fig 3c the proportions of semi arid basins and dry sub humid basins were comparable but were not found in france or the uk fig 3b finally the link between levels of intermittence and aridity fig 4 was summarized using the unep classification we computed ir wir and pr for each climate type as defined by the aridity index ai table 3 only nine gauged basins two in the us and seven in australia experienced arid conditions so they were pooled with semi arid basins leading to the arid semi arid class proportions were interpreted in terms of probability under arid semi arid and dry sub humid conditions the probability of a river basin being non perennial was around 63 when ai 0 65 this probability declined to around 14 under humid conditions 3 3 classification of intermittence the classification procedure was applied to the 308 irs using the subset of 14 climate and hydrological metrics figs 5 and 6 appendix b a specific color was attributed to each class in figs 5 and 6 and the color palette was used latter to distinguish the different classes in subsequent graphs according to the agglomeration schedule the hierarchical cluster analysis suggested solutions with two six and nine groups the solution with two groups mainly differentiated irs according to their degree of flow intermittence the interquartile ranges of f0 of the two groups did not overlap at least six groups were required to distinguish 15 irs experiencing continental climate with cold winters and hot summers in the us as a separate group the solution with nine groups identified six harsh irs that had very few days with flow conditions moreover this solution resulted in a near uniform number of gauged basins obtained per group six classes with 40 52 basins and three classes with 6 24 basins hydrographs observed at one gauging station illustrated the seasonal pattern of river flows within each group fig 7 the distribution of the nine groups across the four countries is detailed in table 4 and in fig 8 the classification discriminated against rivers primarily on the basis of the mean annual proportion of no flow days fig 5 ir groups 1 5 were classified as weakly to moderately intermittent there was a non negligible probability for these groups to experience a full year with no flow conditions see the distribution of mediann groups 6 9 contained 126 moderately to harshly regularly intermittent rivers with f0 10 for all but five gauged basins of group 6 although most of the basins 1110 with ai 0 65 among the 1356 gauging stations experienced humid climates a wide diversity of seasonal patterns was identified in the classes of irs fig 7 ranging from rainfall fed regimes with high flows in winter and low flows in summer groups 1 2 and 3 to snowmelt dominated regimes with high flows in spring or early summer and winter minima caused by freezing groups 3 and 5 groups 1 2 3 and 8 displayed intermittence in summer and early fall while groups 4 5 and 7 experienced intermittence in spring and winter fig 6 seasonality of no flow conditions was not pronounced for groups 6 r 0 25 and 9 r 0 001 group 7 and group 8 were comparable in terms of frequency of flow 1 l s but differed in the distribution of no flow events each year group 1 was the most frequently observed in our dataset and the most relevant for european rivers group 7 was specific to australia while groups 3 and 5 were primarily associated with midwest us with few exceptions direct use of the nine groups defined above to study stationarity in flow intermittence was not straightforward because the groups encompassed a wide variety of climates and this was particularly evident in australia and the us therefore sub groups were delineated at national or regional levels fig 8 related regions were outlined manually to ensure geographic consistency median size 11 lat 20 long since climate the regions have been created considering a smaller extension in latitude than in longitude since latitude is a more important factor influencing climate patterns than longitude at the global scale and to limit heterogeneity in climate conditions considering the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 basins of group 1 in europe that were located in southern france with latitude 46 were extracted to form one sub group under oceanic influence east west distinctions were considered for the us to delineate the two regions 8 w 124 long 106 and 30 lat 39 and 8e 105 long 81 and 28 lat 41 finally stationarity within 14 regional pools 7 in the us 1 crossing france and uk and 6 in australia with 8 gauged basins in each pool were analyzed 3 4 trend analysis high year to year variability of flow intermittence was observed figs 9 11 with specific climatic events standing out in the data as high values of median non exceedance probability with small whiskers in australia the data were anomalous in groups 1 and 2 fig 9 in 1982 1983 and from 2000 to 2009 all groups but group 7 had a high proportion of no flow conditions likewise in europe there were notable periods of high no flow frequency in 1976 and from 1989 to 1992 in group 1 fig 10 in the eastern us the year 2012 was marked by extremely dry conditions due to the particular cause for intermittence freezing the temporal pattern displayed for group 5 differed substantially from those for other groups fig 11 despite the strong variability observed in the time series statistically significant trends i e p value 0 05 were detected when applying the modified mann kendall test for eight of the 14 groups all but one significant trend was positive indicating an increase in flow intermittence the slight trend of increasing flow intermittence in europe was not significant coherent results were found for groups with overlapping regions in southern australia 1 2 6 and 8 regardless of differences in significance level the slopes in southern australia were all positive upward trends were found in south central states of the us 2 and 6 however these upward trends were not statistically significant due to serial autocorrelation in regions 8 w and 8 e region 5 in the us displayed a decrease in flow intermittence out of the 14 regions examined in table 5 eight exhibited a statistically significant temporal change though no change was found in europe a question relates to the consistency of the detected changes in flow intermittence with changes observed in the main climate drivers ai and mwt section 3 2 over the same period at the regional scale for each region we carried out the regional mann kendall trend test to test for trends in ai and mwt in the gauged basins distributed across the regions significant changes in ai were observed for 5 out the 14 regions table 5 here the consistency in the sign of the changes was expected rather than consistency in the level of significance the sensitivity of flow intermittence to changes in climate drivers varied between catchments and in the case of consistency it does not mean that causal links are established in australia the five regions with detected increase in flow intermittence experienced increase in ai conversely no changes in both ai and flow intermittence were detected in europe the consistency was less noticeable in the us however the sign of the change in ai although not significant was consistent with the changes in flow intermittence note that for region 5 where ai was influenced by freezing no significant change was detected in the winter temperature mwt the slight trend towards warmer winter combined with more precipitation not shown here may be sufficient to result in decreased in flow intermittence 4 discussion 4 1 spatial pattern of flow intermittence the proportion of ires in the database is substantial 25 and 15 of the gauging stations are intermittent ir and weakly intermittent wir respectively however the gauged irs are not uniformly distributed 50 of the irs in the database are located in australia where only 35 of the stations are considered perennial in the uk the proportion of irs and wirs in the near natural network is low 5 of the 146 ukbn2 gauging stations rivers with gauged intermittent regimes but without human influence are rare intermittence in the wider uk hydrological monitoring network is more prevalent tramblay et al 2020 two of the three irs are small clay headwater catchments 30 km2 whilst chalk catchments in the south east of england are notably absent because of the historical effects of abstraction westwood et al 2017 furthermore it is likely that intermittence in the uk and more widely in temperate zones is under represented in the hydrological monitoring network stubbington et al 2017 certainly in france most irs remain ungauged the spatial pattern of irs across france is consistent with beaufort et al 2018 who show gauging stations and sites from the onde network with observed no flow conditions between 2012 and 2017 although wirs are found across france there are clusters of gauging stations in the western and southwestern regions note that there are more wirs in france than irs which provides an opportunity to study shifts from rarely towards moderately intermittent streams this is also true in the us where nearly 20 of the selected gauging stations is on intermittent rivers table 1 this suspected underestimation is consistent with conclusions from previous national studies irs may represent around 60 of total river length in the conterminous us nadeau and rains 2007 the distribution of irs across the us is similar to the results of eng et al 2015 for which gauging stations were also extracted from the gages2 database however other constraints were applied a threshold of 15 d yr was imposed to distinguish perennial from intermittent rivers and the required length of records between 1950 and 2012 was set at 10 years finally stations located in the us that have shoreline on the east coast and in northwestern us are absent from the dataset examined by eng et al 2015 while these estimates are limited in spatial extent they suggest that the ires are extremely abundant globally 4 2 drivers of flow intermittence aridity as measured by ai was the most relevant climate driver within the set of selected metrics ai is a measure of dryness based on precipitation and evapotranspiration processes related to air temperature which may explain why it outperformed the individual precipitation map and temperature mat variables the list of potential climate drivers examined in this study was intentionally limited indeed the potential climate drivers were primarily selected for the availability from gcm outputs and the reliability of the projected change under global warming conditions indicators related to climate extremes were thus not considered here aridity is certainly not the single main driver of intermittence rivers may cease flowing under humid conditions 12 of the gauging stations with ai 1 41 for example many streams in australia s wet dry tropics are intermittent leigh and sheldon 2008 furthermore warfe et al 2011 suggest that in addition to climate latitude and geology control flow intermittence at a regional scale in australia a geological origin of flow intermittence is likely in both france and the uk and globally at the european scale sauquet et al 2020b no flow conditions are mainly due to impervious bedrock in western france crystalline rock formation to groundwater table fluctuations and seepage through permeable channels in northern and southwestern france sedimentary rock formation and to the presence of an extensive karst in eastern france jeannin et al 2016 in southern france mediterranean climate conditions may have a moderate influence on flow intermittence couturier and fourneaux 1998 in the uk flow intermittence driven by permeable geology is observed in soluble rocks for example in the carboniferous limestone of the peak district stubbington et al 2009 and in the cretaceous chalk of south and east of england where streams typically contract through the summer months sefton et al 2019 many of the intermittent watersheds in humid portions of the us contain significant karst developments which may explain flow intermittence for example a large part of florida is karstic with high hydraulic conductivity so that by the end of the dry season i e january june many streams become intermittent 4 3 classification and dynamics of intermittent rivers many river flow classifications based on a set of gauging stations do exist including those encompassing a small to large portion of irs e g kennard et al 2010 oueslati et al 2015 as well as those restricted to irs e g eng et al 2015 there are many ways to establish a classification in accordance with predefined objectives see olden et al 2011 and as a consequence the universality of any one classification is debatable a large set of hydrological indices related to the different components of river flow regimes were considered in this study in accordance with the objective of developing a classification dedicated to irs the metrics related to no flow periods were overrepresented to give more weight to flow intermittence in the production of homogenous groups of rivers links between our results and previous classifications can be identified for example eng et al 2015 emphasized the seasonality of no flow periods which is one component of flow intermittence amongst others considered here in our clustering procedure most of the fall to winter irs in west north central us of eng et al 2015 are classified within our group 5 rivers with irs experiencing negative winter temperatures and no flow events in autumn or winter fig 11 non seasonal irs are found in groups 7 9 which displays the least seasonally contrasted temporal pattern of no flow periods r 0 35 fig 6 the linkage with the australian river flow classes developed by kennard et al 2010 is not straightforward due to the presence of perennial rivers in that dataset classes 5 8 of kennard et al 2010 which include irs from groups 1 2 6 and 8 of our classification are observed along the coast in southern australia at the opposite extreme the summer highly and extremely intermittent streams classes 10 and 12 of kennard et al 2010 and irs from our groups 4 and 7 are found in northern australia these links are substantial since the studies share a large proportion of gauging stations and correlated hydrological metrics the global classification developed here can be considered an extension of preexisting classifications encompassing additional temporal patterns that are missing in regional classifications e g group 5 and group 7 are only found in the conterminous us and in australia respectively regardless of the large number of suitable gauging stations examined across the four countries ires experiencing freezing conditions are underrepresented in our classification examples in antarctica switzerland and norway can be found in the literature chinn and mason 2016 robinson et al 2016 sauquet et al 2020b in addition atypical local geological conditions may result in an unexpected hydrograph and require a novel group to be defined this encourages us to extend data collection across other climates and other hydrogeological contexts despite the limitation of low coverage of data in areas experiencing continental polar and alpine climates the results presented here represent a major first attempt to classify and compare river flow regimes at a global scale 4 4 long term trend analysis in no flow conditions several analyses have been conducted to study the impact of long term climate variability on low flows in australia chiew and mcmahon 1993 zhang et al 2016 in france renard et al 2008 giuntoli et al 2013 in the uk hannaford and buys 2012 hannaford 2015 and in the us e g douglas et al 2000 small et al 2006 kam and sheffield 2016 ahn and palmer 2015 the present study is to our knowledge the first to focus on flow intermittence at the global scale our findings are for the most part in agreement with those from the previous cited works in australia the 1982 1983 drought affected the east part of the country gibbs 1984 very low precipitation over the period of april 1982 february 1983 was recorded in southeastern australia prevailing extremely dry conditions were responsible for huge dust storms and one of the most deadly bushfires in the history of australia in february 1983 known as the 1983 ash wednesday bushfires e g blanchi et al 2014 from the mid 1990s to 2009 southeastern australia experienced a prolonged sequence of yearly precipitation deficit known as the millennium drought leblanc et al 2012 van dijk et al 2013 peaking in 2006 with the lowest average rainfall for south australia since 1900 a high proportion of no flow conditions were observed in rivers within groups 1 2 6 and 8 for the corresponding period fig 9 the decreasing trend found in q90 in southern australia temperate climate zone is in accordance with results obtained for groups 1 2 6 and 8 no change was found for groups 4 and 7 with geographical domains partly overlapping central australia where no significant trends in q90 were detected this is in agreement with zhang et al 2016 who found temporal changes in hydrology varied with latitude the impact of several major drought events in europe during the period 1970 2013 spinoni et al 2015 hanel et al 2018 was also apparent fig 10 with above normal no flow frequencies observed during the droughts deficits in precipitations from december 1975 until august 1976 were particularly high in southern uk and northern france comparative to the mediterranean region vidal et al 2010 zaidman et al 2002 causing a high proportion of no flow events in group 1 fig 10 note that flow intermittence in 2003 and in 2015 was close to average conditions with a median non exceedance probability dispersed around 50 the 2003 european heat wave event garcía herrera et al 2010 produced an agricultural drought with more impact on soil moisture than on river flow vidal et al 2010 the 2015 european drought event laaha et al 2017 mainly affected central europe spanning from eastern france to southern poland and northern romania however there was no evidence of general change in low flows for the uk nor for france giuntoli et al 2013 showed evidence of downward trends in annual minimum discharge in southern france while no change was detected in northern france no irs which met our selection criteria are gauged in areas where these changes were detected we also found no significant trend in flow intermittence for group 1 with all irs located in northern france and in the uk in the us the year 1988 stands out and corresponds to the north american drought of 1988 namias 1991 fig 11 this was one of the most severe and extensive droughts of recent times in the us affecting the northern plains in particular starting in 1987 and continuing until 1992 this multi year event was accompanied by two heat waves in summer 1988 a significant multi year drought occurred in california during the period 2007 2009 california department of water resources 2010 and its effect on river flows is noticeable for group 8 with above average flow intermittence conditions there are many other intermittency indices some of which also display trends in european rivers tramblay et al 2020 and may also be important on other continents however f0 is the most widely used metric for characterization therefore this study chose f0 as a starting point and suggests additional metrics be examined in further studies 5 conclusions here we characterized and classified the flow regimes of non perennial rivers using data sourced from a large collection of gauging stations monitoring unregulated rivers in four countries and representing a range of climate conditions priority was given to near natural flow regimes in gauging station selection over proportionate representation of intermittence or types of intermittent river across the contributing countries from the 1356 selected stations 308 had a mean annual frequency of no flows 5 days year and were assigned as intermittent the classification included different aspects of flow intermittence and will be useful to assess the impact of no flow periods on biological communities and ecosystem processes our findings also suggest that the proportion of ires varies in space under a temperate climate this proportion is certainly underestimated due to the priority given to gauging rivers in medium to large basins and in urban areas where water resources are sufficient enough to develop human activities and where the human population needs to be protected against extreme events a simple aridity index was found to be the most relevant factor discriminating intermittent from perennial rivers at the global scale the link between aridity and flow intermittence identified here may provide a first insight into the risk of individual rivers becoming intermittent due to change in climate for example a modified ai could be computed for different scenarios of shifts in mean annual rainfall and temperature the considered river could be categorized thereafter according to the unep classification arid semi arid dry sub humid humid and its probability of being intermittent under the modified climate given by the proportion of irs within the aridity class provided by table 3 the classification also defined a basis for trend detection in annual frequency of no flows at a regional scale with conclusions supporting those obtained for low flows of near natural basins in the countries examined at the global scale the global warming observed in recent years may not necessarily have led to more flow intermittence but such a conclusion must be viewed with caution and requires further investigation as it is based on a finite set of gauged stations data and analyses information on how flow intermittence develops in both time and space is still sparse partly due to the lack of gauged or otherwise monitored ires in the absence of information on ires location options to identify them include conducting field surveys along river networks e g turner and richter 2011 assendelft and van meerveld 2019 sefton et al 2019 utilising

which improved this manuscript appendix a calculation of hydrological metrics the characteristics of flow intermittence the frequency of no flow conditions f0 is the percentage of the time with q 1 l s the pth quantile qp is the daily discharge value exceeded p of time metrics related to no flow events are computed a no flow event starts when q 1 l s and will last until q 1 l s the metrics meand mediand and sd are the mean median and standard deviation of the duration of no flow events respectively the no flow events have been identified for each water year to estimate meann mediann and sdn which are the mean median and standard deviation of the number of no flow events per year respectively the maximal duration of the continuous sequence of no flow within the year exceeded on average every five years d80 maximum duration of consecutive no flows d are sampled by block maxima approach and d80 is defined as the empirical 80th percentile of cumulative distribution function of d the mean and dispersion of the occurrence of no flows within the year θ and r these two variables are circular statistics each day i with no flow is converted into an angular ti and represented by a unit vector with rectangular coordinates cos ti sin ti the mean of the cosines and sines defines a representative vector the value for θ is obtained by calculating the inverse tangent of the angle of the mean vector and the norm of the mean vector provides a measure of the regularity in the dates a value close to one indicates a high concentration around θ while a value close to zero indicates no seasonality to account for the shift in the timing of winter in the two hemispheres december to february in the northern hemisphere june to august in the southern hemisphere the constant π or π is added to θ for australian gauged basins when θ occurred between 1st july and 31st december or 1st january and 30th june respectively seasonal predictability of no flow events sd6 this metric was formerly introduced by gallart et al 2012 and uses monthly discharge sd6 1 meanf06wm meanf06dm where meanf06dm and meanf06wm represent the average frequency of month with no flow for the contiguous six driest months of the year and for the remaining six wetter months respectively the sd6 descriptor is computed here using monthly frequencies of days with no flow the seasonal recession time scale drec this duration based on the hydrograph defined by the 30 day moving average of the 365 long term mean daily discharges q d d 1 365 the day with the maximal value within the 365 values is the start

between low flow and high flow regimes derived from quantiles of the flow duration curve ic q 10 q 99 q 1 q 99 the base flow index bfi the method used to compute bfi is the algorithm suggested by the institute of hydrology 1980 baseflow volume is obtained by hydrograph separation applying a smoothed minima approach to the discharge time series divided into 5 day non overlapping blocks the base flow index bfi is the ratio of baseflow to total flow the median duration of runoff events mediandr daily values for runoff are obtained by subtracting the base flow from the observed river flow the most severe runoff events within each year are selected the spread of the upper part of the hydrographs is related to the quick subsurface runoff component for each of the hydrographs q t the peak

in the dataset the flow intermittence regime observed under humid subtropical climate and temperate oceanic climate in the three continents characteristics are typical of rainfall fed regimes of intermittent rivers f0 10 and mediann 0 for most of the basins low flows and probably flow intermittence are likely due to evapotranspiration processes in summer no flow events are short mediand around 10 days and highly seasonal 46 out of the 51 irs display r above 0 7 occurring in late summer march or april in australia august or september in europe and in the us group 2 irs are mainly located in the eastern us and southeastern australia group 2 is similar to group 1 in terms of duration and frequency of no flow events and is the group ranked 2nd in terms of size 67 irs the two groups differ in both the timing and predictability of no flow events earlier in summer with a less pronounced seasonality than group 1 irs from group 2 tend to be more intermittent the median of f0 is 15 d yr and flashier in terms of q01 and mediandr than irs from group 1 group 3 is also similar to groups 1 and 2 in terms of duration and frequency of no flow events basins from group 3 experience more no flows than the two previous groups f0 around 22 d yr they are found in the central us and europe no flows occur usually around september for the us the dispersion of the occurrence of no flow days within the year median r 0 73 is between group 1 median r 0 85 and group 2 median r 0 63 no flow events are more frequently observed mediann 0 for almost 50 of the basins than in groups 1 and 2 group 4 irs are similar to those in groups 1 3 in terms of flow permanence f0 median around 10 they differ by their location they are found in areas experiencing equatorial subtropical or tropical climate in northwestern australia and in florida and their seasonality no flow events are observed in spring intermittence is not observed every year q90 within this group can be above 1 l s group 5 are found exclusively within northcentral us in regions with winter temperatures below zero indicating the flow regimes of this group are likely to be partly influenced by snow processes the median date of occurrence of no flow events is observed in autumn or winter but the seasonality of flow intermittence is not well pronounced small values for r are due to continental climate leading to two no flow periods one induced by freezing in winter and the other by evapotranspiration processes in summer group 6 pools moderate and harsh irs all but one from southern australia and western us f0 ranges between 6 and 86 with a median value of 26 group 6 comprises irs with the highest values of mediann 2 5 no flow events per year no flows tend to be divided into several events and these events are distributed within the year leading to low values for r and no strong seasonal pattern only 10 among the 50 basins have q90 0 characteristics of group 7 are typical of harsh irs located in central australia no flow events are observed in late winter and early spring all basins display q90 0 mediann 0 and climates for 6 of the 20 basins are dry sub humid to arid group 8 and group 7 irs are very similar in terms of flow intermittence medians of f0 close to 40 for the two groups those of group 8 differ mainly in the way the no flows are distributed within the year late summer for group 8 and spring for group 7 several no flow events can be expected within the year medians of mediann 2 for both groups and a median no flow event for group 8 irs persists 25 days median of mediand which is shorter than a median no flow event for group 7 irs 21 days group 9 irs are ephemeral streams with few days of flow on average 3 d yr with f0 98 they are found in the south central us under arid and semi arid conditions they experience flashy runoff events mediandr 1 d the seasonality of flow intermittence is not pronounced and values for r are close to 0 due to extended periods of little to no rainfall 
4600,this study examines the spatial and temporal variability of flow intermittence over the period 1970 2018 across four countries australia france uk and the conterminous usa intermittence no flow periods in 471 unregulated non perennial rivers were analyzed using flow data collected from 1356 gauging stations distributed across the four countries climate data were also analyzed to place findings within a climate change context intermittence of streamflow demonstrated high seasonality and showed regional differences an aridity index was the most relevant explanatory factor of flow intermittence at the global scale the more arid the climate the higher the probability of non perennial flow regimes flow intermittence was observed however in humid climate zones a global classification of intermittent rivers was developed that included all the facets of the flow regime this classification served as a basis for trend detection in annual frequency of no flows at the regional scale some but not all of the 14 examined regions in australia and the us displayed significant trends and most of them displayed an upward trend in the occurrence of no flow days keywords flow intermittence streamflow variability river flow classification trend analysis 1 introduction a large proportion of the channels comprising river networks globally cease flow or dry periodically larned et al 2010 datry et al 2014 leigh et al 2016 these systems collectively referred to here as intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams ires range from near perennial rivers with infrequent short periods of no flow to rivers experiencing flow only following episodic rainfall snelder et al 2013 the distribution of ires is changing due to climate change at the continental döll and schmied 2012 national sauquet et al 2020a and regional scales jaeger et al 2014 pumo et al 2015 de girolamo et al 2017 decreased minimum flows under climate driven changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation and runoff and increases in temperature could lead some perennial rivers to shift to non perennial flow regimes and further reduce the flow permanence of some intermittent rivers conversely many naturally intermittent rivers are becoming artificially perennial due to effluent recharge e g halaburka et al 2013 globally climate is a primary driver of streamflow patterns though geology topography and vegetation can also play dominant roles in space and time e g beaufort et al 2019 our global climate is not static but subject to variability on many timescales trend analysis is one method of assessing how rivers respond to these changes in climate the frequency of no flows for example is a key variable used to distinguish and classify ires in large areas experiencing semi arid to arid climate conditions e g kennard et al 2010 however flow intermittence is changing globally and some areas of the globe are experiencing increasing frequency of flow intermittence as they become semi arid while warmer climate conditions can create flowing conditions in winter indeed the duration timing and predictability of no flow events along with their frequency are all important determinants of biodiversity and ecosystem processes in both ires and their adjacent or downstream ecosystems e g leigh and datry 2016 detailed temporal descriptions of ires hydrology including the different facets of flow intermittence that follow a flow regime classification methodology are thus necessary not only to summarize the hydrological behavior of rivers at various time scales but also to support environmental monitoring water allocation decisions and environmental flow setting e g kennard et al 2010 perez saez et al 2017 d ambrosio et al 2017 to study flow patterns in rivers and how they change in time we generally rely on gauging stations as the primary source of data although flow data from gauging stations only represents the overall hydrology at discrete locations and indeed there is rarely more than one gauging station on a given intermittent river gauging stations remain our chief source of time series data for example the frequency of no flows is a fundamental consideration when defining a river as non perennial and thus is by far the most common metric used to characterize flow intermittence e g moliere et al 2009 smakhtin and toulouse 1998 bond et al 2010 poff and ward 1989 poff 1996 snelder et al 2013 eng et al 2015 however large scale comparison of gauging station data remains a challenge due to limitations in the length of available time series variability in the collection methods and reporting and lack of information on the degree of catchment alteration due to anthropogenic activity in many regions of the world e g giuntoli et al 2013 gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 harrigan et al 2018a yu et al 2018 yet a large scale synthesis is essential the scarcity of information on the occurrence of ires their flow regime patterns and the environmental conditions that produce those patterns are arguably the main reasons limiting their effective management snelder et al 2013 leigh et al 2016 characterizing the temporal hydrological patterns of ires is an essential element of large scale river management and research olden et al 2011 therefore an overarching classification is needed to understand how ires fit into a global continuum this classification has begun but to date has been regional or national for example kennard et al 2010 developed a classification of flow regimes for both perennial and non perennial rivers in australia while a study specifically on non perennial watersheds in the conterminous us primarily focused on seasonal occurrence of no flow in relation to climate but did not quantify different elements of the no flow regime using multiple metrics eng et al 2015 to address large scale patterns and trends in ires flow regimes we explore long term streamflow data from a large set of reference gauges across four countries spanning three continents these data combined with climate data are then used in a i qualitative comparison of flow intermittence showing overarching commonalities and differences in flow characteristics ii examination of the importance of climate as a driver of flow regimes iii classification of ires across all four countries using common metrics iv analysis of the trends in climate specifically aridity and winter temperature compared to trends in intermittence in time and space across the classifications this pan continental study complements the expanding body of literature that has classified ires in individual countries snelder et al 2013 kennard et al 2010 buttle et al 2012 and highlights commonalities and differences across ires 2 methods 2 1 selection of gauging stations daily discharge data were compiled using gauging station records from france uk australia and the conterminous united states us table 1 these stations form subsets extracted from the nationwide reference hydrologic networks of the four countries they were deeply screened and extensively used in global studies e g zhang et al 2016 for australia giuntoli et al 2013 hodgkins et al 2017 and renard and thyer 2019 for france harrigan et al 2018b gnann et al 2019 and smith et al 2019 for the uk archfield et al 2014 hammond et al 2018 and dudley et al 2020 for the us the selection procedures are not strictly the same however the gauging stations were chosen to primarily reflect near natural conditions for example only usgs gauging stations classified as reference by falcone 2011 were used according to the quantitative and qualitative criteria of falcone et al 2010 which included calculation of a gis based disturbance index visual inspection of topographic maps and imagery and use of information available in technical reports on human activities data quality was one of the stages of development of these networks for example the final selection of the french gauging stations stemmed from an iterative scheme including dialogue between researchers and data providers on monitoring conditions and possible non natural causes of change e g rating curve change constructions affecting the river change of the station location etc in the uk data quality was ensured by using gauging stations of the uk benchmark network ukbn2 classed suitable for the study of trends in low flows as by barker et al 2019 in their assessment of historical droughts for more details on the selection procedures see the references in table 1 three main criteria were imposed to select gauging stations that had i a minimum length of 30 years of data between 01 01 1970 and 31 12 2018 with 5 of missing data which resulted in the selection of gauging stations with at least 28 5 years of records not necessarily continuous ii no significant human influence on low flows and iii high quality measurements in discharge especially in low flows a 30 year record length with up to 5 missing data criterion i was considered the minimum to derive reliable statistics on hydrological extremes such as those related to severe low and no flows this matches the timespan conventionally adopted to derive reliable statistics for climate world meteorological organization convention wmo 1989 to satisfy criterion ii gauging stations monitoring discharge of rivers with natural flows or minor abstractions were selected from previously published datasets table 1 a total of 1356 gauging stations across the four countries met all three criteria for inclusion in the final dataset 2 2 characterising flow regimes for intermittent rivers hydrologically distinguishing perennial from intermittent rivers is not straightforward and perhaps in consequence several definitions can be found in the literature for example poff 1996 and eng et al 2015 considered a river intermittent if the mean number of zero flow days was 10 d yr and 15 d yr respectively poff 1996 stressed that the definition was rather arbitrary furthermore reynolds et al 2015 discriminated perennial from two classes of intermittent rivers considering a river as weakly intermittent when the mean number of zero flow d yr was 20 and strongly intermittent when it was 20 leigh and datry 2016 introduced the term moderately ires as intermediate between weakly and strongly ires to describe the results of a k means clustering on a combined european and australian dataset in which rivers within each cluster had a mean of 11 0 4 and 92 zero flow d yr respectively huxter and van meerveld 2012 suggested distinguishing almost intermittent rivers for which the minimum daily river flow is 5 l s from intermittent rivers for which zero flow conditions are observed national regulations also define intermittent rivers including criteria on the annual number of zero flow days see d ambrosio et al 2017 for italy and spain in this paper we considered a gauged river intermittent ir when the mean number of no flow days in its 1970 2018 record was 5 d yr a definition supported by previous research on flow regimes in the countries of interest we considered rivers with on average 5 d yr but a strictly positive frequency of no flow days in their record as weakly intermittent wir all other rivers were considered perennial pr the no flow days were defined as only those days for which the observed daily flow was 1 l s this accounted for potential false positive detection of no flows associated with measurement resolution constraints and uncertainty in discharge observations zimmer et al 2020 each gauging station was characterized in terms of its river flow regime using statistics derived from daily flow time series there is a wide range of hydrological metrics used to characterize river flow regimes e g smakhtin 2001 olden and poff 2003 a set of 19 hydrological metrics calculated from daily flow time series table 2 was selected for i their relevance for describing ires and ii their complementarity in describing the different components of river flow regimes magnitude duration timing frequency and rate of change of flows introduced by richter et al 1996 the computation of and coding used for these metrics is given in appendix a 2 3 climate metrics climate metrics were chosen first for their potential links to flow intermittence and second for their relevance regarding the ability to interpret results within a climate change context to this end metrics were selected based on their simplicity of calculation i e variables which could be easily derived from the outputs of the general circulation models the final set of climate metrics included for analysis was mean annual temperature mat total precipitation map an aridity index ai and mean winter temperature mwt ai is computed as follows 1 ai m a p m a p e t where mapet is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration respectively middleton and thomas 1997 cherlet et al 2018 and the unep classification consider a location hyper arid if ai 0 03 arid if 0 03 ai 0 2 semi arid if 0 2 ai 0 5 dry sub humid if 0 5 ai 0 65 and otherwise humid ai 0 65 in this application map and mapet are average values over the gauged basins due to limited access to climate data for all the gauging stations examined and to the need for consistency we used the gridded terraclimate product abatzoglou et al 2018 which is available at 4 km spatial resolution and 1 month temporal resolution back to 1950 monthly time series of each variable were extracted as watershed averaged means to watershed boundaries available from national gauging network repositories using the exactextractr r package baston 2020 where watershed boundaries were not available for a subset of the gauges the gauging location was used in combination with merit hydrography yamazaki et al 2019 to prepare watershed boundaries based on upstream contributing area monthly time series were then aggregated to annual and mean annual time series by calculating annual totals of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and means of maximum minimum mean and winter mean temperature where winter months for france the uk and usa are december january and february and for australia are june july and august the identification of the main climate drivers was based on the analysis of homogeneity within classes derived from the empirical distribution of climate metrics classes were first defined by n quantiles for n 1 evenly spaced cumulative probabilities 1 n 2 n n 1 n derived from the empirical distribution of each climate descriptor the proportion of each type of river ir for ir wir for wir and pr for pr within each class was then computed secondly the proportions ir wir and pr were computed for each class as well as the inter class variance related to each partition the three inter class variances measure the degree of separation between classes and the highest value indicates the highest discrimination power among the tested partitions four partitions of irs were derived from each of the four empirical distributions of the selected climate metrics mat map ai and mwt the samples of climate metrics were divided into 10 bins defined by the minimum the nine deciles and the maximum each class had the same size 135 or 136 gauged basins which is a size large enough to derive robust statistics 2 4 classification procedure we performed a simple classification based on a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis using ward s minimum variance method and the euclidean distance between metrics as similarity criteria note that the coordinates of the gauging stations were not included in the distance between clusters and that methods leading to contiguous regions e g assunção et al 2006 guo 2008 were not applied here instead our methods provide a purely hydrological characterization based on river flow regimes the classification was achieved using a subset of weakly correlated climate metrics and hydrological metrics from among those described above as identified by a principal component analysis pca performed on all the metrics and regression analyses among pairs of metrics olden and poff 2003 the three first principal components explained 63 of the total variance in the dataset including the 19 hydrological metrics and the two main climate drivers ai and mwt the first component had large positive loadings for f0 and for all flow metrics related to the duration metrics related to flow duration curve characteristics aridity and predictability were highly negatively correlated with the first axis the second principal component is positively correlated with all duration metrics and negatively correlated with frequency metrics metrics related to no flow events were weakly correlated with the third axis the final subset of hydrological metrics includes seven metrics f0 mediand sdd meann sdn θ r which focus specifically on no flow conditions the first metric f0 when expressed in terms of percentage of the time with no flow conditions can be interpreted as flow permanence and is an important determinant of river biodiversity statistics on the duration and number of no flow events mediand sdd mediann sdn provide information complementary to flow permanence on the dynamics of flow intermittence e g the way no flow events are distributed within the year and their average severity in terms of consecutive days without flow circular statistics r and θ were also calculated to characterize periodicity of phenomena which contain temporal seasonal components these metrics were initially developed to identify flood periods on the basis of the timing of annual maximal peak discharges e g burn 1997 castellarin et al 2001 and have been applied to characterize low flow periods when discharge falls below a critical threshold value e g prudhomme et al 2016 here r provides a measure of the regularity of no flow days while θ gives the mean date of no flow occurrence four metrics qp p 1 90 ic and mediandr derived from the flow duration curve describing low to high flow components two metrics drec and mediandr which are durational measures of time recession at the seasonal scale and of flood dynamics respectively the metrics related to no flow conditions are overrepresented in the list of selected metrics in accordance with the objective of characterizing flow regime of ires further transformations were applied to normalize metrics and reduce asymmetry in empirical distributions the metrics related to duration mediandr meand mediand sdd were log transformed qp p 1 90 were divided by the mean long term annual discharge before being square root transformed f0 mediann sdn drec and ic were square root transformed the mean date θ was transformed to allow comparison of the timing with no flow conditions accounting for the shift in seasons between the two hemispheres the variables r sin θ and r cos θ were used instead of r and θ to avoid an artificial break in winter induced by angles 2 5 trend analysis trends were investigated at the aggregated level of clusters of gauged basins to overcome some of the issues due to both spatial and temporal dependencies between sites the analysis was conducted using regional metrics following ribes et al 2019 here derived from the at site annual f0 first values were computed for each river and year and converted into non exceedance probabilities when annual f0 was available for more than eight irs the median of these annual values was then calculated for each homogeneous group of rivers and this regional metric was used to represent flow intermittence at the regional scale the regional metric was not available over the whole period 1970 2018 due to gaps in the discharge records trends in regional flow intermittence were evaluated using the non parametric modified mann kendall trend test accounting for autocorrelation in time series yue and wang 2004 the theil sen slope estimator theil 1950 sen 1968 and least squares linear regression for graphic representations the regional kendall test helsel and frans 2006 was applied to identify evidence of consistent trend at multiple locations the choice of the method is partly supported by results of renard et al 2008 showing on the basis of simulated fields that the method applied here is unbiased and well suited for regional stationarity analysis and performs as well as for example the regional average mann kendall test developed by yue and wang 2002 positive or negative slopes suggest trends of more or less frequent years with no flow conditions time series demonstrate statistically significant trends when p values obtained from the mann kendall test were less than the predetermined significance level 0 05 3 results 3 1 flow characteristics in irs a set of 471 stations 308 irs and 163 wirs out of the 1356 met the criteria for intermittence table 1 fig 1 record lengths of irs ranged from 28 7 to 49 years with continuous observations throughout the 1974 2014 period available for 80 of the stations the extended overlapping period enabled comparisons between flow statistics the drainage areas of irs ranged from 4 to 232 850 km2 with a dominant proportion of small to medium size catchments 50 have catchment areas of 110 650 km2 50 of irs recorded no flow for at least 10 of their record length of the flow regime statistics the median number of continuous periods with no flow days mediann showed the most heterogeneous pattern within countries particularly in the us not shown there were also distinct regional differences in the occurrence of continuous periods with no flow days within countries the proportion of prs was lowest in the uk and highest in australia where 73 of all stations recorded no flow days table 1 across all countries nearly 90 of the 471 irs and wirs were located in australia and the conterminous us the proportion of irs among the gauged rivers was distributed relatively evenly over australia except for the interior and central west where no perennial gauges were identified and values of f0 are markedly higher fig 1 most of the gauged basins with low values of f0 were located along the southern and eastern coast while high values were in central arid and semi arid australia in france most irs were located in the west and the south western coastal region and f0 was low throughout the country 50 of the irs demonstrate f0 above 9 d yr in the uk only three irs and four wirs were identified however one station demonstrated a high value of f0 173 d yr while the two others had values of f0 below 15 d yr in the us the interquartile range of f0 was 17 124 d yr with the majority of irs located on the west coast and in the central states i e in the great plains most of the high values of f0 were concentrated in the central part of the country flow intermittence was infrequently recorded in mountainous regions and absent from eastern mountain gauges flow intermittence was highly seasonal but seasonality also varied substantially from one country to another fig 2 most of the gauged irs 58 for australia all for france and uk 72 for the usa experienced on average no flow in summer and early autumn between june and september in the northern hemisphere and between december and march in the southern hemisphere in australia and the us gauged basins with θ mean date of no flow occurrence falling outside of summer periods tended to demonstrate low seasonality the median of r for these basins 0 36 for australia 0 32 for the us was lower than for basins with no flow periods on average in summer 0 58 for australia 0 66 for the us 3 2 climate as a driver of flow intermittence the partition based on ai resulted in the maximal inter variance of ir wir and pr the metric ai was globally the most suitable variable for discriminating irs from prs the climate metrics ranked second and third in terms of power of discrimination were the mean annual temperature mat and the total precipitation map respectively from the four climate metrics only ai and mwt are considered in the following analyses the metric mwt despite weak overall discriminating power was finally selected because it was the only climate metric that could distinguish between no flow conditions due to freezing versus no flow from other causes note that ai was square root transformed before using this climate metric in the clustering procedure to reduce asymmetry of the empirical distribution overall ir was higher when ai was lower i e when climate was more arid and ir was lower when ai was higher i e when climate was more humid fig 3 d this global tendency was shared across the countries however the distribution of irs differed among and within countries in particular with the pattern for australia contrasting from other countries fig 3a the contrasting results among countries in terms of discriminating irs from prs were due to non overlapping ranges in ai and the specificity in climate conditions e g the proportion of gauged basins with negative winter temperatures was the highest in the us fig 3c the proportions of semi arid basins and dry sub humid basins were comparable but were not found in france or the uk fig 3b finally the link between levels of intermittence and aridity fig 4 was summarized using the unep classification we computed ir wir and pr for each climate type as defined by the aridity index ai table 3 only nine gauged basins two in the us and seven in australia experienced arid conditions so they were pooled with semi arid basins leading to the arid semi arid class proportions were interpreted in terms of probability under arid semi arid and dry sub humid conditions the probability of a river basin being non perennial was around 63 when ai 0 65 this probability declined to around 14 under humid conditions 3 3 classification of intermittence the classification procedure was applied to the 308 irs using the subset of 14 climate and hydrological metrics figs 5 and 6 appendix b a specific color was attributed to each class in figs 5 and 6 and the color palette was used latter to distinguish the different classes in subsequent graphs according to the agglomeration schedule the hierarchical cluster analysis suggested solutions with two six and nine groups the solution with two groups mainly differentiated irs according to their degree of flow intermittence the interquartile ranges of f0 of the two groups did not overlap at least six groups were required to distinguish 15 irs experiencing continental climate with cold winters and hot summers in the us as a separate group the solution with nine groups identified six harsh irs that had very few days with flow conditions moreover this solution resulted in a near uniform number of gauged basins obtained per group six classes with 40 52 basins and three classes with 6 24 basins hydrographs observed at one gauging station illustrated the seasonal pattern of river flows within each group fig 7 the distribution of the nine groups across the four countries is detailed in table 4 and in fig 8 the classification discriminated against rivers primarily on the basis of the mean annual proportion of no flow days fig 5 ir groups 1 5 were classified as weakly to moderately intermittent there was a non negligible probability for these groups to experience a full year with no flow conditions see the distribution of mediann groups 6 9 contained 126 moderately to harshly regularly intermittent rivers with f0 10 for all but five gauged basins of group 6 although most of the basins 1110 with ai 0 65 among the 1356 gauging stations experienced humid climates a wide diversity of seasonal patterns was identified in the classes of irs fig 7 ranging from rainfall fed regimes with high flows in winter and low flows in summer groups 1 2 and 3 to snowmelt dominated regimes with high flows in spring or early summer and winter minima caused by freezing groups 3 and 5 groups 1 2 3 and 8 displayed intermittence in summer and early fall while groups 4 5 and 7 experienced intermittence in spring and winter fig 6 seasonality of no flow conditions was not pronounced for groups 6 r 0 25 and 9 r 0 001 group 7 and group 8 were comparable in terms of frequency of flow 1 l s but differed in the distribution of no flow events each year group 1 was the most frequently observed in our dataset and the most relevant for european rivers group 7 was specific to australia while groups 3 and 5 were primarily associated with midwest us with few exceptions direct use of the nine groups defined above to study stationarity in flow intermittence was not straightforward because the groups encompassed a wide variety of climates and this was particularly evident in australia and the us therefore sub groups were delineated at national or regional levels fig 8 related regions were outlined manually to ensure geographic consistency median size 11 lat 20 long since climate the regions have been created considering a smaller extension in latitude than in longitude since latitude is a more important factor influencing climate patterns than longitude at the global scale and to limit heterogeneity in climate conditions considering the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 basins of group 1 in europe that were located in southern france with latitude 46 were extracted to form one sub group under oceanic influence east west distinctions were considered for the us to delineate the two regions 8 w 124 long 106 and 30 lat 39 and 8e 105 long 81 and 28 lat 41 finally stationarity within 14 regional pools 7 in the us 1 crossing france and uk and 6 in australia with 8 gauged basins in each pool were analyzed 3 4 trend analysis high year to year variability of flow intermittence was observed figs 9 11 with specific climatic events standing out in the data as high values of median non exceedance probability with small whiskers in australia the data were anomalous in groups 1 and 2 fig 9 in 1982 1983 and from 2000 to 2009 all groups but group 7 had a high proportion of no flow conditions likewise in europe there were notable periods of high no flow frequency in 1976 and from 1989 to 1992 in group 1 fig 10 in the eastern us the year 2012 was marked by extremely dry conditions due to the particular cause for intermittence freezing the temporal pattern displayed for group 5 differed substantially from those for other groups fig 11 despite the strong variability observed in the time series statistically significant trends i e p value 0 05 were detected when applying the modified mann kendall test for eight of the 14 groups all but one significant trend was positive indicating an increase in flow intermittence the slight trend of increasing flow intermittence in europe was not significant coherent results were found for groups with overlapping regions in southern australia 1 2 6 and 8 regardless of differences in significance level the slopes in southern australia were all positive upward trends were found in south central states of the us 2 and 6 however these upward trends were not statistically significant due to serial autocorrelation in regions 8 w and 8 e region 5 in the us displayed a decrease in flow intermittence out of the 14 regions examined in table 5 eight exhibited a statistically significant temporal change though no change was found in europe a question relates to the consistency of the detected changes in flow intermittence with changes observed in the main climate drivers ai and mwt section 3 2 over the same period at the regional scale for each region we carried out the regional mann kendall trend test to test for trends in ai and mwt in the gauged basins distributed across the regions significant changes in ai were observed for 5 out the 14 regions table 5 here the consistency in the sign of the changes was expected rather than consistency in the level of significance the sensitivity of flow intermittence to changes in climate drivers varied between catchments and in the case of consistency it does not mean that causal links are established in australia the five regions with detected increase in flow intermittence experienced increase in ai conversely no changes in both ai and flow intermittence were detected in europe the consistency was less noticeable in the us however the sign of the change in ai although not significant was consistent with the changes in flow intermittence note that for region 5 where ai was influenced by freezing no significant change was detected in the winter temperature mwt the slight trend towards warmer winter combined with more precipitation not shown here may be sufficient to result in decreased in flow intermittence 4 discussion 4 1 spatial pattern of flow intermittence the proportion of ires in the database is substantial 25 and 15 of the gauging stations are intermittent ir and weakly intermittent wir respectively however the gauged irs are not uniformly distributed 50 of the irs in the database are located in australia where only 35 of the stations are considered perennial in the uk the proportion of irs and wirs in the near natural network is low 5 of the 146 ukbn2 gauging stations rivers with gauged intermittent regimes but without human influence are rare intermittence in the wider uk hydrological monitoring network is more prevalent tramblay et al 2020 two of the three irs are small clay headwater catchments 30 km2 whilst chalk catchments in the south east of england are notably absent because of the historical effects of abstraction westwood et al 2017 furthermore it is likely that intermittence in the uk and more widely in temperate zones is under represented in the hydrological monitoring network stubbington et al 2017 certainly in france most irs remain ungauged the spatial pattern of irs across france is consistent with beaufort et al 2018 who show gauging stations and sites from the onde network with observed no flow conditions between 2012 and 2017 although wirs are found across france there are clusters of gauging stations in the western and southwestern regions note that there are more wirs in france than irs which provides an opportunity to study shifts from rarely towards moderately intermittent streams this is also true in the us where nearly 20 of the selected gauging stations is on intermittent rivers table 1 this suspected underestimation is consistent with conclusions from previous national studies irs may represent around 60 of total river length in the conterminous us nadeau and rains 2007 the distribution of irs across the us is similar to the results of eng et al 2015 for which gauging stations were also extracted from the gages2 database however other constraints were applied a threshold of 15 d yr was imposed to distinguish perennial from intermittent rivers and the required length of records between 1950 and 2012 was set at 10 years finally stations located in the us that have shoreline on the east coast and in northwestern us are absent from the dataset examined by eng et al 2015 while these estimates are limited in spatial extent they suggest that the ires are extremely abundant globally 4 2 drivers of flow intermittence aridity as measured by ai was the most relevant climate driver within the set of selected metrics ai is a measure of dryness based on precipitation and evapotranspiration processes related to air temperature which may explain why it outperformed the individual precipitation map and temperature mat variables the list of potential climate drivers examined in this study was intentionally limited indeed the potential climate drivers were primarily selected for the availability from gcm outputs and the reliability of the projected change under global warming conditions indicators related to climate extremes were thus not considered here aridity is certainly not the single main driver of intermittence rivers may cease flowing under humid conditions 12 of the gauging stations with ai 1 41 for example many streams in australia s wet dry tropics are intermittent leigh and sheldon 2008 furthermore warfe et al 2011 suggest that in addition to climate latitude and geology control flow intermittence at a regional scale in australia a geological origin of flow intermittence is likely in both france and the uk and globally at the european scale sauquet et al 2020b no flow conditions are mainly due to impervious bedrock in western france crystalline rock formation to groundwater table fluctuations and seepage through permeable channels in northern and southwestern france sedimentary rock formation and to the presence of an extensive karst in eastern france jeannin et al 2016 in southern france mediterranean climate conditions may have a moderate influence on flow intermittence couturier and fourneaux 1998 in the uk flow intermittence driven by permeable geology is observed in soluble rocks for example in the carboniferous limestone of the peak district stubbington et al 2009 and in the cretaceous chalk of south and east of england where streams typically contract through the summer months sefton et al 2019 many of the intermittent watersheds in humid portions of the us contain significant karst developments which may explain flow intermittence for example a large part of florida is karstic with high hydraulic conductivity so that by the end of the dry season i e january june many streams become intermittent 4 3 classification and dynamics of intermittent rivers many river flow classifications based on a set of gauging stations do exist including those encompassing a small to large portion of irs e g kennard et al 2010 oueslati et al 2015 as well as those restricted to irs e g eng et al 2015 there are many ways to establish a classification in accordance with predefined objectives see olden et al 2011 and as a consequence the universality of any one classification is debatable a large set of hydrological indices related to the different components of river flow regimes were considered in this study in accordance with the objective of developing a classification dedicated to irs the metrics related to no flow periods were overrepresented to give more weight to flow intermittence in the production of homogenous groups of rivers links between our results and previous classifications can be identified for example eng et al 2015 emphasized the seasonality of no flow periods which is one component of flow intermittence amongst others considered here in our clustering procedure most of the fall to winter irs in west north central us of eng et al 2015 are classified within our group 5 rivers with irs experiencing negative winter temperatures and no flow events in autumn or winter fig 11 non seasonal irs are found in groups 7 9 which displays the least seasonally contrasted temporal pattern of no flow periods r 0 35 fig 6 the linkage with the australian river flow classes developed by kennard et al 2010 is not straightforward due to the presence of perennial rivers in that dataset classes 5 8 of kennard et al 2010 which include irs from groups 1 2 6 and 8 of our classification are observed along the coast in southern australia at the opposite extreme the summer highly and extremely intermittent streams classes 10 and 12 of kennard et al 2010 and irs from our groups 4 and 7 are found in northern australia these links are substantial since the studies share a large proportion of gauging stations and correlated hydrological metrics the global classification developed here can be considered an extension of preexisting classifications encompassing additional temporal patterns that are missing in regional classifications e g group 5 and group 7 are only found in the conterminous us and in australia respectively regardless of the large number of suitable gauging stations examined across the four countries ires experiencing freezing conditions are underrepresented in our classification examples in antarctica switzerland and norway can be found in the literature chinn and mason 2016 robinson et al 2016 sauquet et al 2020b in addition atypical local geological conditions may result in an unexpected hydrograph and require a novel group to be defined this encourages us to extend data collection across other climates and other hydrogeological contexts despite the limitation of low coverage of data in areas experiencing continental polar and alpine climates the results presented here represent a major first attempt to classify and compare river flow regimes at a global scale 4 4 long term trend analysis in no flow conditions several analyses have been conducted to study the impact of long term climate variability on low flows in australia chiew and mcmahon 1993 zhang et al 2016 in france renard et al 2008 giuntoli et al 2013 in the uk hannaford and buys 2012 hannaford 2015 and in the us e g douglas et al 2000 small et al 2006 kam and sheffield 2016 ahn and palmer 2015 the present study is to our knowledge the first to focus on flow intermittence at the global scale our findings are for the most part in agreement with those from the previous cited works in australia the 1982 1983 drought affected the east part of the country gibbs 1984 very low precipitation over the period of april 1982 february 1983 was recorded in southeastern australia prevailing extremely dry conditions were responsible for huge dust storms and one of the most deadly bushfires in the history of australia in february 1983 known as the 1983 ash wednesday bushfires e g blanchi et al 2014 from the mid 1990s to 2009 southeastern australia experienced a prolonged sequence of yearly precipitation deficit known as the millennium drought leblanc et al 2012 van dijk et al 2013 peaking in 2006 with the lowest average rainfall for south australia since 1900 a high proportion of no flow conditions were observed in rivers within groups 1 2 6 and 8 for the corresponding period fig 9 the decreasing trend found in q90 in southern australia temperate climate zone is in accordance with results obtained for groups 1 2 6 and 8 no change was found for groups 4 and 7 with geographical domains partly overlapping central australia where no significant trends in q90 were detected this is in agreement with zhang et al 2016 who found temporal changes in hydrology varied with latitude the impact of several major drought events in europe during the period 1970 2013 spinoni et al 2015 hanel et al 2018 was also apparent fig 10 with above normal no flow frequencies observed during the droughts deficits in precipitations from december 1975 until august 1976 were particularly high in southern uk and northern france comparative to the mediterranean region vidal et al 2010 zaidman et al 2002 causing a high proportion of no flow events in group 1 fig 10 note that flow intermittence in 2003 and in 2015 was close to average conditions with a median non exceedance probability dispersed around 50 the 2003 european heat wave event garcía herrera et al 2010 produced an agricultural drought with more impact on soil moisture than on river flow vidal et al 2010 the 2015 european drought event laaha et al 2017 mainly affected central europe spanning from eastern france to southern poland and northern romania however there was no evidence of general change in low flows for the uk nor for france giuntoli et al 2013 showed evidence of downward trends in annual minimum discharge in southern france while no change was detected in northern france no irs which met our selection criteria are gauged in areas where these changes were detected we also found no significant trend in flow intermittence for group 1 with all irs located in northern france and in the uk in the us the year 1988 stands out and corresponds to the north american drought of 1988 namias 1991 fig 11 this was one of the most severe and extensive droughts of recent times in the us affecting the northern plains in particular starting in 1987 and continuing until 1992 this multi year event was accompanied by two heat waves in summer 1988 a significant multi year drought occurred in california during the period 2007 2009 california department of water resources 2010 and its effect on river flows is noticeable for group 8 with above average flow intermittence conditions there are many other intermittency indices some of which also display trends in european rivers tramblay et al 2020 and may also be important on other continents however f0 is the most widely used metric for characterization therefore this study chose f0 as a starting point and suggests additional metrics be examined in further studies 5 conclusions here we characterized and classified the flow regimes of non perennial rivers using data sourced from a large collection of gauging stations monitoring unregulated rivers in four countries and representing a range of climate conditions priority was given to near natural flow regimes in gauging station selection over proportionate representation of intermittence or types of intermittent river across the contributing countries from the 1356 selected stations 308 had a mean annual frequency of no flows 5 days year and were assigned as intermittent the classification included different aspects of flow intermittence and will be useful to assess the impact of no flow periods on biological communities and ecosystem processes our findings also suggest that the proportion of ires varies in space under a temperate climate this proportion is certainly underestimated due to the priority given to gauging rivers in medium to large basins and in urban areas where water resources are sufficient enough to develop human activities and where the human population needs to be protected against extreme events a simple aridity index was found to be the most relevant factor discriminating intermittent from perennial rivers at the global scale the link between aridity and flow intermittence identified here may provide a first insight into the risk of individual rivers becoming intermittent due to change in climate for example a modified ai could be computed for different scenarios of shifts in mean annual rainfall and temperature the considered river could be categorized thereafter according to the unep classification arid semi arid dry sub humid humid and its probability of being intermittent under the modified climate given by the proportion of irs within the aridity class provided by table 3 the classification also defined a basis for trend detection in annual frequency of no flows at a regional scale with conclusions supporting those obtained for low flows of near natural basins in the countries examined at the global scale the global warming observed in recent years may not necessarily have led to more flow intermittence but such a conclusion must be viewed with caution and requires further investigation as it is based on a finite set of gauged stations data and analyses information on how flow intermittence develops in both time and space is still sparse partly due to the lack of gauged or otherwise monitored ires in the absence of information on ires location options to identify them include conducting field surveys along river networks e g turner and richter 2011 assendelft and van meerveld 2019 sefton et al 2019 utilising

s the pth quantile qp is the daily discharge value exceeded p of time metrics related to no flow events are computed a no flow event starts when q 1 l s and will last until q 1 l s the metrics meand mediand and sd are the mean median and standard deviation of the duration of no flow events respectively the no flow events have been identified for each water year to estimate meann mediann and sdn which are the mean median and standard deviation of the number of no flow events per year respectively the maximal duration of the continuous sequence of no flow within the year exceeded on average

mean and dispersion of the occurrence of no flows within the year θ and r these two variables are circular statistics each day i with no flow is converted into an angular ti and represented by a unit vector with rectangular coordinates cos ti sin ti the mean of the cosines and sines defines a representative vector the value for θ is obtained by calculating the inverse tangent of the angle of the mean vector and the norm of the mean vector provides a measure of the regularity in the dates a value close to one indicates a high concentration around θ while a value close to zero indicates no seasonality to account for the shift in the timing of winter in the two hemispheres december to february in the northern hemisphere june to august in the southern hemisphere the constant π or π is added to θ for australian gauged basins when θ occurred between 1st july and 31st december or 1st january and 30th june respectively seasonal predictability of no flow events sd6 this metric was formerly introduced by gallart et al 2012 and uses monthly discharge sd6 1 meanf06wm meanf06dm where meanf06dm and meanf06wm represent the average frequency of month with no flow for the contiguous six driest months of the year and for the remaining six wetter months respectively the sd6 descriptor is computed here using monthly frequencies of days with no flow the seasonal recession time scale

in the dataset the flow intermittence regime observed under humid subtropical climate and temperate oceanic climate in the three continents characteristics are typical of rainfall fed regimes of intermittent rivers f0 10 and mediann 0 for most of the basins low flows and probably flow intermittence are likely due to evapotranspiration processes in summer no flow events are short mediand around 10 days and highly seasonal 46 out of the 51 irs display r above 0 7 occurring in late summer march or april in australia august or september in europe and in the us group 2 irs are mainly located in the eastern us and southeastern australia group 2 is similar to group 1 in terms of duration and frequency of no flow events and is the group ranked 2nd in terms of size 67 irs the two groups differ in both the timing and predictability of no flow events earlier in summer with a less pronounced seasonality than group 1 irs from group 2 tend to be more intermittent the median of f0 is 15 d yr and flashier in terms of q01 and mediandr than irs from group 1 group 3 is also similar to groups 1 and 2 in terms of duration and frequency of no flow events basins from group 3 experience more no flows than the two previous groups f0 around 22 d yr they are found in the central us and europe no flows occur usually around september for the us the dispersion of the occurrence of no flow days within the year median r 0 73 is between group 1 median r 0 85 and group 2 median r 0 63 no flow events are more frequently observed mediann 0 for almost 50 of the basins than in groups 1 and 2 group 4 irs are similar to those in groups 1 3 in terms of flow permanence f0 median around 10 they differ by their location they are found in areas experiencing equatorial subtropical or tropical climate in northwestern australia and in florida and their seasonality no flow events are observed in spring intermittence is not observed every year q90 within this group can be above 1 l s group 5 are found exclusively within northcentral us in regions with winter temperatures below zero indicating the flow regimes of this group are likely to be partly influenced by snow processes the median date of occurrence of no flow events is observed in autumn or winter but the seasonality of flow intermittence is not well pronounced small values for r are due to continental climate leading to two no flow periods one induced by freezing in winter and the other by evapotranspiration processes in summer group 6 pools moderate and harsh irs all but one from southern australia and western us f0 ranges between 6 and 86 with a median value of 26 group 6 comprises irs with the highest values of mediann 2 5 no flow events per year no flows tend to be divided into several events and these events are distributed within the year leading to low values for r and no strong seasonal pattern only 10 among the 50 basins have q90 0 characteristics of group 7 are typical of harsh irs located in central australia no flow events are observed in late winter and early spring all basins display q90 0 mediann 0 and climates for 6 of the 20 basins are dry sub humid to arid group 8 and group 7 irs are very similar in terms of flow intermittence medians of f0 close to 40 for the two groups those of group 8 differ mainly in the way the no flows are distributed within the year late summer for group 8 and spring for group 7 several no flow events can be expected within the year medians of mediann 2 for both groups and a median no flow event for group 8 irs persists 25 days median of mediand which is shorter than a median no flow event for group 7 irs 21 days group 9 irs are ephemeral streams with few days of flow on average 3 d yr with f0 98 they are found in the south central us under arid and semi arid conditions they experience flashy runoff events mediandr 1 d the seasonality of flow intermittence is not pronounced and values for r are close to 0 due to extended periods of little to no rainfall 
4601,this paper presents the new analytical expressions to improve the description of transient specific yield sy in shallow groundwater drainage a new expression of the transient sy i e sy g t that only considers the gravity effect is first derived based on the modified van genuchten model this analytical expression is still valid when water table depth wtd is less than the soil air entry pressure head and thus completes the lack of description in the near saturated segment in previous expressions further we propose an approximate method to dealing with the diffusivity capillary effect and derive an improved approximate expression of sy with both considering the gravity and diffusivity capillary effects the accuracy of the improved expression of sy gd t is evaluated with the test cases that cover all of soil types under the usda soil classification system and different changes in water table also compared with the expression derived with only considering the gravity effect the comparisons show that the sy gd t expression could more accurately capture the dependence of the transient sy on time and wtd and significantly reduce the errors of ignoring the diffusivity effect in addition the analytical expression of ultimate sy and the final time td required to reach its ultimate value are both derived based on the initial and final equilibrium states results indicate that our improved expressions can expand the application range of analytical expression and significantly improve the calculation accuracy of transient sy in the shallow groundwater environments keywords transient specific yield time dependent analytical expressions modified van genuchten model gravity and diffusivity effects 1 introduction the specific yield sy is an important hydrogeological parameter in groundwater resource estimation and management boucher et al 2009 dettmann and bechtold 2016 mclaughlin and cohen 2014 it is often used in the estimation of groundwater recharge drainage evapotranspiration and water resource storage in unconfined aquifers and the measurement of water driven by gravity in the vadose zone above the shallow groundwater table cheng et al 2015 gribovszki 2018 mclaughlin and cohen 2014 said et al 2005 the sy is defined as the volume of water released from or taken into storage per unit surface area of the aquifer per unit change in water table depth bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 and can be expressed as 1 s y δ v a δ d where a is the aquifer area and δv is the volume of water released or stored resulting from changes in water table of δd the consensus is that the sy is a time dependent transient parameter changing from the initial value zero to a final stable value i e ultimate specific yield when water table has a δd fluctuation meanwhile the ultimate sy also significantly varies with different changes in water table under shallow groundwater conditions due to the capillary effects of soils cheng et al 2020 duke 1972 nachabe 2002 in addition the sy is largely affected by the soil hydraulic properties as well actually understanding the changes in sy is quite significant for the groundwater management issues under shallow groundwater environments mclaughlin and cohen 2014 xiao et al 2021 for the ultimate sy the analytical expressions can be obtained through the integral calculation and several expressions have already been proposed with enough calculation accuracy cheng et al 2015 duke 1972 nachabe 2002 nevertheless the transient sy shows significantly non linear properties with both time and water table depth wtd nachabe 2002 to our knowledge there is still lack of analytical expression that could accurately calculate the transient sy in general the calculation of the transient sy is based on the richards equation that could describe the variably saturated water flow process there are mainly two types of approaches analytical expression nachabe 2002 and numerical method zhang and cai 1988 cheng et al 2020 the vertical one dimensional richards equation can be expressed as richards 1931 2 θ t z d θ θ z k θ z where θ is the soil water content t is the time d θ is the diffusivity k θ is the hydraulic conductivity and z is the vertical coordinate positive upward the first and second terms on the right hand side of eq 2 are called the diffusive flux term and the gravity flux term respectively it is known that there is few analytical solution for eq 2 except with some very specific assumptions basha 1994 warrick et al 1991 to our knowledge only nachabe 2002 has derived the analytical expressions for the transient sy but with only considering the gravity flux term during drainage however cheng et al 2020 indicate that ignoring the diffusive flux term or capillary effect term may result in significant errors in estimating the transient sy through comparison of the nachabe s expression and the numerical results including both diffusive flux term and the gravity flux term moreover the sy expressions by nachabe 2002 are based on the integral calculation of the brooks corey b c model to describe the soil water retention swr curve brooks and corey 1964 and hence nachabe s expression lacks a reasonable description in near saturated segment when wtd less than air entry pressure head therefore many researchers employ the numerical method to calculate the transient sy cheng et al 2020 zhang and cai 1988 the numerical calculation can obtain the water contents of soil profile at any time and further calculate the transient sy during changes in water table in spite of that we think the analytical expression can more directly and effectively reflect the relationship between physical variables in addition it is more economical and useful to obtain the results without needing the complex numerical codes and modeling experience therefore obtaining the analytical expressions of sy is still of interest to many researchers and engineers cheng et al 2015 nachabe 2002 tan et al 2006 this study aimed to 1 overcome the weakness of the existing transient expressions of sy in the near saturated segment with adopting the modified van genuchten mvg model van genuchten 1980 and 2 improve the accuracy of analytical expressions of transient sy with considering both the gravity and diffusivity effects through proposing an approximate method to further consider the diffusivity

applicability of analytical expression of transient sy and the range of the empirical parameter in the expression were discussed under different soil types and wtds 2 method and equations 2 1 the derivation of sy with mvg model only considering the gravity effect the mixed form of 1 d richards equation considers the gravity and diffusive flux terms can be written as 3 θ t z k θ h θ z k θ z where h θ is the capillary pressure head function in general it is impossible to obtain an analytical solution of the full richards equation bear and cheng 2010 younger 2007 due to its highly nonlinear properties while the approximate solution hogarth and parlange 2000 parlange et al 1997 philip 1960 ross and parlange 1994 or analytical solutions may be possible in some special cases basha 1994 warrick et al 1991 this makes it difficult to directly adopt the eq 3 in the further derivation of transient sy therefore the nachabe s expression of transient sy is based on the simplified richard s equation i e only considers the gravity effect and ignores the diffusivity effect and the equation can be expressed as 4 θ t k θ z eq 4 can be converted into the following expression 5 z t 1 θ s θ r k s e s e where θs and θr are the saturated and residual soil water contents respectively and se is the effective saturation s e θ θ r θ s θ r the processing of eq 1 requires the functions of h θ and k se to describe the soil hydraulic properties in this study the traditional vg model van genuchten 1980 i e eq 6 is used for the expression of relative hydraulic conductivity and the expression of mvg model i e eq 7 proposed by troch 1993 is adopted to describe the swr curve compared with the traditional vg model the mvg model can be easily integrated with using m 1 1 n troch 1993 which is more helpful to derive an analytical solution or expression 6 s e 1 1 α h n 1 1 n 7 s e 1 1 α h n 1 1 n where α and α are the empirical shape parameters affecting the soil air entry pressure head and n and n are the empirical shape parameters determining the curve steepness the parameters of α and n in mvg model can be easily obtained by fitting the vg model curve the k se is a nonlinear function and can be expressed by the mualem equation mualem 1976 as follows 8 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where l is a pore connectivity parameter and suggested to be about 0 5 and m equals to 1 1 n van genuchten et al 1991 substituting eq 8 into eq 5 the relationship between z and effective saturation se at time t can be expressed as 9 z τ k s s e l 1 θ s θ r 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n l 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 s e s e n n 1 1 1 n t where τ is the vertical distance i e ac from the point a on the initial soil water content profile to the final water table fig 1 fig 1 shows the changes in the effective saturation of the soil profile when the water table drops from initial depth d 1 to final depth d 2 during the drainage process the water content evolution of soil profile can be divided into two sections the lower section has reached the final equilibrium state while the upper section is still changing driven by the pressure gradients at time t the one that has reached its equilibrium state satisfies τ z δd δd d 2 d 1 then replacing τ z δd in eq 9 the corresponding effective saturation variation of se v t satisfies the following equation 10a θ s θ r δ d k s s e v l 1 1

one can obtain 10b z δ d s e n n 1 1 1 n α k s s e l 1 θ s θ r 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n l 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 s e s e n n 1 1 1 n t eq 10b expresses the mathematical relationship of effective saturation varied with z at any time t when not reaching the final equilibrium state when the water table drops from initial depth d 1 to final depth d 2 fig 1 the sy can be expressed as bear 1972 gribovszki 2018 nachabe 2002 11 s y δ v a δ d 1 δ d θ g s θ s τ z d θ θ s θ r δ d s e g s s e d 1 d 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n α k s e t θ s θ r d s e s e d 1 s e v k s e t θ s θ r d s e δ d s e v 1 d s e where the se d 1 is the effective saturation of ground surface at the initial time and s e d 1 1 α d 1 n 1 1 n se gs is the effective saturation of ground surface it can be calculated by eq 10b when we set z d 2 the variation of effective saturation se v t at time t can be calculated by eq 10a according to the integral term of eq 11 the change in transient sy g t with time t can be expressed as 12 s y g t θ s θ r

obtained as follows 13 s y θ s θ r δ d δ d d 1 1 α d 1 n 1 n d 2 1 α d 2 n 1 n then by rewriting the form of eq 10a we can obtain the final time td g when the sy g t has reached its ultimate value 14

under the combined action of gravity and diffusivity effects the analytical expression of sy that ignores the diffusivity effect may cause considerable errors especially for some finer texture soils therefore we attempt to further consider the effects of diffusivity on the transient sy estimation during drainage the water flow in the unsaturated zone is driven by the pressure gradients formed by the wtd drops from d 1 to d 2 fig 2 a this means that h z i e the first term on the right side of eq 3 is highly related to the parameters d 1 and d 2 as shown in fig 2 the h z 1 at the initial and final equilibrium state i e h z d 1 d 1 1 at the initial time t 0 and h z d 2 d 2 1 at the final time td with h z 1 0 in the process fig 2b considering that the variation range of h z 1 0 is within a limited interval it can be reasonably understood that the range of z k θ h z 0 k θ z based on the above analysis we assume that there is a coefficient a related to d 1 and d 2 and the form of a k θ z can approximate the role of z k θ h z in eq 3 with a 0 1 meanwhile h z value is assumed to be independent on z and t and a is a introduced new empirical parameter by this way we intend to approximately express the influence of diffusivity effect and further to improve the accuracy in the analytical expression of transient sy with the approach of using a k θ z to approximate the effect of diffusive flux term z k θ h z in eq 3 we substitute the term of a k θ z into the highly non linear eq 3 i e one dimensional full richards equation to obtain 15 θ t z k θ h θ z k θ z a k θ z k θ z 1 a k θ z eq 15 can be converted into the following expression 16 z t 1 a θ s θ r k s e s e it can be seen that eq 16 has the similar form as eq 5 thus with the similar approach of deriving eqs 12 14 we can re derive the improved analytical expression of transient sy that could both consider the gravity effect and diffusivity effect as follows 17 s y g d t θ s θ r δ d d 1 s e d 1 s e g s 1 s e d 1 n n 1 1 1 n 1 s e g s n n 1 1 1 n α 1 a k s e v k s e g s t δ d θ s θ r 1 s e v the analytical expression of sy g t eq 12 only considers the gravity effect while the sy gd t eq 17 further includes the diffusivity effects note that the two treatments have the same expression of ultimate sy corresponding to eq 13 for the same water table change however the final time td gd when the sy gd t reaches its ultimate value is quite different with the td g in the aforementioned situation expressed as 18 t d g d θ s θ r δ d 1 a k s s e v l 1 1 1 s e v n n 1 1 1 n l 1 1 s e v n n 1 1 1 n 2 s e v s e v n n 1 1 1 n eq 18 introduces one more parameter a than eq 14 it implies that the larger parameter a results in the larger td and the slower drainage process 3 verification and discussions 3 1 performance of the sy g equations in order to present the applicable range of the sy expression based on the b c model nachabe 2002 and mvg model this study two types of soil fine sand and fine sandy loam that used in nachabe 2002 were also adopted here the soil hydraulic parameters for different swr models are provided in table 1 here two cases of wtd change i e increasing instantaneously from 60 cm to 90 cm and from 25 cm to 65 cm were presented in the comparison case meanwhile hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 was used to numerically solve the richards equation eq 3 and to further obtain the values of transient sy the transient sy at time t can be calculated by 19 s y t i 1 k θ initial i θ t i d z i δ d where θ initial i and θ t i are the water content of ith soil compartment at initial time and time t in hydrus 1d model respectively dzi is the thickness of the ith soil compartment and k is the total number of soil compartments above the final water table the sy values calculated by the numerical approach can be approximated as the real values of transient sy and noted as sy num t the variation of sy t calculated by the numerical approach and analytical expressions i e eq 12 in this study and nachabe s equation are presented in fig 3 results indicated that the curves of these two sy g t expressions had a similar trend with the variation of sy num t fig 3a and 3b but the sy g t expression of nachabe s equation was unable to characterize the sy g t when the initial wtd was less than the air entry pressure fig 3c and 3d compared with nachabe s equation eq 12 in this study was still valid when the wtd was less than the air entry pressure head thus the weakness of existing expressions in the near saturated segment was overcome and the applicable range of transient sy was thus expanded in addition there was a great difference between the curves of sy g t both for eq 12 and nachabe s equation and the corresponding real values of sy num t fig 3 it can be seen that the curves of sy g t showed larger values of transient sy in drainage process and were much faster to reach the ultimate values this was highly related to the sy g t expressions eq 12 and nachabe s equation that only considered the gravity effect thus it was crucial to both consider the gravity and diffusivity effects to improve the accuracy of transient sy 3 2 performance of the sy gd equations the test cases that covered all of soil types under the usda soil classification system and different changes in water table were conducted to further test the accuracy of the proposed analytical expression of sy gd t i e eq 17 and to obtain the appropriate a values for different conditions the twelve major soil textural groups reported by carsel and parrish 1988 were adopted in the test the detailed soil hydraulic parameters of different swr models are provided in table 1 an effective best fitting approach was adopted to estimate the value of a a was assumed to be increased in a step of 0 001 with the known value space a 0 1 the a value that corresponded to the smallest value of root mean square error rmse calculated from analytical values and real values of sy was considered as the appropriate value for each test case four different changes in wtd i e increasing instantaneously from 20 cm to 40 cm from 40 cm to 80 cm from 120 cm to 160 cm and from 60 cm to 140 cm were taken as examples to present the variation of transient sy the fourth one represented the situation where the water table dropped significantly the variation of sy t of four soil types i e sand loamy sand silt loam and sandy clay calculated by analytical expressions and numerical approach are selected and presented in figs 4 7 results indicated that the sy gd t curves were much closer to the sy num t curves than sy g t curves showing a better approximation to real values than sy g t curves for most of the soils after the use of a best fitting a value meanwhile for the sand soil and loamy sand soil the calculated sy g t values by eq 12 could be approximate to the real sy num t ones figs 4 and 5 this was due to that these two soils had relatively coarse texture and large ks the gravity flux terms was dominant during drainage in addition results showed that the eq 12 preformed a little better for significant water table drawdowns than small water table changes however for the silt loam and sandy clay the eq 12 obviously failed to describe the sy t variations figs 6 and 7 the sy g t curves deviated from the true sy num t curves being much faster to reach the ultimate values especially for small wtd changes figs 6 and 7 fortunately the sy gd t values by eq 17 showed a very good fit with the real values i e sy num t for all situations when adopting appropriate a values figs 6 and 7 rmse 0 002 in above cases with twelve soils and different water table changes the calculated sy gd t matched very well with the real values of sy num t when using the best fitting a values meanwhile the appropriate a values for all cases are provided in fig 8 and fig s1 in appendix for a given initial wtd d 1 the a value gradually decreased as the increase of final wtd d 2 figs 8 and s1 for example for d 1 20 cm the a value of silt loam soil decreased from 0 783 to 0 309 when d 2 changed from 40 cm to 80 cm fig 8c this was because the gravity effect became more significant when water table changing more sharply besides the value range of a was smaller for relatively coarse textured soils e g sand soil and loamy sand soil fig 8 this was because the gravity effect on sy gd t was much stronger for relatively coarse textured soils than that for relatively fine textured soils during drainage in addition the estimated td by eq 18 i e td gd more approached to the real values figs 4 7 while td was underestimated by eq 14 i e td g for example in the test case of wtd changing from 20 cm to 40 cm for silt loam soil td gd reached to about 68 h with a 0 783 and the td g was only 15 h fig 6a moreover the plot contours for parameter a are drawn and provided in figs 8 and s1 the rmse was less than 0 0071 and r2 was greater than 0 953 of sy which could be convenient for users to determine the reasonable a values under different soil and wtd change conditions overall the introduction of parameter a was very meaningful to the practical engineering application of our proposed sy gd t expression 3 3 practicality and limitations the derivation of our improved expressions for sy considered both the gravity and diffusivity effects compared with previous expressions of transient sy the eq 17 effectively improved the calculation accuracy of sy t for most of soil types in addition the eqs 12 and 17 can be used to calculate sy when the wtd is less than the air entry pressure head and complemented the lack of description in near saturated segment this could expand the application range of analytical expression of transient sy in shallow groundwater environments the proposed expressions of transient sy are time dependent and can be effectively used in many shallow groundwater management issues e g estimation of groundwater recharge drainage evapotranspiration and water resource storage in addition although the form of expressions eqs 12 and 17 seems to be complicated its calculation could be is easily carried out with basic software e g microsoft excel and matlab the calculation accuracy and practicality should be acceptable enough in the practical applications especially from an engineering perspective however there were still some limitations in the transient expressions of sy in this paper only the condition of water table falling was concerned the hysteresis of the soil water retention curve suggested that the transient sy in drainage process should be different from that in the water table rising process therefore the transient sy is required to be further studied when water table is rising in addition the derivation of transient sy was carried out under the assumption of homogeneous soils and the sy for heterogeneous soils needed to be investigated in the follow up researches 4 conclusion this paper presented the development of new improved expressions of transient specific yield sy for shallow groundwater environments the improved expressions of transient sy only considered the gravity effect i e sy g t and involved the gravity and approximate diffusivity capillary effects i e sy gd t were derived based on the modified van genuchten model respectively the comparison case with two soil types showed that the improved expression of transient sy can be used to characterize sy even when the wtd was less than the air entry pressure head and thus complemented the lack of description of sy in near saturated segment in previous expressions approximate approach was proposed to further consider the diffusivity effect with introducing an empirical parameter a in the derivation of sy gd t the test cases with twelve soil types and different changes in water table indicated that the improved analytical expression of sy gd t can effectively improve the calculation accuracy for the transient sy for most of soil types compared with the expressions of transient sy derived with only considering the gravity effect moreover a reasonable value of the introduced empirical parameter a was discussed and recommended under different soil and wtd change conditions the plot contours for parameter a could provide effective reference values for practical engineering applications with our proposed sy gd t expression the analytical expression of ultimate sy and the time td required to reach the ultimate state were also given in eqs 13 and 18 respectively overall the improved expressions could significantly increase

4601,this paper presents the new analytical expressions to improve the description of transient specific yield sy in shallow groundwater drainage a new expression of the transient sy i e sy g t that only considers the gravity effect is first derived based on the modified van genuchten model this analytical expression is still valid when water table depth wtd is less than the soil air entry pressure head and thus completes the lack of description in the near saturated segment in previous expressions further we propose an approximate method to dealing with the diffusivity capillary effect and derive an improved approximate expression of sy with both considering the gravity and diffusivity capillary effects the accuracy of the improved expression of sy gd t is evaluated with the test cases that cover all of soil types under the usda soil classification system and different changes in water table also compared with the expression derived with only considering the gravity effect the comparisons show that the sy gd t expression could more accurately capture the dependence of the transient sy on time and wtd and significantly reduce the errors of ignoring the diffusivity effect in addition the analytical expression of ultimate sy and the final time td required to reach its ultimate value are both derived based on the initial and final equilibrium states results indicate that our improved expressions can expand the application range of analytical expression and significantly improve the calculation accuracy of transient sy in the shallow groundwater environments keywords

equilibrium state satisfies τ z δd δd d 2 d 1 then replacing τ z δd in eq 9 the corresponding effective saturation variation of se v t satisfies the following equation 10a θ s θ r δ d k s s e v l 1 1

one can obtain 10b z δ d s e n n 1 1 1 n α k s s e l 1 θ s θ r 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n l 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 s e s e n n 1 1 1 n t eq 10b expresses the mathematical relationship of effective saturation varied with z at any time t when not reaching the final equilibrium state when the water table drops from initial depth d 1 to final depth d 2 fig 1 the sy can be expressed as bear 1972 gribovszki

1 is the effective saturation of ground surface at the initial time and s e d 1 1 α d 1 n 1 1 n se gs is the effective saturation of ground surface it can be calculated by eq 10b when we set z d 2 the variation of effective saturation se v t at time t can be calculated by eq 10a according to the integral term of eq 11 the change in transient sy g t with time t can be expressed as 12 s y g t θ s θ r

under the combined action of gravity and diffusivity effects the analytical expression of sy that ignores the diffusivity effect may cause considerable errors especially for some finer texture soils therefore we attempt to further consider the effects of diffusivity on the transient sy estimation during drainage the water flow in the unsaturated zone is driven by the pressure gradients formed by the wtd drops from d 1 to d 2 fig 2 a this means that h z i e the first term on the right side of eq 3 is highly related to the parameters d 1 and d 2 as shown in fig 2 the h z 1 at the initial and final equilibrium state i e h z d 1 d 1 1 at the initial time t 0 and h z d 2 d 2 1 at the final time td with h z 1 0 in the process fig 2b considering that the variation range of h z 1 0 is within a limited interval it can be reasonably understood that the range of z k θ h z 0 k θ z based on the above analysis we assume that there is a coefficient a related to d 1 and d 2 and the form of a k θ z can approximate the role of z k θ h z in eq 3 with a 0 1 meanwhile h z value is assumed to be independent on z and t and a is a introduced new empirical parameter by this way we intend to approximately express the influence of diffusivity effect and further to improve the accuracy in the analytical expression of transient sy with the approach of using a k θ z to approximate the effect of diffusive flux term z k θ h z in eq 3 we substitute the term of a k θ z into the highly non linear eq 3 i e one dimensional full richards equation to obtain 15 θ t z k θ h θ z k θ z a k θ z k θ z 1 a k θ z eq 15 can be converted into the following expression 16 z t 1 a θ s θ r k s e s e it can be seen that eq 16 has the similar form as eq 5 thus with the similar approach of deriving eqs 12 14 we can re derive the improved analytical expression of transient sy that could both consider the gravity effect and diffusivity effect as follows 17 s y g d t θ s θ r δ d d 1 s e d 1 s e g s 1 s e d 1 n n 1 1 1 n 1 s e g s n n 1 1 1 n α 1 a k s e v k s e g s t δ d θ s θ r 1 s e v the analytical expression of sy g t eq 12 only considers the gravity effect while the sy gd t eq 17 further includes the diffusivity effects note that the two treatments have the same expression of ultimate sy corresponding to eq 13 for the same water table change however the final time td gd when the sy gd t reaches its ultimate value is quite different with the td g in the aforementioned situation expressed as 18 t d g d θ s θ r δ d 1 a k s s e v l 1 1 1 s e v n n 1 1 1 n l 1 1 s e v n n 1 1 1 n 2 s e v s e v n n 1 1 1 n eq 18 introduces one more parameter a than eq 14 it implies that the larger parameter a results in the larger td and the slower drainage process 3 verification and discussions 3 1 performance of the sy g equations in order to present the applicable range of the sy expression based on the b c model nachabe 2002 and mvg model this study two types of soil fine sand and fine sandy loam that used in nachabe 2002 were also adopted here the soil hydraulic parameters for different swr models are provided in table 1 here two cases of wtd change i e increasing instantaneously from 60 cm to 90 cm and from 25 cm to 65 cm were presented in the comparison case meanwhile hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 was used to numerically solve the richards equation eq 3 and to further obtain the values of transient sy the transient sy at time t can be calculated by 19 s y t i 1 k θ initial i θ t i d z i δ d where θ initial i and θ t i are the water content of ith soil compartment at initial time and time t in hydrus 1d model respectively dzi is the thickness of the ith soil compartment and k is the total number of soil compartments above the final water table the sy values calculated by the numerical approach can be approximated as the real values of transient sy and noted as sy num t the variation of sy t calculated by the numerical approach and analytical expressions i e eq 12 in this study and nachabe s equation are presented in fig 3 results indicated that the curves of these two sy g t expressions had a similar trend with the variation of sy num t fig 3a and 3b but the sy g t expression of nachabe s equation was unable to characterize the sy g t when the initial wtd was less than the air entry pressure fig 3c and 3d compared with nachabe s equation eq 12 in this study was still valid when the wtd was less than the air entry pressure head thus the weakness of existing expressions in the near saturated segment was overcome and the applicable range of transient sy was thus expanded in addition there was a great difference between the curves of sy g t both for eq 12 and nachabe s equation and the corresponding real values of sy num t fig 3 it can be seen that the curves of sy g t showed larger values of transient sy in drainage process and were much faster to reach the ultimate values this was highly related to the sy g t expressions eq 12 and nachabe s equation that only considered the gravity effect thus it was crucial to both consider the gravity and diffusivity effects to improve the accuracy of transient sy 3 2 performance of the sy gd equations the test cases that covered all of soil types under the usda soil classification system and different changes in water table were conducted to further test the accuracy of the proposed analytical expression of sy gd t i e eq 17 and to obtain the appropriate a values for different conditions the twelve major soil textural groups reported by carsel and parrish 1988 were adopted in the test the detailed soil hydraulic parameters of different swr models are provided in table 1 an effective best fitting approach was adopted to estimate the value of a a was assumed to be increased in a step of 0 001 with the known value space a 0 1 the a value that corresponded to the smallest value of root mean square error rmse calculated from analytical values and real values of sy was considered as the appropriate value for each test case four different changes in wtd i e increasing instantaneously from 20 cm to 40 cm from 40 cm to 80 cm from 120 cm to 160 cm and from 60 cm to 140 cm were taken as examples to present the variation of transient sy the fourth one represented the situation where the water table dropped significantly the variation of sy t of four soil types i e sand loamy sand silt loam and sandy clay calculated by analytical expressions and numerical approach are selected and presented in figs 4 7 results indicated that the sy gd t curves were much closer to the sy num t curves than sy g t curves showing a better approximation to real values than sy g t curves for most of the soils after the use of a best fitting a value meanwhile for the sand soil and loamy sand soil the calculated sy g t values by eq 12 could be approximate to the real sy num t ones figs 4 and 5 this was due to that these two soils had relatively coarse texture and large ks the gravity flux terms was dominant during drainage in addition results showed that the eq 12 preformed a little better for significant water table drawdowns than small water table changes however for the silt loam and sandy clay the eq 12 obviously failed to describe the sy t variations figs 6 and 7 the sy g t curves deviated from the true sy num t curves being much faster to reach the ultimate values especially for small wtd changes figs 6 and 7 fortunately the sy gd t values by eq 17 showed a very good fit with the real values i e sy num t for all situations when adopting appropriate a values figs 6 and 7 rmse 0 002 in above cases with twelve soils and different water table changes the calculated sy gd t matched very well with the real values of sy num t when using the best fitting a values meanwhile the appropriate a values for all cases are provided in fig 8 and fig s1 in appendix for a given initial wtd d 1 the a value gradually decreased as the increase of final wtd d 2 figs 8 and s1 for example for d 1 20 cm the a value of silt loam soil decreased from 0 783 to 0 309 when d 2 changed from 40 cm to 80 cm fig 8c this was because the gravity effect became more significant when water table changing more sharply besides the value range of a was smaller for relatively coarse textured soils e g sand soil and loamy sand soil fig 8 this was because the gravity effect on sy gd t was much stronger for relatively coarse textured soils than that for relatively fine textured soils during drainage in addition the estimated td by eq 18 i e td gd more approached to the real values figs 4 7 while td was underestimated by eq 14 i e td g for example in the test case of wtd changing from 20 cm to 40 cm for silt loam soil td gd reached to about 68 h with a 0 783 and the td g was only 15 h fig 6a moreover the plot contours for parameter a are drawn and provided in figs 8 and s1 the rmse was less than 0 0071 and r2 was greater than 0 953 of sy which could be convenient for users to determine the reasonable a values under different soil and wtd change conditions overall the introduction of parameter a was very meaningful to the practical engineering application of our proposed sy gd t expression 3 3 practicality and limitations the derivation of our improved expressions for sy considered both the gravity and diffusivity effects compared with previous expressions of transient sy the eq 17 effectively improved the calculation accuracy of sy t for most of soil types in addition the eqs 12 and 17 can be used to calculate sy when the wtd is less than the air entry pressure head and complemented the lack of description in near saturated segment this could expand the application range of analytical expression of transient sy in shallow groundwater environments the proposed expressions of transient sy are time dependent and can be effectively used in many shallow groundwater management issues e g estimation of groundwater recharge drainage evapotranspiration and water resource storage in addition although the form of expressions eqs 12 and 17 seems to be complicated its calculation could be is easily carried out with basic software e g microsoft excel and matlab the calculation accuracy and practicality should be acceptable enough in the practical applications especially from an engineering perspective however there were still some limitations in the transient expressions of sy in this paper only the condition of water table falling was concerned the hysteresis of the soil water retention curve suggested that the transient sy in drainage process should be different from that in the water table rising process therefore the transient sy is required to be further studied when water table is rising in addition the derivation of transient sy was carried out under the assumption of homogeneous soils and the sy for heterogeneous soils needed to be investigated in the follow up researches 4 conclusion this paper presented the development of new improved expressions of transient specific yield sy for shallow groundwater environments the improved expressions of transient sy only considered the gravity effect i e sy g t and involved the gravity and approximate diffusivity capillary effects i e sy gd t were derived based on the modified van genuchten model respectively the comparison case with two soil types showed that the improved expression of transient sy can be used to characterize sy even when the wtd was less than the air entry pressure head and thus complemented the lack of description of sy in near saturated segment in previous expressions approximate approach was proposed to further consider the diffusivity effect with introducing an empirical parameter a in the derivation of sy gd t the test cases with twelve soil types and different changes in water table indicated that the improved analytical expression of sy gd t can effectively improve the calculation accuracy for the transient sy for most of soil types compared with the expressions of transient sy derived with only considering the gravity effect moreover a reasonable value of the introduced empirical parameter a was discussed and recommended under different soil and wtd change conditions the plot contours for parameter a could provide effective reference values for practical engineering applications with our proposed sy gd t expression the analytical expression of ultimate sy and the time td required to reach the ultimate state were also given in eqs 13 and 18 respectively overall the improved expressions could significantly increase the applicability and calculation accuracy of transient sy for the shallow groundwater environments credit authorship contribution statement xue xiao conceptualization formal analysis writing original

4602,evapotranspiration et and its components of soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t as key variables for the water energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere are widely used in hydrological and agricultural applications the land surface temperature based two source energy balance tseb model can provide high accuracy e t and et which are spatio temporally discontinuous whereas the spatio temporally continuous daily et is more helpful in water resources management in this study to improve the continuity of estimates from the tseb model we developed a new combined model coupling the tseb model and deep neural network dnn tseb dnn first spatio temporally continuous reference data was prepared based on the remote sensing and meteorological data as input and e from soil and t from vegetation were obtained from the tseb model under clear sky condition as outputs then the dnn was trained under clear sky condition to obtain the relationship between e and t estimates from tseb and reference data finally the trained dnn was driven by the spatio temporally continuous reference data to obtain spatio temporally continuous e t and et compared with the et estimates from the original tseb model the continuity was significantly improved for the tseb dnn model the tseb dnn model was well consistent with the in situ measurements and had the overall correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias values of 0 88 0 88 mm d 1 and 0 37 mm d 1 respectively the ratio of t et estimates from the tseb dnn model had high accuracy against in situ measurements with rmse and bias values of 7 49 and 2 22 respectively the combined model and the maps of e t and et will help improve water resource management keywords evaporation and transpiration two source energy balance deep neural network water resources management remote sensing 1 introduction vegetation evapotranspiration et including soil evaporation e vegetation transpiration t and vegetation rainfall interception links the water energy cycle between the land surface and atmosphere and plays a key role in water resources management gash 1979 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 the vegetation rainfall interception only occurs during and a short period after rainfall and is always considered as an independent process cui et al 2017 martens et al 2017 the processes of e and t can occur together and are difficult to separate monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 however t along with carbon uptake contributes to photosynthesis wang and dickinson 2012 hence more and more applications need separated e and t such as water saving and irrigation management practices bastiaanssen et al 2012 song et al 2018 owing to the unique natural environment of cold arid regions coexist and mountain cryosphere the heihe river basin is characterized by glaciers alpine meadow and forest in the up stream by irrigated crops including maize wheat and vegetable in the mid stream and by riparian ecosystem and desert in the down stream hence it can serve as an ideal area for studying et of complex ecosystems in cold and arid regions meanwhile the heihe river basin was equipped with good research facilities and rich datasets including hydrological ecological atmospheric forcing variables vegetation soil parameters et observations from point to regional scales and many researches on inland river basins used it as a case study li et al 2013 2009 this gives a good foundation to validate the developed et model land surface temperature lst is a key parameter in remote sensing monitoring of the et total et could be estimated by a well developed single source model such as the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b and the surface temperature vegetation index ts vi model jiang and islam 1999 tang et al 2010 the et components could also be estimated by the two source energy balance model tseb norman et al 1995 which has a more reasonable physical mechanismconsidering the interaction between the land surface and atmosphere and provides a greater advantage separating the e and t than the single source model however the satellite based lst is not always available due to clouds and results in spatio temporally discontinuous e t and et song et al 2016 limiting the actual applications hence developing a spatio temporal reconstruction strategy is crucial to obtain continuous e t and et and support agricultural and hydrological applications reconstructing the lst is a possible way to obtain continuous daily et under all sky conditions however the accuracy is sensitive to the lst data as a key input of the tseb model where more than 2 k errors in lst will result in 30 uncertainty kustas et al 2012 another way is to use reference data such as assuming the ratio of actual et to reference et linearly changing under clear sky and cloudy sky conditions the reference data method is widely used in other water cycle elements reconstructions such as soil moisture and precipitation cui et al 2016 tao et al 2016 the major issue of this method is to obtain a reliable relationship between the predictors and the reference data the deep neural network ddn has shown good performance and can solve this issue as it has more layers and a stronger fitting ability than traditional neural networks bengio 2009 the dnn has been successfully applied in water cycle elements reconstruction for soil moisture and precipitation fang et al 2017 tao et al 2016 in this study our objective is to develop a combined et model named tseb dnn by coupling tseb and dnn to generate daily spatio temporally continuous et and its components the performance of tseb dnn model including et estimation and its components of e and t partitioning is evaluated using the ground measurements over different land covers such as grassland forest and cropland under variable environmental conditions in heihe river basin and the relative importance of input variables to the e and t estimates from tseb dnn was also analyzed 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the heihe river basin 96 5 102 5 e and 38 5 43 n with an arid and semi arid climate selected as the study area is the second largest inland river basin of china and has received a lot of interest by agricultural and hydrological research li et al 2013 2009 this study area can be partitioned into three distinct parts including the up stream with a semi arid climate covered by forest and grassland arid middle stream covered by crops in the oasis and the extremely arid down stream surrounded by a vast desert the precipitation ranges from about 400 mm yr 1 in the up stream decreasing to less than 100 mm yr 1 in the down stream 2 2 data table 1 lists remote sensing meteorological and ground data used in this study the spatio temporal resolution of these products was resampled interpolated and downscaled to 0 01 and 1 day the input data was selected based on the penman monteith et model monteith 1965 which clearly described the associated et variables our framework can be considered as a machine learning method based on causality which has abandoned the idea of using a large number of different types of input and let the machine learning automatically find relationships lacking physical explanations a detailed data description is given in the following sections 2 2 1 remote sensing data land surface products from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis were used in this study including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi 1 km 16 day albedo 500 m daily leaf area index lai 500 m 8 day land surface temperature lst 1 km daily land cover 1 km yearly and other products were downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https modis gsfc nasa gov these products were reprojected to 0 01 in wgs 84 geographic coordinate system using the modis reprojection tool the ndvi and lai product were reconstructed using the harmonic analysis of time series hants to obtain gap free variables and then temporal linear interpolation method was applied to obtain daily ndvi and lai jia et al 2011 the albedo product was reconstructed using temporal filter algorithms to obtain gap free variables liu et al 2013 european space agency esa essential climate variables ecv surface soil moisture sm version v04 7 was used to define the soil moisture stress the combined ecv sm spanning more than 40 years was obtained by merging data from about ten sensors using the triple collocation method liu et al 2011b the spatial resolution of the original ecv sm was downscaled from 0 25 to 0 01 the gap filling was done using the spatio temporal resolution improving algorithm based on multi source remote sensing data and a general regression neural network grnn model proposed by cui et al 2020a the ndvi land cover albedo and sm were used in this paper to obtain spatio temporally continuous e t and et maps as they were associated with the vegetation state vegetation type net radiation and soil wetness the lst and lai product were mainly used in the original tseb model as the key input parameter 2 2 2 meteorologicaldata the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd with a fine spatio temporal resolution of 0 1 and 3 h was selected as the meteorological data because of its high quality cmfd was obtained by merging the stations observations from china he et al 2020 the six variables selected in this study included wind speed air temperature specific humidity air pressure longwave radiation and shortwave radiation for each meteorological parameter 3 h data was averaged to daily for daily air temperature air pressure specific humidity air pressure longwave radiation and shortwave radiation the spatial resolution was downscaled from 0 1 to 0 01 using statistical downscaling approaches which is based on the semi empirical relationships and on the multiple referred variables such as topographic altitude aspect and slope and transfer functions hu and jia 2015 and the spatial resolution of wind speed improved to 0 01 using the bilinear interpolation method 2 2 3 ground data the accuracy of the total et estimates was validated using ground data from three eddy covariance sites from 2009 to 2011 one las site from 2012 to 2014 as well as the ratio of t et from stable sites during 2012 li et al 2013 2009 liu et al 2018 they include one grassland ec station arou 3 2 m and one forest ec station guantan 20 02 m in the upper reaches of the heihe river and one crop ec station yingke 2 81 m and one crop las station las in the middle stream of the heihe river liu et al 2011a all of these data can be downloaded from http data tpdc ac cn zh hans similarly ground data of the ratio of t et from isotopic technology in the middle stream of the heihe river daman covered by crop during may october in 2012 li et al 2017 wen et al 2016 were used to validate the accuracy of the e and t estimates all ground data were checked and averaged to a daily scale to match the estimates of the framework 3 methods the workflow for this study fig 2 includes four mainly steps 1 preparing spatio temporally continuous input variables 2 generating e and t estimates from the tseb model under clear sky conditions 3 building the tseb dnn model under all sky conditions using dataset from 1 and 2 4 generating spatio temporally continuous e and t using the tseb dnn model the core of the tseb dnn model is to build a linking model between the estimated e and t from the original tseb model and the input variables under clear sky conditions and then applying it for all sky conditions the tseb dnn model is described in detail as following 3 1 preparing spatio temporally continuous input variables there are 11 input variables for the developed tseb dnn model including remote sensing and meteorological data due to different sources the spatio temporal resolution of these datasets varies greatly from 3 h to 16 days and from 500 m to 25 km hence the spatio temporal resolution should be unified before the next step as a preprocess step detailed information of these algorithms were described in the section 2 following the corresponding data description finally we obtained spatio temporally continuous 11 input variables used in the following steps with spatio temporal resolution of 0 01 and 1 day 3 2 generating evaporation and transpiration estimates from the tseb model under clear sky conditions the daily et components of e and t in a clear day were estimated using the dual temperature difference dtd model which implements the tseb modeling scheme but using morning time differential lst and air temperature the original dtd model was revised for using the daytime and nighttime modis lst product to estimate the regional distribution of et guzinski et al 2013 here the modis based dtd model was run with the inputs of the modis lst and lai products and the meteorological forcing data including air temperature wind speed air pressure relative humidity among other parameters given the soil and canopy net radiation and sensible heat fluxes and soil heat flux were estimated and the latent heat fluxes for soil and canopy were calculated as the residual of the surface energy balance equation these instantaneous soil and canopy latent heat fluxes at the modis daily overpass time were upscaled to daily et using the diurnal self preservation of the evaporative fraction the details of the latent heat fluxes and daily e and t estimations can be found in song et al 2018 3 3 building tseb dnn model to generate continuous daily evaporation and transpiration under all sky conditions the dnn has more layers than the traditional neural networks bengio 2009 cui et al 2020b the main advantage of the dnn to other machine learning methods is that it can automatically extract complicated information from input therefore it is feasible to train a dnn on a large scale with multiple training datasets moreover it is not sensitive to outliers and demonstrates a good performance same as other machine learning methods the core idea of dnn is to establish the stable nonlinear function between input variables and output e and t based on the deeper layers at daily scale 1 e t f dnn n d v i a l b e d o w s a t r h a p d l r d s r l c s m d e m where e and t are from the original tseb model at the training stage f dnn is a nonlinear function between the input variables and the output e and t ws a t r h a p d l r d s r l c s m d e m denote the wind speed air temperature relative humidity air pressure downward longwave radiation downward shortwave radiation land cover soil moisture and digital elevation models respectively albedo and land cover represent the effect of land surface character ndvi represents the effect of vegetation sm represents the effect of soil wetness ws a t r h a p d l r d s r represents the effect of the atmosphere and dem represents the effect of terrain in dnn the predicted e and t are obtained by aggregating the prediction of individual neurons in the last layer the first important step is to build the structure of the dnn where the input layer depends on the number of input variables and the output layer depends on the objectives feature extraction ability of dnn increases with the increasing number of layers and neurons however the complexity of the dnn was limited by the number of coincident samples between inputs and outputs because a too deep structure has a high risk of overfitting due to the too many parameters and inadequate samples tang et al 2018 and two hidden layers can automatically extract more complicated information from inputs lippmann 1988 hence dnn with two deeper layers were adopted in this study the number of neurons is always an integral power of two to effectively use the gpu for accelerating calculations considering the size of training data of about 1 2 106 128 neurons were setted for the two hidden layers the crucial parameters in dnn models are learning rate activation function cost function and optimizer learning rate refers to the magnitude of updating the network weight in the dnn optimization and a linearly decreasing learning rate is always a good alternative the activation function added to some nonlinear factors can better solve more complex problems the cost function always root mean square error rmse measures the difference between the predicted and the actual results the optimizer is used to improve computational efficiency in practice we found that the trained and validated rmse had almost no change when the number of echoes is larger than 800 hence a four layer dnn 11 128 128 2 was adopted with a max number of echoes of 1000 linearly decreasing the learning rate of 0 9 times every 200 echoes with an initial value of 0 005 the cost function of rmse and optimizer of adam kingma and ba 2014 nair and hinton 2010 and the dnn was trained using the e and t estimates from section 3 1 and the tseb dnn et model was obtained the time of dnn training is generally within half hour i7 7700 k cpu 4 20 ghz nvidia geforce gtx 1080 gpu gddr5x 8 gb and e and t estimation based on the tseb dnn is very quick with almost negligible time cost 3 4 generating spatio temporally continuous evaporation and transpiration using the tseb dnn in the last step the built tseb dnn model was driven by all sky input variables including remote sensing and meteorological data to obtain spatio temporally continuous e and t and the common error metrics of r rmse and bias are calculated between predicted and in situ measured e t and et 4 results to comprehensively assess the tseb dnn at different spatio temporal scales we only use the e and t estimates from the original tseb during the day of the year doy 153 to 272 in 2012 as the training dataset and validate the performance of tseb dnn from 2009 to 2014 at the different land cover and climate condition zone using in situ measurements first we examined the consistency between the tseb dnn and the original tseb model then the overall performance of tseb dnn in the estimation of e t and et was displayed against the in situ measurements last the spatial and temporal pattern of the continuous e t and et estimates from tseb dnn were shown according to the previous studies the original tseb model can model e and t accurately and our previous studies over the heihe river basin showed that the tseb has a mean absolute percent differences mapd value about 15 25 hence in this study validation of tseb model is not shown more detail of the validation of the original tseb model the reader is kindly referred to song et al 2016 and song et al 2018 4 1 performance of tseb dnn against original tseb models the e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model and the original tseb model were compared which is helpful to understand the similarity and difference of them fig 3 the r and rmse between e t and et estimates from two models were examined the overall r and rmse of et estimates from the tseb dnn model are 0 92 and 0 56 mm d 1 respectively showing high consistency of the two models under clear sky condition fig 3 a b for detail the r for t is larger than 0 95 for most parts and higher than the e of 0 7 fig 3 c e and the overall rmse of e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model are 0 54 mm d 1 and 0 13 mm d 1 respectively fig 3 d f these indicated that the tseb dnn is more reliable in predicting t than predicting e under different land cover types and variable environmental conditions in the middle and down streams of the heihe river basin the tseb dnn model showed higher consistence against the up streams where the complexity of terrain and environmental conditions always results in more complex water heat flux exchange between the soil vegetation atmosphere overall the tseb dnn model can provide the similar quality and continuous et and its components against the original tseb model 4 2 validation of total evapotranspiration against ec and las observations the total modeled et summing soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t was first validated under different land covers with ec and las observations to evaluate the performance of the tseb dnn model fig 4 compared the et estimates from the tseb dnn model for grassland arou site forest guantan site and crop yingke site with ec and las site with las overall r rmse and bias were 0 88 0 88 mm d 1 and 0 37 mm d 1 respectively the tseb dnn model has the best performance for grassland with the highest r value of 0 93 and the lowest rmse value of 0 64 mm d 1 fig 4 a the performance of the crop was the second fig 4 b which had a strong human nature interaction with frequent irrigation another interesting finding was that the tseb dnn model performed better for the daman crop site las than the yingke crop site with a lower rmse value of 0 65 mm d 1 and a slope of 1 08 fig 4 c d this is because las has a much larger footprint of about several kilometers while the ec at yingke site always has a footprint of several hundred meters this indicated that the matched source area between satellite pixel and the footprint of observation instruments is also very important for et evaluation the forest site had the worst performance because of the uneven land surface and complex water and heat distribution in the forest due to the tall canopies of the trees another larger uncertainty for forest is the rainfall interception cui et al 2015 1 the forest rainfall interception is very important to the total et about 8 40 of annual gross rainfall according to the previous studies 2 the tseb dnn model underestimated the total et e t interception for the interception was replaced by the calculated et using tseb dnn model when the rainfall occurs and it is always higher than calculated et under the same net radiation due to the high evaporation efficiency of intercepted rainfall 3 the measured et is lower than the total et e t interception for that the open path ec cannot observe forest rainfall interception and the observations during rainfall are always removed fig 5 shows the time series of total et estimates from the tseb dnn model against in situ measurements tseb dnn captured well the et temporal variation for grassland the uncertainty is small for the entire year fig 5 a however a large underestimation of et was observed in the forest site fig 5 b especially in summer suggesting room for improvement of the tseb dnn model for tall vegetation for the crop several increases in et during spring were not captured fig 5 c d because our training data were from doy between 152 and 271 in summary this study suggests that the tseb dnn model can provide acceptable total et 4 3 validation of evapotranspiration components against in situ measurements to further evaluate the performance of tseb dnn in modeling the et components the spatio temporally continuous e and t from the tseb dnn model were examined at the daman site in this study we compared the ratio of t et due to the higher accuracy in measuring t et than absolute e and t song et al 2016 wen et al 2016 the r rmse and bias of the t et estimate from the tseb dnn model were 0 54 7 49 and 2 22 respectively fig 6 the ratio of t et has a strong positive relationship with ndvi r 0 98 showing controlling impact of ndvi on t et where the ratio of t et is increasing sharply with ndvi increasing before the peak of ndvi and decreasing sharply with ndvi after the peak this was consistent with previous studies e g zhou et al 2016 found the strong positive relationship between enhanced vegetation index evi and t et for corn r 0 84 it was lower in spring and higher in summer and the small variation over a short time might be due to changes in soil and atmospheric parameters overall there was a better performance of the tseb dnn model in modeling e t and et laying a foundation for measuring spatial and temporal pattern at the basin scale 4 4 spatial and temporal patterns of evapotranspiration the spatial pattern of data coverage ratio of the number of days having valid et value against the total days in a period of et estimates from tseb dnn and tseb models was shown in fig 7 averaged data coverage of et estimates from tseb dnn was improved from 39 2 to 97 4 during the growing season for doy between 153 and 272 beyond our expectation the data coverage of et estimates from tseb dnn for the middle stream with arid climate is much lower than the upper stream with a semi arid climate of the original tseb model most likely the unstable atmosphere due to strong local water energy interaction between the artificial oasis and the surrounding desert in the middle stream made the thermal infrared observation invalid the spatial and temporal patterns of the e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model can give more information about this model accuracy maps of e and t estimates from tseb dnn and the original tseb modes for 01 06 02 07 01 08 01 09 and 28 09 over the study area are displayed in fig 8 the e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model were consistent with those from the original tseb model in spatial and temporal patterns and the values were within the range however the e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model are continuous compared with the original tseb model the e and t had different spatial distributions where e from soil was higher while t from vegetation was lower t in the southwest of the study area due to low vegetation coverage however the situation was the opposite in most of the remaining sites the extreme t was found in the middle stream of the river basin due to frequent irrigation resulting in high vegetation coverage fig 8 another interesting finding was that e had a lower temporal variation than t for the different seasons the total et of the heihe river basin was about 1 77 10 15 kg per year where approximately 15 29 7 05 52 87 and 22 26 were from forest shrub grass and crop respectively fig 9 a all et from the vegetation covered area had a significant temporal variation with a lower value in winter and higher value in summer grassland played the most important role in the regional water cycle indicating that grassland has an irreplaceable role in semi arid and arid areas over the irrigated area human activities had large contribution to the regional water cycle through irrigation considering its low precipitation of about 100 mm yr 1 the ratio of t et estimates from the tseb dnn model for the different land covers in fig 9 b show a clear temporal variation although march had the lowest t et in disagreement with the temporal variation of et the ratio of t et fluctuates among different vegetation types and increases from grass to shrub to forest which is consistent with the previous studies hu et al 2018 crop had the most significant water use efficiency where about 50 et was through vegetation transpiration and grassland had the lowest water use efficiency for grass the range of monthly t et was from 5 to 45 consisting with the previous results in a semi arid area of inner mongolia china hu et al 2009 the ratio of t et of these four types of vegetation had strong positive relationship with ndvi with r larger than 0 95 during growing season 5 discussions 5 1 importance of input variables the normalized rmse was calculated to understand the importance of input variables on the performance of the tseb dnn for generating spatio temporally continuous et in the dnn training predicting processes the rmse between the et estimates from the tseb dnn model when one variable is not included against when all variables are included can indicate the importance of this variable all rmse of the 11 input variables were normalized to express the significance at the same level the normalized rmse is shown in fig 10 the downward shortwave radiation plays the most significant role 26 52 due to its controlling effect on the et energy exchange as the commonly used variable to estimate the et the downward longwave radiation 10 95 dem 10 00 albedo 8 96 air temperature 8 35 and ndvi 7 84 relative humidity 7 05 land cover 5 63 air pressure 5 51 soil moisture 4 7 and wind 4 69 also show relatively high importance due to their strong ability in reflecting the water energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere fisher et al 2008 jia et al 2003 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2007 su 2002 tang et al 2010 the surface soil moisture showed lower importance due to the high t et for the vegetation area suggesting surface soil moisture has a limited controlling effect on the total et fig 10 the lowest importance of wind can help the model run at a stable level although until now the wind product has a larger uncertainty hu and jia 2015 5 2 comparison with similar studies overall the proposed tseb dnn model can obtain spatio temporally continuous et under all sky conditions there are mainly three types of et models that can be used under all sky conditions 1 time scale extension of the lst based et model for example jiang et al 2009 proposed an evaporation fraction interpolation method to obtain et under clear sky and cloudy sky conditions based on the contextual relationship between remotely sensed surface temperature and vegetation index they reported r rmse and bias of all day estimates of 0 606 1 209 mm d 1 and 0 513 mm d 1 over south florida 2 process based et model for example wang et al 2019 proposed a three source satellite algorithm for retrieving the evapotranspiration rate under all sky conditions using a combined optical and microwave vegetation index at twenty asia flux sites they reported r rmse and bias of 0 748 0 89 mm d 1 and 0 16 mm d 1 respectively the mod 16 products are also process based et models mu et al 2007 the reported r and rmse over the heihe river basin were 0 761 and 1 09 mm d 1 respectively hu and jia 2015 3 data assimilation method for example miralles et al 2011 proposed the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam et model with a core of priestley taylor p t equation and data assimilation of microwave soil moisture to maximize the incorporation of satellite observations and produce temporally spatially continuous terrestrial et at daily scales the reported r rmse and bias of gleam are 0 748 0 88 mm d 1 0 38 mm d 1 respectively over asia wang et al 2019 the et estimates of our tseb dnn model on the daily scale under all sky conditions are overall comparable with their results fig 4 for t et hu et al 2018 reviewed that the t et fluctuates among different land cover and normally increases from grass to shrub to trees based on the previous studies for the grass in semi arid area of china the monthly t et is normally lower than 50 and has strong seasonal variation zhou et al 2016 different vegetation index was used to investigate the relationship between vegetation and t et at point scale finding the strong positive between the ndvi evi lai and t et hu et al 2018 2009 wei et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 our results were consistent with these findings 5 3 advantages and limitations of this study the dnn model combined with the tseb model was successfully applied in this study to generate the spatio temporally continuous e t and et the et estimates from the tseb dnn model can reflect the spatio temporal variability against the in situ measurements especially for grass and crop however the performance of tseb dnn indicates that there is still a lot of room for improvement for the original tseb model in the forest including the model configuration field observation and validation strategy the generated e t and et maps in this study would enhance the application of water resources management and agricultural development at the regional scale the performance of the tseb dnn model was evaluated and analyzed only for the arid and semi arid area its evaluation for other climatic regions e g humid and semi humid area will be performed in the future 6 conclusions combining the tseb and dnn models the spatio temporally continuous e t and et with 0 01 resolution was generated by integrating the remote sensing data and meteorological data compared with in situ measurements the spatio temporally continuous total et and t e estimates from tseb dnn effectively reflect these parameters for the study region the r rmse and bias between the estimated et from the tseb dnn model and the in situ measurements ranges from 0 87 to 0 93 from 0 64 mm d 1 to 1 43 mm d 1 and from 0 01 mm d 1 to 1 38 mm d 1 for grass forest and crop respectively the tseb dnn model showed better performance for shorter vegetation grass and crop than tall vegetation forest the et estimates from the tseb dnn model is highly consistent with the et estimates from the original tseb model and can reflect the temporal variation of in situ measurements at different land cover sites the t et estimates from the tseb dnn model have high accuracy with rmse and bias of 7 49 and 2 22 respectively indicating the strong ability to obtain spatio temporally continuous et components these results showed the significant advantages of combining the tseb and dnn models providing effective information on spatio temporal variations in et in summary this study successfully generates spatio temporal continuous daily e t and et at the heihe river basin meeting the need for better water resources management practices developing spatio temporally continuous daily et and its components at field scales e g 30 m 30 m will be discussed in the future

4602,evapotranspiration et and its components of soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t as key variables for the water energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere are widely used in hydrological and agricultural applications the land surface temperature based two source energy balance tseb model can provide high accuracy e t and et which are spatio temporally discontinuous whereas the spatio temporally continuous daily et is more helpful in water resources management in this study to improve the continuity of estimates from the tseb model we developed a new combined model coupling the tseb model and deep neural network dnn tseb dnn first spatio temporally continuous reference data was prepared based on the remote sensing and meteorological data as input and e from soil and t from vegetation were obtained from the tseb model under clear sky condition as outputs then the dnn was trained under clear sky condition to obtain the relationship between e and t estimates from tseb and reference data finally the trained dnn was driven by the spatio temporally continuous reference data to obtain spatio temporally continuous e t and et compared with the et estimates from the original tseb model the continuity was significantly improved for the tseb dnn model the tseb dnn model was well consistent with the in situ measurements and had the overall correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias values of 0 88 0 88 mm d 1 and 0 37 mm d 1 respectively the ratio of t et estimates from the tseb dnn model had high accuracy against in situ measurements with rmse and bias values of 7 49 and 2 22 respectively the combined model and the maps of e t and et will help improve water resource management keywords evaporation and transpiration two source energy balance deep neural network water resources management remote sensing 1 introduction vegetation evapotranspiration et including soil evaporation e vegetation transpiration t and vegetation rainfall interception links the water energy cycle between the land surface and atmosphere and plays a key role in water resources management gash 1979 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 the vegetation rainfall interception only occurs during and a short period after rainfall and is always considered as an independent process cui et al 2017 martens et al 2017 the processes of e and t can occur together and are difficult to separate monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 however t along with carbon uptake contributes to photosynthesis wang and dickinson 2012 hence more and more applications need separated e and t such as water saving and irrigation management practices bastiaanssen et al 2012 song et al 2018 owing to the unique natural environment of cold arid regions coexist and mountain cryosphere the heihe river basin is characterized by glaciers alpine meadow and forest in the up stream by irrigated crops including maize wheat and vegetable in the mid stream and by riparian ecosystem and desert in the down stream hence it can serve as an ideal area for studying et of complex ecosystems in cold and arid regions meanwhile the heihe river basin was equipped with good research facilities and rich datasets including hydrological ecological atmospheric forcing variables vegetation soil parameters et observations from point to regional scales and many researches on inland river basins used it as a case study li et al 2013 2009 this gives a good foundation to validate the developed et model land surface temperature lst is a key parameter in remote sensing monitoring of the et total et could be estimated by a well developed single source model such as the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b and the surface temperature vegetation index ts vi model jiang and islam 1999 tang et al 2010 the et components could also be estimated by the two source energy balance model tseb norman et al 1995 which has a more reasonable physical mechanismconsidering the interaction between the land surface and atmosphere and provides a greater advantage separating the e and t than the single source model however the satellite based lst is not always available due to clouds and results in spatio temporally discontinuous e t and et song et al 2016 limiting the actual applications hence developing a spatio temporal reconstruction strategy is crucial to obtain continuous e t and et and support agricultural and hydrological applications reconstructing the lst is a possible way to obtain continuous daily et under all sky conditions however the accuracy is sensitive to the lst data as a key input of the tseb model where more than 2 k errors in lst will result in 30 uncertainty kustas et al 2012 another way is to use reference data such as assuming the ratio of actual et to reference et linearly changing under clear sky and cloudy sky conditions the reference data method is widely used in other water cycle elements reconstructions such as soil moisture and precipitation cui et al 2016 tao et al 2016 the major issue of this method is to obtain a reliable relationship between the predictors and the reference data the deep neural network ddn has shown good performance and can solve this issue as it has more layers and a stronger fitting ability than traditional neural networks bengio 2009 the dnn has been successfully applied in water cycle elements reconstruction for soil moisture and precipitation fang et al 2017 tao et al 2016 in this study our objective is to develop a combined et model named tseb dnn by coupling tseb and dnn to generate daily spatio temporally continuous et and its components the performance of tseb dnn model including et estimation and its components of e and t partitioning is evaluated using the ground measurements over different land covers such as grassland forest and cropland under variable environmental conditions in heihe river basin and the relative importance of input variables to the e and t estimates from tseb dnn was also analyzed 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the heihe river basin 96 5 102 5 e and 38 5 43 n with an arid and semi arid climate selected as the study area is the second largest inland river basin of china and has received a lot of interest by agricultural and hydrological research li et al 2013 2009 this study area can be partitioned into three distinct parts including the up stream with a semi arid climate covered by forest and grassland arid middle stream covered by crops in the oasis and the extremely arid down stream surrounded by a vast desert the precipitation ranges from about 400 mm yr 1 in the up stream decreasing to less than 100 mm yr 1 in the down stream 2 2 data table 1 lists remote sensing meteorological and ground data used in this study the spatio temporal resolution of these products was resampled interpolated and downscaled to 0 01 and 1 day the input data was selected based on the penman monteith et model monteith 1965 which clearly described the associated et variables our framework can be considered as a machine learning method based on causality which has abandoned the idea of using a large number of different types of input and let the machine learning automatically find relationships lacking physical explanations a detailed data description is given in the following sections 2 2 1 remote sensing data land surface products from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis were used in this study including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi 1 km 16 day albedo 500 m daily leaf area index lai 500 m 8 day land surface temperature lst 1 km daily land cover 1 km yearly and other products were downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https modis gsfc nasa gov these products were reprojected to 0 01 in wgs 84 geographic coordinate system using the modis reprojection tool the ndvi and lai product were reconstructed using the harmonic analysis of time series hants to obtain gap free variables and then temporal linear interpolation method was applied to obtain daily ndvi and lai jia et al 2011 the albedo product was reconstructed using temporal filter algorithms to obtain gap free variables liu et al 2013 european space agency esa essential climate variables ecv surface soil moisture sm version v04 7 was used to define the soil moisture stress the combined ecv sm spanning more than 40 years was obtained by merging data from about ten sensors using the triple collocation method liu et al 2011b the spatial resolution of the original ecv sm was downscaled from 0 25 to 0 01 the gap filling was done using the spatio temporal resolution improving algorithm based on multi source remote sensing data and a general regression neural network grnn model proposed by cui et al 2020a the ndvi land cover albedo and sm were used in this paper to obtain spatio temporally continuous e t and et maps as they were associated with the vegetation state vegetation type net radiation and soil wetness the lst and lai product were mainly used in the original tseb model as the key input parameter 2 2 2 meteorologicaldata the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd with a fine spatio temporal resolution of 0 1 and 3 h was selected as the meteorological data because of its high quality cmfd was obtained by merging the stations observations from china he et al 2020 the six variables selected in this study included wind speed air temperature specific humidity air pressure longwave radiation and shortwave radiation for each meteorological parameter 3 h data was averaged to daily for daily air temperature air pressure specific humidity air pressure longwave radiation and shortwave radiation the spatial resolution was downscaled from 0 1 to 0 01 using statistical downscaling approaches which is based on the semi empirical relationships and on the multiple referred variables such as topographic altitude aspect and slope and transfer functions hu and jia 2015 and the spatial resolution of wind speed improved to 0 01 using the bilinear interpolation method 2 2 3 ground data the accuracy of the total et estimates was validated using ground data from three eddy covariance sites from 2009 to 2011 one las site from 2012 to 2014 as well as the ratio of t et from stable sites during 2012 li et al 2013 2009 liu et al 2018 they include one grassland ec station arou 3 2 m and one forest ec station guantan 20 02 m in the upper reaches of the heihe river and one crop ec station yingke 2 81 m and one crop las station las in the middle stream of the heihe river liu et al 2011a all of these data can be downloaded from http data tpdc ac cn zh hans similarly ground data of the ratio of t et from isotopic technology in the middle stream of the heihe river daman covered by crop during may october in 2012 li et al 2017 wen et al 2016 were used to validate the accuracy of the e and t estimates all ground data were checked and averaged to a daily scale to match the estimates of the framework 3 methods the workflow for this study fig 2 includes four mainly steps 1 preparing spatio temporally continuous input variables 2 generating e and t estimates from the tseb model under clear sky conditions 3 building the tseb dnn model under all sky conditions using dataset from 1 and 2 4 generating spatio temporally continuous e and t using the tseb dnn model the core of the tseb dnn model is to build a linking model between the estimated e and t from the original tseb model and the input variables under clear sky conditions and then applying it for all sky conditions the tseb dnn model is described in detail as following 3 1 preparing spatio temporally continuous input variables there are 11 input variables for the developed tseb dnn model including remote sensing and meteorological data due to different sources the spatio temporal resolution of these datasets varies greatly from 3 h to 16 days and from 500 m to 25 km hence the spatio temporal resolution should be unified before the next step as a preprocess step detailed information of these algorithms were described in the section 2 following the corresponding data description finally we obtained spatio temporally continuous 11 input variables used in the following steps with spatio temporal resolution of 0 01 and 1 day 3 2 generating evaporation and transpiration estimates from the tseb model under clear sky conditions the daily et components of e and t in a clear day were estimated using the dual temperature difference dtd model which implements the tseb modeling scheme but using morning time differential lst and air temperature the original dtd model was revised for using the daytime and nighttime modis lst product to estimate the regional distribution of et guzinski et al 2013 here the modis based dtd model was run with the inputs of the modis lst and lai products and the meteorological forcing data including air temperature wind speed air pressure relative humidity among other parameters given the soil and canopy net radiation and sensible heat fluxes and soil heat flux were estimated and the latent heat fluxes for soil and canopy were calculated as the residual of the surface energy balance equation these instantaneous soil and canopy latent heat fluxes at the modis daily overpass time were upscaled to daily et using the diurnal self preservation of the evaporative fraction the details of the latent heat fluxes and daily e and t estimations can be found in song et al 2018 3 3 building tseb dnn model to generate continuous daily evaporation and transpiration under all sky conditions the dnn has more layers than the traditional neural networks bengio 2009 cui et al 2020b the main advantage of the dnn to other machine learning methods is that it can automatically extract complicated information from input therefore it is feasible to train a dnn on a large scale with multiple training datasets moreover it is not sensitive to outliers and demonstrates a good performance same as other machine learning methods the core idea of dnn is to establish the stable nonlinear function between input variables and output e and t based on the deeper layers at daily scale 1 e t f dnn n d v i a l b e d o w s a t r h a p d l r d s r l c s m d e m where e and t are from the original tseb model at the training stage f dnn is a nonlinear function between the input variables and the output e and t ws a t r h a p d l r d s r l c s m d e m denote the wind speed air temperature relative humidity air pressure downward longwave radiation downward shortwave radiation land cover soil moisture and digital elevation models respectively albedo and land cover represent the effect of land surface character ndvi represents the effect of vegetation sm represents the effect of soil wetness ws a t r h a p d l r d s r represents the effect of the atmosphere and dem represents the effect of terrain in dnn the predicted e and t are obtained by aggregating the prediction of individual neurons in the last layer the first important step is to build the structure of the dnn where the input layer depends on the number of input variables and the output layer depends on the objectives feature extraction ability of dnn increases with the increasing number of layers and neurons however the complexity of the dnn was limited by the number of coincident samples between inputs and outputs because a too deep structure has a high risk of overfitting due to the too many parameters and inadequate samples tang et al 2018 and two hidden layers can automatically extract more complicated information from inputs lippmann 1988 hence dnn with two deeper layers were adopted in this study the number of neurons is always an integral power of two to effectively use the gpu for accelerating calculations considering the size of training data of about 1 2 106 128 neurons were setted for the two hidden layers the crucial parameters in dnn models are learning rate activation function cost function and optimizer learning rate refers to the magnitude of updating the network weight in the dnn optimization and a linearly decreasing learning rate is always a good alternative the activation function added to some nonlinear factors can better solve more complex problems the cost function always root mean square error rmse measures the difference between the predicted and the actual results the optimizer is used to improve computational efficiency in practice we found that the trained and validated rmse had almost no change when the number of echoes is larger than 800 hence a four layer dnn 11 128 128 2 was adopted with a max number of echoes of 1000 linearly decreasing the learning rate of 0 9 times every 200 echoes with an initial value of 0 005 the cost function of rmse and optimizer of adam kingma and ba 2014 nair and hinton 2010 and the dnn was trained using the e and t estimates from section 3 1 and the tseb dnn et model was obtained the time of dnn training is generally within half hour i7 7700 k cpu 4 20 ghz nvidia geforce gtx 1080 gpu gddr5x 8 gb and e and t estimation based on the tseb dnn is very quick with almost negligible time cost 3 4 generating spatio temporally continuous evaporation and transpiration using the tseb dnn in the last step the built tseb dnn model was driven by all sky input variables including remote sensing and meteorological data to obtain spatio temporally continuous e and t and the common error metrics of r rmse and bias are calculated between predicted and in situ measured e t and et 4 results to comprehensively assess the tseb dnn at different spatio temporal scales we only use the e and t estimates from the original tseb during the day of the year doy 153 to 272 in 2012 as the training dataset and validate the performance of tseb dnn from 2009 to 2014 at the different land cover and climate condition zone using in situ measurements first we examined the consistency between the tseb dnn and the original tseb model then the overall performance of tseb dnn in the estimation of e t and et was displayed against the in situ measurements last the spatial and temporal pattern of the continuous e t and et estimates from tseb dnn were shown according to the previous studies the original tseb model can model e and t accurately and our previous studies over the heihe river basin showed that the tseb has a mean absolute percent differences mapd value about 15 25 hence in this study validation of tseb model is not shown more detail of the validation of the original tseb model the reader is kindly referred to song et al 2016 and song et al 2018 4 1 performance of tseb dnn against original tseb models the e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model and the original tseb model were compared which is helpful to understand the similarity and difference of them fig 3 the r and rmse between e t and et estimates from two models were examined the overall r and rmse of et estimates from the tseb dnn model are 0 92 and 0 56 mm d 1 respectively showing high consistency of the two models under clear sky condition fig 3 a b for detail the r for t is larger than 0 95 for most parts and higher than the e of 0 7 fig 3 c e and the overall rmse of e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model are 0 54 mm d 1 and 0 13 mm d 1 respectively fig 3 d f these indicated that the tseb dnn is more reliable in predicting t than predicting e under different land cover types and variable environmental conditions in the middle and down streams of the heihe river basin the tseb dnn model showed higher consistence against the up streams where the complexity of terrain and environmental conditions always results in more complex water heat flux exchange between the soil vegetation atmosphere overall the tseb dnn model can provide the similar quality and continuous et and its components against the original tseb model 4 2 validation of total evapotranspiration against ec and las observations the total modeled et summing soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t was first validated under different land covers with ec and las observations to evaluate the performance of the tseb dnn model fig 4 compared the et estimates from the tseb dnn model for grassland arou site forest guantan site and crop yingke site with ec and las site with las overall r rmse and bias were 0 88 0 88 mm d 1 and 0 37 mm d 1 respectively the tseb dnn model has the best performance for grassland with the highest r value of 0 93 and the lowest rmse value of 0 64 mm d 1 fig 4 a the performance of the crop was the second fig 4 b which had a strong human nature interaction with frequent irrigation another interesting finding was that the tseb dnn model performed better for the daman crop site las than the yingke crop site with a lower rmse value of 0 65 mm d 1 and a slope of 1 08 fig 4 c d this is because las has a much larger footprint of about several kilometers while the ec at yingke site always has a footprint of several hundred meters this indicated that the matched source area between satellite pixel and the footprint of observation instruments is also very important for et evaluation the forest site had the worst performance because of the uneven land surface and complex water and heat distribution in the forest due to the tall canopies of the trees another larger uncertainty for forest is the rainfall interception cui et al 2015 1 the forest rainfall interception is very important to the total et about 8 40 of annual gross rainfall according to the previous studies 2 the tseb dnn model underestimated the total et e t interception for the interception was replaced by the calculated et using tseb dnn model when the rainfall occurs and it is always higher than calculated et under the same net radiation due to the high evaporation efficiency of intercepted rainfall 3 the measured et is lower than the total et e t interception for that the open path ec cannot observe forest rainfall interception and the observations during rainfall are always removed fig 5 shows the time series of total et estimates from the tseb dnn model against in situ measurements tseb dnn captured well the et temporal variation for grassland the uncertainty is small for the entire year fig 5 a however a large underestimation of et was observed in the forest site fig 5 b especially in summer suggesting room for improvement of the tseb dnn model for tall vegetation for the crop several increases in et during spring were not captured fig 5 c d because our training data were from doy between 152 and 271 in summary this study suggests that the tseb dnn model can provide acceptable total et 4 3 validation of evapotranspiration components against in situ measurements to further evaluate the performance of tseb dnn in modeling the et components the spatio temporally continuous e and t from the tseb dnn model were examined at the daman site in this study we compared the ratio of t et due to the higher accuracy in measuring t et than absolute e and t song et al 2016 wen et al 2016 the r rmse and bias of the t et estimate from the tseb dnn model were 0 54 7 49 and 2 22 respectively fig 6 the ratio of t et has a strong positive relationship with ndvi r 0 98 showing controlling impact of ndvi on t et where the ratio of t et is increasing sharply with ndvi increasing before the peak of ndvi and decreasing sharply with ndvi after the peak this was consistent with previous studies e g zhou et al 2016 found the strong positive relationship between enhanced vegetation index evi and t et for corn r 0 84 it was lower in spring and higher in summer and the small variation over a short time might be due to changes in soil and atmospheric parameters overall there was a better performance of the tseb dnn model in modeling e t and et laying a foundation for measuring spatial and temporal pattern at the basin scale 4 4 spatial and temporal patterns of evapotranspiration the spatial pattern of data coverage ratio of the number of days having valid et value against the total days in a period of et estimates from tseb dnn and tseb models was shown in fig 7 averaged data coverage of et estimates from tseb dnn was improved from 39 2 to 97 4 during the growing season for doy between 153 and 272 beyond our expectation the data coverage of et estimates from tseb dnn for the middle stream with arid climate is much lower than the upper stream with a semi arid climate of the original tseb model most likely the unstable atmosphere due to strong local water energy interaction between the artificial oasis and the surrounding desert in the middle stream made the thermal infrared observation invalid the spatial and temporal patterns of the e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model can give more information about this model accuracy maps of e and t estimates from tseb dnn and the original tseb modes for 01 06 02 07 01 08 01 09 and 28 09 over the study area are displayed in fig 8 the e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model were consistent with those from the original tseb model in spatial and temporal patterns and the values were within the range however the e and t estimates from the tseb dnn model are continuous compared with the original tseb model the e and t had different spatial distributions where e from soil was higher while t from vegetation was lower t in the southwest of the study area due to low vegetation coverage however the situation was the opposite in most of the remaining sites the extreme t was found in the middle stream of the river basin due to frequent irrigation resulting in high vegetation coverage fig 8 another interesting finding was that e had a lower temporal variation than t for the different seasons the total et of the heihe river basin was about 1 77 10 15 kg per year where approximately 15 29 7 05 52 87 and 22 26 were from forest shrub grass and crop respectively fig 9 a all et from the vegetation covered area had a significant temporal variation with a lower value in winter and higher value in summer grassland played the most important role in the regional water cycle indicating that grassland has an irreplaceable role in semi arid and arid areas over the irrigated area human activities had large contribution to the regional water cycle through irrigation considering its low precipitation of about 100 mm yr 1 the ratio of t et estimates from the tseb dnn model for the different land covers in fig 9 b show a clear temporal variation although march had the lowest t et in disagreement with the temporal variation of et the ratio of t et fluctuates among different vegetation types and increases from grass to shrub to forest which is consistent with the previous studies hu et al 2018 crop had the most significant water use efficiency where about 50 et was through vegetation transpiration and grassland had the lowest water use efficiency for grass the range of monthly t et was from 5 to 45 consisting with the previous results in a semi arid area of inner mongolia china hu et al 2009 the ratio of t et of these four types of vegetation had strong positive relationship with ndvi with r larger than 0 95 during growing season 5 discussions 5 1 importance of input variables the normalized rmse was calculated to understand the importance of input variables on the performance of the tseb dnn for generating spatio temporally continuous et in the dnn training predicting processes the rmse between the et estimates from the tseb dnn model when one variable is not included against when all variables are included can indicate the importance of this variable all rmse of the 11 input variables were normalized to express the significance at the same level the normalized rmse is shown in fig 10 the downward shortwave radiation plays the most significant role 26 52 due to its controlling effect on the et energy exchange as the commonly used variable to estimate the et the downward longwave radiation 10 95 dem 10 00 albedo 8 96 air temperature 8 35 and ndvi 7 84 relative humidity 7 05 land cover 5 63 air pressure 5 51 soil moisture 4 7 and wind 4 69 also show relatively high importance due to their strong ability in reflecting the water energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere fisher et al 2008 jia et al 2003 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2007 su 2002 tang et al 2010 the surface soil moisture showed lower importance due to the high t et for the vegetation area suggesting surface soil moisture has a limited controlling effect on the total et fig 10 the lowest importance of wind can help the model run at a stable level although until now the wind product has a larger uncertainty hu and jia 2015 5 2 comparison with similar studies overall the proposed tseb dnn model can obtain spatio temporally continuous et under all sky conditions there are mainly three types of et models that can be used under all sky conditions 1 time scale extension of the lst based et model for example jiang et al 2009 proposed an evaporation fraction interpolation method to obtain et under clear sky and cloudy sky conditions based on the contextual relationship between remotely sensed surface temperature and vegetation index they reported r rmse and bias of all day estimates of 0 606 1 209 mm d 1 and 0 513 mm d 1 over south florida 2 process based et model for example wang et al 2019 proposed a three source satellite algorithm for retrieving the evapotranspiration rate under all sky conditions using a combined optical and microwave vegetation index at twenty asia flux sites they reported r rmse and bias of 0 748 0 89 mm d 1 and 0 16 mm d 1 respectively the mod 16 products are also process based et models mu et al 2007 the reported r and rmse over the heihe river basin were 0 761 and 1 09 mm d 1 respectively hu and jia 2015 3 data assimilation method for example miralles et al 2011 proposed the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam et model with a core of priestley taylor p t equation and data assimilation of microwave soil moisture to maximize the incorporation of satellite observations and produce temporally spatially continuous terrestrial et at daily scales the reported r rmse and bias of gleam are 0 748 0 88 mm d 1 0 38 mm d 1 respectively over asia wang et al 2019 the et estimates of our tseb dnn model on the daily scale under all sky conditions are overall comparable with their results fig 4 for t et hu et al 2018 reviewed that the t et fluctuates among different land cover and normally increases from grass to shrub to trees based on the previous studies for the grass in semi arid area of china the monthly t et is normally lower than 50 and has strong seasonal variation zhou et al 2016 different vegetation index was used to investigate the relationship between vegetation and t et at point scale finding the strong positive between the ndvi evi lai and t et hu et al 2018 2009 wei et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 our results were consistent with these findings 5 3 advantages and limitations of this study the dnn model combined with the tseb model was successfully applied in this study to generate the spatio temporally continuous e t and et the et estimates from the tseb dnn model can reflect the spatio temporal variability against the in situ measurements especially for grass and crop however the performance of tseb dnn indicates that there is still a lot of room for improvement for the original tseb model in the forest including the model configuration field observation and validation strategy the generated e t and et maps in this study would enhance the application of water resources management and agricultural development at the regional scale the performance of the tseb dnn model was evaluated and analyzed only for the arid and semi arid area its evaluation for other climatic regions e g humid and semi humid area will be performed in the future 6 conclusions combining the tseb and dnn models the spatio temporally continuous e t and et with 0 01 resolution was generated by integrating the remote sensing data and meteorological data compared with in situ measurements the spatio temporally continuous total et and t e estimates from tseb dnn effectively reflect these parameters for the study region the r rmse and bias between the estimated et from the tseb dnn model and the in situ measurements ranges from 0 87 to 0 93 from 0 64 mm d 1 to 1 43 mm d 1 and from 0 01 mm d 1 to 1 38 mm d 1 for grass forest and crop respectively the tseb dnn model showed better performance for shorter vegetation grass and crop than tall vegetation forest the et estimates from the tseb dnn model is highly consistent with the et estimates from the original tseb model and can reflect the temporal variation of in situ measurements at different land cover sites the t et estimates from the tseb dnn model have high accuracy with rmse and bias of 7 49 and 2 22 respectively indicating the strong ability to obtain spatio temporally continuous et components these results showed the significant advantages of combining the tseb and dnn models providing effective information on spatio temporal variations in et in summary this study successfully generates spatio temporal continuous daily e t and et at the heihe river basin meeting the need for better water resources management practices developing spatio temporally continuous daily et and its components at field scales e g 30 m 30 m will be discussed in the future

4603,dissolved silica dsi and bicarbonate hco3 stoichiometric coupling is collectively regulated by chemical weathering and algal activity and potentially indicates the aquatic silicon retention and carbon emission in aquatic systems damming markedly remodels the hydrological conditions and aquatic biological activity however its effects on the spatiotemporal dynamics of coupled dsi and hco3 remain poorly understood here we deciphered a 2 year hydrological and water quality dataset collected at multiple sites within an urban lake namely hanfeng lake the largest pre dam of the three gorges reservoir to unravel the spatiotemporal dynamics of dsi and hco3 and selected hydrological and water quality variables using cluster analysis and to explore the best predictors for dsi hco3 using partial least squares regression the changes of dsi hco3 and selected water variables could be characterized by spatial east and west zones and further by temporal periods 1 2 and 3 corresponding respectively to fluctuation stage fluvial stage and lacustrine stage in each zone based on the hydrographic features of hanfeng lake wet season presented higher flow velocity permanganate index concentrations of dsi hco3 nitrate nitrogen and total suspended solids and lower water level secchi depth and chlorophyll a but equal dsi hco3 relative to dry season dsi was overall negatively correlated with hco3 highlighting the dominant role of chemical weathering rather algal activity dsi hco3 exhibited significant relationships with various variables but was the best predictable using water level permanganate index and nitrogen based variables suggesting the strong effects of water level fluctuation and pollution discharge on the coupling of silicon and carbon our results have

generated originally through chemical weathering of silicate minerals at a coupled stoichiometry gaillardet et al 1999 conley 2002 wang et al 2016 subsequently they are transported by fluvial networks to the downstream lake and or reservoir systems accompanying complicated hydrological activities onderka et al 2012 in these aquatic ecosystems dsi is commonly utilized by planktonic diatoms to construct their cell walls and hco3 can be taken up through photosynthesis by phytoplankton to synthesize organic matters wang et al 2018 these biological activities reveal that the stoichiometrically coupled dsi and hco3 originated from watershed chemical weathering is probably regulated further by diatom uptake accordingly reflecting the biogeochemical silicon si and carbon c cycles in aquatic ecosystems wang et al 2013 therefore changes in water quality indicating comprehensively the chemical weathering and phytoplankton activities kalin et al 2001 rakocevic nedovic and hollert 2005 wang et al 2010 potentially impact the shifts in dsi hco3 and dsi hco3 ratio li et al 2018a demonstrated that the dsi hco3 and dsi hco3 exhibited significant correlations with water quality variables e g electric conductivity total nitrogen and phosphorus under the drought and post drought conditions in the australia s lower lakes wang et al 2013 reported that dsi hco3 was negatively correlated with chlorophyll a and total phosphorus in impounded rivers however unanswered questions remain about the exact relationship between dsi and hco3 because of the combined effects of chemical weathering and algal activity further it is also unclear which common hydrological and water quality indicators are to what extent correlated with dsi hco3 and dsi hco3 ratio in the changeful aquatic ecosystems which are dramatically affected by human activities and climate change harrison et al 2012 wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a damming of a river can lead to pronounced increase in hydraulic residence time and reduction in currents resulting in increase in the water column thermal stratification and light availability mcginnis et al 2006 wang et al 2018 these shifts can enhance the photosynthesis and consequently increase autochthonous primary production in waters which are evidently responsible for the significant decrease in dsi and hco3 concentrations humborg et al 1997 conley et al 2000 struyf et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2010 pointed out that photosynthesis of phytoplankton taking place in the euphotic zone could continually consume dissolved co2 and thus shifted the carbonate equilibrium system leading to increase in ph and decline in hco3 and simultaneous occurrence of removal of nutrients e g si n and p from waters this implies that the changes of hco3 and other nutrient concentrations are strongly linked with the co2 emission in waters which play important roles in global carbon budget borges et al 2015 to date great efforts have been made to separately understand the effects of damming on the riverine si and c dynamics teodoru et al 2006 maavara et al 2014 2017 nevertheless for the best of our knowledge there have been few studies focus on the effects of damming on spatiotemporal dynamics of coupled dsi and hco3 and characterization of linkages between dsi hco3 ratio and water variables assmy et al 2013 indeed addressing these issues can help to deep the understanding of biogeochemical si and c cycles in aquatic ecosystems recently a pre dam was constructed upstream backwater zone of the three gorges reservoir tgr with the aim of reducing the area of water fluctuating zone from 24 km2 to 3 06 km2 which is controlled strongly by the periodical backflows from tgr qin et al 2012 as a result an interior artificial lake named hanfeng lake by the government was shaped the dam induced hanfeng lake is adjacent to the urban center of the kaizhou city and is thus subjected to severe disturbances by human activities such as a high amount of tourism activity and excessive input of pollutants zheng et al 2014 the hanfeng lake has attracted increasing attentions to its effects on the regulation of water fluctuating zone and changes in water quality chen et al 2018b previous studies have detected the changes in water resources allocation and eutrophic status in relation with their influence factors driven by damming and changing climate in this lake chen et al 2018a whereas interpretation of data on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dsi and hco3 in the hanfeng lake remain unstudied given the blooming construction of dams and subsequently its remarkable impacts on sustainable management of river environmental flows water resources allocation and water quality maavara et al 2017 kuriqi et al 2020 understanding the role dam induced urban lake played in biogeochemical cycles of nutrients will contribute importantly for making optimal strategies for improving sustainable development of local society economy and ecology around the three gorges reservoir area in this study a 2 year dataset collected at multiple sites within the dam induced hanfeng lake were interpreted in detail using multivariate statistical techniques including cluster analysis and partial least squares regression to precisely disclose the spatiotemporal variations in dsi hco3 and selected hydrological and water quality data matrix the specific objectives of this study were thus to 1 quantify the effects of damming on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dsi hco3 and other water variables 2 determine the potential interrelationships among these variables and 3 identify the most important predictors governing dsi hco3 ratio in the dam induced hanfeng lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area a detailed description of the hanfeng lake 108 42 e 31 18 n has been given by li et al 2021 briefly the hanfeng lake is located in the fengyue town kaizhou district chongqing municipality china fig 1 and is the largest urban artificial lake in the west china chen et al 2018a the lake controls an upper catchment area of around 3198 6 km2 and has a surface lake area of 14 8 km2 a water storage capacity of 80 million m3 and an average annual runoff discharge of approximately 2 4 billion m3 sourcing mainly from upstream dong river 37 nan river 28 taoxi river 28 toudao river 2 5 and others 4 5 the local climate is typical subtropical humid monsoon with a mean annual temperature of 18 5 c and average annual rainfall of 1385 mm of which 75 occurs in the wet season may september qin et al 2012 the hydrographic features of hanfeng lake can be commonly categorized into three distinct stages including lacustrine stage fluctuation stage and fluvial stage due largely to periodical influences of the upper river flows water releasing from the dam and backflows from tgr li et al 2021 the lacustrine stage spanning from october to january is strongly impacted by the backflows from tgr and characterized by high water level wide surface area and low flow velocity leading to the similar condition with the natural lake the fluctuation stage occurring from february to april is impacted soundly by the water level decline in tgr and presents decreasing water level and surface area conversely the fluvial stage covering from may to august is markedly impacted by the water releasing from the dam and the rainfall runoff replenishment resulting in low water level in the lake in september the backflows from tgr gradually recharge the lake leading to periodical evolution from fluvial stage to lacustrine stage overall the lacustrine stage and fluctuation stage belong to dry season and the fluvial stage serves to wet season 2 2 sampling strategy and measurements a total of 8 sampling sites were used to monitor the water environmental conditions of the hanfeng lake fig 2 specifically site 1 was located at the downstream of the dam gate sites 2 3 and 8 were located respectively at upper stream of dam gate the central part of main water body and the intersection of upper rivers sites 4 5 6 and 7 were situated at the mouths of dong river toudao river and nan river respectively sampling for each site was implemented monthly weekly in may and october from january 2013 to december 2014 at each site water level wl was recorded by the measuring tape with a range of 50 m flow velocity v was measured using portable current meter lgy ns china and secchi depth sd was measured with a 30 cm diameter secchi disc other water variables which were needed to be measured in situ and or in laboratory were determined according to the fluctuated wl they were measured only at 0 5 m located below the water surface top layer when wl was lower than 5 m they were measured at top layer and at half of the water depth middle layer when wl was higher than 5 m and lower than 10 m and were measured respectively at top layer middle layer and at 0 5 m located above the lakebed bottom layer when wl was higher than 10 m thus these water variables were obtained only at the top layer from march through august while they were acquired at all three layers from september through february li et al 2021 thus the water variables measured in situ including water temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and chlorophylla chl a were conducted using a portable multi parameter meter minisonde5x hach usa alkalinity was manually titrated with hcl and hence bicarbonate hco3 was calculated through temperature ph and alkalinity the hco3 could account for almost all of the alkalinity 99 fig s1 in this study indicating that monovalent bicarbonate was the dominant species of dissolved inorganic carbon in the hanfeng lake during the study period for the water variables measured in laboratory water samples were first collected using a 2 5 l grab sampler and were filled into duplicate polyethylene bottles 500 ml which had been pre washed with lake water corresponded to sampling depths then these samples were kept in the dark at 4 c and immediately delivered to the laboratory for analysis within 24 hr in laboratory one bottle of water samples was filtered through 0 45 μm glass microporous fiber membrane thus total suspended solid tss was determined by oven dried at 105 c ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n were determined spectrophotometrically using indophenol blue method and sulfamic acid method respectively dissolved silica dsi was analyzed spectrophotometrically using the blue ammoniummolybdate reaction mullin and riley 1955 tallberg et al 1997 which has been demonstrated to be high sensitivity and accuracy for determination of soluble silicon in freshwater tang et al 2014 the other bottle of water samples was unfiltered and the permanganate index codmn was analyzed using potassium permanganate titration after reduction by sodium oxalate total nitrogen tn was measured spectrophotometrically by digestion with the addition of alkaline potassium peroxodisuphate total phosphorus tp was measured using molybdenum blue colorimetric method after addition of potassium peroxodisuphate overall the measurements for tss nh4 n no3 n codmn tn tp sd and alkalinity were conducted in line with the standard chinese protocols sepa 2002 in this study most variables were expressed in µmol l 1 except wl m v m s 1 t c ph ec µs cm 1 chl a µg l 1 codmn mg l 1 tss mg l 1 and sd m the descriptive statistics on the study water variables dataset in the hanfeng lake were summarized in table s1 2 3 statistical analysis since most water variables were not significant differences among three water layers li et al 2021 the average value calculated from three water layers corresponding to each water variable was used in this study additionally the value for each water variable measured weekly in may and october was averaged to represent the monthly changes cluster analysis ca was used to unravel the spatiotemporal changes of water variables in the hangfeng lake it is suggested that geochemical and environmental data usually present a non normal distribution reimann and filzmoser 2000 while the ca is not based on normal distribution brown 1998 and hence it can be applied for this study iida et al 2011 the data was standardized through a z score transformation to normalize for different units of measurement and render the data dimensionless hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was performed on the normalized dataset of the hanfeng lake gurjar and tare 2019 the distances between clusters through this analysis of variance approach was determined using the ward s method the squared euclidean distances were used to measure similarity and the linkage distance was reported as a rescaled distance cluster combine and displayed on the x axis with the range 0 25 li et al 2018b based on the results of ca manny whitney u test was performed to compare the differences on water variables between spatial zones and kruskal wallis h test was adopted to further compare these among temporal periods in each zone spearman s rank correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships among water variables for various periods of each zone simple linear regression model was used to coordinate the relationship between dsi and hco3 among temporal periods in each zone moreover partial least squares regression plsr models were constructed separately to determine the importance of water variables as predictors of dsi hco3 and characteristic indexes of these models were compared among different periods in each zone prior to plsr the kolmgorov smirnov test was conducted to examine the normality of the variables and the log transformation base 10 was conducted when the data was not normally distributed for each obtained plsr model different components were obtained and the proportion of variance in dsi hco3 for individual r 2 y and cumulated r2ycum components and the predictive ability of the model for these components individual goodness of prediction q 2 and cumulated q 2 cum were used to assess the model strength onderka et al 2012 cross validation was used to test the predictive significance and root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv was calculated to present the difference between the observed and predicted values of each individual pass yan et al 2013 the relative influence of each independent variable was estimated using the variable importance of projection vip which is the sum of the variable s influence over all model dimensions divided by the total explained variation by the model independent variables with vip 1 were the most relevant and significant for explaining the dsi hco3 regression coefficient for each plsr model was adopted to explain the direction of relationship between dsi hco3 and other water variables plsr was performed using simca p 12 umetrics ab sweden while other statistical analyses abovementioned were conducted using spss 22 0 ibm armonk new york usa statistical significance in this study was specified at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 spatial variations of dsi hco3 and other variables ca clustered two statistically significant groups from the 8 sites fig 3 group 1 corresponded to the east zone of the hanfeng lake including sites 1 2 4 and 8 group 2 corresponded to the west zone of the hanfeng lake including sites 3 5 6 and 7 mann whitney u test confirmed that the dsi dsi hco3 wl ec chl a codmn tn nh4 n tp and tn tp were significant different between east and west zones p 0 05 while other water variables were not p 0 05 table 1 specifically the mean dsi dsi hco3 chl a codmn tn nh4 n and tp were 24 4 34 1 20 2 18 2 10 5 22 and 18 7 lower and the mean wl ec and tn tp were 11 8 33 and 14 higher in the east zone than these in the west zone respectively table 1 3 2 temporal variations of dsi hco3 and other variables a majority of water variables in the hanfeng lake including dsi dsi hco3 ph ec do codmn tn nh4 n no3 n tn tp showed the fluctuated decrease from january to december whilst hco3 and tp presented the inverse trends fig 4 meanwhile wl sd and chl a roughly showed sharp decline from january to april and kept marginal fluctuations between may and august and exhibited abrupt increase from september to december while the opposite trend was true for v t and tss fig 4 further ca gave accurately three statistically significant periods i e periods 1 2 and 3 for each zone respectively fig s2 in the east zone period 1 included february to april and pertained to the fluctuation stage and period 3 corresponded to september to january and served to the lacustrine stage period 2 was involved in may to august and thus entirely belonged to the fluvial stage fig s2a in the west zone the january and september included in period 3 of the east zone were assigned respectively to periods 1 and 2 fig s2b kruskal wallis h test showed that most variables were significant different among three periods in each zone p 0 05 respectively except codmn and tp in the east zone and tn tp and hco3 in the west zone p 0 05 table s2 additionally period 2 the wet season showed the highest hco3 v t and tss but lowest wl and sd compared to periods 1 and 3 the dry season in each zone p 0 05 table s2 3 3 relationships among dsi hco3 and other variables in the east zone log transformed dsi was negatively

5b moreover spearman s rank correlation analysis further showed that water variables presented apparently interrelationships over different periods in each zone table s3 thereinto dsi hco3 ratio showed significant relationships with different water variables but was always insignificantly correlated with chl a across all periods in each zone table s3 3 4 important predictors of dsi hco3 for each clustered period and zone the plsr model identified different numbers of components ranged from 1 and 3 which explained 21 82 variance of dsi hco3 the rmsecv varied from 0 04 to 0 15 table 2 and the goodness of prediction q cum 2 varied between 0 05 and 0 63 table 2 with respect to the whole hanfeng lake the plsr model identified four components which cumulatively explained 36 variance of dsi hco3 the rmsecv was always 0 09 for all components table 2 and the q cum 2 was 0 25 table 2 although dsi hco3 could be predicted by different water variables over different periods of each zone fig 6 for the whole hanfeng lake dsi hco3 was the best predictable by nh4 n codmn tn tp tn no3 n and wl which vip values for these variables were all greater to 1 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal similarity of dsi hco3 and other water variables the changes of dsi hco3 and other water variables were characterized by two spatial zones in the hanfeng lake fig 3 this may be a result of different amounts of runoff discharge sourcing from tributary rivers the east zone including sites 1 2 4 and 8 was controlled mainly by the dong river which alone contributed 37 of total runoff discharge for the hanfeng lake chen et al 2018a while the west zone including sites 3 5 6 and 7 was highly affected by nan river taoxi river and toudao river which collectively contributed 58 5 of total runoff discharge to the hanfeng lake chen et al 2018a east zone had higher wl relative to west zone because of the dam site signally lower dsi dsi hco3 chl a codmn tn nh4 n and tp were found in the east zone rather than the west zone table 1 this was due to the occurrence of dilution effects driven by high wl in the east zone moatar et al 2017 and was also because that the east zone was contributed relatively smaller numbers of pollutants by dong river relative to the west zone supplied by other inflow sources the results were in good line with the previous findings chen et al 2018b in contrast the average ec was considerably higher in the east zone than in the west zone the reason was probably that the weathering materials stemming from the upper terrestrial zone accumulated in the east zone as a result of the dam effects affecting the mineral related variables e g ec and tss this was also supported by the slightly higher tss in the east zone relative to the west zone the similar result was also given by dinka et al 2004 who found that the ec increased considerably from the lakeshore to the open water in the lake fertõ further white et al 2008 found that ec could be positive and or negative correlated with water level under the similar geologic and climatic conditions and area specific was responsible for the differences in relationships between wl and water quality variables temporal shifts of study water variables in the east and west zones were respectively characterized by three distinct periods fig 3 and fig s2 water releasing and synchronous river flow recharge in the period 2 led to decline in wl and increase in v and simultaneous decrease in sd and increase in tss due to sediment resuspension oliveira and calheiros 2000 scheffer and jeppesen 2007 conversely substantial backflows from tgr in the periods 1 and 3 led to inverse shifts in wl v sd and tss because of dilution and sedimentation izaguirre et al 2001 chen et al 2018b higher do but lower chl a concentration was found in period 2 of each zone owing to the changes in wl and v table s2 acuña et al 2011 mitrovic et al 2011 this was because that low wl increased the supply of oxygen and consequently increased the concentration of do and high v could cause the death of algae because of the damage of algae cells resulting in decline in chl a concentration chen et al 2018b the higher dsi hco3 codmn and no3 n in the period 2 was due largely to the overall decrease in lake water volume but increase in inputs of chemical materials wu et al 2006 liu et al 2016 4 2 spatiotemporal covariation of dsi hco3 and other water variables dsi usually shows considerable negative correlation with hco3 due to the chemical weathering gaillardet et al 1999 wang et al 2013 while the direction of the correlation is probably altered by the algal activities in aquatic system deng et al 2020 found that dsi was positively correlated with hco3 due to the regulation of the photosynthesis of phytoplankton in this study the log transformed dsi showed significant negative correlation with log transformed hco3 in most periods fig 5 implying the dominant role of chemical weathering rather than algal activities wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a the insignificant relationship between log transformed dsi and hco3 detected in period 3 in the west zone may be attributable to the enhanced algal activities that led to decrease in the concentration of hco3 compared to period 2 as a consequence of uptake of co2 wang et al 2013 although both periods 1 and 3 were involved in dry season biogeochemical processes in the two periods were significantly different this was the symptomatic of the severity of the period 2 leading to persistent effects on period 3 the high variability in correlations among water variables over different periods in each zone potentially supported above results table s3 indicating further the complex changes of hydrological and biogeochemical processes in hanfeng lake importantly the dsi hco3 ratio had been demonstrated to be of remarkable effectiveness to interpret the biogeochemical dynamics of coupled si and c and was correlated with water variables in the aquatic ecosystems wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a suggested that nutrients i e tn no3 n nh4 n and tp and the tn tp ratio were closely linked to the development of phytoplankton and hence were reasonably correlated with dsi hco3 ratio in the lake other variables e g wl v t ph do codmn ec sd and tss also potentially reflected the chemical weathering wang et al 2016 and the trophic state of the lake that was generally associated with the dynamics of phytoplankton rakocevic nedovic and hollert 2005 naselli flores and barone 2005 yang et al 2016 this was also supported by our findings that dsi hco3 ratio was significantly correlated with different water variables table s3 nevertheless our results surprisingly indicated no significant correlation between dsi hco3 and chl a in various periods of each zone though chl a showed significant negative relationships with dsi in period 2 of the west zone and with hco3 in period 2 of the east zone table s3 this result contrasted with the previous findings that dsi hco3 ratio presented negative correlation with chl a in river and lake ecosystems wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a algal activity can differentially take up si versus c and the changes in algae species compositions also play the key roles in modification of dsi hco3 ratio wang et al 2013 these together affected the correlation between dsi hco3 and chl a more data are required to precisely identify the respective effect of chemical weathering and algal activities on the linkage between dsi hco3 and chl a in aquatic ecosystems 4 3 driven factors for changes in coupling of dsi and hco3 although different water variables were significantly linked to dsi hco3 over various periods in each zone table 2 fig 6 the wl codmn and nitrogen based variables i e tn nh4 n no3 n and tn tp were found throughout to be of high effectiveness for prediction of dsi hco3 wl played pivotal roles as intermediate disturbance in structuring the physical chemical and biotic components of the lake ecosystems white et al 2008 and were widely known to associate with water quality variables webster et al 2000 george et al 2004 wantzen et al 2008 this suggested the strong effects of water level fluctuation on the coupling of si and c the codmn and nitrogen based variables were closely linked to the upstream point and non point sources onderka et al 2012 which were both transported to downstream waters accompanying the inputs of geological weathering materials including si and c by the rainfall runoff wang et al 2018 this result strongly indicated the important role of pollution discharge driven by human activities in shaping the silicon and carbon biogeochemical cycle moreover it was worthy noted that the present study was not aimed at developing a prediction model but rather identifying the main water variables that governed the spatiotemporal coupling of dsi and hco3 in the hanfeng lake multicollinearity was usually found among hydrological and water quality variables in aquatic ecosystems onderka et al 2012 while plsr had been widely demonstrated to eliminate the codependency among variables yan et al 2013 the implementation of plsr was therefore conducive to achieve a more unbiased view of the contribution of shifts in variables associated with spatiotemporal evolution to the dynamics of dsi hco3 in the hanfeng lake 4 4 implications the construction of pre dam induced systematic shifts in the hydrological and biogeochemical processes consequently leading to unbalance changes in the dsi and hco3 collins et al 2017 this resulted in significant differences in average dsi hco3 values among different periods and zones and generated some discrepancies relative to other aquatic ecosystems the dsi hco3 ratio averaged 0 07 in the hanfeng lake was similar with the american lake 0 06 wang et al 2016 and was higher than the drought affected australia s lower lakes 0 01 li et al 2018a but was lower than the australia s lower lakes 0 09 in post drought period li et al 2018a and the english lakes 0 12 wang et al 2016 this suggested that the net si retention occurred in the hanfeng lake due to dsi loss through diatom activity and sedimentation wang et al 2010 in turn the changed dsi hco3 and dsi hco3 ratio successively driven the dynamics of other elemental concentrations and stoichiometric ratios e g n and p turner 2002 implying the changes in phytoplankton communities and aquatic webs that are required to be further interpreted in the near future overall long term monitored data are urgently needed to identify the influence factors on si and c cycles and model their coupled processes in aquatic ecosystems affected by heightened human activities and climate change 5 conclusions the changes of dsi hco3 and selected water variables were characterized by the spatial east and west zones and further by temporal periods 1 2 and 3 corresponding respectively to fluctuation stage fluvial stage and lacustrine stage in each zone wet season was collectively impacted by river flow recharge and water releasing from dam and showed higher dsi hco3 v tss codmn and no3 n but lower wl chl a and sd than these in the dry season due to the dominant backflows from tgr log transformed dsi negatively correlated with log transformed hco3 as a result of the conjoint regulation of chemical weathering and algal activity dsi hco3 ratio was the best predictable using wl codmn tn nh4 n no3 n and tn tp in the hanfeng lake the results revealed that periodical evolutions of hydrological conditions considerably modified the biogeochemical coupling of dsi and hco3 and increased the spatiotemporal variability in the linkages between dsi hco3 and water variables in dam induced urban lake system this study highlights the effects of damming on spatiotemporal dynamics of water variables and contributes largely to modeling the global si and c cycles under the anticipated increasing frequency and intensity of human activities and changing climate notably this study also provides a novel perspective for understanding the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients and improving the sustainable management of water resources and water quality not only for dam induced urban lake system but also for aquatic ecosystems with similar conditions worldwide credit authorship contribution

4603,dissolved silica dsi and bicarbonate hco3 stoichiometric coupling is collectively regulated by chemical weathering and algal activity and potentially indicates the aquatic silicon retention and carbon emission in aquatic systems damming markedly remodels the hydrological conditions and aquatic biological activity however its effects on the spatiotemporal dynamics of coupled dsi and hco3 remain poorly understood here we deciphered a 2 year hydrological and water quality dataset collected at multiple sites within an urban lake namely hanfeng lake the largest pre dam of the three gorges reservoir to unravel the spatiotemporal dynamics of dsi and hco3 and selected hydrological and water quality variables using cluster analysis and to explore the best predictors for dsi hco3 using partial least squares regression the changes of dsi hco3 and selected water variables could be characterized by spatial east and west zones and further by temporal periods 1 2 and 3 corresponding respectively to fluctuation stage fluvial stage and lacustrine stage in each zone based on the hydrographic features of hanfeng lake wet season presented higher flow velocity permanganate index concentrations of dsi hco3 nitrate nitrogen and total suspended solids and lower water level secchi depth and chlorophyll a but equal dsi hco3 relative to dry season dsi was overall negatively correlated with hco3 highlighting the dominant role of chemical weathering rather algal activity dsi hco3 exhibited significant relationships with various variables but was the best predictable using water level permanganate index and nitrogen based variables suggesting the strong effects of water level fluctuation and pollution discharge on the coupling of silicon and carbon our results have

generated originally through chemical weathering of silicate minerals at a coupled stoichiometry gaillardet et al 1999 conley 2002 wang et al 2016 subsequently they are transported by fluvial networks to the downstream lake and or reservoir systems accompanying complicated hydrological activities onderka et al 2012 in these aquatic ecosystems dsi is commonly utilized by planktonic diatoms to construct their cell walls and hco3 can be taken up through photosynthesis by phytoplankton to synthesize organic matters wang et al 2018 these biological activities reveal that the stoichiometrically coupled dsi and hco3 originated from watershed chemical weathering is probably regulated further by diatom uptake accordingly reflecting the biogeochemical silicon si and carbon c cycles in aquatic ecosystems wang et al 2013 therefore changes in water quality indicating comprehensively the chemical weathering and phytoplankton activities kalin et al 2001 rakocevic nedovic and hollert 2005 wang et al 2010 potentially impact the shifts in dsi hco3 and dsi hco3 ratio li et al 2018a demonstrated that the dsi hco3 and dsi hco3 exhibited significant correlations with water quality variables e g electric conductivity total nitrogen and phosphorus under the drought and post drought conditions in the australia s lower lakes wang et al 2013 reported that dsi hco3 was negatively correlated with chlorophyll a and total phosphorus in impounded rivers however unanswered questions remain about the exact relationship between dsi and hco3 because of the combined effects of chemical weathering and algal activity further it is also unclear which common hydrological and water quality indicators are to what extent correlated with dsi hco3 and dsi hco3 ratio in the changeful aquatic ecosystems which are dramatically affected by human activities and climate change harrison et al 2012 wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a damming of a river can lead to pronounced increase in hydraulic residence time and reduction in currents resulting in increase in the water column thermal stratification and light availability mcginnis et al 2006 wang et al 2018 these shifts can enhance the photosynthesis and consequently increase autochthonous primary production in waters which are evidently responsible for the significant decrease in dsi and hco3 concentrations humborg et al 1997 conley et al 2000 struyf et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2010 pointed out that photosynthesis of phytoplankton taking place in the euphotic zone could continually consume dissolved co2 and thus shifted the carbonate equilibrium system leading to increase in ph and decline in hco3 and simultaneous occurrence of removal of nutrients e g si n and p from waters this implies that the changes of hco3 and other nutrient concentrations are strongly linked with the co2 emission in waters which play important roles in global carbon budget borges et al 2015 to date great efforts have been made to separately understand the effects of damming on the riverine si and c dynamics teodoru et al 2006 maavara et al 2014 2017 nevertheless for the best of our knowledge there have been few studies focus on the effects of damming on spatiotemporal dynamics of coupled dsi and hco3 and characterization of linkages between dsi hco3 ratio and water variables assmy et al 2013 indeed addressing these issues can help to deep the understanding of biogeochemical si and c cycles in aquatic ecosystems recently a pre dam was constructed upstream backwater zone of the three gorges reservoir tgr with the aim of reducing the area of water fluctuating zone from 24 km2 to 3 06 km2 which is controlled strongly by the periodical backflows from tgr qin et al 2012 as a result an interior artificial lake named hanfeng lake by the government was shaped the dam induced hanfeng lake is adjacent to the urban center of the kaizhou city and is thus subjected to severe disturbances by human activities such as a high amount of tourism activity and excessive input of pollutants zheng et al 2014 the hanfeng lake has attracted increasing attentions to its effects on the regulation of water fluctuating zone and changes in water quality chen et al 2018b previous studies have detected the changes in water resources allocation and eutrophic status in relation with their influence factors driven by damming and changing climate in this lake chen et al 2018a whereas interpretation of data on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dsi and hco3 in the hanfeng lake remain unstudied given the blooming construction of dams and subsequently its remarkable impacts on sustainable management of river environmental flows water resources allocation and water quality maavara et al 2017 kuriqi et al 2020 understanding the role dam induced urban lake played in biogeochemical cycles of nutrients will contribute importantly for making optimal strategies for improving sustainable development of local society economy and ecology around the three gorges reservoir area in this study a 2 year dataset collected at multiple sites within the dam induced hanfeng lake were interpreted in detail using multivariate statistical techniques including cluster analysis and partial least squares regression to precisely disclose the spatiotemporal variations in dsi hco3 and selected hydrological and water quality data matrix the specific objectives of this study were thus to 1 quantify the effects of damming on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dsi hco3 and other water variables 2 determine the potential interrelationships among these variables and 3 identify the most important predictors governing dsi hco3 ratio in the dam induced hanfeng lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area a detailed description of the hanfeng lake 108 42 e 31 18 n has been given by li et al 2021 briefly the hanfeng lake is located in the fengyue town kaizhou district chongqing municipality china fig 1 and is the largest urban artificial lake in the west china chen et al 2018a the lake controls an upper catchment area of around 3198 6 km2 and has a surface lake area of 14 8 km2 a water storage capacity of 80 million m3 and an average annual runoff discharge of approximately 2 4 billion m3 sourcing mainly from upstream dong river 37 nan river 28 taoxi river 28 toudao river 2 5 and others 4 5 the local climate is typical subtropical humid monsoon with a mean annual temperature of 18 5 c and average annual rainfall of 1385 mm of which 75 occurs in the wet season may september qin et al 2012 the hydrographic features of hanfeng lake can be commonly categorized into three distinct stages including lacustrine stage fluctuation stage and fluvial stage due largely to periodical influences of the upper river flows water releasing from the dam and backflows from tgr li et al 2021 the lacustrine stage spanning from october to january is strongly impacted by the backflows from tgr and characterized by high water level wide surface area and low flow velocity leading to the similar condition with the natural lake the fluctuation stage occurring from february to april is impacted soundly by the water level decline in tgr and presents decreasing water level and surface area conversely the fluvial stage covering from may to august is markedly impacted by the water releasing from the dam and the rainfall runoff replenishment resulting in low water level in the lake in september the backflows from tgr gradually recharge the lake leading to periodical evolution from fluvial stage to lacustrine stage overall the lacustrine stage and fluctuation stage belong to dry season and the fluvial stage serves to wet season 2 2 sampling strategy and measurements a total of 8 sampling sites were used to monitor the water environmental conditions of the hanfeng lake fig 2 specifically site 1 was located at the downstream of the dam gate sites 2 3 and 8 were located respectively at upper stream of dam gate the central part of main water body and the intersection of upper rivers sites 4 5 6 and 7 were situated at the mouths of dong river toudao river and nan river respectively sampling for each site was implemented monthly weekly in may and october from january 2013 to december 2014 at each site water level wl was recorded by the measuring tape with a range of 50 m flow velocity v was measured using portable current meter lgy ns china and secchi depth sd was measured with a 30 cm diameter secchi disc other water variables which were needed to be measured in situ and or in laboratory were determined according to the fluctuated wl they were measured only at 0 5 m located below the water surface top layer when wl was lower than 5 m they were measured at top layer and at half of the water depth middle layer when wl was higher than 5 m and lower than 10 m and were measured respectively at top layer middle layer and at 0 5 m located above the lakebed bottom layer when wl was higher than 10 m thus these water variables were obtained only at the top layer from march through august while they were acquired at all three layers from september through february li et al 2021 thus the water variables measured in situ including water temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and chlorophylla chl a were conducted using a portable multi parameter meter minisonde5x hach usa alkalinity was manually titrated with hcl and hence bicarbonate hco3 was calculated through temperature ph and alkalinity the hco3 could account for almost all of the alkalinity 99 fig s1 in this study indicating that monovalent bicarbonate was the dominant species of dissolved inorganic carbon in the hanfeng lake during the study period for the water variables measured in laboratory water samples were first collected using a 2 5 l grab sampler and were filled into duplicate polyethylene bottles 500 ml which had been pre washed with lake water corresponded to sampling depths then these samples were kept in the dark at 4 c and immediately delivered to the laboratory for analysis within 24 hr in laboratory one bottle of water samples was filtered through 0 45 μm glass microporous fiber membrane thus total suspended solid tss was determined by oven dried at 105 c ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n were determined spectrophotometrically using indophenol blue method and sulfamic acid method respectively dissolved silica dsi was analyzed spectrophotometrically using the blue ammoniummolybdate reaction mullin and riley 1955 tallberg et al 1997 which has been demonstrated to be high sensitivity and accuracy for determination of soluble silicon in freshwater tang et al 2014 the other bottle of water samples was unfiltered and the permanganate index codmn was analyzed using potassium permanganate titration after reduction by sodium oxalate total nitrogen tn was measured spectrophotometrically by digestion with the addition of alkaline potassium peroxodisuphate total phosphorus tp was measured using molybdenum blue colorimetric method after addition of potassium peroxodisuphate overall the measurements for tss nh4 n no3 n codmn tn tp sd and alkalinity were conducted in line with the standard chinese protocols sepa 2002 in this study most variables were expressed in µmol l 1 except wl m v m s 1 t c ph ec µs cm 1 chl a µg l 1 codmn mg l 1 tss mg l 1 and sd m the descriptive statistics on the study water variables dataset in the hanfeng lake were summarized in table s1 2 3 statistical analysis since most water variables were not significant differences among three water layers li et al 2021 the average value calculated from three water layers corresponding to each water variable was used in this study additionally the value for each water variable measured weekly in may and october was averaged to represent the monthly changes cluster analysis ca was used to unravel the spatiotemporal changes of water variables in the hangfeng lake it is suggested that geochemical and environmental data usually present a non normal distribution reimann and filzmoser 2000 while the ca is not based on normal distribution brown 1998 and hence it can be applied for this study iida et al 2011 the data was standardized through a z score transformation to normalize for different units of measurement and render the data dimensionless hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was performed on the normalized dataset of the hanfeng lake gurjar and tare 2019 the distances between clusters through this analysis of variance approach was determined using the ward s method the squared euclidean distances were used to measure similarity and the linkage distance was reported as a rescaled distance cluster combine and displayed on the x axis with the range 0 25 li et al 2018b based on the results of ca manny whitney u test was performed to compare the differences on water variables between spatial zones and kruskal wallis h test was adopted to further compare these among temporal periods in each zone spearman s rank correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships among water variables for various periods of each zone simple linear regression model was used to coordinate the relationship between dsi and hco3 among temporal periods in each zone moreover partial least squares regression plsr models were constructed separately to determine the importance of water variables as predictors of dsi hco3 and characteristic indexes of these models were compared among different periods in each zone prior to plsr the kolmgorov smirnov test was conducted to examine the normality of the variables and the log transformation base 10 was conducted when the data was not normally distributed for each obtained plsr model different components were obtained and the proportion of variance in dsi hco3 for individual r 2 y and cumulated r2ycum components and the predictive ability of the model for these components individual goodness of prediction q 2 and cumulated q 2 cum were used to assess the model strength onderka et al 2012 cross validation was used to test the predictive significance and root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv was calculated to present the difference between the observed and predicted values of each individual pass yan et al 2013 the relative influence of each independent variable was estimated using the variable importance of projection vip which is the sum of the variable s influence over all model dimensions divided by the total explained variation by the model independent variables with vip 1 were the most relevant and significant for explaining the dsi hco3 regression coefficient for each plsr model was adopted to explain the direction of relationship between dsi hco3 and other water variables plsr was performed using simca p 12 umetrics ab sweden while other statistical analyses abovementioned were conducted using spss 22 0 ibm armonk new york usa statistical significance in this study was specified at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 spatial variations of dsi hco3 and other variables ca clustered two statistically significant groups from the 8 sites fig 3 group 1 corresponded to the east zone of the hanfeng lake including sites 1 2 4 and 8 group 2 corresponded to the west zone of the hanfeng lake including sites 3 5 6 and 7 mann whitney u test confirmed that the dsi dsi hco3 wl ec chl a codmn tn nh4 n tp and tn tp were significant different between east and west zones p 0 05 while other water variables were not p 0 05 table 1 specifically the mean dsi dsi hco3 chl a codmn tn nh4 n and tp were 24 4 34 1 20 2 18 2 10 5 22 and 18 7 lower and the mean wl ec and tn tp were 11 8 33 and 14 higher in the east zone than these in the west zone respectively table 1 3 2 temporal variations of dsi hco3 and other variables a majority of water variables in the hanfeng lake including dsi dsi hco3 ph ec do codmn tn nh4 n no3 n tn tp showed the fluctuated decrease from january to december whilst hco3 and tp presented the inverse trends fig 4 meanwhile wl sd and chl a roughly showed sharp decline from january to april and kept marginal fluctuations between may and august and exhibited abrupt increase from september to december while the opposite trend was true for v t and tss fig 4 further ca gave accurately three statistically significant periods i e periods 1 2 and 3 for each zone respectively fig s2 in the east zone period 1 included february to april and pertained to the fluctuation stage and period 3 corresponded to september to january and served to the lacustrine stage period 2 was involved in may to august and thus entirely belonged to the fluvial stage fig s2a in the west zone the january and september included in period 3 of the east zone were assigned respectively to periods 1 and 2 fig s2b kruskal wallis h test showed that most variables were significant different among three periods in each zone p 0 05 respectively except codmn and tp in the east zone and tn tp and hco3 in the west zone p 0 05 table s2 additionally period 2 the wet season showed the highest hco3 v t and tss but lowest wl and sd compared to periods 1 and 3 the dry season in each zone p 0 05 table s2 3 3 relationships among dsi hco3 and other variables in the east zone log transformed dsi was negatively

5b moreover spearman s rank correlation analysis further showed that water variables presented apparently interrelationships over different periods in each zone table s3 thereinto dsi hco3 ratio showed significant relationships with different water variables but was always insignificantly correlated with chl a across all periods in each zone table s3 3 4 important predictors of dsi hco3 for each clustered period and zone the plsr model identified different numbers of components ranged from 1 and 3 which explained 21 82 variance of dsi hco3 the rmsecv varied from 0 04 to 0 15 table 2 and the goodness of prediction q cum 2 varied between 0 05 and 0 63 table 2 with respect to the whole hanfeng lake the plsr model identified four components which cumulatively explained 36 variance of dsi hco3 the rmsecv was always 0 09 for all components table 2 and the q cum 2 was 0 25 table 2 although dsi hco3 could be predicted by different water variables over different periods of each zone fig 6 for the whole hanfeng lake dsi hco3 was the best predictable by nh4 n codmn tn tp tn no3 n and wl which vip values for these variables were all greater to 1 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal similarity of dsi hco3 and other water variables the changes of dsi hco3 and other water variables were characterized by two spatial zones in the hanfeng lake fig 3 this may be a result of different amounts of runoff discharge sourcing from tributary rivers the east zone including sites 1 2 4 and 8 was controlled mainly by the dong river which alone contributed 37 of total runoff discharge for the hanfeng lake chen et al 2018a while the west zone including sites 3 5 6 and 7 was highly affected by nan river taoxi river and toudao river which collectively contributed 58 5 of total runoff discharge to the hanfeng lake chen et al 2018a east zone had higher wl relative to west zone because of the dam site signally lower dsi dsi hco3 chl a codmn tn nh4 n and tp were found in the east zone rather than the west zone table 1 this was due to the occurrence of dilution effects driven by high wl in the east zone moatar et al 2017 and was also because that the east zone was contributed relatively smaller numbers of pollutants by dong river relative to the west zone supplied by other inflow sources the results were in good line with the previous findings chen et al 2018b in contrast the average ec was considerably higher in the east zone than in the west zone the reason was probably that the weathering materials stemming from the upper terrestrial zone accumulated in the east zone as a result of the dam effects affecting the mineral related variables e g ec and tss this was also supported by the slightly higher tss in the east zone relative to the west zone the similar result was also given by dinka et al 2004 who found that the ec increased considerably from the lakeshore to the open water in the lake fertõ further white et al 2008 found that ec could be positive and or negative correlated with water level under the similar geologic and climatic conditions and area specific was responsible for the differences in relationships between wl and water quality variables temporal shifts of study water variables in the east and west zones were respectively characterized by three distinct periods fig 3 and fig s2 water releasing and synchronous river flow recharge in the period 2 led to decline in wl and increase in v and simultaneous decrease in sd and increase in tss due to sediment resuspension oliveira and calheiros 2000 scheffer and jeppesen 2007 conversely substantial backflows from tgr in the periods 1 and 3 led to inverse shifts in wl v sd and tss because of dilution and sedimentation izaguirre et al 2001 chen et al 2018b higher do but lower chl a concentration was found in period 2 of each zone owing to the changes in wl and v table s2 acuña et al 2011 mitrovic et al 2011 this was because that low wl increased the supply of oxygen and consequently increased the concentration of do and high v could cause the death of algae because of the damage of algae cells resulting in decline in chl a concentration chen et al 2018b the higher dsi hco3 codmn and no3 n in the period 2 was due largely to the overall decrease in lake water volume but increase in inputs of chemical materials wu et al 2006 liu et al 2016 4 2 spatiotemporal covariation of dsi hco3 and other water variables dsi usually shows considerable negative correlation with hco3 due to the chemical weathering gaillardet et al 1999 wang et al 2013 while the direction of the correlation is probably altered by the algal activities in aquatic system deng et al 2020 found that dsi was positively correlated with hco3 due to the regulation of the photosynthesis of phytoplankton in this study the log transformed dsi showed significant negative correlation with log transformed hco3 in most periods fig 5 implying the dominant role of chemical weathering rather than algal activities wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a the insignificant relationship between log transformed dsi and hco3 detected in period 3 in the west zone may be attributable to the enhanced algal activities that led to decrease in the concentration of hco3 compared to period 2 as a consequence of uptake of co2 wang et al 2013 although both periods 1 and 3 were involved in dry season biogeochemical processes in the two periods were significantly different this was the symptomatic of the severity of the period 2 leading to persistent effects on period 3 the high variability in correlations among water variables over different periods in each zone potentially supported above results table s3 indicating further the complex changes of hydrological and biogeochemical processes in hanfeng lake importantly the dsi hco3 ratio had been demonstrated to be of remarkable effectiveness to interpret the biogeochemical dynamics of coupled si and c and was correlated with water variables in the aquatic ecosystems wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a suggested that nutrients i e tn no3 n nh4 n and tp and the tn tp ratio were closely linked to the development of phytoplankton and hence were reasonably correlated with dsi hco3 ratio in the lake other variables e g wl v t ph do codmn ec sd and tss also potentially reflected the chemical weathering wang et al 2016 and the trophic state of the lake that was generally associated with the dynamics of phytoplankton rakocevic nedovic and hollert 2005 naselli flores and barone 2005 yang et al 2016 this was also supported by our findings that dsi hco3 ratio was significantly correlated with different water variables table s3 nevertheless our results surprisingly indicated no significant correlation between dsi hco3 and chl a in various periods of each zone though chl a showed significant negative relationships with dsi in period 2 of the west zone and with hco3 in period 2 of the east zone table s3 this result contrasted with the previous findings that dsi hco3 ratio presented negative correlation with chl a in river and lake ecosystems wang et al 2016 li et al 2018a algal activity can differentially take up si versus c and the changes in algae species compositions also play the key roles in modification of dsi hco3 ratio wang et al 2013 these together affected the correlation between dsi hco3 and chl a more data are required to precisely identify the respective effect of chemical weathering and algal activities on the linkage between dsi hco3 and chl a in aquatic ecosystems 4 3 driven factors for changes in coupling of dsi and hco3 although different water variables were significantly linked to dsi hco3 over various periods in each zone table 2 fig 6 the wl codmn and nitrogen based variables i e tn nh4 n no3 n and tn tp were found throughout to be of high effectiveness for prediction of dsi hco3 wl played pivotal roles as intermediate disturbance in structuring the physical chemical and biotic components of the lake ecosystems white et al 2008 and were widely known to associate with water quality variables webster et al 2000 george et al 2004 wantzen et al 2008 this suggested the strong effects of water level fluctuation on the coupling of si and c the codmn and nitrogen based variables were closely linked to the upstream point and non point sources onderka et al 2012 which were both transported to downstream waters accompanying the inputs of geological weathering materials including si and c by the rainfall runoff wang et al 2018 this result strongly indicated the important role of pollution discharge driven by human activities in shaping the silicon and carbon biogeochemical cycle moreover it was worthy noted that the present study was not aimed at developing a prediction model but rather identifying the main water variables that governed the spatiotemporal coupling of dsi and hco3 in the hanfeng lake multicollinearity was usually found among hydrological and water quality variables in aquatic ecosystems onderka et al 2012 while plsr had been widely demonstrated to eliminate the codependency among variables yan et al 2013 the implementation of plsr was therefore conducive to achieve a more unbiased view of the contribution of shifts in variables associated with spatiotemporal evolution to the dynamics of dsi hco3 in the hanfeng lake 4 4 implications the construction of pre dam induced systematic shifts in the hydrological and biogeochemical processes consequently leading to unbalance changes in the dsi and hco3 collins et al 2017 this resulted in significant differences in average dsi hco3 values among different periods and zones and generated some discrepancies relative to other aquatic ecosystems the dsi hco3 ratio averaged 0 07 in the hanfeng lake was similar with the american lake 0 06 wang et al 2016 and was higher than the drought affected australia s lower lakes 0 01 li et al 2018a but was lower than the australia s lower lakes 0 09 in post drought period li et al 2018a and the english lakes 0 12 wang et al 2016 this suggested that the net si retention occurred in the hanfeng lake due to dsi loss through diatom activity and sedimentation wang et al 2010 in turn the changed dsi hco3 and dsi hco3 ratio successively driven the dynamics of other elemental concentrations and stoichiometric ratios e g n and p turner 2002 implying the changes in phytoplankton communities and aquatic webs that are required to be further interpreted in the near future overall long term monitored data are urgently needed to identify the influence factors on si and c cycles and model their coupled processes in aquatic ecosystems affected by heightened human activities and climate change 5 conclusions the changes of dsi hco3 and selected water variables were characterized by the spatial east and west zones and further by temporal periods 1 2 and 3 corresponding respectively to fluctuation stage fluvial stage and lacustrine stage in each zone wet season was collectively impacted by river flow recharge and water releasing from dam and showed higher dsi hco3 v tss codmn and no3 n but lower wl chl a and sd than these in the dry season due to the dominant backflows from tgr log transformed dsi negatively correlated with log transformed hco3 as a result of the conjoint regulation of chemical weathering and algal activity dsi hco3 ratio was the best predictable using wl codmn tn nh4 n no3 n and tn tp in the hanfeng lake the results revealed that periodical evolutions of hydrological conditions considerably modified the biogeochemical coupling of dsi and hco3 and increased the spatiotemporal variability in the linkages between dsi hco3 and water variables in dam induced urban lake system this study highlights the effects of damming on spatiotemporal dynamics of water variables and contributes largely to modeling the global si and c cycles under the anticipated increasing frequency and intensity of human activities and changing climate notably this study also provides a novel perspective for understanding the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients and improving the sustainable management of water resources and water quality not only for dam induced urban lake system but also for aquatic ecosystems with similar conditions worldwide credit authorship contribution

4604,carbon capture and storage ccs is one of the key technologies for reducing co2 emissions but it has suffered from the high costs for the purification of captured co2 streams storing co2 with two major impurities i e n2 and o2 in geological formations would be more economical however the cost savings might be offset by the reduced co2 storage efficiency to understand the relationships between the reduced co2 storage efficiency and the co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 storage efficiency and co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers are evaluated we established a 2d model by developing a new module incorporated into tough2 to simulate the migration and dissolution of co2 n2 o2 mixtures in aquifers based on the hydrogeological conditions of the shenhua ccs site in china it is found that the partitioning between co2 and the impurities during migration can reduce co2 storage efficiency by raising impurity concentrations in gas phase but higher pressure and temperature in reservoirs can alleviate the reduction of co2 storage efficiency while retaining the benefit of the impurities on the co2 dissolution efficiency with 10 mol n2 the co2 storage efficiency is decreased by at least 32 while the co2 storage cost in saline aquifers is increased less than 0 01 us t co2 keywords carbon capture and storage impurity deep saline aquifers co2 storage efficiency co2 storage cost numerical simulation 1 introduction in the background of global warming and climate change carbon capture and storage ccs has been widely approved as a key technology for reducing co2 emissions and alleviating greenhouse gas effect intergovernmental panel on climate change 2005 international energy agency 2013 li and yu 2020 among the various methods of storage that have been proposed co2 geological storage has drawn tremendous attention due to its permanency and huge potential capacity the suitable geological formations for co2 storage can be mainly divided into two categories depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and deep saline aquifers bachu 2008 xu et al 2020 by comparison deep saline aquifers are ubiquitously distributed around the world and easier to be found near the co2 emission sources wu 2013 over the period from 2030 to 2050 the estimated storage share of co2 in deep saline aquifers can reach 66 to 88 international energy agency 2008 however unlike the co2 geological storage projects involving oil or gas recovery storing co2 in deep saline aquifers does not produce direct economic benefits for which seeking the economic feasibility and minimizing the costs are more crucial problems a full chain of co2 capture and geological storage in deep saline aquifers includes three components capture separation and compression transportation and storage injection and monitor taken together the key points affecting the total cost of the project can come down to two major factors 1 the impurities in the raw co2 flue gas 2 the transportation modes and distance rubin et al 2005 2007 jakobsen et al 2011 2017 especially the representative costs of capturing co2 dependent on the capture technologies i e the species and concentrations of the impurities varying from 12 to 44 us t co2 dominates nearly 75 of the final cost intergovernmental panel on climate change 2005 wu 2013 however it has been proved that very high purity co2 may not be required in some scenarios to give examples for the enhanced oil recovery eor projects in kinder morgan and weyburn the injected co2 volume fraction are 95 and 96 respectively de visser et al 2008 but the impurities generally have deleterious impact on the transportation and the storage of co2 in deep saline aquifers li et al 2019 such as corrosion in pipelines and decrease in storage capacity ieaghg 2004 2011 matuszewski and woods 2012 which may incur additional costs the key issue is to find the economic balance between the savings in capture costs and the possible increase in transportation and storage costs in the different co2 capture technologies e g pre combustion post combustion and oxy fuel combustion the widest possible range of impurities is present in oxy fuel combustion ieaghg 2004 kather 2009 kather and kownatzki 2011 porter et al 2017 have modelled three different purification processes on the raw co2 streams 1 1 from this point forward the term co2 stream is used when referring to the captured co2 including impurities while the term co2 or injected co2 means pure co2 posch and haider 2012 captured from oxy fuel combustion the process only involving compression and dehydration produces co2 with a purity of 77 69 mol while the major impurities are n2 and o2 the costs to achieve higher co2 purity of 96 61 and 99 99 mol are about 38 56 and 53 47 us t co2 respectively skaugen et al 2016 have reported that 5 mol impurities n2 and o2 and 10 mol impurities n2 and ch4 can bring increases of 2 7 and 4 5 us t co2 in pipeline transportation cost respectively based on an on shore transportation distance of 500 km in this context the additional cost incurred by impurities n2 and o2 on co2 pipeline transportation may be less than one tenth of the savings in capture costs which makes the co capture and co storage of co2 with the impurities n2 and o2 seems quite attractive however to our best knowledge there has no published study investigating the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers according to the cost analysis of co2 geological storage by heddle et al 2003 and united states environmental protection agency 2008 wang et al 2014 have established an engineering economic model for the co2 storage in deep saline aquifers which indicates the major factors affecting storage cost 1 the number of wells 2 the area of storage site and 3 the depth of target reservoirs more specifically the calculation mainly involves the co2 thermo physical properties and the reservoir characteristics since there is yet no evidence that impurities n2 and o2 can significantly change reservoir properties in co2 geological storage conditions lu et al 2014 2016 pearce et al 2019 the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers are then directly related to the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 thermo physical properties it is well known that n2 and o2 are much less dense than co2 at the same temperature and pressure conditions which would increase the molar volume and the mobility of co2 streams this not only may affect the calculation of well numbers but also decrease the co2 storage efficiency defined as the mass of injected co2 per unit pore volume in this paper and hence changes the area of storage site co2 storage mechanisms in deep saline aquifers can be divided into physical trapping solubility trapping and mineral trapping which correspond to three states of co2 supercritical co2 the supercritical is occasionally referred to as gas or gaseous for simplicity below dissolved co2 and co2 in mineral phase the dissolution of co2 starts almost immediately after the co2 injection while co2 mineral trapping requires a very long time scale and the co2 in mineral phase is the transformation product of dissolved co2 the total amount of gaseous and dissolved co2 which can be accommodated by the target saline aquifers represents actually the final co2 storage capacity of a specific storage site the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the storage efficiency of gaseous co2 have been characterized by the density ratio of impure and pure co2 wang et al 2012 while the effects on the storage efficiency of dissolved co2 have been calculated from the co2 solubility and the corresponding brine density ziabakhsh ganji and kooi 2014 however the differences of multiphase flow and dissolution process in target reservoirs between the impure and pure co2 should also be considered the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and impurities shows that n2 and o2 with higher concentrations dominate the leading edge of the co2 plume bachu and bennion 2009 lei et al 2016 li et al 2017a 2017b this might lead to additional increase of the pore volume occupied by gases because the molar volume of co2 mixtures increases with the concentrations of n2 and o2 besides the expanded distribution range enhances the dissolution of co2 li et al 2017a 2017b which would increase the co2 solubility trapping capacity but to our knowledge there is no published study yet on the extent of impurities n2 and o2 affecting the storage efficiency of injected co2 by comprehensively considering and simulating the migration and dissolution processes of the impure and pure co2 the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 storage efficiency and co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers according to the discussion above we firstly assess the impact of impurities n2 and o2 on co2 geological storage efficiency by establishing a 2d model to simulate the migration and dissolution of co2 n2 o2 mixtures in aquifers using a new module yu 2018 incorporated into tough2 and based on the hydrogeological conditions at the shenhua ccs site in ordos basin we compare the evaluation results under different formation temperature and pressure conditions then the simulation results are applied to the engineering economic model to evaluate the fixed investment and the cost of operation and maintenance at the shenhua ccs site for the pure and impure co2 storage in deep saline aquifers 2 shenhua ccs site 2 1 shenhua ccs project shenhua ccs project in ordos basin is 38 km southeast of ordos city inner mongolia china fig 1 it was initiated by shenhua group and achieved its goal of injecting 0 1 million tons mt co2 per year into the deep saline aquifers the injected co2 is provided by china shenhua coal liquefaction co ltd csclc which is a subsidiary company of shenhua group the 1080 kt a coal liquefaction project of csclc can release total 3 1 mt co2 per year discharged from the cold methanol wash unit of the coal liquefaction process the raw co2 stream mainly consists of 88 8 vol co2 and 10 9 vol n2 table 1 by virtue of the procedures such as condensation and distillation the co2 purity can be up to 99 2 vol the operation cost for the separation and purification processes is estimated to be 28 us t co2 by zhang et al 2016 these costs may be saved by the co capture of the co2 and n2 since the shenhua ccs project is a pilot scale storage project and only 14 km northwest of the co2 source the pipeline transportation would be too wasteful intergovernmental panel on climate change 2005 the co2 captured in csclc is transported to the storage site by five liquified natural gas tankers with a temperature of 20 c and a pressure of 2 mpa in this condition the volume of 0 1 mt impure co2 with 10 mol n2 is about 10 times that of pure co2 which would significantly increase the total transportation cost if we choose the 60 m3 compressed natural gas tankers with a temperature of 20 c and a pressure of 10 mpa assuming the transportation cost for pure co2 is 19 9 us t co2 100 km the increase in transportation cost caused by 10 mol n2 is about 2 2 us t co2 100 km 2 2 hydrogeological characteristics of the research area ordos basin is a large sedimentary basin with an area of about 2 5 105 km2 which experienced multiple tectonic movements but still has long term overall stability the sedimentary formations quaternary tertiary cretaceous jurassic triassic permian carboniferous and ordovician from top to bottom are continuously deposited or belong to pseudo conformity contact while the angular unconformity only exists at the edge of the basin the ordos basin is also a huge groundwater basin in which several aquifer systems with different characteristics are overlapped or laterally linked cut and interconnected in space these aquifer systems from top to bottom include the cenozoic unconsolidated aquifer system cretaceous clastic rock porous fractured aquifer system carboniferous jurassic fractured clastic aquifer system and cambrian ordovician carbonate karst aquifer system wang et al 2005 at depths from 1 to 3 km the water movement in the sandstone and carbonate aquifers of ordovician to jurassic age is quite slow and basically in a stagnant state fig 2 b which can provide a relatively stable hydrogeological environment for co2 geological storage the south slope of yimeng uplift belt in ordos basin is where the shenhua ccs site has located it is a monoclinal structure with a dip angle less than 1 fig 2a in monoclinal structures the injected supercritical co2 streams will move as plume within the formation driven by buoyancy and hydrodynamic force based on the known hydrogeological data and the results of seismic exploration within the burial depth from 1 6 to 2 5 km liujiagou formation shiqianfeng formation shihezi formation and shanxi formation of ordovician to triassic age are selected as potential reservoirs for shenhua ccs project fig 2c 3 methodology 3 1 modelling approach 3 1 1 simulation tool tough2 is a numerical simulation program that can reproduce and predict the multiphase flow of multicomponent fluids in porous and fractured media it has a modular architecture that allows the main module to interface with different fluid property modules according to different needs the fluid property modules can calculate the thermophysical properties for specific fluid mixtures only through several primary thermodynamic variables in this study we establish a new module to simulate the flow and transport of co2 n2 o2 mixtures in deep saline aquifers for the new module the primary variables are determined by the phase composition of co2 n2 o2 mixtures under the investigated pressure and temperature conditions consulting the study of co2 streams captured from oxyfuel combustion kather and kownatzki 2011 mix1 80 co2 17 n2 3 o2 mix2 90 co2 10 n2 and pure co2 representing the low purity medium purity and high purity respectively are selected for the calculation of phase diagram of co2 n2 o2 mixtures by the peng robinson equation of state pr eos peng and robinson 1976 see appendix a in this study the proportions used in mix1 and mix2 all indicate mole fractions fig 3 shows that the impurity effects on the phase behaviors are conspicuous including the formation of two phase regions and the alternation of critical properties the mix1 deviates pure co2 more significantly decreases the critical temperature by about 15 c and increases the critical pressure by about 5 mpa it can be seen that either in the p t range between the two straight lines possessing most interest for co2 geological storage spycher et al 2003 or under the simulation conditions in this study co2 n2 o2 mixtures are non condensable gases meanwhile the formation water is modelled as nacl solution consisted of nacl and h2o thus the fluid system involves five components co2 n2 o2 h2o and nacl and two phases gas and aqueous eos7c oldenburg et al 2004 is a tough2 module that calculates the fluid properties for the systems of co2 ch4 tracer brine based on its composition of primary variables and the submodule zevsreal that can calculate real gas mixture properties we modified eos7c to simulate the co injection of co2 with n2 and o2 in addition the function of simulating the dissolution and precipitation of solid salt is transplanted from eco2n pruess and spycher 2007 which is a tough2 module for the calculation of fluid properties of co2 h2o nacl systems the primary thermodynamic variables of the new module modified from eos7c and eco2n are shown in table 2 for the thermophysical properties of the gas mixtures the calculation of density viscosity and solubility involves pr eos peng and robinson 1976 empirical function of chung et al 1988 and the fugacity activity model appendix a the governing equations in the main module of tough2 appendix a which turn to a set of coupled discrete equations with strong nonlinearity can be linearized and solved by newton raphson iteration method 3 1 2 model setup according to the actual injection of shenhua ccs project in ordos basin many features such as the geometry porosity and permeability of the major reservoirs can be used for the model setup however in order to capture the variation of co2 storage efficiency due to the impurity effects on the flow and dissolution of injected supercritical co2 streams we have made some simplifications a symmetric two dimensional radial model with the thickness of 100 m and an external radius of 5 km is abstracted from the shihezi formation fig 4 other simplifications include the assumption of isothermal conditions the homogenization of porosity and the simplification of permeability details pruess et al 2004 the model is divided into 10 layers evenly in the vertical direction and 101 radial grid elements with logarithmically increasing sizes from left to right in the radial direction at the left boundary a vertical injection well is modelled as a column of circular grid elements with the radius of 0 2 m and the injection interval is the lowermost 40 m of the reservoir the right boundary consists of grid elements with a large volume of 1050 m3 so that their thermodynamic conditions do not change from fluid exchange with finite size blocks in the flow domain xu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 since the common porosity and permeability of the overlying and underlying mudstone are smaller than 1 and 1 md wu 2013 respectively the top and bottom boundaries of the model are set to be impermeable based on the logging data of the injection well fig 2c shihezi formation is located at a depth from 1990 to 2232 m with a temperature of 64 82 c due to the interbedding of the sandstone and mudstone the model thickness abstracted from shihezi formation is set to be 100 m and the burial depth is assumed to be 2100 to 2200 m thus the hydrostatic fluid pressure of the model is 21 22 mpa from top to bottom when the formation pressure gradient is 100 bar km the average geothermal gradient in the central ordos basin is 2 32 c 100 m and the lowest is only 1 3 c 100 m in the northern part of the basin wang et al 2004 hence we assume an isothermal condition in the simulations the porosity and permeability are set to be the maximums of the available data cao et al 2007 xie et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 25 and 73 md respectively to represent the well developed fractures and reduce the impacts of pressure build up due to the injection of co2 streams wu 2013 the average salinity of the formation water is only 14 g l which is sufficiently small that it is set to be zero in our work the parameters in relative permeability and capillary pressure model were taken from oldenburg et al 2001 table 3 referring to the actual injection of shenhua project pure co2 is injected into the model at a constant rate of 3 17 kg s for 2 years to keep the same total amount of co2 injected the injection rates of co2 n2 and o2 for mix1 are set to be 3 17 kg s 0 4 kg s and 0 07 kg s respectively the injection rates of co2 and o2 for mix2 are 3 17 kg s and 0 2 kg s respectively since the proportions in mix1and mix2 are mole fractions a conversion is done here to get the mass flow rates for each gas component in addition in most practical ccs operations including shenhua ccs project the maximal mole fraction of impurity n2 is about 10 while the content of o2 is very limited hence mix2 is used to quantify the impurity effects on co2 storage efficiency at different storage conditions the simulations are conducted under the temperatures of 55 65 and 75 c and the pressures from 9 to 21 mpa fig 3 3 2 quantifying the impurity effects on the co2 storage efficiency wang et al 2012 and ziabakhsh ganji and kooi 2014 have focused on the impurity effects on the storage capacity of co2 sequestrated by structural trapping assuming all the injected co2 is stored as supercritical fluid they have quantified the impurity effects on the storage efficiency of gaseous co2 by a normalized co2 storage capacity nc 1 nc g pr ρ mix x c o 2 ρ 0 where ρ mix and ρ 0 are the density of the impure and pure co2 respectively since x c o 2 is the mass fraction of co2 in the impure co2 ρ mix x c o 2 can be viewed as the density of gaseous co2 in the gas mixture wang et al 2012 and ziabakhsh ganji and kooi 2014 have calculated the normalized storage capacity for gaseous co2 nc g pr according to the pr eos directly with given temperature pressure and impurity concentration levels however the actual density of gaseous co2 is not uniform in the entire reservoir because of the formation pressure gradient and the disturbance by co2 injection especially as mentioned above due to the solubility difference of co2 and the impurities with higher impurity level in gas phase the average density of gaseous co2 in the gas mixture might be decreased by the partitioning phenomenon in this context using the density of gaseous co2 calculated from pr eos to quantify the impurity effects on the storage efficiency of gaseous co2 may be not accurate enough hence in this study we aim to determine how impurities n2 and o2 affect the co2 storage efficiency based on simulation results based on the simulation results in this study we can sum the mass of gaseous co2 and the pore volume occupied by the gas phase over all the grid blocks in the model respectively as m c o 2 g eq 2 1 and v g eq 2 2 also the mass of dissolved co2 can be calculated as m c o 2 a q eq 2 3 the subscript n is the index of grids superscripts g and aq denote the gas phase and aqueous phase respectively ϕ v s and ρ are the porosity grid volume phase saturation and phase density respectively y co 2 is the mass fraction of co2 in gas phase and x co 2 is the mass fraction of co2 in aqueous phase for the two scenarios of injecting impure and pure co2 the average densities of gaseous co2 are written as ρ c o 2 g m i x m c o 2 g mix v g mix and ρ c o 2 g 0 m c o 2 g 0 v g 0 respectively the superscript mix and 0 are used to distinguish these two scenarios then similarly the normalized storage capacity for gaseous co2 is defined as 2 nc g ρ c o 2 g mix ρ c o 2 g 0 2 1 m c o 2 g n ϕ n v n s n g ρ n g y n co 2 2 2 v g n ϕ n v n s n g 2 3 m c o 2 a q n ϕ n v n s n aq ρ n aq x n co 2 moreover because the effects of dissolved gases on the solution volume are negligible the pore volume occupied by gaseous co2 can be regarded as the storage space taken by all co2 phases as the same total amount of injected co2 0 2 million tons is used in all scenarios we can write the normalized storage capacity for total co2 as 3 nc t v g 0 v g mix in this paper the co2 storage efficiency is defined as the mass of injected co2 per unit pore volume the normalized co2 storage capacity is actually the ratio of the storage efficiency of impure co2 to pure co2 by comparing nc g pr and nc g we can investigate the effects of the partitioning phenomenon on the co2 storage efficiency also through comparing nc g and nc t the effects from the dissolution process on the co2 storage efficiency can be shown 3 3 evaluation of the co2 storage costs the cost analysis for the co2 storage in deep saline aquifers in this study is based on the shenhua ccs project and calculated from the engineering economic model appendix b established by wang et al 2014 after calculation the fixed investment c us and the operation and maintenance cost o us a can be directly related to the reservoir depth d m the area of the storage site a km2 and the injection rate m t d as followed 4 c 981560 3447 4227 d 867113 a 5 o 220521 93 1152 4805 d 276100 59 a 8 4942 m a where the injection rates m t d of pure co2 and impure co2 with 10 mol n2 are set to 273 9 t d and 291 2 t d respectively to store the same total amount of co2 the levelized cost for the co2 storage in deep saline aquifers can be obtained according to eq b 5 and eq b 6 the injection time and the monitoring time after injection are set to 2 a and 10 a respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the simulation model the co2 n2 o2 mixture densities and viscosities and the gas solubilities calculated using the eqs a 1 a 12 and the parameters in table a 1 were compared to experimental data reported in the literatures table 4 and table 5 the relative deviation rd and the average absolute deviation aad are defined by 6 rd 100 m cal m exp m exp a a d 100 a b s r d n where n is the number of points in table 4 and table 5 4 1 1 density the comparison on density of co2 n2 o2 mixtures between experimental data and calculated results is shown in fig 5 the positive deviations indicate that the predicted result overestimates the densities of co2 n2 o2 mixtures for the co2 mixtures with a purity of more than 80 mol the relative deviations can reach about 80 however when the temperature and pressure are far away from the critical point of co2 7 3 mpa 31 c the calculated densities have a relatively good agreement with the experimental data fig 5d shows that 75 of the deviations are less than 10 and almost 95 of the deviations are less than 20 moreover the average absolute deviations aad between calculation results and the experimental data from different sources are all less than 10 18 table 4 when the mole fraction of co2 is less than 50 mol the calculations are found to be more accurate with an aad of 2 08 it can be inferred that the large relative deviations might be caused by the sharply changed densities of co2 when the compared points are in the vicinity of the supercritical region of co2 generally the predicting model can provide a relatively reasonable calculation for the density of co2 n2 o2 mixtures 4 1 2 viscosity due to the lack of experimental viscosity data of co2 n2 o2 mixtures the model results are only compared to the experimental viscosities of a co2 mixture with 5 mol o2 ibrahim 2013 the positive deviations in fig 6 denote that the empirical function of temperature from chung et al 1988 overestimates the viscosities of co2 o2 mixtures however the experimental data are still reproduced with an average absolute deviation aad of 10 62 table 4 with the temperatures above 50 c and the pressures from 15 to 35 mpa the calculated viscosities from the predicting model can be more accurate and the relative deviations are less than 5 therefore the capability of the predicting model to calculate co2 n2 o2 mixture viscosities can be considered reliable preliminarily 4 1 3 solubility firstly the predicted solubilities of pure gases are compared to the experimental data while a large number of experimental solubility data are available for co2 limited data are found for n2 and o2 fig 7 shows that the relative deviations are unstable and range from 45 to 32 however according to the average absolute deviations in table 5 the deviations of the gas solubilities in water are generally smaller than those in nacl solutions large gaps only exist between the calculation results and a few experimental data sources fig 7d shows that 75 of the deviations are less than 10 and almost 95 of the deviations are less than 20 moreover the average absolute deviations of the solubilities of co2 n2 and o2 are less than 7 07 6 52 and 4 79 respectively it indicates that the predicting model can be used for the solubility calculation of pure co2 n2 and o2 unlike the quantity of the experimental data sources for pure gases only one reference liu et al 2012 is found to validate the predicted solubilities of co2 n2 mixtures the experimental solubilities in pure water are reproduced with an average absolute deviation aad less than 7 7 when co2 n2 mixtures dissolve in solutions with a salt molality of 0 068 m nacl the aad of co2 solubilities is 5 8 while the aad of n2 solubilities is up to 26 99 fig 8 as predictions are strongly dependent on the availability and quality of experimental data more experimental data are needed to validate and optimize the capability of the predicting model calculating the solubilities of co2 n2 o2 mixtures in pure water and nacl solutions 4 1 4 flow and transport using the actual injection rate in the project a total of 0 2 million tons co2 is injected into the model within 2 years time lapse vsp data of the shihezi formation from the monitoring well mw2 in shenhua ccs site chen et al 2014 are used to validate the migration of pure co2 in the 2d model due to the lack of detailed data on permeability of shihezi formation we apply three ratios of horizontal permeability to vertical permeability kh kv in the simulations to compare the migration of co2 lei et al 2016 fig 9 shows that the distribution pattern of co2 plume is significantly affected by vertical permeability with higher vertical permeability co2 is more likely to migrate upward driven by the buoyance force it can be seen that the horizontal migration distance of co2 in the model with the permeability ratio of 100 0 is about 280 m which is the closest to the estimation of time lapse vsp thus in this study the vertical permeability is assumed to be 0 73 md which can provide a more reasonable prediction for the distribution of co2 plume 4 2 impurity effects on the density and viscosity of co2 streams density and viscosity are decisive factors for the mobility of co2 streams and the density can directly affect the pore space required for gaseous co2 per unit mass thus before simulating the migration and dissolution of the injected fluid densities and viscosities of the gases are calculated firstly from the pr eos and the empirical function chung et al 1988 respectively to investigate the effects of n2 and o2 on these two fluid properties fig 10 shows the effects of n2 and o2 on the density of co2 streams according to the relative deviations fig 10b c and d the densities of the two co2 mixtures can be 10 to 50 lower than that of pure co2 and the reduction in density increases with the mole fractions of impurities wang et al 2015 de dios et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 this is because impurities n2 and o2 are less dense than co2 at the same temperature and pressure conditions fig 10a for instance moreover the density reduction of both the two co2 mixtures has a maximum at a certain pressure it has been proposed by wang et al 2012 that the maximums correspond to the crossing points where the volume change rates of pure and impure co2 are equal this is consistent with the results calculated from pr eos in fig 10b c and d for example at 55 c the minimal negative relative deviations of mix1 and mix2 occur at 11 4 and 10 9 mpa respectively which are also the pressures that the curves of the volume change rate of mix1 and mix2 crosses that of pure co2 the maximum reduction in the density of supercritical co2 streams means the largest increment in the pore space required for gaseous co2 fig 11 shows the effects of n2 and o2 on the viscosity of co2 streams when the pressure approaches the critical point of pure co2 7 3 mpa it can be clearly seen that the viscosities decrease with increasing impurity concentration level ibrahim 2013 nicot et al 2013 this is mainly related to the variation of density it can be understood by the fact that co2 streams with greater density will have larger internal friction among molecules therefore the relative deviations of viscosity shown in fig 11b resemble those of density according to the results above increasing the geological storage temperature and pressure can alleviate the reduction in both the density and viscosity of co2 streams brought by n2 and o2 4 3 impurity effects on the spread of supercritical co2 streams as mentioned in section 1 currently the relationships between the co2 storage efficiency and the behavior of impure co2 in deep saline aquifers are unclear in this study mix1 mix2 and pure co2 are injected into the model for 2 years respectively to investigate the effects of n2 and o2 on the migration and dissolution of co2 4 3 1 impurity effects on co2 migration comparing the distribution of co2 plume in the three scenarios it is found that the impurities n2 and o2 increase both the vertical and horizontal distribution ranges of gas phase fig 12 a c and e for example for mix1 at 2 years the gas phase with saturation above 0 01 has reached 42 3 m and 343 5 m in the vertical and horizontal direction respectively while the vertical and horizontal migration distance in the pure co2 scenario are 37 0 m and 271 6 m respectively this agrees with the simulation results of lei et al 2016 li et al 2017a and li et al 2017b in this study the three scenarios have the same injection rates of co2 hence a higher impurity concentration level results in a greater injection rate and a greater pressure gradient to drive the fluid fig 12b d and f besides the larger spatial extent of gaseous co2 is also related to the lower density and viscosity of the co2 mixtures the former promotes the buoyancy force while the latter reduces the flow resistance in this context the vertical and horizontal extent of both gaseous and dissolved co2 are expanded by the impurities n2 and o2 fig 13 this would increase the amount of dissolved co2 as the increased gas aqueous interface is more favorable for co2 dissolution 4 3 2 partitioning phenomenon between co2 and the impurities fig 14 shows the concentration distribution of n2 and o2 in gas and aqueous phases different from the distribution pattern of gaseous co2 the mass fraction of n2 and o2 in the leading edge of the gas phase can be up to 90 and 10 respectively which are much higher than those in the original mixtures similarly higher concentration of the dissolved n2 and o2 are also found in the leading edge but due to the grid effects the gaseous and dissolved n2 and o2 in the leading edge are shown as many small blobs rather than a continuous band this partitioning phenomenon is mainly due to the higher solubility of co2 than that of n2 and o2 lei et al 2016 li et al 2017a 2017b bachu and bennion 2009 since more co2 dissolves when gas phase displaces aqueous phase the concentrations of n2 and o2 in the gas phase will be higher it is known that the density of co2 n2 o2 mixtures is lower with higher impurity concentration thus the partitioning phenomenon might decrease the average density of gaseous co2 for the injected mixtures which is defined in section 3 2 as ρ c o 2 g m i x to investigate the effect of the partitioning phenomenon on the average density of gaseous co2 the densities of gaseous co2 in mix2 before injection are compared with the average densities of gaseous co2 after injection at different storage temperature and pressure conditions fig 15 the average density of gaseous co2 in the model are calculated based on the simulation results of the scenarios injecting mix2 and pure co2 while the density of gaseous co2 before injection are calculated from pr eos fig 15b shows that the average density of gaseous co2 in pure state after injection are a little higher than the density of gaseous co2 before injection at the same storage conditions this is because the injection leads to pressure buildup in reservoirs it can be seen in fig 10a that the densities of co2 streams increase with pressure in this context if there is no partitioning phenomenon during the migration the average density of gaseous co2 in mix2 after injection should also be higher than the density of gaseous co2 before injection however on the contrary fig 15a shows that the average density of gaseous co2 after injection are lower than the density of gaseous co2 before injection it indicates that partitioning phenomenon between co2 and n2 decreases the average density of gaseous co2 for the injected mixtures by raising the impurity concentrations 4 4 impurity effects on the co2 storage efficiency and costs 4 4 1 variation of the gas volume and dissolved amount of co2 as mentioned in section 3 1 2 mix2 are used in the scenarios to quantify the impurity effect on co2 storage efficiency at different storage temperature and pressure conditions when the same amount of co2 is injected into the reservoir the relative deviations in the pore volume occupied by co2 can directly reflect the effect of 10 mol n2 on co2 storage efficiency in this study the pore volume occupied by gas phase v g is calculated from eq 2 2 fig 16 a shows that the pore space needed by mix2 with 10 mol n2 is at least 32 larger than that of pure co2 the maximal volume increments of the occupied pore space can be 55 46 and 41 in the scenarios of 55 65 and 75 c respectively it means that n2 with a mole fraction of 10 can reduce the co2 storage efficiency by nearly half and significantly increase the leakage risk of co2 the larger pore volume required for injected co2 the higher probability of co2 plume encountering an escape path on the other hand the presence of 10 mol n2 also increased the amounts of dissolved co2 m c o 2 a q eq 2 3 fig 16b dissolved co2 barely moves if the flow velocity of formation water is significantly small and the dissolution of co2 also barely affects the solution volume therefore the increased amount of dissolved co2 is beneficial to both the co2 storage efficiency and safety it is noteworthy that in this study above 15 mpa and 55 c with increasing pressure and higher temperature the volume increase by the impurities n2 can be alleviated while the amount increase of dissolved co2 is maintained that is to say with increasing depth higher temperatures and pressures can reduce the adverse effects of impurity n2 and retain the benefits 4 4 2 normalized co2 storage capacity fig 17 shows the normalized co2 storage capacity nc of mix2 calculated from eqs 1 3 the nc of eq 1 and eq 2 are both determined by the ratio of gaseous co2 density in the mixture to that in the pure state eq 1 assumes that all the co2 stored in the reservoir is in a supercritical state and the composition of the gas mixture is the same at every point in the pore space for a co2 mixture with 10 mol n2 the nc varies from 0 63 to 0 82 and there is a minimum at a certain pressure which denotes the maximum reduction in co2 storage efficiency wang et al 2012 2015 ziabakhsh ganji and kooi 2014 the definition of nc in eq 2 is similar to that in eq 1 however the density of gaseous co2 in eq 2 is calculated based on the simulation results thus the effect of the partitioning phenomenon fig 14 is also taken into consideration the lower nc from eq 2 indicates that impurity effects of n2 on the co2 storage efficiency are underestimated by eq 1 the reason is that the average density of gaseous co2 in mixtures is lowered further after injection due to the partitioning phenomenon moreover since the effects of dissolved gases on the solution volume are negligible in eq 3 the pore volume occupied by gaseous co2 is regarded as the storage space taken by all co2 phases because the presence of n2 increase the amount of dissolved co2 fig 16b the calculated nc is a little higher than the results of eq 2 overall the comparison of the normalized co2 storage capacity reveals that the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and n2 has a negative effect on the co2 storage efficiency while the enhanced co2 dissolution by n2 shows a positive effect besides at a given temperature the pressures corresponding the maximal reduction in co2 storage capacity calculated from the three equations are the same they all indicate that increasing the storage depth will alleviate the adverse effects brought by impurity n2 4 4 3 cost analysis of the co2 storage in deep saline aquifers in this study we have applied the engineering economic model appendix b established by wang et al 2014 to calculate the co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers for two major scenarios injecting pure co2 and injecting impure co2 with 10 mol n2 into the deep saline aquifers based on the data from the shenhua ccs site scenarios with different formation temperatures and pressures are also considered in table 6 the depth of the reservoir is calculated from the formation pressure with a gradient of 1 mpa 100 m it can be seen that for the different storage conditions table 6 the increase in co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers by the 10 mol n2 is generally less than 0 01 us t co2 which is nearly negligible compared to the cost savings from the co capture of co2 and air related impurities however for the co2 transportation system of the shenhua project to achieve the goal of injecting 0 1 million tons impure co2 with 10 mol n2 the increased transportation distance of the compressed gas tankers would be about 8000 km then the increase in transportation cost caused by 10 mol n2 is about 160 us t co2 in this context the co storage of co2 with 10 mol n2 for the shenhua ccs project is not a cost effective way but it may work for a project storing co2 in deep saline aquifers and using pipeline transportation systems 5 conclusions this work aims to minimize the costs of co2 geological storage in deep saline aquifers and has studied the economic possibility of the co capture and the co storage of co2 with the air related impurities the major outcomes include the following 1 a new module modified from eos7c and eco2n was incorporated into tough2 after the validation it proves that the new module can provide a relatively reasonable calculation for the thermo physical properties of co2 n2 o2 mixtures the prediction of the distribution characteristics of the co2 streams by the established 2d model is also consistent with other experimental and simulation studies 2 through considering and simulating the migration and dissolution processes of the impure and pure co2 comprehensively it is found that 10 mol n2 in the co2 mixture increases the pore space required for the same amount of co2 by 32 at least in this study above 15 mpa and 55 c higher pressure and temperature in reservoirs can alleviate the reduction of co2 storage efficiency by n2 while retain the benefit of n2 on the co2 dissolution efficiency 3 the increase in co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers at the shenhua ccs site by the 10 mol n2 is less than 0 01 us t co2 the other reservoir temperatures and pressures set in this work shows little effects on the cost increment but it also can be seen that the cost increments increase with the temperature and decrease with the increasing pressure however the economic feasibility of the co capture and the co storage of co2 with 10 mol n2 in the shenhua ccs project is hindered by the co2 transportation system since the impurity n2 with a mole fraction of 10 can increase the transportation cost significantly in this work although the new module is verified with limited experimental data to be capable of calculating the density viscosity and solubility of co2 n2 o2 mixtures with the average absolute deviations aad less than 11 its accuracy still needs to be further improved since the fluid thermophysical fluid properties are crucial for the reliability of simulation results besides the geometry and the heterogeneity of reservoirs and other processes such as the convective mixing that affecting the flow and dissolution of impure co2 will also be considered in the future credit authorship contribution statement ying yu conceptualization investigation methodology

4604,carbon capture and storage ccs is one of the key technologies for reducing co2 emissions but it has suffered from the high costs for the purification of captured co2 streams storing co2 with two major impurities i e n2 and o2 in geological formations would be more economical however the cost savings might be offset by the reduced co2 storage efficiency to understand the relationships between the reduced co2 storage efficiency and the co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 storage efficiency and co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers are evaluated we established a 2d model by developing a new module incorporated into tough2 to simulate the migration and dissolution of co2 n2 o2 mixtures in aquifers based on the hydrogeological conditions of the shenhua ccs site in china it is found that the partitioning between co2 and the impurities during migration can reduce co2 storage efficiency by raising impurity concentrations in gas phase but higher pressure and temperature in reservoirs can alleviate the reduction of co2 storage efficiency while retaining the benefit of the impurities on the co2 dissolution efficiency with 10 mol n2 the co2 storage efficiency is decreased by at least 32 while the co2 storage cost in saline aquifers is increased less than 0 01 us t co2 keywords carbon capture and storage impurity deep saline aquifers co2 storage efficiency co2 storage cost numerical simulation 1 introduction in the background of global warming and climate change carbon capture and storage ccs has been widely approved as a key technology for reducing co2 emissions and alleviating greenhouse gas effect intergovernmental panel on climate change 2005 international energy agency 2013 li and yu 2020 among the various methods of storage that have been proposed co2 geological storage has drawn tremendous attention due to its permanency and huge potential capacity the suitable geological formations for co2 storage can be mainly divided into two categories depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and deep saline aquifers bachu 2008 xu et al 2020 by comparison deep saline aquifers are ubiquitously distributed around the world and easier to be found near the co2 emission sources wu 2013 over the period from 2030 to 2050 the estimated storage share of co2 in deep saline aquifers can reach 66 to 88 international energy agency 2008 however unlike the co2 geological storage projects involving oil or gas recovery storing co2 in deep saline aquifers does not produce direct economic benefits for which seeking the economic feasibility and minimizing the costs are more crucial problems a full chain of co2 capture and geological storage in deep saline aquifers includes three components capture separation and compression transportation and storage injection and monitor taken together the key points affecting the total cost of the project can come down to two major factors 1 the impurities in the raw co2 flue gas 2 the transportation modes and distance rubin et al 2005 2007 jakobsen et al 2011 2017 especially the representative costs of capturing co2 dependent on the capture technologies i e the species and concentrations of the impurities varying from 12 to 44 us t co2 dominates nearly 75 of the final cost intergovernmental panel on climate change 2005 wu 2013 however it has been proved that very high purity co2 may not be required in some scenarios to give examples for the enhanced oil recovery eor projects in kinder morgan and weyburn the injected co2 volume fraction are 95 and 96 respectively de visser et al 2008 but the impurities generally have deleterious impact on the transportation and the storage of co2 in deep saline aquifers li et al 2019 such as corrosion in pipelines and decrease in storage capacity ieaghg 2004 2011 matuszewski and woods 2012 which may incur additional costs the key issue is to find the economic balance between the savings in capture costs and the possible increase in transportation and storage costs in the different co2 capture technologies e g pre combustion post combustion and oxy fuel combustion the widest possible range of impurities is present in oxy fuel combustion ieaghg 2004 kather 2009 kather and kownatzki 2011 porter et al 2017 have modelled three different purification processes on the raw co2 streams 1 1 from this point forward the term co2 stream is used when referring to the captured co2 including impurities while the term co2 or injected co2 means pure co2 posch and haider 2012 captured from oxy fuel combustion the process only involving compression and dehydration produces co2 with a purity of 77 69 mol while the major impurities are n2 and o2 the costs to achieve higher co2 purity of 96 61 and 99 99 mol are about 38 56 and 53 47 us t co2 respectively skaugen et al 2016 have reported that 5 mol impurities n2 and o2 and 10 mol impurities n2 and ch4 can bring increases of 2 7 and 4 5 us t co2 in pipeline transportation cost respectively based on an on shore transportation distance of 500 km in this context the additional cost incurred by impurities n2 and o2 on co2 pipeline transportation may be less than one tenth of the savings in capture costs which makes the co capture and co storage of co2 with the impurities n2 and o2 seems quite attractive however to our best knowledge there has no published study investigating the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers according to the cost analysis of co2 geological storage by heddle et al 2003 and united states environmental protection agency 2008 wang et al 2014 have established an engineering economic model for the co2 storage in deep saline aquifers which indicates the major factors affecting storage cost 1 the number of wells 2 the area of storage site and 3 the depth of target reservoirs more specifically the calculation mainly involves the co2 thermo physical properties and the reservoir characteristics since there is yet no evidence that impurities n2 and o2 can significantly change reservoir properties in co2 geological storage conditions lu et al 2014 2016 pearce et al 2019 the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers are then directly related to the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 thermo physical properties it is well known that n2 and o2 are much less dense than co2 at the same temperature and pressure conditions which would increase the molar volume and the mobility of co2 streams this not only may affect the calculation of well numbers but also decrease the co2 storage efficiency defined as the mass of injected co2 per unit pore volume in this paper and hence changes the area of storage site co2 storage mechanisms in deep saline aquifers can be divided into physical trapping solubility trapping and mineral trapping which correspond to three states of co2 supercritical co2 the supercritical is occasionally referred to as gas or gaseous for simplicity below dissolved co2 and co2 in mineral phase the dissolution of co2 starts almost immediately after the co2 injection while co2 mineral trapping requires a very long time scale and the co2 in mineral phase is the transformation product of dissolved co2 the total amount of gaseous and dissolved co2 which can be accommodated by the target saline aquifers represents actually the final co2 storage capacity of a specific storage site the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the storage efficiency of gaseous co2 have been characterized by the density ratio of impure and pure co2 wang et al 2012 while the effects on the storage efficiency of dissolved co2 have been calculated from the co2 solubility and the corresponding brine density ziabakhsh ganji and kooi 2014 however the differences of multiphase flow and dissolution process in target reservoirs between the impure and pure co2 should also be considered the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and impurities shows that n2 and o2 with higher concentrations dominate the leading edge of the co2 plume bachu and bennion 2009 lei et al 2016 li et al 2017a 2017b this might lead to additional increase of the pore volume occupied by gases because the molar volume of co2 mixtures increases with the concentrations of n2 and o2 besides the expanded distribution range enhances the dissolution of co2 li et al 2017a 2017b which would increase the co2 solubility trapping capacity but to our knowledge there is no published study yet on the extent of impurities n2 and o2 affecting the storage efficiency of injected co2 by comprehensively considering and simulating the migration and dissolution processes of the impure and pure co2 the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effects of impurities n2 and o2 on the co2 storage efficiency and co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers according to the discussion above we firstly assess the impact of impurities n2 and o2 on co2 geological storage efficiency by establishing a 2d model to simulate the migration and dissolution of co2 n2 o2 mixtures in aquifers using a new module yu 2018 incorporated into tough2 and based on the hydrogeological conditions at the shenhua ccs site in ordos basin we compare the evaluation results under different formation temperature and pressure conditions then the simulation results are applied to the engineering economic model to evaluate the fixed investment and the cost of operation and maintenance at the shenhua ccs site for the pure and impure co2 storage in deep saline aquifers 2 shenhua ccs site 2 1 shenhua ccs project shenhua ccs project in ordos basin is 38 km southeast of ordos city inner mongolia china fig 1 it was initiated by shenhua group and achieved its goal of injecting 0 1 million tons mt co2 per year into the deep saline aquifers the injected co2 is provided by china shenhua coal liquefaction co ltd csclc which is a subsidiary company of shenhua group the 1080 kt a coal liquefaction project of csclc can release total 3 1 mt co2 per year discharged from the cold methanol wash unit of the coal liquefaction process the raw co2 stream mainly consists of 88 8 vol co2 and 10 9 vol n2 table 1 by virtue of the procedures such as condensation and distillation the co2 purity can be up to 99 2 vol the operation cost for the separation and purification processes is estimated to be 28 us t co2 by zhang et al 2016 these costs may be saved by the co capture of the co2 and n2 since the shenhua ccs project is a pilot scale storage project and only 14 km northwest of the co2 source the pipeline transportation would be too wasteful intergovernmental panel on climate change 2005 the co2 captured in csclc is transported to the storage site by five liquified natural gas tankers with a temperature of 20 c and a pressure of 2 mpa in this condition the volume of 0 1 mt impure co2 with 10 mol n2 is about 10 times that of pure co2 which would significantly increase the total transportation cost if we choose the 60 m3 compressed natural gas tankers with a temperature of 20 c and a pressure of 10 mpa assuming the transportation cost for pure co2 is 19 9 us t co2 100 km the increase in transportation cost caused by 10 mol n2 is about 2 2 us t co2 100 km 2 2 hydrogeological characteristics of the research area ordos basin is a large sedimentary basin with an area of about 2 5 105 km2 which experienced multiple tectonic movements but still has long term overall stability the sedimentary formations quaternary tertiary cretaceous jurassic triassic permian carboniferous and ordovician from top to bottom are continuously deposited or belong to pseudo conformity contact while the angular unconformity only exists at the edge of the basin the ordos basin is also a huge groundwater basin in which several aquifer systems with different characteristics are overlapped or laterally linked cut and interconnected in space these aquifer systems from top to bottom include the cenozoic unconsolidated aquifer system cretaceous clastic rock porous fractured aquifer system carboniferous jurassic fractured clastic aquifer system and cambrian ordovician carbonate karst aquifer system wang et al 2005 at depths from 1 to 3 km the water movement in the sandstone and carbonate aquifers of ordovician to jurassic age is quite slow and basically in a stagnant state fig 2 b which can provide a relatively stable hydrogeological environment for co2 geological storage the south slope of yimeng uplift belt in ordos basin is where the shenhua ccs site has located it is a monoclinal structure with a dip angle less than 1 fig 2a in monoclinal structures the injected supercritical co2 streams will move as plume within the formation driven by buoyancy and hydrodynamic force based on the known hydrogeological data and the results of seismic exploration within the burial depth from 1 6 to 2 5 km liujiagou formation shiqianfeng formation shihezi formation and shanxi formation of ordovician to triassic age are selected as potential reservoirs for shenhua ccs project fig 2c 3 methodology 3 1 modelling approach 3 1 1 simulation tool tough2 is a numerical simulation program that can reproduce and predict the multiphase flow of multicomponent fluids in porous and fractured media it has a modular architecture that allows the main module to interface with different fluid property modules according to different needs the fluid property modules can calculate the thermophysical properties for specific fluid mixtures only through several primary thermodynamic variables in this study we establish a new module to simulate the flow and transport of co2 n2 o2 mixtures in deep saline aquifers for the new module the primary variables are determined by the phase composition of co2 n2 o2 mixtures under the investigated pressure and temperature conditions consulting the study of co2 streams captured from oxyfuel combustion kather and kownatzki 2011 mix1 80 co2 17 n2 3 o2 mix2 90 co2 10 n2 and pure co2 representing the low purity medium purity and high purity respectively are selected for the calculation of phase diagram of co2 n2 o2 mixtures by the peng robinson equation of state pr eos peng and robinson 1976 see appendix a in this study the proportions used in mix1 and mix2 all indicate mole fractions fig 3 shows that the impurity effects on the phase behaviors are conspicuous including the formation of two phase regions and the alternation of critical properties the mix1 deviates pure co2 more significantly decreases the critical temperature by about 15 c and increases the critical pressure by about 5 mpa it can be seen that either in the p t range between the two straight lines possessing most interest for co2 geological storage spycher et al 2003 or under the simulation conditions in this study co2 n2 o2 mixtures are non condensable gases meanwhile the formation water is modelled as nacl solution consisted of nacl and h2o thus the fluid system involves five components co2 n2 o2 h2o and nacl and two phases gas and aqueous eos7c oldenburg et al 2004 is a tough2 module that calculates the fluid properties for the systems of co2 ch4 tracer brine based on its composition of primary variables and the submodule zevsreal that can calculate real gas mixture properties we modified eos7c to simulate the co injection of co2 with n2 and o2 in addition the function of simulating the dissolution and precipitation of solid salt is transplanted from eco2n pruess and spycher 2007 which is a tough2 module for the calculation of fluid properties of co2 h2o nacl systems the primary thermodynamic variables of the new module modified from eos7c and eco2n are shown in table 2 for the thermophysical properties of the gas mixtures the calculation of density viscosity and solubility involves pr eos peng and robinson 1976 empirical function of chung et al 1988 and the fugacity activity model appendix a the governing equations in the main module of tough2 appendix a which turn to a set of coupled discrete equations with strong nonlinearity can be linearized and solved by newton raphson iteration method 3 1 2 model setup according to the actual injection of shenhua ccs project in ordos basin many features such as the geometry porosity and permeability of the major reservoirs can be used for the model setup however in order to capture the variation of co2 storage efficiency due to the impurity effects on the flow and dissolution of injected supercritical co2 streams we have made some simplifications a symmetric two dimensional radial model with the thickness of 100 m and an external radius of 5 km is abstracted from the shihezi formation fig 4 other simplifications include the assumption of isothermal conditions the homogenization of porosity and the simplification of permeability details pruess et al 2004 the model is divided into 10 layers evenly in the vertical direction and 101 radial grid elements with logarithmically increasing sizes from left to right in the radial direction at the left boundary a vertical injection well is modelled as a column of circular grid elements with the radius of 0 2 m and the injection interval is the lowermost 40 m of the reservoir the right boundary consists of grid elements with a large volume of 1050 m3 so that their thermodynamic conditions do not change from fluid exchange with finite size blocks in the flow domain xu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 since the common porosity and permeability of the overlying and underlying mudstone are smaller than 1 and 1 md wu 2013 respectively the top and bottom boundaries of the model are set to be impermeable based on the logging data of the injection well fig 2c shihezi formation is located at a depth from 1990 to 2232 m with a temperature of 64 82 c due to the interbedding of the sandstone and mudstone the model thickness abstracted from shihezi formation is set to be 100 m and the burial depth is assumed to be 2100 to 2200 m thus the hydrostatic fluid pressure of the model is 21 22 mpa from top to bottom when the formation pressure gradient is 100 bar km the average geothermal gradient in the central ordos basin is 2 32 c 100 m and the lowest is only 1 3 c 100 m in the northern part of the basin wang et al 2004 hence we assume an isothermal condition in the simulations the porosity and permeability are set to be the maximums of the available data cao et al 2007 xie et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 25 and 73 md respectively to represent the well developed fractures and reduce the impacts of pressure build up due to the injection of co2 streams wu 2013 the average salinity of the formation water is only 14 g l which is sufficiently small that it is set to be zero in our work the parameters in relative permeability and capillary pressure model were taken from oldenburg et al 2001 table 3 referring to the actual injection of shenhua project pure co2 is injected into the model at a constant rate of 3 17 kg s for 2 years to keep the same total amount of co2 injected the injection rates of co2 n2 and o2 for mix1 are set to be 3 17 kg s 0 4 kg s and 0 07 kg s respectively the injection rates of co2 and o2 for mix2 are 3 17 kg s and 0 2 kg s respectively since the proportions in mix1and mix2 are mole fractions a conversion is done here to get the mass flow rates for each gas component in addition in most practical ccs operations including shenhua ccs project the maximal mole fraction of impurity n2 is about 10 while the content of o2 is very limited hence mix2 is used to quantify the impurity effects on co2 storage efficiency at different storage conditions the simulations are conducted under the temperatures of 55 65 and 75 c and the pressures from 9 to 21 mpa fig 3 3 2 quantifying the impurity effects on the co2 storage efficiency wang et al 2012 and ziabakhsh ganji and kooi 2014 have focused on the impurity effects on the storage capacity of co2 sequestrated by structural trapping assuming all the injected co2 is stored as supercritical fluid they have quantified the impurity effects on the storage efficiency of gaseous co2 by a normalized co2 storage capacity nc 1 nc g pr ρ mix x c o 2 ρ 0 where ρ mix and ρ 0 are the density of the impure and pure co2 respectively since x c o 2 is the mass fraction of co2 in the impure co2 ρ mix x c o 2 can be viewed as the density of gaseous co2 in the gas mixture wang et al 2012 and ziabakhsh ganji and kooi 2014 have calculated the normalized storage capacity for gaseous co2 nc g pr according to the pr eos directly with given temperature pressure and impurity concentration levels however the actual density of gaseous co2 is not uniform in the entire reservoir because of the formation pressure gradient and the disturbance by co2 injection especially as mentioned above due to the solubility difference of co2 and the impurities with higher impurity level in gas phase the average density of gaseous co2 in the gas mixture might be decreased by the partitioning phenomenon in this context using the density of gaseous co2 calculated from pr eos to quantify the impurity effects on the storage efficiency of gaseous co2 may be not accurate enough hence in this study we aim to determine how impurities n2 and o2 affect the co2 storage efficiency based on simulation results based on the simulation results in this study we can sum the mass of gaseous co2 and the pore volume occupied by the gas phase over all the grid blocks in the model respectively as m c o 2 g eq 2 1 and v g eq 2 2 also the mass of dissolved co2 can be calculated as m c o 2 a q eq 2 3 the subscript n is the index of grids superscripts g and aq denote the gas phase and aqueous phase respectively ϕ v s and ρ are the porosity grid volume phase saturation and phase density respectively y co 2 is the mass fraction of co2 in gas phase and x co 2 is the mass fraction of co2 in aqueous phase for the two scenarios of injecting impure and pure co2 the average densities of gaseous co2 are written as ρ c o 2 g m i x m c o 2 g mix v g mix and ρ c o 2 g 0 m c o 2 g 0 v g 0 respectively the superscript mix and 0 are used to distinguish these two scenarios then similarly the normalized storage capacity for gaseous co2 is defined as 2 nc g ρ c o 2 g mix ρ c o 2 g 0 2 1 m c o 2 g n ϕ n v n s n g ρ n g y n co 2 2 2 v g n ϕ n v n s n g 2 3 m c o 2 a q n ϕ n v n s n aq ρ n aq x n co 2 moreover because the effects of dissolved gases on the solution volume are negligible the pore volume occupied by gaseous co2 can be regarded as the storage space taken by all co2 phases as the same total amount of injected co2 0 2 million tons is used in all scenarios we can write the normalized storage capacity for total co2 as 3 nc t v g 0 v g mix in this paper the co2 storage efficiency is defined as the mass of injected co2 per unit pore volume the normalized co2 storage capacity is actually the ratio of the storage efficiency of impure co2 to pure co2 by comparing nc g pr and nc g we can investigate the effects of the partitioning phenomenon on the co2 storage efficiency also through comparing nc g and nc t the effects from the dissolution process on the co2 storage efficiency can be shown 3 3 evaluation of the co2 storage costs the cost analysis for the co2 storage in deep saline aquifers in this study is based on the shenhua ccs project and calculated from the engineering economic model appendix b established by wang et al 2014 after calculation the fixed investment c us and the operation and maintenance cost o us a can be directly related to the reservoir depth d m the area of the storage site a km2 and the injection rate m t d as followed 4 c 981560 3447 4227 d 867113 a 5 o 220521 93 1152 4805 d 276100 59 a 8 4942 m a where the injection rates m t d of pure co2 and impure co2 with 10 mol n2 are set to 273 9 t d and 291 2 t d respectively to store the same total amount of co2 the levelized cost for the co2 storage in deep saline aquifers can be obtained according to eq b 5 and eq b 6 the injection time and the monitoring time after injection are set to 2 a and 10 a respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the simulation model the co2 n2 o2 mixture densities and viscosities and the gas solubilities calculated using the eqs a 1 a 12 and the parameters in table a 1 were compared to experimental data reported in the literatures table 4 and table 5 the relative deviation rd and the average absolute deviation aad are defined by 6 rd 100 m cal m exp m exp a a d 100 a b s r d n where n is the number of points in table 4 and table 5 4 1 1 density the comparison on density of co2 n2 o2 mixtures between experimental data and calculated results is shown in fig 5 the positive deviations indicate that the predicted result overestimates the densities of co2 n2 o2 mixtures for the co2 mixtures with a purity of more than 80 mol the relative deviations can reach about 80 however when the temperature and pressure are far away from the critical point of co2 7 3 mpa 31 c the calculated densities have a relatively good agreement with the experimental data fig 5d shows that 75 of the deviations are less than 10 and almost 95 of the deviations are less than 20 moreover the average absolute deviations aad between calculation results and the experimental data from different sources are all less than 10 18 table 4 when the mole fraction of co2 is less than 50 mol the calculations are found to be more accurate with an aad of 2 08 it can be inferred that the large relative deviations might be caused by the sharply changed densities of co2 when the compared points are in the vicinity of the supercritical region of co2 generally the predicting model can provide a relatively reasonable calculation for the density of co2 n2 o2 mixtures 4 1 2 viscosity due to the lack of experimental viscosity data of co2 n2 o2 mixtures the model results are only compared to the experimental viscosities of a co2 mixture with 5 mol o2 ibrahim 2013 the positive deviations in fig 6 denote that the empirical function of temperature from chung et al 1988 overestimates the viscosities of co2 o2 mixtures however the experimental data are still reproduced with an average absolute deviation aad of 10 62 table 4 with the temperatures above 50 c and the pressures from 15 to 35 mpa the calculated viscosities from the predicting model can be more accurate and the relative deviations are less than 5 therefore the capability of the predicting model to calculate co2 n2 o2 mixture viscosities can be considered reliable preliminarily 4 1 3 solubility firstly the predicted solubilities of pure gases are compared to the experimental data while a large number of experimental solubility data are available for co2 limited data are found for n2 and o2 fig 7 shows that the relative deviations are unstable and range from 45 to 32 however according to the average absolute deviations in table 5 the deviations of the gas solubilities in water are generally smaller than those in nacl solutions large gaps only exist between the calculation results and a few experimental data sources fig 7d shows that 75 of the deviations are less than 10 and almost 95 of the deviations are less than 20 moreover the average absolute deviations of the solubilities of co2 n2 and o2 are less than 7 07 6 52 and 4 79 respectively it indicates that the predicting model can be used for the solubility calculation of pure co2 n2 and o2 unlike the quantity of the experimental data sources for pure gases only one reference liu et al 2012 is found to validate the predicted solubilities of co2 n2 mixtures the experimental solubilities in pure water are reproduced with an average absolute deviation aad less than 7 7 when co2 n2 mixtures dissolve in solutions with a salt molality of 0 068 m nacl the aad of co2 solubilities is 5 8 while the aad of n2 solubilities is up to 26 99 fig 8 as predictions are strongly dependent on the availability and quality of experimental data more experimental data are needed to validate and optimize the capability of the predicting model calculating the solubilities of co2 n2 o2 mixtures in pure water and nacl solutions 4 1 4 flow and transport using the actual injection rate in the project a total of 0 2 million tons co2 is injected into the model within 2 years time lapse vsp data of the shihezi formation from the monitoring well mw2 in shenhua ccs site chen et al 2014 are used to validate the migration of pure co2 in the 2d model due to the lack of detailed data on permeability of shihezi formation we apply three ratios of horizontal permeability to vertical permeability kh kv in the simulations to compare the migration of co2 lei et al 2016 fig 9 shows that the distribution pattern of co2 plume is significantly affected by vertical permeability with higher vertical permeability co2 is more likely to migrate upward driven by the buoyance force it can be seen that the horizontal migration distance of co2 in the model with the permeability ratio of 100 0 is about 280 m which is the closest to the estimation of time lapse vsp thus in this study the vertical permeability is assumed to be 0 73 md which can provide a more reasonable prediction for the distribution of co2 plume 4 2 impurity effects on the density and viscosity of co2 streams density and viscosity are decisive factors for the mobility of co2 streams and the density can directly affect the pore space required for gaseous co2 per unit mass thus before simulating the migration and dissolution of the injected fluid densities and viscosities of the gases are calculated firstly from the pr eos and the empirical function chung et al 1988 respectively to investigate the effects of n2 and o2 on these two fluid properties fig 10 shows the effects of n2 and o2 on the density of co2 streams according to the relative deviations fig 10b c and d the densities of the two co2 mixtures can be 10 to 50 lower than that of pure co2 and the reduction in density increases with the mole fractions of impurities wang et al 2015 de dios et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 this is because impurities n2 and o2 are less dense than co2 at the same temperature and pressure conditions fig 10a for instance moreover the density reduction of both the two co2 mixtures has a maximum at a certain pressure it has been proposed by wang et al 2012 that the maximums correspond to the crossing points where the volume change rates of pure and impure co2 are equal this is consistent with the results calculated from pr eos in fig 10b c and d for example at 55 c the minimal negative relative deviations of mix1 and mix2 occur at 11 4 and 10 9 mpa respectively which are also the pressures that the curves of the volume change rate of mix1 and mix2 crosses that of pure co2 the maximum reduction in the density of supercritical co2 streams means the largest increment in the pore space required for gaseous co2 fig 11 shows the effects of n2 and o2 on the viscosity of co2 streams when the pressure approaches the critical point of pure co2 7 3 mpa it can be clearly seen that the viscosities decrease with increasing impurity concentration level ibrahim 2013 nicot et al 2013 this is mainly related to the variation of density it can be understood by the fact that co2 streams with greater density will have larger internal friction among molecules therefore the relative deviations of viscosity shown in fig 11b resemble those of density according to the results above increasing the geological storage temperature and pressure can alleviate the reduction in both the density and viscosity of co2 streams brought by n2 and o2 4 3 impurity effects on the spread of supercritical co2 streams as mentioned in section 1 currently the relationships between the co2 storage efficiency and the behavior of impure co2 in deep saline aquifers are unclear in this study mix1 mix2 and pure co2 are injected into the model for 2 years respectively to investigate the effects of n2 and o2 on the migration and dissolution of co2 4 3 1 impurity effects on co2 migration comparing the distribution of co2 plume in the three scenarios it is found that the impurities n2 and o2 increase both the vertical and horizontal distribution ranges of gas phase fig 12 a c and e for example for mix1 at 2 years the gas phase with saturation above 0 01 has reached 42 3 m and 343 5 m in the vertical and horizontal direction respectively while the vertical and horizontal migration distance in the pure co2 scenario are 37 0 m and 271 6 m respectively this agrees with the simulation results of lei et al 2016 li et al 2017a and li et al 2017b in this study the three scenarios have the same injection rates of co2 hence a higher impurity concentration level results in a greater injection rate and a greater pressure gradient to drive the fluid fig 12b d and f besides the larger spatial extent of gaseous co2 is also related to the lower density and viscosity of the co2 mixtures the former promotes the buoyancy force while the latter reduces the flow resistance in this context the vertical and horizontal extent of both gaseous and dissolved co2 are expanded by the impurities n2 and o2 fig 13 this would increase the amount of dissolved co2 as the increased gas aqueous interface is more favorable for co2 dissolution 4 3 2 partitioning phenomenon between co2 and the impurities fig 14 shows the concentration distribution of n2 and o2 in gas and aqueous phases different from the distribution pattern of gaseous co2 the mass fraction of n2 and o2 in the leading edge of the gas phase can be up to 90 and 10 respectively which are much higher than those in the original mixtures similarly higher concentration of the dissolved n2 and o2 are also found in the leading edge but due to the grid effects the gaseous and dissolved n2 and o2 in the leading edge are shown as many small blobs rather than a continuous band this partitioning phenomenon is mainly due to the higher solubility of co2 than that of n2 and o2 lei et al 2016 li et al 2017a 2017b bachu and bennion 2009 since more co2 dissolves when gas phase displaces aqueous phase the concentrations of n2 and o2 in the gas phase will be higher it is known that the density of co2 n2 o2 mixtures is lower with higher impurity concentration thus the partitioning phenomenon might decrease the average density of gaseous co2 for the injected mixtures which is defined in section 3 2 as ρ c o 2 g m i x to investigate the effect of the partitioning phenomenon on the average density of gaseous co2 the densities of gaseous co2 in mix2 before injection are compared with the average densities of gaseous co2 after injection at different storage temperature and pressure conditions fig 15 the average density of gaseous co2 in the model are calculated based on the simulation results of the scenarios injecting mix2 and pure co2 while the density of gaseous co2 before injection are calculated from pr eos fig 15b shows that the average density of gaseous co2 in pure state after injection are a little higher than the density of gaseous co2 before injection at the same storage conditions this is because the injection leads to pressure buildup in reservoirs it can be seen in fig 10a that the densities of co2 streams increase with pressure in this context if there is no partitioning phenomenon during the migration the average density of gaseous co2 in mix2 after injection should also be higher than the density of gaseous co2 before injection however on the contrary fig 15a shows that the average density of gaseous co2 after injection are lower than the density of gaseous co2 before injection it indicates that partitioning phenomenon between co2 and n2 decreases the average density of gaseous co2 for the injected mixtures by raising the impurity concentrations 4 4 impurity effects on the co2 storage efficiency and costs 4 4 1 variation of the gas volume and dissolved amount of co2 as mentioned in section 3 1 2 mix2 are used in the scenarios to quantify the impurity effect on co2 storage efficiency at different storage temperature and pressure conditions when the same amount of co2 is injected into the reservoir the relative deviations in the pore volume occupied by co2 can directly reflect the effect of 10 mol n2 on co2 storage efficiency in this study the pore volume occupied by gas phase v g is calculated from eq 2 2 fig 16 a shows that the pore space needed by mix2 with 10 mol n2 is at least 32 larger than that of pure co2 the maximal volume increments of the occupied pore space can be 55 46 and 41 in the scenarios of 55 65 and 75 c respectively it means that n2 with a mole fraction of 10 can reduce the co2 storage efficiency by nearly half and significantly increase the leakage risk of co2 the larger pore volume required for injected co2 the higher probability of co2 plume encountering an escape path on the other hand the presence of 10 mol n2 also increased the amounts of dissolved co2 m c o 2 a q eq 2 3 fig 16b dissolved co2 barely moves if the flow velocity of formation water is significantly small and the dissolution of co2 also barely affects the solution volume therefore the increased amount of dissolved co2 is beneficial to both the co2 storage efficiency and safety it is noteworthy that in this study above 15 mpa and 55 c with increasing pressure and higher temperature the volume increase by the impurities n2 can be alleviated while the amount increase of dissolved co2 is maintained that is to say with increasing depth higher temperatures and pressures can reduce the adverse effects of impurity n2 and retain the benefits 4 4 2 normalized co2 storage capacity fig 17 shows the normalized co2 storage capacity nc of mix2 calculated from eqs 1 3 the nc of eq 1 and eq 2 are both determined by the ratio of gaseous co2 density in the mixture to that in the pure state eq 1 assumes that all the co2 stored in the reservoir is in a supercritical state and the composition of the gas mixture is the same at every point in the pore space for a co2 mixture with 10 mol n2 the nc varies from 0 63 to 0 82 and there is a minimum at a certain pressure which denotes the maximum reduction in co2 storage efficiency wang et al 2012 2015 ziabakhsh ganji and kooi 2014 the definition of nc in eq 2 is similar to that in eq 1 however the density of gaseous co2 in eq 2 is calculated based on the simulation results thus the effect of the partitioning phenomenon fig 14 is also taken into consideration the lower nc from eq 2 indicates that impurity effects of n2 on the co2 storage efficiency are underestimated by eq 1 the reason is that the average density of gaseous co2 in mixtures is lowered further after injection due to the partitioning phenomenon moreover since the effects of dissolved gases on the solution volume are negligible in eq 3 the pore volume occupied by gaseous co2 is regarded as the storage space taken by all co2 phases because the presence of n2 increase the amount of dissolved co2 fig 16b the calculated nc is a little higher than the results of eq 2 overall the comparison of the normalized co2 storage capacity reveals that the partitioning phenomenon between co2 and n2 has a negative effect on the co2 storage efficiency while the enhanced co2 dissolution by n2 shows a positive effect besides at a given temperature the pressures corresponding the maximal reduction in co2 storage capacity calculated from the three equations are the same they all indicate that increasing the storage depth will alleviate the adverse effects brought by impurity n2 4 4 3 cost analysis of the co2 storage in deep saline aquifers in this study we have applied the engineering economic model appendix b established by wang et al 2014 to calculate the co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers for two major scenarios injecting pure co2 and injecting impure co2 with 10 mol n2 into the deep saline aquifers based on the data from the shenhua ccs site scenarios with different formation temperatures and pressures are also considered in table 6 the depth of the reservoir is calculated from the formation pressure with a gradient of 1 mpa 100 m it can be seen that for the different storage conditions table 6 the increase in co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers by the 10 mol n2 is generally less than 0 01 us t co2 which is nearly negligible compared to the cost savings from the co capture of co2 and air related impurities however for the co2 transportation system of the shenhua project to achieve the goal of injecting 0 1 million tons impure co2 with 10 mol n2 the increased transportation distance of the compressed gas tankers would be about 8000 km then the increase in transportation cost caused by 10 mol n2 is about 160 us t co2 in this context the co storage of co2 with 10 mol n2 for the shenhua ccs project is not a cost effective way but it may work for a project storing co2 in deep saline aquifers and using pipeline transportation systems 5 conclusions this work aims to minimize the costs of co2 geological storage in deep saline aquifers and has studied the economic possibility of the co capture and the co storage of co2 with the air related impurities the major outcomes include the following 1 a new module modified from eos7c and eco2n was incorporated into tough2 after the validation it proves that the new module can provide a relatively reasonable calculation for the thermo physical properties of co2 n2 o2 mixtures the prediction of the distribution characteristics of the co2 streams by the established 2d model is also consistent with other experimental and simulation studies 2 through considering and simulating the migration and dissolution processes of the impure and pure co2 comprehensively it is found that 10 mol n2 in the co2 mixture increases the pore space required for the same amount of co2 by 32 at least in this study above 15 mpa and 55 c higher pressure and temperature in reservoirs can alleviate the reduction of co2 storage efficiency by n2 while retain the benefit of n2 on the co2 dissolution efficiency 3 the increase in co2 storage costs in deep saline aquifers at the shenhua ccs site by the 10 mol n2 is less than 0 01 us t co2 the other reservoir temperatures and pressures set in this work shows little effects on the cost increment but it also can be seen that the cost increments increase with the temperature and decrease with the increasing pressure however the economic feasibility of the co capture and the co storage of co2 with 10 mol n2 in the shenhua ccs project is hindered by the co2 transportation system since the impurity n2 with a mole fraction of 10 can increase the transportation cost significantly in this work although the new module is verified with limited experimental data to be capable of calculating the density viscosity and solubility of co2 n2 o2 mixtures with the average absolute deviations aad less than 11 its accuracy still needs to be further improved since the fluid thermophysical fluid properties are crucial for the reliability of simulation results besides the geometry and the heterogeneity of reservoirs and other processes such as the convective mixing that affecting the flow and dissolution of impure co2 will also be considered in the future credit authorship contribution statement ying yu conceptualization investigation methodology

weight of component i z m is the compressibility factor of the gas mixture the viscosity calculation of gas mixtures is referring to chung et al 1988 the fugacity activity model based on thermodynamic equilibrium is applied to calculate the mutual solubilities taking the co2 dissolution in water as an example the equilibrium constant k co 2 is written as a 7 k co 2 a co 2 f co 2 a 8 a co 2 55 508 γ
