optimal results offer abundant schemes to decision makers by trading off benefit and risk in addition from the comparison between single objective and multiobjective model the multiobjective model shows better practicality due to more reasonable water allocation in critical water demand period of crops these results can effectively contribute to the local irrigation water management and ecological restoration keywords crop water allocation interval nonlinear multiobjective programming fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming uncertainty 1 introduction due to the water pollution and increasing water demand in recent years water shortage occurs in many countries which calls for higher water use efficiency in agricultural production especially in arid and semi arid areas kosolapova et al 2017 agriculture is one of the major water consuming sector in most of the countries for instance water used in agriculture accounts for about 62 4 of total use in ministry of water resources china the bulletin of water resources of china 2016 therefore how to enhance the efficiency of agriculture water use and allocate irrigation water reasonably are challenges faced by decision makers dms in planning agriculture water allocation schemes however the process of developing allocation schemes is often accompanied by multiple uncertainties nonlinear and conflicting objectives due to the complexity in irrigation in many previous researches optimization models were considered as effective ways to help dms manage water resources liu et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a b therefore many optimization models including linear programming models nonlinear programming models single objective programming models and multiobjective programming models etc were formulated to obtain satisfactory water allocation schemes li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 nasirigheidari et al 2017 in practical problems it is usually required to optimize several nonlinear and conflicting objectives simultaneously among existing approaches nonlinear multiobjective programming nmp models show good performance in dealing with such problems sakawa and kato 2003 han et al 2014 dalman 2016 due to multiple uncertainties existing in water allocation systems various uncertain optimization models have been used to tackle uncertainties in optimization problems guo et al 2009 tan et al 2017 xie et al 2017 however few researches made attempts to introduce these uncertainties into the nmp optimization process to handle the uncertainties nonlinear and conflicting objectives at the same time in water allocation system thus a nonlinear multiobjective programming model with multiple uncertainties will be developed based on nmp and existing uncertain techniques to address the nonlinearity and conflicting objectives under uncertainty in this study the wide application of uncertainty techniques make it possible for irrigation water managers to obtain more realistic allocation schemes li et al 2015a b usually uncertainties in precipitation and hydrological data for irrigation were represented by interval fuzzy models in the optimization process zhang and guo 2017 as one of the fuzzy programming models fuzzy credibility constrained programming fcp was proved an effective tool to address irrigation water allocation problems with fuzzy constraints zhang et al 2017a b but conventional fuzzy set in fcp was over simplified and thus limited its utilization when the membership function is difficult to determine jin and huang 2014 therefore the fuzzy interval set method veiseh et al 2017 is integrated with fcp for better describing the characteristics of membership interval uncertainties in irrigation water allocation the fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming ficp is thus formulated to help dms identify more practical irrigation water allocation schemes as the factors above are taken into account the interval nonlinear multiobjective programming model with fuzzy interval credibility constraint fic inmp will be developed for irrigation water allocation there are many methods to solve nmp models such as fuzzy goal programming approach and fuzzy weighted programming approach zhang et al 2004 lachhwani 2012 li et al 2017a b but none of them can effectively solve fic inmp model when the uncertainties are introduced into nmp therefore an interval fuzzy weighted ifw method integrating fuzzy weighted programming approach and interval zimmermann fuzzy method will be applied to fic inmp model for optimal allocation schemes this study aims to develop a fic inmp model and propose corresponding solving method ifw method for supporting irrigation water management under multiple uncertainties the framework of study system is shown in fig 1 through the developed model integrated concerns of different dms normal growth of crops local water balance and uncertainties can be fully considered in the optimization the monthly water sensitive weights based on water production function is first introduced into the model to value the monthly importance of water demand fic inmp model and ifw method are applied to the yingke irrigation district to plan main crop monthly irrigation to illustrate its applicability 2 research methodology 2 1 fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming ficp proposed by liu et al in 2002 liu and liu 2002 the fuzzy credibility constrained programming fcp has been widely used to handle optimization problems whose coefficients and parameters are fuzzy li et al 2015a b zeng et al 2014 fcp can provide dms abundant schemes via examining the tradeoffs among satisfaction of constraints under different credibility levels zhang and guo 2017 a typical fcp model can be shown as follows 1a m a x f i 1 i c i x i subject to 1b c r i 1 i a i x i b λ 1c x i 0 i 1 i where xi represent the non fuzzy decision variable ci denotes the coefficients a i and b are fuzzy coefficients with deterministic membership functions which can be expressed as a i a 1 i a 2 i a 3 i and b b 1 b 2 b 3 if they are triangular fuzzy numbers λ denotes the credibility level i denotes the number of decision variables even though fcp model is effective for many fuzzy problems it cannot address optimization problems whose coefficients and parameters presenting more complex uncertainties because the membership functions of current fcp model are totally crisp for example when decision makers objective cognition towards statistical data featured as fuzzy set without knowing the crisp membership functions the conventional fcp model cannot handle uncertainties fuzzy interval sets in right hand sides of constraint hence the fuzzy interval sets fis were considered an extension of the traditional method to process such problems veiseh et al 2017 this method is more complex but better reflects the uncertainties in some practical situation fuzzy interval membership functions can give fcp model more comprehensive characteristics of uncertain data differing from the traditional fuzzy numbers a triangular fuzzy number with interval value bound is shown in fig 2 and can be denoted by m m 1 m 2 m 3 m 1 m 1 m 2 m 2 m 2 m 2 when the membership function of fuzzy number b in fcp featured fis and the coefficients a i featured as interval value a i the typical fcp become fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming ficp ficp can be written as 1d m a x f i 1 i c i x i subject to 1e c r i 1 i a i x i b λ 1f x i 0 i 1 i where b is fuzzy coefficient with fuzzy interval membership function b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2 b 2 b 2 and a i are interval coefficients with upper and lower bound a i a i a i following the methods in solving fcp c r i 1 i a i x i b λ in 1e can be transferred as follows 1g c r i 1 i a i x i b 1 i f i 1 i a i x i b 1 2 b 2 b 1 i 1 i a i x i 2 b 2 b 1 i f b 1 i 1 i a i x i b 2 i 1 i a i x i b 3 2 b 3 b 2 i f b 2 i 1 i a i x i b 3 0 i f i 1 i a i x i b 3 in reality the significant credibility level λ should be greater than 0 5 thus for each 0 5 λ 1 we have 1h c r i 1 i a i x i b 2 b 2 b 1 i 1 i a i x i 2 b 2 b 1 λ then 1i i 1 i a i x i b 2 1 2 λ b 2 b 1 through above conversion the ficp model is transformed into an interval linear programming model which can be solved by two step method easily although ficp model can tackle uncertainties expressed as fis in membership function of fcp constraint it cannot deal with conflicting and nonlinear objectives simultaneously posing a considerable obstacle to practical 2 2 interval nonlinear multiobjective programming model with fuzzy interval credibility constraint fic inmp to deal with above concerns an interval nonlinear multiobjective programming model with fuzzy interval credibility constraint fic inmp is proposed the model is formulated as follows 2a max f x i max f 1 x i f 2 x i f n x i subject to 2b c r i 1 i a i x i b λ 2c c i x i d i 2d x i 0 where n is the number of the nonlinear objectives and i is the number of variables x i is a vector of interval decision variables f n x i is nonlinear objective a i c i and d i are the interval coefficients of constraints b is the fuzzy interval coefficient λ is a specified credibility level for constraint 2b although the developed model fic inmp can handle interval nonlinear multiobjective as well as uncertainties expressed as fuzzy interval sets in right hand sides of constraint existing methods cannot effectively solve such model therefore a new solving method based on some classic solving methods for solving fic inmp will be illustrated in detail as follows 2 3 interval fuzzy weighted method for solving fic inmp model fuzzy weighted fw method was proved a useful tool to solve nonlinear multiobjective problems which make it possible for dms to weight the different importance of each objective in optimization hota et al 2000 zhang et al 2004 however fw method cannot process interval coefficients and fuzzy interval credibility constraint at the same time thence the model solving ideas in interval zimmermann fuzzy method lence et al 2017 zimmermann 1978 for solving interval linear multiobjective problems was introduced into fw method resulting in interval fuzzy weighted ifw method for solving fic inmp model the detailed steps of ifw method is presented as follows step 1 after formulating the fic inmp model transform fuzzy interval credibility constraints into interval linear constraints as eqs 1i shows step 2 obtain the typical interval linear constraints under each certain credibility level λ hence the fic inmp model is divided as several inmp models which can be solved by following steps step 3 convert every interval set m of inmp model using the equation m m r δ m where δ m m m and r 0 1 step 4 transform each objective function into a minimized one and the min operator in fwm is used to solve the model step 5 calculate the best value of each minimum objective f n λ m i n step 6 flexible range of satisfaction in fw method can be obtained via judging the sign of the f n λ m i n if f n λ m i n 0 flexible range of satisfaction is f n λ m i n δ n f n λ m i n if f n λ m i n 0 flexible range of satisfaction is f n λ m i n δ n f n λ m i n where δ n is elasticity coefficient of each objective step 7 if flexible range of satisfaction is f n λ m i n δ n f n λ m i n membership functions for each objective of inmp can be defined as follows 3a γ f n λ x 1 i f f n λ x f n λ min f n λ min δ n f n λ min f n λ x δ n f n λ min i f f n min f n λ x f n λ min δ n f n λ min 0 i f f n λ min δ n f n λ min f n λ x step 8 with the help of membership functions in step 7 inmp model can be converted into an interval nonlinear programming inp model with the single objective as follows 3b max n 1 n k n γ n λ subject to 3c f n λ x i γ n λ δ n f p λ min f n λ min δ n f n λ min 3d i 1 i a i x i r λ 3e c i x i d i 3f x i 0 step 9 two step method for inp is used to solve above problem by decomposing the inp model into two sub models step 10 solve the sub model corresponding to the upper bound of objective and then solve the other model step 11 calculate every inmp model under different credibilities levels by step 3 10 and the final solution of fic inmp model would be generated 3 case study 3 1 study area and problem statement yingke irrigation district yid is a sub area of the zhangye city 100 17 100 34 e 38 50 38 58 n which is the third largest irrigation areas in the middle reach of heihe river basin northwest china fig 3 jiang et al 2016 the heihe river basin has a typical temperate continental climate characterized by low and irregular rainfall high evaporation and long sunshine duration as with other river basins in northwestern china it faces serious water shortages due to climate change population growth and the rapid socio economic development the middle reach basin is the major water user of whole heihe river basin where agricultural irrigation consumes about 90 of the total water available li et al 2016 crops including corn seed corn and field corn wheat and economic crops are mainly planted in yid among these corn and wheat account for 83 of the total planted area which are mainly irrigated by surface water therefore when the supply of surface water is insufficient or untimely due to seasonal variations groundwater is extracted to supplement agriculture irrigation increasing water demand of other water use sectors and decreasing surface water inflow are jointly causing the over exploitation of groundwater which is leading to groundwater levels decline and ecological damage thence how to optimally allocate the limited water resources by a sustainable and reasonable way have become a challenge faced by dms at each level in the process of water allocation optimization among crops marginal utility of irrigation water main concern of dms from different levels normal growth of crops and uncertainties existing in agricultural systems make it more complicated to obtain appropriate schemes it is meaningful for local dms obtain suitable allocation schemes considering all the factors obviously 3 2 data collection and processing to obtain the optimization schemes of crop water allocation all three main crops wheat w seed corn s and field corn f of yid were taken into account in addition to match the growth period of selected crops the allocation time period is from april to september moreover more inputs parameters including related coefficients of water balance available surface water irrigation water demand experimental data processing of different crops and other relevant parameters can be stated in detail as follows 3 2 1 water balance and available surface water to avoid deepening the environmental damage water circulation and balance in yid should be taken into consideration when planning water allocation schemes the main water balance process of yid can be roughly described as fig 4 the detail related coefficients of water balance are cited from previous study li et al 2017a b although precipitation plays a minor role in the process of crop growth it is meaningful to local water circulation and balance fig 5 shows the statistical data of effective precipitation from april to september during 1951 2017 collected from zhangye no 52562 metrological station which is characterized as fuzzy interval number crops in yid are mainly irrigated by surface water which can be well described by fuzzy interval number due to years of statistical data characteristics yid surface water consumption accounts for 9 of the water throughout heihe river and selected crops account for 69 of total available surface water in yid the amount of available surface water is shown in fig 6 3 2 2 data related to selected crops in this study interval quadratic water production function iqwpf was chosen to simulate the relationship between cropland irrigation water and crop yield due to existence of marginal utility and uncertainties the iqwpf and price and planting area of three crops can be obtained from previous researches and field research jiang et al 2016 li et al 2017a b which can be seen in table 1 in order to represent the important degree of the water demand in each month monthly water sensitive weights based on jensen model are introduced into this study jensen model was a effective method to reflect crop yields linked to sensitivity of monthly water shortage jerisen 1968 zhang et al 2013 after obtained the sensitivity index of crop via jensen model monthly water sensitive weights can be calculated by eq 4 sensitivity index monthly water sensitive weights and minimum irrigation water demand of each crop are shown in table 2 4 μ t λ t t 1 t λ t where μ t is the water sensitive weights in month t λ t is the sensitivity index of crop in month t as the basis of allocation irrigation water demand is calculated by the equation e t c k c e t 0 allen 1998 where etc is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm day et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day kc is the crop coefficient which can be obtained from previous studies jiang et al 2014 kang et al 2003 daily reference evapotranspiration can be obtained by the fao 56 penman monteith method based on the meteorological data from zhangye meteorological station no 52562 during 1951 2017 the monthly crop evapotranspiration can be calculated by the sum of daily value of each month the monthly minimum irrigation water demand interval thus can be obtained under 90 confidence in table 2 3 3 model establishment in this study marginal benefit of crop water consumption concerns of different stakeholders and the crop water demand in different growth period were fully considered via multiple objectives in addition fuzzy interval uncertainty in measuring amounts of surface water and rainfall as well as interval uncertainty in economic parameters were well characterized a fic inmp model was tailored for obtaining reasonable water allocation schemes as follows 5a max f 1 i 1 3 a i b i a i t 1 6 s w i t g w i t 2 b i t 1 6 s w i t g w

and irrigation water use coefficients respectively μ i t denotes the weights of irrigation water important degree to crop i in month t is an interval with lower and upper bounds and superscripts are

underground aquifer δ h t is change of groundwater level in month t mm e t c i t represents the minimum crop water requirement of crop i in month t mm 4 results analysis and discussion the developed fic inmp model was solved by ifwm described in the section of research methodology in this study the credibility level λ changed from 0 5 to 1 and the weights of objectives are 0 35 0 35 and 0 3 respectively fig 7 shows the upper u and lower l bounds of crop water allocation results under different credibility levels during whole growth period the total water allocation trends of three crops increase firstly and then reduce along with the month the main water consumption period of three crops wheat seed corn and field corn is in may july and july respectively which well match the sensitive weights of them and thus ensure the crop growth normally in addition among three crops wheat occupies a disadvantageous position in water allocation process because of its lower water productivity and price comparing with other crops on the contrary other two crops show obvious advantages via coordinating three objectives according to the optimal results in fig 7 it is noteworthy that seed corn is mainly irrigated by groundwater while field corn is surface water which can help dms formulate suitable irrigation strategy fig 8 presents the total water allocation results consisted by different crops and different sources of water in whole growth period total yield and benefit by developed model under different credibility levels with the increasing of credibility level the total amount of available water decreased significantly it can be seen in fig 8 a that water balance constraint can help maintain groundwater level and protect local ecological health through decreasing the available groundwater in crop irrigation furthermore fig 8 a shows that the total water allocation results of three crops in whole growth period have the continuous trend of decrease along with the credibility level increasing fig 8 b indicates that total yield obtained declines sharply as credibility level increase especially from 0 7 to 1 this means that the decreasing of available irrigation water including surface water and groundwater has begun to significantly affect the yield of three crops when the credibility greater than 0 7 on the contrary the total benefit obtained can maintain a stable level after a significantly reduced from 0 5 to 0 6 of credibility level that may relate to the quadratic form of crop irrigation production functions in optimization process the loss caused by crop yield reduction close to the fees saved from irrigation water decreasing as shown in fig 9 the benefit per unit water and irrigation water productivity of each crop and total value of these two parameters under different credibility levels have the diametrically opposed trend from the parameters in fig 8 because parameters in fig 9 can reflect the water distribution efficiency under different credibility levels the obtained optimal results illustrate that the conservative estimate of water available contribute to more effective allocation of irrigation water resources credibility level directly affects the not only available water but also irrigation water allocation results and system efficiency the comparison of water distribution efficiency was made between the developed multiobjective model m and a single objective model s with same objective as 5a in fig 10 it seems that the single objective model is the better choice for crop water allocation from the results in fig 10 however the benefit and crop yield of single objective are harder to achieve than multiobjective one because of the irrational water distribution within the crop growth period to explain this problem in detail wheat was selected as an example in fig 11 although may is the most important growth period among four months it can hardly receive enough attention in the process of allocation by single objective model which threaten the normal growth of wheat therefore the allocation schemes obtained by multiobjective model can meet crop water requirements in key growth period well and thus it can help dms in better way to planning irrigation water resources in summary fic inmp model can obtain water allocation schemes not only coordinating three objectives under interval and fuzzy interval uncertainty but also fully considering the normal growth of crops and concerns from different dms in planning crop water abundant allocation schemes can be calculated under different credibility levels which can support dms more choices when such uncertainties exist in water resources system moreover credibility levels can be considered as a characterization of risk in this study large credibility level represents low risk level which can provide dms intuitive indicators to trade off benefit and risk these efforts made by developed model are helpful for local dms in yid also the obtained water allocation schemes can serve as a reference for crop water resources allocation practices for similar arid and semi arid areas 5 conclusion an fic inmp model is developed by integrating interval nonlinear multiobjective programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming for supporting crop water allocation under multiple uncertainties in this study the developed model can effectively handle not only inputs uncertainties including interval uncertainties and fuzzy uncertainties with fuzzy interval membership function but also nonlinearities in the multiobjective function to reflect the effect of marginal utility in crop planting process in addition ifw method is proposed for solving fic inmp model to demonstrate the performance of fic inmp model and ifw method the developed model and method are applied to a case study in yingke irrigation district which located in the middle reaches of heihe river basin northwest china through considering key factors including concerns of different decision maker s normal growth of crops and local water circulation of irrigation in the process of allocating limited water to different crops a series of monthly crop irrigation water allocation results under different credibility levels are generated the obtained results from the case study indicate that 1 the ifw method can solve fic inmp model effectively 2 the abundant optimal water allocation schemes obtained can help local dms plan appropriate water allocation strategy under different risk tolerance 3 the results obtained by developed multiobjective model are more practical than single objective with the same constraints in allocating irrigation water among crops this study makes an attempt to integrate interval nonlinear multiobjective programming model and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming model within an irrigation water management framework for supporting better irrigation water allocation schemes moreover the developed model and proposed solving method could be applied to other water allocation problems as well as other optimal problems to obtained satisfactory schemes nevertheless fic inmp model can hardly take more meaningful detail information into consideration such as managers experience and knowledge these should be taken into account in the future

uncertainties expressed as fis in membership function of fcp constraint it cannot deal with conflicting and nonlinear objectives simultaneously posing a considerable obstacle to practical 2 2 interval nonlinear multiobjective programming model with fuzzy interval credibility constraint fic inmp to deal with above concerns an interval nonlinear multiobjective programming model with fuzzy interval credibility constraint fic inmp is proposed the model is formulated as follows 2a max f x i max f 1 x i f 2 x i f n x i subject to 2b c r i 1 i a i x i b λ 2c c i x i d i 2d x i 0 where n is the number of the nonlinear objectives and i is the number of variables x i is a vector of interval decision variables f n x i is nonlinear objective a i c i and d i are the interval coefficients of constraints b is the fuzzy interval coefficient λ is a specified credibility level for constraint 2b although the developed model fic inmp can handle interval nonlinear multiobjective as well as uncertainties expressed as fuzzy interval sets in right hand sides of constraint existing methods cannot effectively solve such model therefore a new solving method based on some classic solving methods for solving fic inmp will be illustrated in detail as follows 2 3 interval fuzzy weighted method for solving fic inmp model fuzzy weighted fw method was proved a useful tool to solve nonlinear multiobjective problems which make it possible for dms to weight the different importance of each objective in optimization hota et al 2000 zhang et al 2004 however fw method cannot process interval coefficients and fuzzy interval credibility constraint at the same time thence the model solving ideas in interval zimmermann fuzzy method lence et al 2017 zimmermann 1978 for solving interval linear multiobjective problems was introduced into fw method resulting in interval fuzzy weighted ifw method for solving fic inmp model the detailed steps of ifw method is presented as follows step 1 after formulating the fic inmp model transform fuzzy interval credibility constraints into interval linear constraints as eqs 1i shows step 2 obtain the typical interval linear constraints under each certain credibility level λ hence the fic inmp model is divided as several inmp models which can be solved by following steps step 3 convert every interval set m of inmp model using the equation m m r δ m where δ m m m and r 0 1 step 4 transform each objective function into a minimized one and the min operator in fwm is used to solve the model step 5 calculate the best value of each minimum objective f n λ m i n step 6 flexible range of satisfaction in fw method can be obtained via judging the sign of the f n λ m i n if f n λ m i n 0 flexible range of satisfaction is f n λ m i n δ n f n λ m i n if f n λ m i n 0 flexible range of satisfaction is f n λ m i n δ n f n λ m i n where δ n is elasticity coefficient of each objective step 7 if flexible range of satisfaction is f n λ m i n δ n f n λ m i n membership functions for each objective of inmp can be defined as follows 3a γ f n λ x 1 i f f n λ x f n λ min f n λ min δ n f n λ min f n λ x δ n f n λ min i f f n min f n λ x f n λ min δ n f n λ min 0 i f f n λ min δ n f n λ min f n λ x step 8 with the help of membership functions in step 7 inmp model can be converted into an interval nonlinear programming inp model with the single objective as follows 3b max n 1 n k n γ n λ subject to 3c f n λ x i γ n λ δ n f p λ min f n λ min δ n f n λ min 3d i 1 i a i x i r λ 3e c i x i d i 3f x i 0 step 9 two step method for inp is used to solve above problem by decomposing the inp model into two sub models step 10 solve the sub model corresponding to the upper bound of objective and then solve the other model step 11 calculate every inmp model under different credibilities levels by step 3 10 and the final solution of fic inmp model would be generated 3 case study 3 1 study area and problem statement yingke irrigation district yid is a sub area of the zhangye city 100 17 100 34 e 38 50 38 58 n which is the third largest irrigation areas in the middle reach of heihe river basin northwest china fig 3 jiang et al 2016 the heihe river basin has a typical temperate continental climate characterized by low and irregular rainfall high evaporation and long sunshine duration as with other river basins in northwestern china it faces serious water shortages due to climate change population growth and the rapid socio economic development the middle reach basin is the major water user of whole heihe river basin where agricultural irrigation consumes about 90 of the total water available li et al 2016 crops including corn seed corn and field corn wheat and economic crops are mainly planted in yid among these corn and wheat account for 83 of the total planted area which are mainly irrigated by surface water therefore when the supply of surface water is insufficient or untimely due to seasonal variations groundwater is extracted to supplement agriculture irrigation increasing water demand of other water use sectors and decreasing surface water inflow are jointly causing the over exploitation of groundwater which is leading to groundwater levels decline and ecological damage thence how to optimally allocate the limited water resources by a sustainable and reasonable way have become a challenge faced by dms at each level in the process of water allocation optimization among crops marginal utility of irrigation water main concern of dms from different levels normal growth of crops and uncertainties existing in agricultural systems make it more complicated to obtain appropriate schemes it is meaningful for local dms obtain suitable allocation schemes considering all the factors obviously 3 2 data collection and processing to obtain the optimization schemes of crop water allocation all three main crops wheat w seed corn s and field corn f of yid were taken into account in addition to match the growth period of selected crops the allocation time period is from april to september moreover more inputs parameters including related coefficients of water balance available surface water irrigation water demand experimental data processing of different crops and other relevant parameters can be stated in detail as follows 3 2 1 water balance and available surface water to avoid deepening the environmental damage water circulation and balance in yid should be taken into consideration when planning water allocation schemes the main water balance process of yid can be roughly described as fig 4 the detail related coefficients of water balance are cited from previous study li et al 2017a b although precipitation plays a minor role in the process of crop growth it is meaningful to local water circulation and balance fig 5 shows the statistical data of effective precipitation from april to september during 1951 2017 collected from zhangye no 52562 metrological station which is characterized as fuzzy interval number crops in yid are mainly irrigated by surface water which can be well described by fuzzy interval number due to years of statistical data characteristics yid surface water consumption accounts for 9 of the water throughout heihe river and selected crops account for 69 of total available surface water in yid the amount of available surface water is shown in fig 6 3 2 2 data related to selected crops in this study interval quadratic water production function iqwpf was chosen to simulate the relationship between cropland irrigation water and crop yield due to existence of marginal utility and uncertainties the iqwpf and price and planting area of three crops can be obtained from previous researches and field research jiang et al 2016 li et al 2017a b which can be seen in table 1 in order to represent the important degree of the water demand in each month monthly water sensitive weights based on jensen model are introduced into this study jensen model was a effective method to reflect crop yields linked to sensitivity of monthly water shortage jerisen 1968 zhang et al 2013 after obtained the sensitivity index of crop via jensen model monthly water sensitive weights can be calculated by eq 4 sensitivity index monthly water sensitive weights and minimum irrigation water demand of each crop are shown in table 2 4 μ t λ t t 1 t λ t where μ t is the water sensitive weights in month t λ t is the sensitivity index of crop in month t as the basis of allocation irrigation water demand is calculated by the equation e t c k c e t 0 allen 1998 where etc is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm day et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day kc is the crop coefficient which can be obtained from previous studies jiang et al 2014 kang et al 2003 daily reference evapotranspiration can be obtained by the fao 56 penman monteith method based on the meteorological data from zhangye meteorological station no 52562 during 1951 2017 the monthly crop evapotranspiration can be calculated by the sum of daily value of each month the monthly minimum irrigation water demand interval thus can be obtained under 90 confidence in table 2 3 3 model establishment in this study marginal benefit of crop water consumption concerns of different stakeholders and the crop water demand in different growth period were fully considered via multiple objectives in addition fuzzy interval uncertainty in measuring amounts of surface water and rainfall as well as interval uncertainty in economic parameters were well characterized a fic inmp model was tailored for obtaining reasonable water allocation schemes as follows 5a max f 1 i 1 3 a i b i a i t 1 6 s w i t g w i t 2 b i t 1 6 s w i t g w

fic inmp model was solved by ifwm described in the section of research methodology in this study the credibility level λ changed from 0 5 to 1 and the weights of objectives are 0 35 0 35 and 0 3 respectively fig 7 shows the upper u and lower l bounds of crop water allocation results under different credibility levels during whole growth period the total water allocation trends of three crops increase firstly and then reduce along with the month the main water consumption period of three crops wheat seed corn and field corn is in may july and july respectively which well match the sensitive weights of them and thus ensure the crop growth normally in addition among three crops wheat occupies a disadvantageous position in water allocation process because of its lower water productivity and price comparing with other crops on the contrary other two crops show obvious advantages via coordinating three objectives according to the optimal results in fig 7 it is noteworthy that seed corn is mainly irrigated by groundwater while field corn is surface water which can help dms formulate suitable irrigation strategy fig 8 presents the total water allocation results consisted by different crops and different sources of water in whole growth period total yield and benefit by developed model under different credibility levels with the increasing of credibility level the total amount of available water decreased significantly it can be seen in fig 8 a that water balance constraint can help maintain groundwater level and protect local ecological health through decreasing the available groundwater in crop irrigation furthermore fig 8 a shows that the total water allocation results of three crops in whole growth period have the continuous trend of decrease along with the credibility level increasing fig 8 b indicates that total yield obtained declines sharply as credibility level increase especially from 0 7 to 1 this means that the decreasing of available irrigation water including surface water and groundwater has begun to significantly affect the yield of three crops when the credibility greater than 0 7 on the contrary the total benefit obtained can maintain a stable level after a significantly reduced from 0 5 to 0 6 of credibility level that may relate to the quadratic form of crop irrigation production functions in optimization process the loss caused by crop yield reduction close to the fees saved from irrigation water decreasing as shown in fig 9 the benefit per unit water and irrigation water productivity of each crop and total value of these two parameters under different credibility levels have the diametrically opposed trend from the parameters in fig 8 because parameters in fig 9 can reflect the water distribution efficiency under different credibility levels the obtained optimal results illustrate that the conservative estimate of water available contribute to more effective allocation of irrigation water resources credibility level directly affects the not only available water but also irrigation water allocation results and system efficiency the comparison of water distribution efficiency was made between the developed multiobjective model m and a single objective model s with same objective as 5a in fig 10 it seems that the single objective model is the better choice for crop water allocation from the results in fig 10 however the benefit and crop yield of single objective are harder to achieve than multiobjective one because of the irrational water distribution within the crop growth period to explain this problem in detail wheat was selected as an example in fig 11 although may is the most important growth period among four months it can hardly receive enough attention in the process of allocation by single objective model which threaten the normal growth of wheat therefore the allocation schemes obtained by multiobjective model can meet crop water requirements in key growth period well and thus it can help dms in better way to planning irrigation water resources in summary fic inmp model can obtain water allocation schemes not only coordinating three objectives under interval and fuzzy interval uncertainty but also fully considering the normal growth of crops and concerns from different dms in planning crop water abundant allocation schemes can be calculated under different credibility levels which can support dms more choices when such uncertainties exist in water resources system moreover credibility levels can be considered as a characterization of risk in this study large credibility level represents low risk level which can provide dms intuitive indicators to trade off benefit and risk these efforts made by developed model are helpful for local dms in yid also the obtained water allocation schemes can serve as a reference for crop water resources allocation practices for similar arid and semi arid areas 5 conclusion an fic inmp model is developed by integrating interval nonlinear multiobjective programming and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming for supporting crop water allocation under multiple uncertainties in this study the developed model can effectively handle not only inputs uncertainties including interval uncertainties and fuzzy uncertainties with fuzzy interval membership function but also nonlinearities in the multiobjective function to reflect the effect of marginal utility in crop planting process in addition ifw method is proposed for solving fic inmp model to demonstrate the performance of fic inmp model and ifw method the developed model and method are applied to a case study in yingke irrigation district which located in the middle reaches of heihe river basin northwest china through considering key factors including concerns of different decision maker s normal growth of crops and local water circulation of irrigation in the process of allocating limited water to different crops a series of monthly crop irrigation water allocation results under different credibility levels are generated the obtained results from the case study indicate that 1 the ifw method can solve fic inmp model effectively 2 the abundant optimal water allocation schemes obtained can help local dms plan appropriate water allocation strategy under different risk tolerance 3 the results obtained by developed multiobjective model are more practical than single objective with the same constraints in allocating irrigation water among crops this study makes an attempt to integrate interval nonlinear multiobjective programming model and fuzzy interval credibility constrained programming model within an irrigation water management framework for supporting better irrigation water allocation schemes moreover the developed model and proposed solving method could be applied to other water allocation problems as well as other optimal problems to obtained satisfactory schemes nevertheless fic inmp model can hardly take more meaningful detail information into consideration such as managers experience and knowledge these should be taken into account in the future

11346,the tensiometer represents an excellent instrument for measuring in situ soil water status however measuring soil matric potential requires a tensiometer reading system sensitive enough to accurately record the matric potential hence an instantaneous profile type experiment was conducted in the field to measure the soil matric potentials within a moisture range from saturation to field capacity after that matric potential soil moisture total potential gradient flow density and hydraulic conductivity were calculated and van genuchten equation parameters were estimated through inverse modeling this study aimed to test the bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer compared with the mercury manometer to measure the soil matric potential and to examine the differences related to the estimations of soil water content and to the associated variables in addition the study also aimed to evaluate soil hydraulic parameters by inverse modeling based on the matric potentials from each reading system bourdon pressure gauge replaces the hg manometer in the measurement of soil water matric potential within the moisture range from saturation to field capacity the use of digital tensiometer and bourdon pressure gauge reduced hydraulic conductivity by four and three times and flow density by approximately three and two times respectively at 6 kpa tension and therefore are not recommended for the estimation of these hydraulic parameters regardless of reading system used in the tensiometer inverse modeling estimates well van genuchten equation parameters and consequently soil water matric potential keywords tensiometer inverse modeling propagation of errors 1 introduction accurate evaluations of soil water status at different spatial and temporal scales is still a challenging task that has stimulated past and present research rallo et al 2018 the range of measurement accuracy repeatability response time and spatial resolution of specific sensors are important considerations for applications and analyses of soil water measurements or and wraith 2002 tensiometry despite requiring extensive maintenance and being limited to relatively wet conditions since it only measures until approximately 0 09 mpa is an accurate technique widely used to determine soil matric potential durner and or 2005 for that the tensiometer has presented itself as an excellent instrument for directly measuring soil water energy and allowing in situ measurements with sensitivity and accuracy of the results dependent on the type of manometer used using the tensiometer to measure soil water matric potential is frequently preferred over other types of soil moisture sensors due to its low cost easy use high measurement accuracy and possibility of electronic data acquisition through differential pressure transducers besides being a non destructive technique zazueta and xin 1994 with possibility of providing continuous moisture measurements without causing alteration in the soil wallhan 1939 since variables such as hydraulic conductivity have the highest values when the soil is saturated and consequently the highest flows through internal drainage occur at soil water contents close to saturation a good tensiometer reading system must be sensitive enough to accurately record soil matric potentials obviously errors associated to each reading system are propagated at higher or lower intensity in the estimates of other soil variables depending on soil matric potential the simplest tensiometers is represented by a mercury hg manometer this system is considered the most sensitive and accurate besides providing direct reading which causes it to be taken as a standard to assess other models but there is the disadvantage that hg is toxic to humans and poses risk of environmental contamination another measuring system the pressure gauge although it had been patented in france in the xix century by the engineer eugene bourdon çengel and boles 2006 comparatively to mercury hg manometer has recently been applied in tensiometers for use in agriculture according to brito et al 2009 in the determination of hydraulic conductivity through the instantaneous profile method experience has shown that the bourdon pressure gauge with the same full scale used in the present study does not allow detailed assessment of matric potential variation over time especially in the first hours of redistribution which correspond to the conditions of higher water content in the soil another alternative to the use of mercury was the introduction of digital tensiometers which use a pressure transducer marthaler et al 1983 as sensitive element to transmit a signal corresponding to the tension at the moment of reading which suggests a previous calibration of the device this signal is also digitally shown on the instrument s display marthaler et al 1983 point out a delay in the equilibrium between the water tension inside the tensiometer and the water tension in the soil over time other reading systems have been introduced in the market aimed at measuring matric potential in an easier faster and more accurate way and with capacity for measurements in a wide range of soil water potentials however each of these alternative systems has disadvantages which reduce their use depending on the conditions the high cost of acquisition and the need for specialized labor are some of the factors which restrict their use in the field making them limited to research in this context the study assumed that hypothesis that the reading systems bourdon pressure gauge and tensiometer with pressure transducer for the measurement of soil water matric potential due to their respective operating mechanisms produce errors that propagate to soil hydraulic functions and related parameters in comparison to the traditional mercury manometers therefore objective of this study was the assessment of two different devices to monitor soil matric potential alternative to the mercury manometer and to evaluate the effects of the precision readings on soil hydraulic functions and related parameters 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental layout the experiment was carried out in an argissolo amarelo empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecuária embrapa 2013 and tensiometers were installed in a circular experimental plot with diameter of 3 m and depth of 0 6 m following the procedures for hydraulic conductivity determination through the instantaneous profile method fig 1 the soil volume was delimited on the sides by a plastic canvas to avoid lateral subsurface flows hence to meet the method s boundary conditions water flow in the center of the plot was guaranteed to occur only in the vertical direction hillel et al 1972 undisturbed and disturbed soil samples were collected in the experimental plots for soil physical characterization disturbed samples were used to determine soil particle density by the volumetric flask method blake and hartge 1986a whereas undisturbed samples collected using an uhland soil sampler in 0 05 m high steel rings with a diameter of 0 05 m were used to determine soil water retention curve swrc and soil bulk density blake and hartge 1986b in the determination of swrc the water content at saturation was considered as equal to total soil porosity calculated with the values of soil bulk and particle densities for low tension points 0 002 0 004 0 006 0 008 and 0 01 mpa water content was determined by using haines funnel haines 1930 whereas the other points 0 033 0 1 0 7 and 1 5 mpa were determined in richards porous plate apparatus klute 1986 the curve was fitted according to the statistical model proposed by van genuchten 1980 the equation parameters for each soil layer were obtained using the software retc van genuchten et al 1991 by assuming the dependence between m and n m 1 1 n 2 2 construction and installation of tensiometers tensiometers were made using rigid pvc pipes with external and internal diameters of 0 021 and 0 016 m respectively and length corresponding to the installation depth plus 0 55 m above soil surface 0 20 m of pvc and 0 35 m of transparent acrylic tube the same instrument was equipped with the three reading systems so that all of them were subjected to the same conditions nylon tubing 0 002 m internal diameter glued to the pvc pipe fig 2 was used to connect the tensiometer to the hg container the bourdon pressure gauge had 760 mmhg full scale with divisions of 20 mmhg for measurements with the digital tensiometer the acrylic tubes were sealed using a silicon stopper the acrylic tube was covered by a pvc cap to avoid direct sunlight which would lead to differential dilation and consequently leaks through the stopper acrylic tube interface because of the way the tensiometer was built containing three reading systems in only one instrument and the sequence in which the readings were taken the systems are independent and do not interfere with one another after confirming perfect operation in the laboratory the tensiometers were installed in the field at soil profile depths of 0 20 0 35 and 0 50 m with six replicates totaling 18 devices after the procedure of wetting until saturation the plot was covered by a plastic canvas to avoid any water flow through the surface also to meet the boundary conditions of the instantaneous profile method libardi et al 1980 readings in the system were taken daily at 07 00 a m to avoid modifications in the equilibrium established between the air chamber located in the upper portion of the tensiometer water in the tensiometer and water in the soil readings were taken first in the hg manometer and then in the bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer at 0 35 m depth after assuming that drainage was negligible i e when the soil reached field capacity the experiment ended such condition was assumed when soil moisture variation rate over time dθ dt was 0 001 cm3 cm 3 d 1 fig 3 nascimento et al 2018 2 3 processing of readings data of tensiometers with hg manometer were obtained by measuring the hg column height in the nylon tubing for the bourdon pressure gauge readings were directly taken on the instrument s display and for the digital tensiometer with pressure transducer data were obtained by connecting the sensor to the air chamber using a needle to transfer the tension to the measuring device the errors of the hg manometer bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer were 1 20 and 0 076 mmhg respectively subsequently the readings were converted to matric potential φ m m through the following equations 1 ϕ m h g 12 6 h h g h c z 2 ϕ m b g l 0 0136 h v h c z 3 ϕ m d t l d 0 0136 h e z where ϕmhg ϕmbg and ϕmdt are the matric potential for hg manometer bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer respectively hhg is the hg column height hc is the hg level height in the container in relation to soil surface z is the distance between the cup s center and soil surface h is the water column height above the manometer insertion point hv is the bourdon gauge insertion height in the pvc pipe in relation to soil surface he hv h all in meter l and ld are readings on the analog display in the pressure gauge and on the digital display in the digital tensiometer in mm once the swrc is known the measurement of matric potential of each reading system also allowed the estimation of volumetric soil water content swrc was obtained by averaging the curves determined from six samples collected outside and close to the experimental plot hence following the methodology described in libardi 2012 simultaneous measurements of water content and total soil water potential ϕm ϕg in the established soil profile during the water redistribution period were used to determine for each time the gradient flow density and subsequently the hydraulic conductivity as a function of volumetric water content k θ all at 0 35 m through the equation 4 k θ z 0 z θ t d z φ t z z where the numerator is the flow density and the denominator is the total potential gradient at the soil depth z 2 4 inverse modeling the parameter saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k0 was determined in the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2013 using an inverse parameter estimation process hopmans et al 2002 the van genuchten 1980 model was used to describe soil water retention curve besides the combination with the pore size distribution statistical model of mualem 1976 for the prediction through the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity function in terms of soil water retention parameters 5 k φ m k 0 s e l 1 1 s e l m 2 where ϕm is the soil water matric potential m k is unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity m h 1 k0 is saturated soil hydraulic conductivity m h 1 and l is the pore connectivity coefficient in hydrus 1d the soil profile was divided into three layers 0 0 275 m 0 275 0 425 m and 0 425 0 6 m in which 0 275 and 0 425 are mean values between 0 2 and 0 35 m and between 0 35 and 0 5 m respectively with 13 nodes and 3 observation points 0 20 m 0 35 m and 0 50 m corresponding to the tensiometers installation depths initial values for the hydraulic parameters were selected taking as reference the values obtained in laboratory with the undisturbed samples previously collected in the field θr 0 1 θs 0 35 α 1 n 1 5 k0 0 001 and l 0 5 at all depths for the 0 35 m depth the parameters θr θs α n and k0 were optimized boundary conditions were considered as zero flow on soil surface upper limit and free drainage at 0 6 m lower boundary the initial soil matric potential in the whole profile was set equal to 0 01 m corresponding to the condition of virtually saturated soil values of soil matric potentials measured in situ during 330 h were considered as simulation input for the objective function hydraulic parameters of the mualem van genuchten model were obtained through the minimization of the objective function defined as the sum of squared deviations between observed and simulated values hopmans et al 2002 the objective function was minimized using the levenberg marquardt method marquardt 1963 it is important to highlight that an objective function containing the residuals between fitted and measured data is minimized and the resulting parameters do not necessarily have physical meaning šimůnek and van genuchten 1996 2 5 data analysis alternative reading systems were graphically correlated with the standard system and the angular and linear coefficients of the line equation that relate them were compared by student s t test at 0 05 significance level tests of parallelism of lines and of linear correlation coefficient were applied to verify if there is relationship between the variables obtained by each reading system of the tensiometer under study additionally to evaluate the performance of the alternative reading systems in the procedure to obtain soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten mualen model the following statistical indices were used mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse maximum error emax coefficient of determination cd and coefficient of residual mass crm 6 m a e 1 n i 1

the standard instrument mercury manometer and oi to matric potential data measured with the different devices n is the number of observations and ō is the average of oi value the optimal agreement between the tensiometer readings is obtained when cd 1 and all the other statistical indices emax mae rmse and crm are equal to zero 3 results and discussion 3 1 matric potential based on the t test line intercepts were equal for the three systems table 1 evidencing the similarity of the readings in the beginning of the experiment when the soil was still close to saturation regarding the slope of the lines the bourdon pressure gauge was equivalent to the hg manometer differently the line generated by the digital tensiometer showed different slope from those of the other reading systems studies related to the digital tensiometer performance focus on the errors of this system due to air temperature variation which are already well known warrick et al 1998 according to hoelscher et al 1993 the electronic components of the digital tensiometer contribute with more errors than it is frequently assumed the authors also suggest that additional experiments should be carried out to separate the errors between the main groups of components that constitute the system in fig 4 the high correlation coefficient denotes how correlated the reading systems are as can be noted both the bourdon pressure gauge and the digital tensiometer overestimate the hg manometer in almost all matric potential readings whereas the digital tensiometer showed higher values in comparison to the other systems as the matric potential increased thus it is important to point out that as the matric potential increases the digital tensiometer progressively overestimates the system considered as reference likewise beraldo et al 2012 comparing tensiometer with hg manometer and with puncture digital tensiometer installed at 0 2 m depth in a latosol found coefficients of determination 0 99 0 92 0 94 and 0 88 very close to those observed in the present study 0 98 these authors also observed that differences between both reading systems increased as soil water content decreased here an observation regarding the bourdon gauge operation becomes necessary inside the instrument the static element deforms after receiving the tension to be measured activating a mechanism with a pointer to indicate the respective tension on the display the moving parts composing the gear of the measuring device offer resistance to movement due to the principle of inertia it is also worth mentioning that the bourdon pressure gauge model may assume various mechanisms of operation and the one used in the present study is composed of a c shaped tube in this aspect models with spiral or helical tube for being more sensitive are the most adequate for low tensions young and sisson 2002 for this reason it should be recommended the use of pressure gauges with spiral sensors particularly when the aim is to measure soil water matric potential under moisture conditions from close to saturation to field capacity since small variations of moisture cause large variations in hydraulic conductivity due to the exponential relationship between these two soil attributes 3 2 soil moisture since moisture determination is of fundamental importance to obtain the function k θ for calculations of internal drainage any system intended to replace a conventional system to measure soil moisture needs to do it without causing differences in statistical coefficients thus after soil moisture estimation from the matric potentials obtained by each reading system through the retention curve there was high linear correlation between them and the digital tensiometer was better correlated with the hg manometer in comparison to the bourdon pressure gauge fig 5 intercept test showed equality between all systems whereas in the slope test the alternative systems differed from the standard one but were similar between themselves according to the angular coefficients each unit of moisture obtained with the hg manometer corresponds to 0 51 in the digital tensiometer and 0 43 in the bourdon pressure gauge i e the alternative systems underestimate moisture values 3 3 hydraulic gradient in fig 6 it can be noticed that hydraulic gradients measured by alternative systems differ from the gradient measured with the hg manometer despite having the same intercept the slopes of the alternative systems were different from that of the hg manometer but similar between themselves hg manometer showed gradient values approximately between 1 5 and 2 5 compared with the other systems which demonstrates small influence of soil matrix on the hydraulic gradient differently the alternative systems exhibited almost double the value observed with the hg manometer 2 7 4 7 the overestimation of hydraulic gradient shown by the alternative systems results from the higher matric potentials obtained with these systems 3 4 flow density in fig 7 flow densities of both alternative systems were highly correlated with that of the hg manometer both systems intercept the y axis at a statistically equal value table 1 hence it is observed that in the last readings of the experiment there was no difference in the flow obtained by each system it is important to point out that for irrigated crops soil moisture is expected to be most of the time close to field capacity and at this point tensiometers equipped with the different reading systems do not lead to differences in the calculations of soil water flow regarding the angular coefficient all systems are different for the first reading it is observed that while the hg manometer shows flow density of approximately 4 2 mm d 1 the bourdon pressure gauge indicates 2 1 mm d 1 and the digital tensiometer 1 4 mm d 1 in practical terms aiming at quantifying the leaching of a certain chemical component present in the soil solution with potential to contaminate the water table the quantification based on bourdon pressure gauge and on digital tensiometer results in only 50 and 33 respectively of the value obtained by the hg manometer based on this analysis the use of these systems to determine soil solution flow density becomes compromised given the discrepancy of the observed values 3 5 hydraulic conductivity the magnitude of hydraulic conductivity values was similar to that of the flow density fig 8 as a consequence of the high values of gradient hydraulic conductivity was underestimated by the alternative systems in comparison to the hg manometer which showed higher values of hydraulic conductivity the t test for intercept and slope demonstrates that the systems have the same intercepts but different slopes table 1 as the soil approaches field capacity the systems tend to be equal as observed in the first measurement saturated soil a high discrepancy was found between the measuring systems although the bourdon pressure gauge and hg manometer were similar regarding intercept and slope for matric potential readings the deviations in the readings of each system when propagated contributed to the differences between the measurements of soil hydraulic conductivity since this parameter varies exponentially with soil moisture here an observation should be made regarding the fact that the bourdon pressure gauge has a full scale with low resolution 20 mmhg within the moisture range from saturation to field capacity notably in the first readings variations in matric potential occur faster due to the high hydraulic conductivity and consequently a greater number of readings are necessary therefore small variations occur in the matric potential requiring greater detailing which is restricted by the scale of the pressure gauge 3 6 inverse modeling considering the possibility of using inverse modeling in hydrological studies we compared the hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten 1980 model of each system obtained by the hydrus 1d model table 2 the simulated data of matric potential fitted very well to those measured in the field in all reading systems and depths showing rmse of at most 0 07 fig 9 a c analysis of the parameters θr and θs through the statistical indices table 3 indicates good agreement between the alternative systems with slightly higher errors by the digital tensiometer mae rmse and emax coefficients errors above 10 occurred in both systems evidencing the low accuracy of these instruments in obtaining van genuchten equation parameters by inverse modeling based on the crm θr is overestimated by the alternative systems the indices mae and rmse provide results in the same unit of measure as the analyzed variable considering that values very close to neutrality were found except for the parameter α which reaches an error of five units based on cd which indicates how much the values simulated by the alternative systems diverge from the average values of the hg manometer the parameters θr and n stand out from the others indicating proximity between the estimates the parameter α showed lowest cd but very close in both alternative systems in a comparison between the alternative systems it can be easily noted based on the statistical indices that there are no major variations between them according to the crm the parameters α and ks are overestimated by the alternative reading systems whereas the other parameters are close to zero since soil hydraulic parameters are used in studies on the modeling of water and solutes dynamics it is important that their estimates by the alternative systems have as few errors as possible for the models to quantify these processes accurately the coefficients of determination demonstrate good fits by the model table 4 there was superiority of the parameter ks obtained by the hg manometer compared with the alternative systems hence bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer indicate 58 and 79 of the value estimated by the hg manometer respectively ramos et al 2006 comparing hydraulic parameters of soils from portugal obtained ks values through inverse modeling that underestimated laboratory measurements by 32 4 and also obtained values that overestimated them by 259 7 scarpare et al 2011 in study to optimize hydraulic parameters of latosols of two sugarcane experiments in são paulo compared parameters in different soil layers obtained by inverse modeling using the levenberg marquardt algorithm embedded in the software pest parameter estimation doherty 2002 and in the laboratory these authors found ks values obtained by inverse modeling representing 5 and 23 of the ks measured in the laboratory 4 conclusions although the mechanisms of operation are different the bourdon manometer can replace the hg manometer to measure matric potential at moisture from and above field capacity hg manometer should be preferred to estimate hydraulic conductivity flow density and gradient of total soil water potential regardless of the reading system used in the tensiometer inverse modeling with hydrus 1d estimates well van genuchten equation parameters and consequently soil

11346,the tensiometer represents an excellent instrument for measuring in situ soil water status however measuring soil matric potential requires a tensiometer reading system sensitive enough to accurately record the matric potential hence an instantaneous profile type experiment was conducted in the field to measure the soil matric potentials within a moisture range from saturation to field capacity after that matric potential soil moisture total potential gradient flow density and hydraulic conductivity were calculated and van genuchten equation parameters were estimated through inverse modeling this study aimed to test the bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer compared with the mercury manometer to measure the soil matric potential and to examine the differences related to the estimations of soil water content and to the associated variables in addition the study also aimed to evaluate soil hydraulic parameters by inverse modeling based on the matric potentials from each reading system bourdon pressure gauge replaces the hg manometer in the measurement of soil water matric potential within the moisture range from saturation to field capacity the use of digital tensiometer and bourdon pressure gauge reduced hydraulic conductivity by four and three times and flow density by approximately three and two times respectively at 6 kpa tension and therefore are not recommended for the estimation of these hydraulic parameters regardless of reading system used in the tensiometer inverse modeling estimates well van genuchten equation parameters and consequently soil water matric potential keywords tensiometer inverse modeling propagation of errors 1 introduction accurate evaluations of soil water status at different spatial and temporal scales is still a challenging task that has stimulated past and present research rallo et al 2018 the range of measurement accuracy repeatability response time and spatial resolution of specific sensors are important considerations for applications and analyses of soil water measurements or and wraith 2002 tensiometry despite requiring extensive maintenance and being limited to relatively wet conditions since it only measures until approximately 0 09 mpa is an accurate technique widely used to determine soil matric potential durner and or 2005 for that the tensiometer has presented itself as an excellent instrument for directly measuring soil water energy and allowing in situ measurements with sensitivity and accuracy of the results dependent on the type of manometer used using the tensiometer to measure soil water matric potential is frequently preferred over other types of soil moisture sensors due to its low cost easy use high measurement accuracy and possibility of electronic data acquisition through differential pressure transducers besides being a non destructive technique zazueta and xin 1994 with possibility of providing continuous moisture measurements without causing alteration in the soil wallhan 1939 since variables such as hydraulic conductivity have the highest values when the soil is saturated and consequently the highest flows through internal drainage occur at soil water contents close to saturation a good tensiometer reading system must be sensitive enough to accurately record soil matric potentials obviously errors associated to each reading system are propagated at higher or lower intensity in the estimates of other soil variables depending on soil matric potential the simplest tensiometers is represented by a mercury hg manometer this system is considered the most sensitive and accurate besides providing direct reading which causes it to be taken as a standard to assess other models but there is the disadvantage that hg is toxic to humans and poses risk of environmental contamination another measuring system the pressure gauge although it had been patented in france in the xix century by the engineer eugene bourdon çengel and boles 2006 comparatively to mercury hg manometer has recently been applied in tensiometers for use in agriculture according to brito et al 2009 in the determination of hydraulic conductivity through the instantaneous profile method experience has shown that the bourdon pressure gauge with the same full scale used in the present study does not allow detailed assessment of matric potential variation over time especially in the first hours of redistribution which correspond to the conditions of higher water content in the soil another alternative to the use of mercury was the introduction of digital tensiometers which use a pressure transducer marthaler et al 1983 as sensitive element to transmit a signal corresponding to the tension at the moment of reading which suggests a previous calibration of the device this signal is also digitally shown on the instrument s display marthaler et al 1983 point out a delay in the equilibrium between the water tension inside the tensiometer and the water tension in the soil over time other reading systems have been introduced in the market aimed at measuring matric potential in an easier faster and more accurate way and with capacity for measurements in a wide range of soil water potentials however each of these alternative systems has disadvantages which reduce their use depending on the conditions the high cost of acquisition and the need for specialized labor are some of the factors which restrict their use in the field making them limited to research in this context the study assumed that hypothesis that the reading systems bourdon pressure gauge and tensiometer with pressure transducer for the measurement of soil water matric potential due to their respective operating mechanisms produce errors that propagate to soil hydraulic functions and related parameters in comparison to the traditional mercury manometers therefore objective of this study was the assessment of two different devices to monitor soil matric potential alternative to the mercury manometer and to evaluate the effects of the precision readings on soil hydraulic functions and related parameters 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental layout the experiment was carried out in an argissolo amarelo empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecuária embrapa 2013 and tensiometers were installed in a circular experimental plot with diameter of 3 m and depth of 0 6 m following the procedures for hydraulic conductivity determination through the instantaneous profile method fig 1 the soil volume was delimited on the sides by a plastic canvas to avoid lateral subsurface flows hence to meet the method s boundary conditions water flow in the center of the plot was guaranteed to occur only in the vertical direction hillel et al 1972 undisturbed and disturbed soil samples were collected in the experimental plots for soil physical characterization disturbed samples were used to determine soil particle density by the volumetric flask method blake and hartge 1986a whereas undisturbed samples collected using an uhland soil sampler in 0 05 m high steel rings with a diameter of 0 05 m were used to determine soil water retention curve swrc and soil bulk density blake and hartge 1986b in the determination of swrc the water content at saturation was considered as equal to total soil porosity calculated with the values of soil bulk and particle densities for low tension points 0 002 0 004 0 006 0 008 and 0 01 mpa water content was determined by using haines funnel haines 1930 whereas the other points 0 033 0 1 0 7 and 1 5 mpa were determined in richards porous plate apparatus klute 1986 the curve was fitted according to the statistical model proposed by van genuchten 1980 the equation parameters for each soil layer were obtained using the software retc van genuchten et al 1991 by assuming the dependence between m and n m 1 1 n 2 2 construction and installation of tensiometers tensiometers were made using rigid pvc pipes with external and internal diameters of 0 021 and 0 016 m respectively and length corresponding to the installation depth plus 0 55 m above soil surface 0 20 m of pvc and 0 35 m of transparent acrylic tube the same instrument was equipped with the three reading systems so that all of them were subjected to the same conditions nylon tubing 0 002 m internal diameter glued to the pvc pipe fig 2 was used to connect the tensiometer to the hg container the bourdon pressure gauge had 760 mmhg full scale with divisions of 20 mmhg for measurements with the digital tensiometer the acrylic tubes were sealed using a silicon stopper the acrylic tube was covered by a pvc cap to avoid direct sunlight which would lead to differential dilation and consequently leaks through the stopper acrylic tube interface because of the way the tensiometer was built containing three reading systems in only one instrument and the sequence in which the readings were taken the systems are independent and do not interfere with one another after confirming perfect operation in the laboratory the tensiometers were installed in the field at soil profile depths of 0 20 0 35 and 0 50 m with six replicates totaling 18 devices after the procedure of wetting until saturation the plot was covered by a plastic canvas to avoid any water flow through the surface also to meet the boundary conditions of the instantaneous profile method libardi et al 1980 readings in the system were taken daily at 07 00 a m to avoid modifications in the equilibrium established between the air chamber located in the upper portion of the tensiometer water in the tensiometer and water in the soil readings were taken first in the hg manometer and then in the bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer at 0 35 m depth after assuming that drainage was negligible i e when the soil reached field capacity the experiment ended such condition was assumed when soil moisture variation rate over time dθ dt was 0 001 cm3 cm 3 d 1 fig 3 nascimento et al 2018 2 3 processing of readings data of tensiometers with hg manometer were obtained by measuring the hg column height in the nylon tubing for the bourdon pressure gauge readings were directly taken on the instrument s display and for the digital tensiometer with pressure transducer data were obtained by connecting the sensor to the air chamber using a needle to transfer the tension to the measuring device the errors of the hg manometer bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer were 1 20 and 0 076 mmhg respectively subsequently the readings were converted to matric potential φ m m through the following equations 1 ϕ m h g 12 6 h h g h c z 2 ϕ m b g l 0 0136 h v h c z 3 ϕ m d t l d 0 0136 h e z where ϕmhg ϕmbg and ϕmdt are the matric potential for hg manometer bourdon pressure gauge and digital tensiometer respectively hhg is the hg column height hc is the hg level height in the container in relation to soil surface z is the distance between the cup s center and soil surface h is the water column height above the manometer insertion point hv is the bourdon gauge insertion height in the pvc pipe in relation to soil surface he hv h all in meter l and ld are readings on the analog display in the pressure gauge and on the digital display in the digital tensiometer in mm once the swrc is known the measurement of matric potential of each reading system also allowed the estimation of volumetric soil water content swrc was obtained by averaging the curves determined from six samples collected outside and close to the experimental plot hence following the methodology described in libardi 2012 simultaneous measurements of water content and total soil water potential ϕm ϕg in the established soil profile during the water redistribution period were used to determine for each time the gradient flow density and subsequently the hydraulic conductivity as a function of volumetric water content k θ all at 0 35 m through the equation 4 k θ z 0 z θ t d z φ t z z where the numerator is the flow density and the denominator is the total potential gradient at the soil depth z 2 4 inverse modeling the parameter saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k0 was determined in the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2013 using an inverse parameter estimation process hopmans et al 2002 the van genuchten 1980 model was used to describe soil water retention curve besides the combination with the pore size distribution statistical model of mualem 1976 for the prediction through the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity function in terms of soil water retention parameters 5 k φ m k 0 s e l 1 1 s e l m 2 where ϕm is the soil water matric potential m k is unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity m h 1 k0 is saturated soil hydraulic conductivity m h 1 and l is the pore connectivity coefficient in hydrus 1d the soil profile was divided into three layers 0 0 275 m 0 275 0 425 m and 0 425 0 6 m in which 0 275 and 0 425 are mean values between 0 2 and 0 35 m and between 0 35 and 0 5 m respectively with 13 nodes and 3 observation points 0 20 m 0 35 m and 0 50 m corresponding to the tensiometers installation depths initial values for the hydraulic parameters were selected taking as reference the values obtained in laboratory with the undisturbed samples previously collected in the field θr 0 1 θs 0 35 α 1 n 1 5 k0 0 001 and l 0 5 at all depths for the 0 35 m depth the parameters θr θs α n and k0 were optimized boundary conditions were considered as zero flow on soil surface upper limit and free drainage at 0 6 m lower boundary the initial soil matric potential in the whole profile was set equal to 0 01 m corresponding to the condition of virtually saturated soil values of soil matric potentials measured in situ during 330 h were considered as simulation input for the objective function hydraulic parameters of the mualem van genuchten model were obtained through the minimization of the objective function defined as the sum of squared deviations between observed and simulated values hopmans et al 2002 the objective function was minimized using the levenberg marquardt method marquardt 1963 it is important to highlight that an objective function containing the residuals between fitted and measured data is minimized and the resulting parameters do not necessarily have physical meaning šimůnek and van genuchten 1996 2 5 data analysis alternative reading systems were graphically correlated with the standard system and the angular and linear coefficients of the line equation that relate them were compared by student s t test at 0 05 significance level tests of parallelism of lines and of linear correlation coefficient were applied to verify if there is relationship between the variables obtained by each reading system of the tensiometer under study additionally to evaluate the performance of the alternative reading systems in the procedure to obtain soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten mualen model the following statistical indices were used mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse maximum error emax coefficient of determination cd and coefficient of residual mass crm 6 m a e 1 n i 1

between the tensiometer readings is obtained when cd 1 and all the other statistical indices emax mae rmse and crm are equal to zero 3 results and discussion 3 1 matric potential based on the t test line intercepts were equal for the three systems table 1 evidencing the similarity of the readings in the beginning of the experiment when the soil was still close to saturation regarding the slope of the lines the bourdon pressure gauge was equivalent to the hg manometer differently the line generated by the digital tensiometer showed different slope from those of the other reading systems studies related to the digital tensiometer performance focus on the errors of this system due to air temperature variation which are already well known warrick et al 1998 according to hoelscher et al 1993 the electronic components of the digital tensiometer contribute with more errors than it is frequently assumed the authors also suggest that additional experiments should be carried out to separate the errors between the main groups of components that constitute the system in fig 4 the high correlation coefficient denotes how correlated the reading systems are as can be noted both the bourdon pressure gauge and the digital tensiometer overestimate the hg manometer in almost all matric potential readings whereas the digital tensiometer showed higher values in comparison to the other systems as the matric potential increased thus it is important to point out that as the matric potential increases the digital tensiometer progressively overestimates the system considered as reference

development of agriculture in arid and semi arid areas which are under the condition of severe water shortage bu et al 2013 kühling et al 2018 the current applications of various water saving technologies and management measures are ultimately aimed to improve the wue of croplands katerji et al 2008 generally it is carried out from three angles in practice irrigation water use rate rainfall water use rate and crop water use efficiency plenty of researches focused on the effects of irrigation engineering and technology and the utilization rate of precipitation in water deficient areas wallace 2000 evans and sadler 2008 roth et al 2013 gu et al 2018 but there lack of systematic and in depth study on wue which takes the different crops as the core affected by different understanding from different disciplines wue of crops has experienced three levels from leaf level to group level and yield level blum 2005 niu et al 2011 the wue at the leaf level is the amount of organic matter formed by per unit of water loss through transpiration in group level wue is the ratio of co2 flux to crop evapotranspiration which is closer to the reality than the single leaf level at the yield level wue refers to how much water consumed during the accumulation of dry matter the water consumption not only includes the transpiration of crops but also the evaporation from the soil surface which is more practical for the research of water saving agriculture mccarthy et al 2011 tang et al 2017 the carbon and water cycles of cropland ecosystems are reciprocal feedback on different spatiotemporal scales as an important indicator to characterize the coupling relationship of carbon and water fluxes the seasonal and interannual patterns of crop wue and its environmental controls are being paid close attentions by current global change ecology researches which is important for future food security especially in the face of frequent climate anomalies baldocchi 2008 gornall et al 2010 yu et al 2018 croplands cover 15 million km2 of the planet and provide the bulk of the food and fiber essential to human well being monfreda et al 2008 maize wheat rice and soybean are the most widely produced grain for humans and livestock around the world therefore quantitative assessment of the temporal patterns and environmental control of ecosystem wue over the main crops will help to project the influence of future climate change on the carbon and water cycling processes of the cropland and to realize the key to water saving irrigation in this study we aimed 1 to reveal the differences in seasonal and interannual dynamics of ecosystem wue across four typical crops worldwide including soybean maize winter wheat and paddy rice based on 10 ec based flux sites and 2 to explore the underlying environmental controlling mechanisms in the wue variability of different crop types by means of the relevant meteorological data biophysical parameter and photosynthetic pathway all analyses are of great theoretical and practical significance to provide scientific supports for agricultural water management at the regional and national scale 2 methods and materials 2 1 descriptions of the flux sites in total of 33 site years flux data over four typical croplands in north america europe and asia were used for analysis in the study table 1 three maize flux sites included us bo1 us ro1 and cn daman the us bo1 site is located in illinois the united states with the climate of temperate continental the flux tower has been operated since 1996 the crops cultivated in this land are maize and soybean rotation maize in the odd years and soybean in the even years bernacchi et al 2005 meyers and hollinger 2004 tang et al 2015 the us ro1 site lies in the university of minnesota s rosemount research and outreach center this area has similar climate type as us bo1 maize and soybean are also planted in this site with maize in the odd years and soybean in the even years griffis et al 2008 kalfas et al 2011 tang et al 2015 the cn daman site is located in the middle of heihe river basin of northwest china the flux tower has been operated since 2012 liu et al 2011 song et al 2015 2016 three soybean flux sites were comprised of us bo1 us ro1 and us ib1 detailed introduction of us bo1 and us ro1 has been described the us ib1 site lies in fermi national accelerator laboratory in the united states the field has been rotated between maize and soybean since 1992 with maize in the even years and soybean in the odd years allison et al 2005 the study used three flux sites of winter wheat the be lon site is in lonzée belgium and started to work in 2004 this area has temperate maritime climate the rotation crop are sugar beet winter wheat seed potato and winter wheat again rannik et al 2003 aubinet et al 2009 the de seh site is close to the border of belgium germany with temperate maritime climate the field is a winter wheat winter wheat sugar beet rotation schmidt et al 2012 the us arm site is located in the atmospheric radiation measurement southern great plains central facility of northern oklahoma the united states the winter wheat years used in this study were 2006 2007 and 2009 2010 lu et al 2017 three flux sites of paddy rice were used in this study the it cas site is located in an alluvial plain in the southern part of italy this region owns subtropical climate a traditional type of rice in italy is cultivated in this land skiba et al 2009 the us twt site lies in the sacramento san joaquin delta this area has mediterranean climate two kinds of rice are planted in this field which generally begins in april to may and ends in october and november hatala et al 2012 knox et al 2016 xin et al 2017 the jpn mse site is located in tsukuba city of the middle part of japan this region is subtropical oceanic monsoon climate paddy rice is the main crop of this area which usually plowed and flooded in april and transplanted in may saito et al 2005 xin et al 2017 the ec system is generally comprised of a three dimensional sonic anemometer and a co2 h2o gas analyzer raw data from the ec sensor are continuously recorded at a frequency of 10 hz then these data are processed using the edire software developed by the university of edinburgh uk http www geos ed ac uk abs research micromet edire to half hour flux dataset the procedures include spike detection two dimensional coordinate rotation lag correction of h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component sonic virtual temperature correction density fluctuations wpl correction and frequency response correction goulden et al 2006 song et al 2016 in addition to these processing steps the half hourly flux data are screened in accordance to the following criteria i data are rejected when the sensor was malfunctioning ii data are rejected when precipitation happened within 1 h before and after the collection iii incomplete data are rejected when the missing ratio was larger than 3 in the 30 min raw record and iv data are rejected at night when the friction velocity was below 0 1 m s 1 liu et al 2011 2 2 vegetation phenology from modis data the main data source used to extract the key vegetation phenological information of various crops is the normalized vegetation index ndvi which is calculated using the site level data of modis brdf albedo products busetto et al 2010 the brdf adjusted reflectance daily l3 data mcd43a4 v006 has removed view angle effects and the cloud and aerosol have been minimized the reflectivity of the modis band 1 7 provided by mcd43a4 is 500 m in spatial resolution which is provided by using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function to model the values from the nadir view https modis ornl gov the near infrared 841 876 nm and red 620 670 nm bands were used to calculate ndvi gillies et al 1997 as follows 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir and r represented the reflectance of band 2 and band 1 of modis data respectively although the product has eliminated some clouds aerosols solar elevation angle and bidirectional reflectance of objects however the noise of the clouds and the atmosphere still have great influence which makes the time series ndvi data irregular the seasonal variation of the curve is not obvious which affects the monitoring of land ecosystem the inversion of vegetation parameters and the accuracy of phenological information extraction therefore the fitting of time series ndvi data and the reconstruction of smooth time profiles are the most important tasks in this study the asymmetric gauss function fitting method was used to smooth ndvi firstly a sliding window is used to obtain the valley and peak value of the ndvi curve two local fitting of ndvi timing data between the valley value and peak value is used to optimize the optimal fitting function to describe the upper envelope curve of ndvi data jonsson and eklundh 2002 the dynamic threshold value method is used to extract crop phenological information sos and eos represent the start and end of the growing season respectively in the arable land crop growth extraction was based on the first order derivative of the fitting guass curve sos and eos were defined as the time point at 20 of the associated distance between the minimum values and maximum values of the derivative for cropland respectively jonsson and eklundh 2004 fig 1 illustrated the process of extraction based on the data of us ib1 site and the other sites were analyzed using the same approach in this study all analyses were based on the data during crop growing season between sos and eos 2 3 flux measurements and climate data processing this study is based on continuous co2 and h2o flux measurements as well as the relevant weather conditions including solar radiation rg air and soil temperatures ta and ts relative humidity rh soil moisture profile swc precipitation p and vapor pressure deficit vpd from three sources us bo1 site us ro1 site us ib1 site us arm site and us twt site from ameriflux website be lon site de seh site and it cas site from european fluxes database and jpn mse cn daman from asiaflux website the ec based flux tower directly measures net ecosystem carbon exchange nee between the cropland and the atmosphere the time series nee observations were partitioned into its two components gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration re through the non linear regressions reichstein et al 2005 desai et al 2008 lu and zhuang 2010 this method obtains temperature response to nee data during the nighttime based on the lloyd and taylor 1994 regression model and then applies this relationship to extrapolation from nighttime to daytime all of these works including gap filling and flux partitioning are completed using the r based package developed by the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgc jena mpg de reddyproc brew reddyproc rhtml finally these half hour data are accumulated to daily and 8 day mean values to reflect the seasonal dynamics of croplands significance of crop wue differs at different scales considering the differences in scientific disciplines beer et al 2009 in this study ecosystem level wue is defined as 2 wue gpp et crop wue was integrated into 8 day period to observe the seasonal dynamics the observed latent heat le w m2 was used to calculate et mm d 1 3 et le λ where λ is the energy required for vaporization of 1 kg liquid water about 2 454 000 j 2 4 statistical analysis pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the environmental controlling factors of seasonal variations in wue of crop ecosystems by spss 19 0 chicago il usa to explore the relationship between ecosystem wue and ndvi of typical crops the linear regression is used to fit with the coefficient of determination r2 evaluating the performance a well performed model generally has the r2 value close to 1 due to the differences in photosynthetic pathways of c3 plants soybean rice and winter wheat and c4 plant maize intercomparison was made among these crop types 3 results 3 1 differences in multi year mean gpp et and ecosystem wue of typical crops the lengths of growing seasons across the typical crops including soybean maize paddy rice and winter wheat from time series modis ndvi data were depicted in fig 2 winter wheat has the longest growing period with 236 days which generally lasts from mid october to early july despite that de seh slightly lagged behind the other flux sites the growth cycle of paddy rice is the shortest with 152 days from mid or late april to early september the durations of growing seasons of soybean 168 days and maize 172 days are quite close from the end of april or early may to the middle of september for harvests ultimately the phenology of crops is determined by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors such as the interannual variations in climate conditions management measures and crop strains based on the specific phenological information of various croplands the study aimed to reveal the differences in annual gpp et and ecosystem wue across the typical crops worldwide the multi year mean gpp et and ecosystem wue across the typical crops were shown in fig 3 and table 2 obviously the c4 crop maize has the largest gpp value with 7 39 1 87 g c m 2 d 1 among these four crops whereas gpp of the c3 crops soybean paddy rice and winter wheat were generally below 6 g c m 2 d 1 during the growing season ecosystem et exhibited the highest value in paddy rice cropland with 3 44 0 99 mm d 1 which was attributed to artificial flood irrigation during the cultivate season however the soybean maize and winter wheat mainly relied on natural rainfall as a proxy of the coupling relationship between carbon and water fluxes this study revealed that maize cropland owned the strongest ecosystem wue of 2 48 0 69 g c kg 1 h2o followed by winter wheat 2 00 0 39 g c kg 1 h2o soybean 1 92 0 52 g c kg 1 h2o and paddy rice 1 88 0 63 g c kg 1 h2o 3 2 seasonal variations in gpp et and ecosystem wue of typical crops the seasonal dynamics in gpp et and ecosystem wue of soybean maize paddy rice and winter wheat croplands were illustrated in fig 4 distinct seasonal cycles existed in the gpp variability the seeds of soybean maize and paddy rice were generally sowed in the springtime then gpp increased gradually with the growth of crops reached the peak during the summertime approximately woy 26 and decreased again as the crops ripen in autumn but the winter wheat has quite different seasonal cycles with the seeds sown in mid october subsequently gpp had a small peak and then fell to zero after the wheat entered the winter as the temperature rises in springtime gpp increased quickly and reached the maximum in early summer the maize sites owned the largest gpp during the peak growth period over these cropland types meanwhile the study found that apparent differences in the maximum gpp values even for the same crops which can be ascribed to the effects of local environmental conditions and crop varieties in general the seasonality of et across the four crops exhibited similar patterns as gpp except the jpn mse site this region belongs to the subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with high et values around the growth period thus the seasonal fluctuations in et were generally lower than those in gpp among these cropland sites the variability in ecosystem wue also showed apparent seasonal dynamics and peaked together with gpp in the most active period 3 3 analysis of the environmental controls pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the environmental constraints of seasonal variations in 8 day mean tower based ecosystem wue of these typical crops table 3 this study found that ecosystem wue was mainly determined by gpp rather than et thus a series of biotic and abiotic factors influencing the gpp variability also strongly affect the seasonal patterns in ecosystem wue across soybean maize paddy rice and winter wheat croplands both rg and temperature ta and ts were strongly correlated to ecosystem wue of soybean maize and winter wheat they were recognized as the most important environmental controls among these abiotic factors besides vpd also had strong correlations with ecosystem wue of winter wheat at the long term flooded paddy rice cropland only ta was strongly and positively related to ecosystem wue 0 461 at 0 01 level furthermore as an important biophysical parameter comprehensively reflecting the environmental conditions time series modis ndvi data strongly impacted the seasonal patterns in crop wue table 3 the data over an 8 day period during the growing season of these cropland sites were used for analysis the soybean cropland has the highest correlation reaching up to 0 890 followed by the winter wheat 0 799 maize 0 748 and paddy rice 0 742 then liner regression is used to reveal the responses of ecosystem wue to the variability in ndvi across various croplands as shown in fig 5 for soybean cropland exponential function was the best fitting method with r2 of 0 90 however linear regression was the optimal fitting function for maize paddy rice and winter wheat croplands with r2 of 0 54 0 54 and 0 47 respectively given the complicated interactions among these environmental factors this study implied the potential path to remotely retrieve the variability in ecosystem wue using time series ndvi data 4 discussion there existed obvious difference between ecosystem wue of c4 crop maize and c3 crop soybean paddy rice and winter wheat in fig 6 us ib1 soybean us bo1 maize us twt paddy rice and us arm winter wheat stations were selected for the comparisons of gpp et and ecosystem wue the gpp of maize during growth period could reach over 20 g c m 2 d 1 while gpp of the other three crops were usually below 15 g c m 2 d 1 even in the peak growing season comparison of the seasonal variations in et also demonstrated the most water consumption at the paddy rice field among the four crops ecosystem wue of the maize was apparently higher than the other three crops with the peak value during growth period exceeding 6 g c kg 1 h2o compared to the other three crops ranging between 2 g c kg 1 h2o and 4 2 g c kg 1 h2o in addition to c3 cycle the c4 photosynthetic cycle supercharges photosynthesis by concentrating co2 around ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase and significantly reduces the oxygenation reaction edwards et al 2010 wang et al 2012 found the increase of both biomass production and co2 fixation with light intensity and co2 concentration in c4 is faster than that in c3 which reflected more efficient use of light and co2 in c4 plants many studies found that c4 vegetation exhibited increasing ecosystem wue in response to rising atmospheric co2 concentration ca by reducing the stomatal aperture as well as the transpiration rate compared with c3 species tong et al 2009 manzoni et al 2011 recent work has highlighted the role of other environmental variables that along with low ca may have contributed to the increase of c4 photosynthesis such as dry or saline conditions osborne and sack 2012 griffiths et al 2013 way et al 2014 these studies emphasized the role of c4 photosynthesis in improving plant water status and preventing hydraulic failure in these environments therefore the characteristics of species determine a higher ecosystem wue for c4 plants than for c3 plants majority of the plants 95 on earth are c3 type with only very few 5 as c4 type thus engineering c4 feature into c3 plants has been suggested as a feasible way to increase photosynthesis and yield of c3 crops such as rice wheat and soybean schuler et al 2016 although the ec method is now the most fundamental method for measuring carbon and water fluxes the findings in this study may contain plenty of uncertainties because flux measurements by the ec method are subject to errors a landmark paper by lenschow et al 1994 has defined systematic and random errors associated with limited samplings of the ec based measurements subsequently as the extensive use of ec systems many papers have been published on this aspect and several methods have emerged for flux uncertainty estimation accordingly papale et al 2006 billesbach 2011 however various problems remain under discussion contrary to traditional error analysis the assessment of ec flux errors is more difficult the systematic errors are not only instrument related but also affected by the unmet environmental conditions of the ec theory and its data processing scheme that is actually a complex long sequence of operation wang et al 2015 moreover flux exchange is controlled by atmospheric turbulence which is an inherently random process flux data often show wiggly variations in consecutive half hour sequences even in a clear stationary day when the net radiation shows a typical smooth diurnal cycle these random uncertainties primarily arise due to a limited number of independent samples of the turbulent eddies responsible for flux transport during a fixed sampling period hollinger and richardson 2005 reichstein et al 2007 other errors can be greatly reduced in a carefully designed field program however these sampling error will remain as one of the largest sources of uncertainty chen et al 2012 found that under the condition of surface heterogeneity the estimated nee value represents 50 60 of the true situation but there is still a problem of insufficient spatial representation due to technical restrictions previous studies often used the observation method according to the existing conditions which often leads to the lack of comparability among different research results and the scientific understanding among the ecosystems difficult ponton et al 2006 additionally the limitations of observation methods constrains the dynamic characteristics of wue and environmental control factors at multiple scales from leaf to ecosystem niu et al 2011 campos et al 2013 in recent years the micrometeorological technology has made great progress which becomes an effective method for long term and continuous observation of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes the flux sites of cropland used in this study were mainly distributed in the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere the coverage of cropland on earth is large with apparent differences in the seasonality in order to enhance the spatial representativeness the increase of flux towers can provide more long term data base for evaluating ecosystem wue across various crops a great number of environmental factors would affect crop wue variability particularly the interannual dynamics these factors are comprised of climatic changes including extreme weather events such as heatwave and drought climate zones due to geographical location rain fed or irrigated conventional or alternative tillage as well as the improvement in the breed of crops 5 conclusions on the basis of 33 ec based years of co2 and h2o flux measurements over 10 cropland sites around the world this study revealed the large differences in the seasonal and interannual variations of gpp et and ecosystem wue across the four crops widespread on the earth including soybean maize winter wheat and paddy rice specifically maize cropland owned the strongest ecosystem wue of 2 48 0 69 g c kg 1 h2o followed by winter wheat soybean and paddy rice on annual time scale the variability in ecosystem wue also exhibited apparent seasonal dynamics and peaked together with gpp in the most active period ecosystem wue of soybean maize and paddy rice increased gradually with crop growth and reached the peak during the summertime woy 26 whereas the winter wheat has quite different seasonality with two peaks meanwhile this study revealed that ecosystem wue was determined more by gpp by comparison with et both solar radiation and temperature were recognized as the most important environmental controls for soybean maize and winter wheat crops however only temperature strongly and positively affected ecosystem wue in the flooded paddy rice field the close correlation between time series modis ndvi data and crop wue implied the great potential to remotely retrieve spatial pattern of ecosystem wue over large areas because of different photosynthetic pathways in c3 and c4 crops ecosystem wue of the maize cropland was apparently higher than the other three crops with large differences in the peak wue values during the growth period thus integrating c4 photosynthesis into c3 crops may help raise the yield potential by means of rational engineering strategies acknowledgments this study was jointly supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities in china xdjk2018c017 swu116088 chongqing basic and frontier research program cstc2018jcyjax0056 and china postdoctoral science foundation 2017m610109 all

11347,water use efficiency wue is an important parameter to assess agricultural production and the reasonable utilization of water resources especially in the context of changing hydrological environment more attention need to be paid on how to use limited water resource to improve crop yield for ensuring food security based on 33 site years of flux measurements over 10 cropland sites using the eddy covariance ec technique the study systematically evaluated the large differences in seasonal and interannual variations of gross primary productivity gpp evapotranspiration et and ecosystem wue across the four crops worldwide including soybean maize winter wheat and paddy rice the lengths of the growing seasons across the main crops extracted from time series modis ndvi data implied that the longest growth period in winter wheat and the shortest growing season in paddy rice field further analyses suggest that maize cropland has the strongest ecosystem wue with 2 48 0 69 g c kg 1 h2o followed by winter wheat 2 00 0 39 g c kg 1 h2o soybean 1 92 0 52 g c kg 1 h2o and paddy rice 1 88 0 63 g c kg 1 h2o meanwhile the variability in ecosystem wue exhibited apparent seasonality and peaked together with gpp in the most active summertime a series of biotic and abiotic factors affected the gpp as well as wue variability given the complicated interactions among these environmental factors this study revealed the great potential to remotely retrieve the wue variability using time series modis ndvi data over large areas ecosystem wue of the c4 crop maize was

may saito et al 2005 xin et al 2017 the ec system is generally comprised of a three dimensional sonic anemometer and a co2 h2o gas analyzer raw data from the ec sensor are continuously recorded at a frequency of 10 hz then these data are processed using the edire software developed by the university of edinburgh uk http www geos ed ac uk abs research micromet edire to half hour flux dataset the procedures include spike detection two dimensional coordinate rotation lag correction of h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component sonic virtual temperature correction density fluctuations wpl correction and frequency response correction goulden et al 2006 song et al 2016 in addition to these processing steps the half hourly flux data are screened in accordance to the following criteria i data are rejected when the sensor was malfunctioning ii data are rejected when precipitation happened within 1 h before and after the collection iii incomplete data are rejected when the missing ratio was larger than 3 in the 30 min raw record and iv data are rejected at night when the friction velocity was below 0 1 m s 1 liu et al 2011 2 2 vegetation phenology from modis data the main data source used to extract the key vegetation phenological information of various crops is the normalized vegetation index ndvi which is calculated using the site level data of modis brdf albedo products busetto et al 2010 the brdf adjusted reflectance daily l3 data mcd43a4 v006 has removed view angle effects and the cloud and aerosol have been minimized the reflectivity of the modis band 1 7 provided by mcd43a4 is 500 m in spatial resolution which is provided by using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function to model the values from the nadir view https modis ornl gov the near infrared 841 876 nm and red 620 670 nm bands were used to calculate ndvi gillies et al 1997 as follows 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir and r represented the reflectance of band 2 and band 1 of modis data respectively although the product has eliminated some clouds aerosols solar elevation angle and bidirectional reflectance of objects however the noise of the clouds and the atmosphere still have great influence which makes the time series ndvi data irregular the seasonal variation of the curve is not obvious which affects the monitoring of land ecosystem the inversion of vegetation parameters and the accuracy of phenological information extraction therefore the fitting of time series ndvi data and the reconstruction of smooth time profiles are the most important tasks in this study the asymmetric gauss function fitting method was used to smooth ndvi firstly a sliding window is used to obtain the valley and peak value of the ndvi curve two local fitting of ndvi timing data between the valley value and peak value is used to optimize the optimal fitting function to describe the upper envelope curve of ndvi data jonsson and eklundh 2002 the dynamic threshold value method is used to extract crop phenological information sos and eos represent the start and end of the growing season respectively in the arable land crop growth extraction was based on the first order derivative of the fitting guass curve sos and eos were defined as the time point at 20 of the associated distance between the minimum values and maximum values of the derivative for cropland respectively jonsson and eklundh 2004 fig 1 illustrated the process of extraction based on the data of us ib1 site and the other sites were analyzed using the same approach in this study all analyses were based on the data during crop growing season between sos and eos 2 3 flux measurements and climate data processing this study is based on continuous co2 and h2o flux measurements as well as the relevant weather

flux tower directly measures net ecosystem carbon exchange nee between the cropland and the atmosphere the time series nee observations were partitioned into its two components gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration re through the non linear regressions reichstein et al 2005 desai et al 2008 lu and zhuang 2010 this method obtains temperature response to nee data during the nighttime based on the lloyd and taylor 1994 regression model and then applies this relationship to extrapolation from nighttime to daytime all of these works including gap filling and flux partitioning are completed using the r based package developed by the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgc jena mpg de reddyproc brew reddyproc rhtml finally these half hour data are accumulated to daily and 8 day mean values to reflect the seasonal dynamics of croplands significance of crop wue differs at different scales considering the differences in scientific disciplines beer et al 2009 in this study ecosystem level wue is defined as 2 wue gpp et crop wue was integrated into 8 day period to observe the seasonal dynamics the observed latent heat le w m2 was used to calculate et mm d 1 3 et le λ where λ is the energy required for vaporization of 1 kg liquid water about 2 454 000 j 2 4 statistical analysis pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the environmental controlling factors of seasonal variations in wue of crop ecosystems by spss 19 0 chicago il usa to explore the relationship between ecosystem wue and ndvi of typical crops the linear regression is used to fit with the coefficient of determination r2 evaluating the performance a well performed model generally has the r2 value close to 1 due to the differences in photosynthetic pathways of c3 plants soybean rice and winter wheat and c4 plant maize intercomparison was made among these crop types 3 results 3 1 differences in multi year mean gpp et and ecosystem wue of typical crops the lengths of growing seasons across the typical crops including soybean maize paddy rice and winter wheat from time series modis ndvi data were depicted in fig 2 winter wheat has the longest growing period with 236 days which generally lasts from mid october to early july despite that de seh slightly lagged behind the other flux sites the growth cycle of paddy rice is the shortest with 152 days from mid or late april to early september the durations of growing seasons of soybean 168 days and maize 172 days are quite close from the end of april or early may to the middle of september for harvests ultimately the phenology of crops is determined by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors such as the interannual variations in climate conditions management measures and crop strains based on the specific phenological information of various croplands the study aimed to reveal the differences in annual gpp et and ecosystem wue across the typical crops worldwide the multi year mean gpp et and ecosystem wue across the typical crops were shown in fig 3 and table 2 obviously the c4 crop maize has the largest gpp value with 7 39 1 87 g c m 2 d 1 among these four crops whereas gpp of the c3 crops soybean paddy rice and winter wheat were generally below 6 g c m 2 d 1 during the growing season ecosystem et exhibited the highest value in paddy rice cropland with 3 44 0 99 mm d 1 which was attributed to artificial flood irrigation during the cultivate season however the soybean maize and winter wheat mainly relied on natural rainfall as a proxy of the coupling relationship between carbon and water fluxes this study revealed that maize cropland owned the strongest ecosystem wue of 2 48 0 69 g c kg 1 h2o followed by winter wheat 2 00 0 39 g c kg 1 h2o soybean 1 92 0 52 g c kg 1 h2o and paddy rice 1 88 0 63 g c kg 1 h2o 3 2 seasonal variations in gpp et and ecosystem wue of typical crops the seasonal dynamics in gpp et and ecosystem wue of soybean maize paddy rice and winter wheat croplands were illustrated in fig 4 distinct seasonal cycles existed in the gpp variability the seeds of soybean maize and paddy rice were generally sowed in the springtime then gpp increased gradually with the growth of crops reached the peak during the summertime approximately woy 26 and decreased again as the crops ripen in autumn but the winter wheat has quite different seasonal cycles with the seeds sown in mid october subsequently gpp had a small peak and then fell to zero after the wheat entered the winter as the temperature rises in springtime gpp increased quickly and reached the maximum in early summer the maize sites owned the largest gpp during the peak growth period over these cropland types meanwhile the study found that apparent differences in the maximum gpp values even for the same crops which can be ascribed to the effects of local environmental conditions and crop varieties in general the seasonality of et across the four crops exhibited similar patterns as gpp except the jpn mse site this region belongs to the subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with high et values around the growth period thus the seasonal fluctuations in et were generally lower than those in gpp among these cropland sites the variability in ecosystem wue also showed apparent seasonal dynamics and peaked together with gpp in the most active period 3 3 analysis of the environmental controls pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the environmental constraints of seasonal variations in 8 day mean tower based ecosystem wue of these typical crops table 3 this study found that ecosystem wue was mainly determined by gpp rather than et thus a series of biotic and abiotic factors influencing the gpp variability also strongly affect the seasonal patterns in ecosystem wue across soybean maize paddy rice and winter wheat croplands both rg and temperature ta and ts were strongly correlated to ecosystem wue of soybean maize and winter wheat they were recognized as the most important environmental controls among these abiotic factors besides vpd also had strong correlations with ecosystem wue of winter wheat at the long term flooded paddy rice cropland only ta was strongly and positively related to ecosystem wue 0 461 at 0 01 level furthermore as an important biophysical parameter comprehensively reflecting the environmental conditions time series modis ndvi data strongly impacted the seasonal patterns in crop wue table 3 the data over an 8 day period during the growing season of these cropland sites were used for analysis the soybean cropland has the highest correlation reaching up to 0 890 followed by the winter wheat 0 799 maize 0 748 and paddy rice 0 742 then liner regression is used to reveal the responses of ecosystem wue to the variability in ndvi across various croplands as shown in fig 5 for soybean cropland exponential function was the best fitting method with r2 of 0 90 however linear regression was the optimal fitting function for maize paddy rice and winter wheat croplands with r2 of 0 54 0 54 and 0 47 respectively given the complicated interactions among these environmental factors this study implied the potential path to remotely retrieve the variability in ecosystem wue using time series ndvi data 4 discussion there existed obvious difference between ecosystem wue of c4 crop maize and c3 crop soybean paddy rice and winter wheat in fig 6 us ib1 soybean us bo1 maize us twt paddy rice and us arm winter wheat stations were selected for the comparisons of gpp et and ecosystem wue the gpp of maize during growth period could reach over 20 g c m 2 d 1 while gpp of the other three crops were usually below 15 g c m 2 d 1 even in the peak growing season comparison of the seasonal variations in et also demonstrated the most water consumption at the paddy rice field among the four crops ecosystem wue of the maize was apparently higher than the other three crops with the peak value during growth period exceeding 6 g c kg 1 h2o compared to the other three crops ranging between 2 g c kg 1 h2o and 4 2 g c kg 1 h2o in addition to c3 cycle the c4 photosynthetic cycle supercharges photosynthesis by concentrating co2 around ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase and significantly reduces the oxygenation reaction edwards et al 2010 wang et al 2012 found the increase of both biomass production and co2 fixation with light intensity and co2 concentration in c4 is faster than that in c3 which reflected more efficient use of light and co2 in c4 plants many studies found that c4 vegetation exhibited increasing ecosystem wue in response to rising atmospheric co2 concentration ca by reducing the stomatal aperture as well as the transpiration rate compared with c3 species tong et al 2009 manzoni et al 2011 recent work has highlighted the role of other environmental variables that along with low ca may have contributed to the increase of c4 photosynthesis such as dry or saline conditions osborne and sack 2012 griffiths et al 2013 way et al 2014 these studies emphasized the role of c4 photosynthesis in improving plant water status and preventing hydraulic failure in these environments therefore the characteristics of species determine a higher ecosystem wue for c4 plants than for c3 plants majority of the plants 95 on earth are c3 type with only very few 5 as c4 type thus engineering c4 feature into c3 plants has been suggested as a feasible way to increase photosynthesis and yield of c3 crops such as rice wheat and soybean schuler et al 2016 although the ec method is now the most fundamental method for measuring carbon and water fluxes the findings in this study may contain plenty of uncertainties because flux measurements by the ec method are subject to errors a landmark paper by lenschow et al 1994 has defined systematic and random errors associated with limited samplings of the ec based measurements subsequently as the extensive use of ec systems many papers have been published on this aspect and several methods have emerged for flux uncertainty estimation accordingly papale et al 2006 billesbach 2011 however various problems remain under discussion contrary to traditional error analysis the assessment of ec flux errors is more difficult the systematic errors are not only instrument related but also affected by the unmet environmental conditions of the ec theory and its data processing scheme that is actually a complex long sequence of operation wang et al 2015 moreover flux exchange is controlled by atmospheric turbulence which is an inherently random process flux data often show wiggly variations in consecutive half hour sequences even in a clear stationary day when the net radiation shows a typical smooth diurnal cycle these random uncertainties primarily arise due to a limited number of independent samples of the turbulent eddies responsible for flux transport during a fixed sampling period hollinger and richardson 2005 reichstein et al 2007 other errors can be greatly reduced in a carefully designed field program however these sampling error will remain as one of the largest sources of uncertainty chen et al 2012 found that under the condition of surface heterogeneity the estimated nee value represents 50 60 of the true situation but there is still a problem of insufficient spatial representation due to technical restrictions previous studies often used the observation method according to the existing conditions which often leads to the lack of comparability among different research results and the scientific understanding among the ecosystems difficult ponton et al 2006 additionally the limitations of observation methods constrains the dynamic characteristics of wue and environmental control factors at multiple scales from leaf to ecosystem niu et al 2011 campos et al 2013 in recent years the micrometeorological technology has made great progress which becomes an effective method for long term and continuous observation of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes the flux sites of cropland used in this study were mainly distributed in the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere the coverage of cropland on earth is large with apparent differences in the seasonality in order to enhance the spatial representativeness the increase of flux towers can provide more long term data base for evaluating ecosystem wue across various crops a great number of environmental factors would affect crop wue variability particularly the interannual dynamics these factors are comprised of climatic changes including extreme weather events such as heatwave and drought climate zones due to geographical location rain fed or irrigated conventional or alternative tillage as well as the improvement in the breed of crops 5 conclusions on the basis of 33 ec based years of co2 and h2o flux measurements over 10 cropland sites around the world this study revealed the large differences in the seasonal and interannual variations of gpp et and ecosystem wue across the four crops widespread on the earth including soybean maize winter wheat and paddy rice specifically maize cropland owned the strongest ecosystem wue of 2 48 0 69 g c kg 1 h2o followed by winter wheat soybean and paddy rice on annual time scale the variability in ecosystem wue also exhibited apparent seasonal dynamics and peaked together with gpp in the most active period ecosystem wue of soybean maize and paddy rice increased gradually with crop growth and reached the peak during the summertime woy 26 whereas the winter wheat has quite different seasonality with two peaks meanwhile this study revealed that ecosystem wue was determined more by gpp by comparison with et both solar radiation and temperature were recognized as the most important environmental controls for soybean maize and winter wheat crops however only temperature strongly and positively affected ecosystem wue in the flooded paddy rice field the close correlation between time series modis ndvi data and crop wue implied the great potential to remotely retrieve spatial pattern of ecosystem wue over large areas because of different photosynthetic pathways in c3 and c4 crops ecosystem wue of the maize cropland was apparently higher than the other three crops with large differences in the peak wue values during the growth period thus integrating c4 photosynthesis into c3 crops may help raise the yield potential by means of rational engineering strategies acknowledgments this study was jointly supported by the fundamental

11348,air temperature ta is one of the key factors in agro hydrological studies including estimation of crop reference evapotranspiration et0 which is crucial for irrigation water management and sustainability of agro ecosystem productivity because direct measurements of et0 are difficult expensive and time consuming the use of physically based or empirical approaches linked to meteorological information is often preferred the prediction of worldwide energy resource project developed by the american national aeronautics and space administration power nasa provides daily meteorological information on a 1 latitude by 1 longitude grid despite the poor spatial resolution characterizing this archive the data is global and continuous in time so that it can be used in particular regions of the globe where weather measurements are not well spatially distributed and or there are some missing weather data to fill procedures for downscaling and spatial disaggregation of daily air temperatures retrieved from the power nasa archive were proposed and validated for the climate of sicily italy in particular a cosine function with three empirical parameters derived from ground elevation was suggested to estimate the spatial and temporal variability of a lapse rate adjustment factor used to downscale and to disaggregate power nasa air temperature model calibration was carried out over three years 2006 2008 whilst validation regarded the measurements acquired over the following six years 2009 2014 downscaled daily air temperature results were consistent and comparable with local ground measurements the spatial disaggregation technique aimed to map the distributions of ta was then tested by the joint use of the digital elevation model dem and the proposed model finally in order to assess the suitability of downscaled air temperatures two simplified empirical equations to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration et0 from air temperature and solar radiation turc 1961 hargreaves 1975 were applied to this aim daily et0 estimated by introducing native and downscaled power nasa air temperature values into turc and hargreaves equations were compared to the corresponding estimations obtained with fao 56 penman monteith fao 56 pm equation and climate data measured on ground keywords power nasa weather dats turc equation hargreaves equation 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions crop reference evapotranspiration et0 is an important numerical tool for a range of scientific and management models and decision frameworks specifically n irrigated agriculture reliable estimates of et0 are crucial for water management aimed to enhance ecosystem conservation and to increase water productivity rallo and provenzano 2013 cammalleri et al 2013 rallo et al 2014 barontini et al 2016 rodriguez sinobas et al 2016 autovino et al 2018 measurements of et0 with lysimeters schrader et al 2013 pan evaporimeters christiansen 1968 and the eddy covariance technique foken 2008 negm et al 2013 are difficult expensive and can only be exploited by well trained personnel in the absence of direct measurements the fao 56 penman monteith model fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 obtained by combining the energy balance with the mass transfer method has been recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations as a standard method to estimate et0 when a complete database of climate observations is available however in several parts of the world the lack of economic resources allocated to environmental monitoring results in the deficiency of detailed meteorological information and incomplete databases bagarello et al 2009 2011 consequently the fao 56 pm equation is often not applicable and it is necessary to use simplified models with a limited number of climate variables based on the considered variables these models are usually classified as temperature based thornthwaite 1948 blaney and criddle 1950 radiation based priestley and taylor 1972 or radiation and temperature based turc 1961 hargreaves 1975 nevertheless before application these models require a preliminary calibration mainly when environmental conditions are different from those in which they were obtained in the last decades the growing availability of open databases of meteorological information downloadable from the web such as those provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric observation noaa 2006 or by the american national aeronautics and space administration nasa offers new challenges autovino et al 2016 minacapilli et al 2016b rallo et al 2017 especially for countries in which complete databases are not easily accessible to the community of atmospheric and environmental scientists in this context the prediction of worldwide energy resource project developed by nasa power nasa represents an open archive of agro climatology variables available for over 30 years with global coverage http power larc nasa gov based on a grid of cells characterized by a spatial resolution of 1 latitude and 1 longitude zhang et al 2010 stackhouse et al 2015 the database includes meteorological variables minimum maximum and average air temperature average relative air humidity and dew point temperature at 2 m above ground and wind speed at 10 m above ground at a daily time step obtained from the goddard earth observing system geos 4 assimilation model version 4 bloom et al 2005 air temperatures are evaluated through an atmospheric analysis performed by combining atmospheric observations land surface pressure sea level pressure and winds and upper air data from rawinsondes with remotely sensed information from satellites and weather forecast data within a model scheme that assimilates and optimizes observation data and model estimates of atmospheric variables bloom et al 2005 the suitability of daily meteorological variables provided by the power nasa database as well as of estimates of fao 56 pm reference evapotranspiration was recently assessed in sicily italy based on ground measurements negm et al 2017 the results evidenced that some of the et0 input variables were comparable between power nasa and ground based datasets whereas others were subjected to either random or systematic uncertainty in particular estimated solar radiation values were in fairly good agreement with the measured values while the average air temperature due to the terrain heterogeneity resulted in good estimates at low elevations and overestimates at high elevations negm et al 2017 for the continental united states white et al 2011 observed a favorable comparison between solar radiation values recorded by automatic weather stations and values obtained using power nasa data deviations between the two temperature data sources were also verified by white et al 2008 in grid cells representing regions with large variations in elevation when considering relative air humidity and wind speed the power nasa data did not fit well to the corresponding ground measurements negm et al 2017 stackhouse et al 2015 however after combining the climate variables into the fao 56 pm equation it was observed that in general the two estimates agree to within about 0 9 mm day the larger disagreements were associated to some coastal weather stations due to the sea effect on relative air humidity as well as to some inland stations located at the higher elevations negm et al 2017 the constraints on air temperatures associated with the coarse power nasa grid cell as well as the well known inverse dependency of air temperature with elevation suggested that downscaling the power nasa air temperatures could reduce the observed bias with ground measurements and be used for gap filling procedures the spatial disaggregation of power nasa air temperature can also provide estimations of this variable in regions of the globe where weather stations are not well distributed stackhouse et al 2016 moreover although several studies have emphasized the possible dependency of air temperature on ground elevation and on proximity to coastlines lookingbill and urban 2003 harlow et al 2004 blandford et al 2008 white et al 2008 no one has tested the possibility of downscaling power nasa daily air temperature by including these orographic features the objective of this study was to propose and validate a model to downscale daily power nasa air temperatures under the climate conditions of sicily italy based on the spatial and temporal variability of a lapse rate adjustment factor that accounts for ground elevation the suitability of the proposed approach was then verified by considering i the comparison between daily air temperatures measured by a network of weather stations and the corresponding downscaled from power nasa database ii the cross comparison between the spatial distribution of daily air temperatures retrieved by disaggregating power nasa archive and the corresponding obtained by interpolating ground measurements iii the errors associated to daily reference evapotranspiration obtained with two empirical equations based on air temperature and solar radiation i e turc 1961 and hargreaves 1975 1 1 crop reference evapotranspiration models according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 reference evapotranspiration et0 mm d 1 can be estimated as 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn mj m 2 d 1 is the net radiation at the crop surface g mj m 2 d 1 is the soil heat flux density ta c is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height u2 m s 1 is the wind speed at 2 0 m height es and ea kpa are the saturation and actual vapor pressure δ kpa c is the slope of vapor pressure curve and finally γ kpa c is the air psychrometric constant at daily time steps the values of g are relatively small and therefore can be neglected allen et al 1998 application of the turc 1961 equation requires the knowledge of average air temperature tavg incoming short wave solar radiation rs as well as the relative humidity value rhavg 2 e t 0 0 31 a t r s 2 094 t a v g t a v g 15 where et0 is in

1 50 r h a v g 70 the turc equation should only be applied if the average air temperature is higher than 10 c allen 2008 alternatively the hargreaves 1975 equation which requires the knowledge of tavg and rs can be written as 4 e t 0 0 4082 0 0135 t a v g 17 8 r s with et0 is in mm d 1 rs in mj m 2 d 1 and tavg in c both the turc and hargreaves models whose accuracy was preliminarily assessed in sicily minacapilli et al 2016a were chosen because their application only requires air temperature and solar radiation inputs 2 materials and methods daily air temperature and solar radiation data from the power nasa archive were downloaded from the public nasa website https power larc nasa gov from january 1st 2006 to december 31st 2014 for the same period a set of local agro climatic measurements recorded by the agro meteorological information service of sicily sias were also acquired to identify the downscaling procedure as well as to validate the downscaled air temperatures the sias service consists of about 100 climate stations equipped to measure air temperature c relative air humidity incoming shortwave solar radiation rs mj m 2d 1 and wind speed at 2 m height u2 m s 1 at either hourly or daily time steps before publishing the weather data the service provider performs preliminary data quality assessment and control procedures according to the standards of the world meteorological organization 2003 the daily average sias air temperatures were used as a basis for comparison whereas all the other sias variables were used to estimate et0 by means of the fao 56 pm equation the data from all ground weather stations were initially checked and filtered for completeness in order to remove days where one or more data recording was missing fig 1 shows the digital terrain model of sicily with the location of sias climate stations as well as the power nasa grid cells covering the whole island in the present study 26 ground stations covering different ecological zones were selected within the two power nasa grid cells named f and g identified by latitude and longitude ranging between 37 and 38 n and 13 and 15 e respectively at the considered latitude the area covered by the two grid cells corresponds to approximately 90 110 km grid cells f and g are covered by 69 4 and 97 0 land respectively and were chosen to minimize the uncertainties related to the extensive presence of the sea which covers the vast majority of the remaining cells additionally the chosen grid cells include weather stations installed over a fairly large range of elevation from 40 to 1470 m a s l fig 1 compared to the limited variability in elevation that characterizes the other grid cells for each sias weather station located on the ground table 1 shows the identification code id and the name indicated in the original database the geographic coordinates the elevation the distance from the sea and the number of records available in the examined period seasonal fluctuations of air temperature are mainly governed by solar radiation and show a typical sinusoidal pattern which depends on the relative earth sun distance and the julian day j 0 365 and is generally modeled by a cosine function spencer 1971 allen et al 1998 the following simplified equation was therefore assumed to characterize the annual variability of daily average air temperature tavg 5 t a v g f 1 f 2 c o s 2 π j f 3 365 where f1 f2 and f3 are fitting parameters which are different when considering data from the sias versus power nasa database in order to downscale the power nasa air temperature the lapse rate adjustment coefficient kt was evaluated using the ratio between daily sias air temperature for each sias ground station tavg s and the corresponding power nasa value tavg n 6 k t t a v g s t a v g n since both sias and power nasa air temperatures are in phase and with the same annual period the ratio kt can also be represented by a sinusoidal function kt e j whose shape was assumed to have the following expression 7 k t e a b c o s 2 π j c 365 where a b and c are dimensionless empirical parameters that require fitting and j is the julian day in particular the first parameter a identifies the position of the sinusoidal axis which depends on the ratio between average yearly sias and power nasa air temperatures the second parameter b represents the sinusoidal amplitude and the third parameter c defined in the range between 0 and 365 explains the sinusoid delay although the proposed model is semi empirical it allows the user to account for the possible seasonal variability of the lapse rate adjustment coefficient which exhibits similar patterns to those characterizing the annual cycle of air temperatures for each weather station parameters in eq 7 were initially fitted using sias and power nasa air temperatures collected over three years 2006 2008 then the variability of the fitted parameters was explained based on the weather station orographic attributes elevation h and coastal distance d in order to obtain the relationships aimed to estimate a b and c parameters in each power nasa grid cell the proposed model kt e j was finally validated for the period 2009 to 2014 by comparing ground sias air temperatures daily values with the corresponding values downscaled from the power nasa archive tavg nd computed as 8 t a v g n d k t e x t a v g n this equation has also been used to obtain the spatial disaggregation of power nasa daily air temperature on pixels of 1 0 km based on the terrain attributes derived by a digital elevation model dem the accuracy of this spatial disaggregation was finally assessed by means of a cross comparison with the corresponding spatialized ground measurements finally the errors on daily et0 values were estimated by using the turc 1961 and hargreaves 1975 equations both of these equations were applied by retrieving solar radiation and air temperature from the power nasa database the latter being determined before tavg n and after tavg nd application of the proposed downscaling procedure in both cases the obtained estimates were compared to the corresponding values calculated according to the fao 56 pm equation that were assumed as reference 2 1 statistical comparisons the root mean square error rmse and the mean bias error mbe were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the examined variables 9 r m s e i 1

has the ability to evaluate the errors in the same unit of the original variable whereas mbe quantifies the average over or under prediction for a certain variable values of mbe equal to zero indicate that the estimates do not deviate from the corresponding measurements which are considered the true values on the other hand a positive mbe corresponds to a certain overestimation of the variable whereas a negative value indicates its underestimation 3 results and discussion a preliminary analysis carried out to verify the consistency of sias database showed the presence of 6 3 missing data which were randomly distributed during the whole period of observation only three weather stations id 216 id 245 id 311 had less than 90 of available records it was therefore assumed that the influence of missing records would not affect the results in comparison over the entire examined period 2006 2014 the power nasa database was complete and contained 3287 records per each variable as a result comparisons were carried out only for those days where full records for all the considered variables were available fig 2a b displays the comparisons between daily air temperatures from power nasa tavg n and sias tavg s databases respectively obtained for grid cells f and g in the validation period from 2009 to 2014 fig 2 c d shows the probability density functions of the difference δt tavg n tavg s obtained after dividing the errors into classes of 1 c despite the overall agreement between the two databases δt values for grid cells f and g fig 2a b ranged from about 9 c to 14 0 c however when considering the probability density functions fig 2c d shows that δt values are distributed according to a normal distribution with 68 of values falling in the intervals 0 1 δt 4 6 c for cell f and 0 4 δt 5 9 c for cell g discrepancies in air temperature are largely related to the coarse resolution of power nasa grid cells 1 that does not account for specific local features such as orography and distance from the coastline in order to identify the sources of the observed discrepancies table 2 summarizes the values of rmse and mbe associated to daily air temperature distinctly evaluated for each climate station located within cells f and g from2006 to2014 in particular rmse values ranged between 1 4 and 6 0 c in cell f and between 1 7 and 9 5 c in cell g whereas mbe values fell in the intervals 0 2 5 5 c and 0 1 9 2 c in cells f and g respectively for all the examined ground weather stations fig 3 shows the relationships between rmse and mbe values and the elevation of the station h as can be observed for h lower than about 300 m a s l errors associated with power nasa air temperatures are not related to ground elevation whereas they are closely dependent on h at elevations higher than 300 m a s l fig 3 as remarked by white et al 2008 the observed trend is consistent with the expectation that the power nasa data are representative of the mean elevation over the entire grid cell thus when cells are characterized by a large variability in elevation such as those investigated in sicily differences between point data from sias and grid cell temperatures from power nasa can become consistent this result is corroborated by the generally higher rmse and mbe observed in cell g in which the standard deviation of elevation is 371 m compared to cell f in which it is only 245 m fig 1 fig 4 shows temporal trends of the lapse rate adjustment coefficient kt obtained for four climate stations id 202 id 213 id 264 id 231 with quite different elevation h and distance from the coastline d for the time period 2006 2008 kt is representative of the overall variability of air temperature and was used to downscale the power nasa air temperatures according to eq 6 fig 4 also shows that especially for weather stations located at high elevations and large distances from the coastline the temporal trend of observed kt values is characterized by a typical sinusoidal pattern confirming the assumption made to derive eq 7 specifically weather stations located at less than 300 m a s l e g id 202 213 showed tenuous variability while at higher elevations e g id 264 231 a typical annual cycle was more manifest with maximum kt observed in summer and minimum in winter these patterns partially explain the differences observed in rmse and mbe associated to air temperature for each weather station even for those characterized by low temporal variability the cosine function kte j indicated in eq 7 was calibrated in particular the value of parameter a sinusoidal axis was evaluated as the average of the lapse rate adjustment factor kt values obtained in the calibration period from 2006 to 2008 whereas the parameters b and c were determined according to a nonlinear generalized reduced gradient grg algorithm by minimizing the variance of residuals between power nasa and sias air temperatures with the aim to assess the dependency of eq 7 parameters on orographic features the set of a b and c coefficients were then correlated to ground elevation and coastal distance for sias weather stations within cells f and g fig 5 shows a strong relationship between variables a b and ground elevation for the calibration period whereas parameter c appears not to be correlated to the ground elevation in particular for h 300 m a s l a single relationship characterized the dependency a h for the two examined grid cells according to the equation 11 a 1 0460 0 0004 h r2 0 94 with h expressed in m for h 300 m a s l the parameter a can be assumed constant and equal to 0 926 fig 5a regarding the parameter b the following two distinct regression equations were obtained for cells f and g 12 cell f b 0 0176 0 0002 h r2 0 85 13 cell g b 0 0324 0 0002 h r2 0 94 with h expressed in m finally despite the absence of correlation between c and h the limited variability between c 11 and c 23 for cell f and between c 22 and c 40 for cell g within its definition domain 0 365 made it possible to assume the following constant values 14 cell f c 17 2 15 cell g c 32 7 ground stations located at elevation lower than 300 m a s l demonstrated a slight correlation between the examined parameters and the distance from the sea d however the relationships developed here do not account for d because its introduction did not improve the model accuracy the reason for this can be attributed to the limited variability of d characterizing weather stations at h 300 m a s l due to its semi empirical nature the proposed approach can be therefore applied to areas with relatively variable orography and within which there are missing weather data but still enough data to allow for model calibration however we believe that in more homogeneous flat environments that are not too close to the sea ground air temperature within the grid cell should be characterized by low variability assuming values similar to those indicated in the power nasa database the proposed methodology to downscale the power nasa air temperatures was then validated based on sias ground measurements registered over six years 2009 2014 fig 6 a b shows the comparison of downscaled power nasa air temperatures and the corresponding sias respectively for grid cells f and g when compared with fig 2a b fig 6a b shows that for both grid cells downscaled power nasa air temperatures are consistently improved with respect to the native unscaled data as confirmed by the r2 values associated to the regression lines fitted through the origin on the other hand fig 6c d illustrates the comparison between the probability density distributions of air temperature differences δt evaluated with native and downscaled data for both grid cells fig 6c d shows that the average δt approaches zero and the standard deviation is less than that of the native data rmse and mbe associated with the comparison between downscaled power nasa and sias air temperatures for both the examined grid cells are plotted in fig 7 as a function of ground elevation as is shown after applying the downscaling procedure the original trends of rmse and mbe showed in fig 3 for ground stations located at h 300 m a s l disappear so that rmse and mbe values become independent of ground elevation at average values of about 2 c and 0 4 c respectively an additional potential use of the proposed approach is the ability to map patterns of daily air temperatures with a spatial resolution higher than the original power nasa grid cell in fact by combining the proposed model with the elevations retrieved by a digital elevation model dem it is possible to estimate daily air temperature for each pixel of the dem and to obtain the spatial disaggregation within the power nasa grid cell an example of this application is shown in fig 8 a d where for two days of 2011 j 161 and j 193 the spatial distributions of ground measurements of daily air temperatures fig 8a b are compared to the corresponding disaggregated power nasa data fig 8c d for both grid cells f and g the disaggregation technique was carried out by using a dem of sicily characterized by resolution of 4 4 km and the spatial distributions of ground measurements were obtained by ordinary kriging at the same spatial resolution as shown in fig 8 for both the examined days the distribution of ta obtained by the two approaches resulted is similar with values of temperatures ranging from 13 c to 24 c for the julian 161 and from 21 c to 31 c for the julian 193 fig 9 a b shows the spatial distribution of the error δe computed in each pixel as the difference between the interpolated ground measurement of ta and the corresponding disaggregated value from power nasa which for a large part of the surface 60 75 ranged from 2 c to 2 c the proposed methodology was finally assessed based on the comparison between daily reference et0 estimated with turc 1961 and hargreaves 1975 equations in which both solar radiation and air temperatures native and downscaled were retrieved from the power nasa database with the corresponding value obtained using the fao 56 pm equation and all climate variables measured on ground for each weather station table 3 shows the values of rmse and mbe used to evaluate the accuracy of these comparisons for the period 2006 2014 turc tu and hargreaves hg equations were applied considering i sias ground measurements subscript s ii native power nasa air temperature subscript n and finally iii downscaled power nasa air temperatures subscript nd as shown in table 3 both the turc and hargreaves models demonstrate similar performance when using the sias ground measurements in fact values of rmse range between 0 38 and 0 87 mm with an average of 0 57 mm and average mbe values are equal to 0 13 turc model and 0 06 hargreaves model this is considered acceptable for practical applications since during irrigation season when atmospheric water requirements is high reference evapotranspiration in sicily reaches values of 6 7 mm d 1 minacapilli et al 2016b moreover when considering the native or downscaled power nasa air temperature it is possible to verify that the proposed downscaling procedure generally improved the accuracy of estimations for both the turc and hargreaves models as confirmed by the systematic reduction of rmse and mbe with respect to the native database for each weather station fig 10 a d shows the values of rmse and mbe obtained when comparing daily et0 values estimated with turc tu and hargreaves hg equations with the corresponding et0 values computed by fao 56 pm equation as function of ground elevation h as shown the use of downscaled power nasa air temperature results in a general improvement of et0 estimations which becomes more evident at higher elevations 4 conclusions a model for downscaling daily air temperatures retrieved from the power nasa agro meteorological archive was proposed and validated based on ground measurements registered by a network of weather stations installed in sicily italy the suitability of the proposed methodology was verified not only in terms of comparison between measured and downscaled local daily air temperatures but also in terms of capability to capture the spatial distribution patterns the suitability of the proposed methodology was also verified against two simplified evapotranspiration models turc 1961 hargreaves 1975 the method is based on a simple lapse rate adjustment coefficient kt that can be computed using a cosine function of julian day combined with three parameters a b and c which depend on ground elevation the proposed approach allows i to estimate local air temperatures from gridded power nasa data ii to fill gaps in air temperature time series when weather information are limited or discontinuous iii to derive spatial distribution patterns of daily air temperature in regions where the number of available weather stations is limited as a final check two simplified evapotranspiration models turc 1961 and hargreaves 1975 were used to assess the suitability of the proposed downscaling methodology downscaled air temperatures were input into the two models and resulting et0 estimates were compared with estimates obtained with the fao 56 pm equation and sias measurements resultant rmse values ranging from 0 44 and 1 08 mm average of 0 72 0 74 mm and average mbe values of 0 06 turc equation and 0 13 mm hargreaves equation confirm the validity of the proposed procedure for practical applications such as the estimation of reference et0 acknowledgments web

11348,air temperature ta is one of the key factors in agro hydrological studies including estimation of crop reference evapotranspiration et0 which is crucial for irrigation water management and sustainability of agro ecosystem productivity because direct measurements of et0 are difficult expensive and time consuming the use of physically based or empirical approaches linked to meteorological information is often preferred the prediction of worldwide energy resource project developed by the american national aeronautics and space administration power nasa provides daily meteorological information on a 1 latitude by 1 longitude grid despite the poor spatial resolution characterizing this archive the data is global and continuous in time so that it can be used in particular regions of the globe where weather measurements are not well spatially distributed and or there are some missing weather data to fill procedures for downscaling and spatial disaggregation of daily air temperatures retrieved from the power nasa archive were proposed and validated for the climate of sicily italy in particular a cosine function with three empirical parameters derived from ground elevation was suggested to estimate the spatial and temporal variability of a lapse rate adjustment factor used to downscale and to disaggregate power nasa air temperature model calibration was carried out over three years 2006 2008 whilst validation regarded the measurements acquired over the following six years 2009 2014 downscaled daily air temperature results were consistent and comparable with local ground measurements the spatial disaggregation technique aimed to map the distributions of ta was then tested by the joint use of the digital elevation model dem and the proposed model finally in order to assess the suitability of downscaled air temperatures two simplified empirical equations to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration et0 from air temperature and solar radiation turc 1961 hargreaves 1975 were applied to this aim daily et0 estimated by introducing native and downscaled power nasa air temperature values into turc and hargreaves equations were compared to the corresponding estimations obtained with fao 56 penman monteith fao 56 pm equation and climate data measured on ground keywords power nasa weather dats turc equation hargreaves equation 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions crop reference evapotranspiration et0 is an important numerical tool for a range of scientific and management models and decision frameworks specifically n irrigated agriculture reliable estimates of et0 are crucial for water management aimed to enhance ecosystem conservation and to increase water productivity rallo and provenzano 2013 cammalleri et al 2013 rallo et al 2014 barontini et al 2016 rodriguez sinobas et al 2016 autovino et al 2018 measurements of et0 with lysimeters schrader et al 2013 pan evaporimeters christiansen 1968 and the eddy covariance technique foken 2008 negm et al 2013 are difficult expensive and can only be exploited by well trained personnel in the absence of direct measurements the fao 56 penman monteith model fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 obtained by combining the energy balance with the mass transfer method has been recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations as a standard method to estimate et0 when a complete database of climate observations is available however in several parts of the world the lack of economic resources allocated to environmental monitoring results in the deficiency of detailed meteorological information and incomplete databases bagarello et al 2009 2011 consequently the fao 56 pm equation is often not applicable and it is necessary to use simplified models with a limited number of climate variables based on the considered variables these models are usually classified as temperature based thornthwaite 1948 blaney and criddle 1950 radiation based priestley and taylor 1972 or radiation and temperature based turc 1961 hargreaves 1975 nevertheless before application these models require a preliminary calibration mainly when environmental conditions are different from those in which they were obtained in the last decades the growing availability of open databases of meteorological information downloadable from the web such as those provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric observation noaa 2006 or by the american national aeronautics and space administration nasa offers new challenges autovino et al 2016 minacapilli et al 2016b rallo et al 2017 especially for countries in which complete databases are not easily accessible to the community of atmospheric and environmental scientists in this context the prediction of worldwide energy resource project developed by nasa power nasa represents an open archive of agro climatology variables available for over 30 years with global coverage http power larc nasa gov based on a grid of cells characterized by a spatial resolution of 1 latitude and 1 longitude zhang et al 2010 stackhouse et al 2015 the database includes meteorological variables minimum maximum and average air temperature average relative air humidity and dew point temperature at 2 m above ground and wind speed at 10 m above ground at a daily time step obtained from the goddard earth observing system geos 4 assimilation model version 4 bloom et al 2005 air temperatures are evaluated through an atmospheric analysis performed by combining atmospheric observations land surface pressure sea level pressure and winds and upper air data from rawinsondes with remotely sensed information from satellites and weather forecast data within a model scheme that assimilates and optimizes observation data and model estimates of atmospheric variables bloom et al 2005 the suitability of daily meteorological variables provided by the power nasa database as well as of estimates of fao 56 pm reference evapotranspiration was recently assessed in sicily italy based on ground measurements negm et al 2017 the results evidenced that some of the et0 input variables were comparable between power nasa and ground based datasets whereas others were subjected to either random or systematic uncertainty in particular estimated solar radiation values were in fairly good agreement with the measured values while the average air temperature due to the terrain heterogeneity resulted in good estimates at low elevations and overestimates at high elevations negm et al 2017 for the continental united states white et al 2011 observed a favorable comparison between solar radiation values recorded by automatic weather stations and values obtained using power nasa data deviations between the two temperature data sources were also verified by white et al 2008 in grid cells representing regions with large variations in elevation when considering relative air humidity and wind speed the power nasa data did not fit well to the corresponding ground measurements negm et al 2017 stackhouse et al 2015 however after combining the climate variables into the fao 56 pm equation it was observed that in general the two estimates agree to within about 0 9 mm day the larger disagreements were associated to some coastal weather stations due to the sea effect on relative air humidity as well as to some inland stations located at the higher elevations negm et al 2017 the constraints on air temperatures associated with the coarse power nasa grid cell as well as the well known inverse dependency of air temperature with elevation suggested that downscaling the power nasa air temperatures could reduce the observed bias with ground measurements and be used for gap filling procedures the spatial disaggregation of power nasa air temperature can also provide estimations of this variable in regions of the globe where weather stations are not well distributed stackhouse et al 2016 moreover although several studies have emphasized the possible dependency of air temperature on ground elevation and on proximity to coastlines lookingbill and urban 2003 harlow et al 2004 blandford et al 2008 white et al 2008 no one has tested the possibility of downscaling power nasa daily air temperature by including these orographic features the objective of this study was to propose and validate a model to downscale daily power nasa air temperatures under the climate conditions of sicily italy based on the spatial and temporal variability of a lapse rate adjustment factor that accounts for ground elevation the suitability of the proposed approach was then verified by considering i the comparison between daily air temperatures measured by a network of weather stations and the corresponding downscaled from power nasa database ii the cross comparison between the spatial distribution of daily air temperatures retrieved by disaggregating power nasa archive and the corresponding obtained by interpolating ground measurements iii the errors associated to daily reference evapotranspiration obtained with two empirical equations based on air temperature and solar radiation i e turc 1961 and hargreaves 1975 1 1 crop reference evapotranspiration models according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 reference evapotranspiration et0 mm d 1 can be estimated as 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn mj m 2 d 1 is the net radiation at the crop surface g mj m 2 d 1 is the soil heat flux density ta c is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height u2 m s 1 is the wind speed at 2 0 m height es and ea kpa are the saturation and actual vapor pressure δ kpa c is the slope of vapor pressure curve and finally γ kpa c is the air psychrometric constant at daily time steps the values of g are relatively small and therefore can be neglected allen et al 1998 application of the turc 1961 equation requires the knowledge of average air temperature tavg incoming short wave solar radiation rs as well as the relative humidity value rhavg 2 e t 0 0 31 a t r s 2 094 t a v g t a v g 15 where et0 is in

1 50 r h a v g 70 the turc equation should only be applied if the average air temperature is higher than 10 c allen 2008 alternatively the hargreaves 1975 equation which requires the knowledge of tavg

sicily minacapilli et al 2016a were chosen because their application only requires air temperature and solar radiation inputs 2 materials and methods daily air temperature and solar radiation data from the power nasa archive were downloaded from the public nasa website https power larc nasa gov from january 1st 2006 to december 31st 2014 for the same period a set of local agro climatic measurements recorded by the agro meteorological information service of sicily sias were also acquired to identify the downscaling procedure as well as to validate the downscaled air temperatures the sias service consists of about 100 climate stations equipped to measure air temperature c relative air humidity incoming shortwave solar radiation rs mj m 2d 1 and wind speed at 2 m height u2 m s 1 at either hourly or daily time steps before publishing the weather data the service provider performs preliminary data quality assessment and control procedures according to the standards of the world meteorological organization 2003 the daily average sias air temperatures were used as a basis for comparison whereas all the other sias variables were used to estimate et0 by means of the fao 56 pm equation the data from all ground weather stations were initially checked and filtered for completeness in order to remove days where one or more data recording was missing fig 1 shows the digital terrain model of sicily with the location of sias climate stations as well as the power nasa grid cells covering the whole island in the present study 26 ground stations covering different ecological zones were selected within the two power nasa grid cells named f and g identified by latitude and longitude ranging between 37 and 38 n and 13 and 15 e respectively at the considered latitude the area covered by the two grid cells corresponds to approximately 90 110 km grid cells f and g are covered by 69 4 and 97 0 land respectively and were chosen to minimize the uncertainties related to the extensive presence of the sea which covers the vast majority of the remaining cells additionally the chosen grid cells include weather stations installed over a fairly large range of elevation from 40 to 1470 m a s l fig 1 compared to the limited variability in elevation that characterizes the other grid cells for each sias weather station located on the ground table 1 shows the identification code id and the name indicated in the original database the geographic coordinates the elevation the distance from the sea and the number of records available in the examined period seasonal fluctuations of air temperature are mainly governed by solar radiation and show a typical sinusoidal pattern which depends on the relative earth sun distance and the julian day j 0 365 and is generally modeled by a cosine function spencer 1971 allen et al 1998 the following simplified equation was therefore assumed to characterize the annual variability of daily average air temperature tavg 5 t a v g f 1 f 2 c o s 2 π j f 3 365 where f1 f2 and f3 are fitting parameters which are different when considering data from the sias versus power nasa database in order to downscale the power nasa air temperature the lapse rate adjustment coefficient kt was evaluated using the ratio between daily sias air temperature for each sias ground station tavg s and the corresponding power nasa value tavg n 6 k t t a v g s t a v g n since both sias and power nasa air temperatures are in phase and with the same annual period the ratio kt can also be represented by a sinusoidal function kt e j whose shape was assumed to have the following expression 7 k t e a b c o s 2 π j c 365 where a b and c are dimensionless empirical parameters that require fitting and j is the julian day in particular the first parameter a identifies the position of the sinusoidal axis which depends on the ratio between average yearly sias and power nasa air temperatures the second parameter b represents the sinusoidal amplitude and the third parameter c defined in the range between 0 and 365 explains the sinusoid delay although the proposed model is semi empirical it allows the user to account for the possible seasonal variability of the lapse rate adjustment coefficient which exhibits similar patterns to those characterizing the annual cycle of air temperatures for each weather station parameters in eq 7 were initially fitted using sias and power nasa air temperatures collected over three years 2006 2008 then the variability of the fitted parameters was explained based on the weather station orographic attributes elevation h and coastal distance d in order to obtain the relationships aimed to estimate a b and c parameters in each power nasa grid cell the proposed model kt e j was finally validated for the period 2009 to 2014 by comparing ground sias air temperatures daily values with the corresponding values downscaled from the power nasa archive tavg nd computed as 8 t a v g n d k t e x t a v g n this equation has also been used to obtain the spatial disaggregation of power nasa daily air temperature on pixels of 1 0 km based on the terrain attributes derived by a digital elevation model dem the accuracy of this spatial disaggregation was finally assessed by means of a cross comparison with the corresponding spatialized ground measurements finally the errors on daily et0 values were estimated by using the turc 1961 and hargreaves 1975 equations both of these equations were applied by retrieving solar radiation and air temperature from the power nasa database the latter being determined before tavg n and after tavg nd application of the proposed downscaling procedure in both cases the obtained estimates were compared to the corresponding values calculated according to the fao 56 pm equation that were assumed as reference 2 1 statistical comparisons the root mean square error rmse and the mean bias error mbe were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the examined variables 9 r m s e i 1

has the ability to evaluate the errors in the same unit of the original variable whereas mbe quantifies the average over or under prediction for a certain variable values of mbe equal to zero indicate that the estimates do not deviate from the corresponding measurements which are considered the true values on the other hand a positive mbe corresponds to a certain overestimation of the variable whereas a negative value indicates its underestimation 3 results and discussion a preliminary analysis carried out to verify the consistency of sias database showed the presence of 6 3 missing data which were randomly distributed during the whole period of observation only three weather stations id 216 id 245 id 311 had less than 90 of available records it was therefore assumed that the influence of missing records would not affect the results in comparison over the entire examined period 2006 2014 the power nasa database was complete and contained 3287 records per each variable as a result comparisons were carried out only for those days where full records for all the considered variables were available fig 2a b displays the comparisons between daily air temperatures from power nasa tavg n and sias tavg s databases respectively obtained for grid cells f and g in the validation period from 2009 to 2014 fig 2 c d shows the probability density functions of the difference δt tavg n tavg s obtained after dividing the errors into classes of 1 c despite the overall agreement between the two databases δt values for grid cells f and g fig 2a b ranged from about 9 c to 14 0 c however when considering the probability density functions fig 2c d shows that δt values are distributed according to a normal distribution with 68 of values falling in the intervals 0 1 δt 4 6 c for cell f and 0 4 δt 5 9 c for cell g discrepancies in air temperature are largely related to the coarse resolution of power nasa grid cells 1 that does not account for specific local features such as orography and distance from the coastline in order to identify the sources of the observed discrepancies table 2 summarizes the values of rmse and mbe associated to daily air temperature distinctly evaluated for each climate station located within cells f and g from2006 to2014 in particular rmse values ranged between 1 4 and 6 0 c in cell f and between 1 7 and 9 5 c in cell g whereas mbe values fell in the intervals 0 2 5 5 c and 0 1 9 2 c in cells f and g respectively for all the examined ground weather stations fig 3 shows the relationships between rmse and mbe values and the elevation of the station h as can be observed for h lower than about 300 m a s l errors associated with power nasa air temperatures are not related to ground elevation whereas they are closely dependent on h at elevations higher than 300 m a s l fig 3 as remarked by white et al 2008 the observed trend is consistent with the expectation that the power nasa data are representative of the mean elevation over the entire grid cell thus when cells are characterized by a large variability in elevation such as those investigated in sicily differences between point data from sias and grid cell temperatures from power nasa can become consistent this result is corroborated by the generally higher rmse and mbe observed in cell g in which the standard deviation of elevation is 371 m compared to cell f in which it is only 245 m fig 1 fig 4 shows temporal trends of the lapse rate adjustment coefficient kt obtained for four climate stations id 202 id 213 id 264 id 231 with quite different elevation h and distance from the coastline d for the time period 2006 2008 kt is representative of the overall variability of air temperature and was used to downscale the power nasa air temperatures according to eq 6 fig 4 also shows that especially for weather stations located at high elevations and large distances from the coastline the temporal trend of observed kt values is characterized by a typical sinusoidal pattern confirming the assumption made to derive eq 7 specifically weather stations located at less than 300 m a s l e g id 202 213 showed tenuous variability while at higher elevations e g id 264 231 a typical annual cycle was more manifest with maximum kt observed in summer and minimum in winter these patterns partially explain the differences observed in rmse and mbe associated to air temperature for each weather station even for those characterized by low temporal variability the cosine function kte j indicated in eq 7 was calibrated in particular the value of parameter a sinusoidal axis was evaluated as the average of the lapse rate adjustment factor kt values obtained in the calibration period from 2006 to 2008 whereas the parameters b and c were determined according to a nonlinear generalized reduced gradient grg algorithm by minimizing the variance of residuals between power nasa and sias air temperatures with the aim to assess the dependency of eq 7 parameters on orographic features the set of a b and c coefficients were then correlated to ground elevation and coastal distance for sias weather stations within cells f and g fig 5 shows a strong relationship between variables a b and ground elevation for the calibration period whereas parameter c appears not to be correlated to the ground elevation in particular for h 300 m a s l a single relationship characterized the dependency a h for the two examined grid cells according to the equation 11 a 1 0460 0 0004 h r2 0 94 with h expressed in m for h 300 m a s l the parameter a can be assumed constant and equal to 0 926 fig 5a regarding the parameter b the following two distinct regression equations were obtained for cells f and g 12 cell f b 0 0176 0 0002 h r2 0 85 13 cell g b 0 0324 0 0002 h r2 0 94 with h expressed in m finally despite the absence of correlation between c and h the limited variability between c 11 and c 23 for cell f and between c 22 and c 40 for cell g within its definition domain 0 365 made it possible to assume the following constant values 14 cell f c 17 2 15 cell g c 32 7 ground stations located at elevation lower than 300 m a s l demonstrated a slight correlation between the examined parameters and the distance from the sea d however the relationships developed here do not account for d because its introduction did not improve the model accuracy the reason for this can be attributed to the limited variability of d characterizing weather stations at h 300 m a s l due to its semi empirical nature the proposed approach can be therefore applied to areas with relatively variable orography and within which there are missing weather data but still enough data to allow for model calibration however we believe that in more homogeneous flat environments that are not too close to the sea ground air temperature within the grid cell should be characterized by low variability assuming values similar to those indicated in the power nasa database the proposed methodology to downscale the power nasa air temperatures was then validated based on sias ground measurements registered over six years 2009 2014 fig 6 a b shows the comparison of downscaled power nasa air temperatures and the corresponding sias respectively for grid cells f and g when compared with fig 2a b fig 6a b shows that for both grid cells downscaled power nasa air temperatures are consistently improved with respect to the native unscaled data as confirmed by the r2 values associated to the regression lines fitted through the origin on the other hand fig 6c d illustrates the comparison between the probability density distributions of air temperature differences δt evaluated with native and downscaled data for both grid cells fig 6c d shows that the average δt approaches zero and the standard deviation is less than that of the native data rmse and mbe associated with the comparison between downscaled power nasa and sias air temperatures for both the examined grid cells are plotted in fig 7 as a function of ground elevation as is shown after applying the downscaling procedure the original trends of rmse and mbe showed in fig 3 for ground stations located at h 300 m a s l disappear so that rmse and mbe values become independent of ground elevation at average values of about 2 c and 0 4 c respectively an additional potential use of the proposed approach is the ability to map patterns of daily air temperatures with a spatial resolution higher than the original power nasa grid cell in fact by combining the proposed model with the elevations retrieved by a digital elevation model dem it is possible to estimate daily air temperature for each pixel of the dem and to obtain the spatial disaggregation within the power nasa grid cell an example of this application is shown in fig 8 a d where for two days of 2011 j 161 and j 193 the spatial distributions of ground measurements of daily air temperatures fig 8a b are compared to the corresponding disaggregated power nasa data fig 8c d for both grid cells f and g the disaggregation technique was carried out by using a dem of sicily characterized by resolution of 4 4 km and the spatial distributions of ground measurements were obtained by ordinary kriging at the same spatial resolution as shown in fig 8 for both the examined days the distribution of ta obtained by the two approaches resulted is similar with values of temperatures ranging from 13 c to 24 c for the julian 161 and from 21 c to 31 c for the julian 193 fig 9 a b shows the spatial distribution of the error δe computed in each pixel as the difference between the interpolated ground measurement of ta and the corresponding disaggregated value from power nasa which for a large part of the surface 60 75 ranged from 2 c to 2 c the proposed methodology was finally assessed based on the comparison between daily reference et0 estimated with turc 1961 and hargreaves 1975 equations in which both solar radiation and air temperatures native and downscaled were retrieved from the power nasa database with the corresponding value obtained using the fao 56 pm equation and all climate variables measured on ground for each weather station table 3 shows the values of rmse and mbe used to evaluate the accuracy of these comparisons for the period 2006 2014 turc tu and hargreaves hg equations were applied considering i sias ground measurements subscript s ii native power nasa air temperature subscript n and finally iii downscaled power nasa air temperatures subscript nd as shown in table 3 both the turc and hargreaves models demonstrate similar performance when using the sias ground measurements in fact values of rmse range between 0 38 and 0 87 mm with an average of 0 57 mm and average mbe values are equal to 0 13 turc model and 0 06 hargreaves model this is considered acceptable for practical applications since during irrigation season when atmospheric water requirements is high reference evapotranspiration in sicily reaches values of 6 7 mm d 1 minacapilli et al 2016b moreover when considering the native or downscaled power nasa air temperature it is possible to verify that the proposed downscaling procedure generally improved the accuracy of estimations for both the turc and hargreaves models as confirmed by the systematic reduction of rmse and mbe with respect to the native database for each weather station fig 10 a d shows the values of rmse and mbe obtained when comparing daily et0 values estimated with turc tu and hargreaves hg equations with the corresponding et0 values computed by fao 56 pm equation as function of ground elevation h as shown the use of downscaled power nasa air temperature results in a general improvement of et0 estimations which becomes more evident at higher elevations 4 conclusions a model for downscaling daily air temperatures retrieved from the power nasa agro meteorological archive was proposed and validated based on ground measurements registered by a network of weather stations installed in sicily italy the suitability of the proposed methodology was verified not only in terms of comparison between measured and downscaled local daily air temperatures but also in terms of capability to capture the spatial distribution patterns the suitability of the proposed methodology was also verified against two simplified evapotranspiration models turc 1961 hargreaves 1975 the method is based on a simple lapse rate adjustment coefficient kt that can be computed using a cosine function of julian day combined with three parameters a b and c which depend on ground elevation the proposed approach allows i to estimate local air temperatures from gridded power nasa data ii to fill gaps in air temperature time series when weather information are limited or discontinuous iii to derive spatial distribution patterns of daily air temperature in regions where the number of available weather stations is limited as a final check two simplified evapotranspiration models turc 1961 and hargreaves 1975 were used to assess the suitability of the proposed downscaling methodology downscaled air temperatures were input into the two models and resulting et0 estimates were compared with estimates obtained with the fao 56 pm equation and sias measurements resultant rmse values ranging from 0 44 and 1 08 mm average of 0 72 0 74 mm and average mbe values of 0 06 turc equation and 0 13 mm hargreaves equation confirm the validity of the proposed procedure for practical applications such as the estimation of reference et0 acknowledgments web

11349,agricultural water management particularly management of multi purpose small reservoirs srs in drier savanna areas of the northern ghana is being promoted as a key solution to improve agricultural production enhance food security and livelihoods of smallholder farm households however little empirical evidence exist on how effective these small water infrastructures are in terms of delivering multiple benefits and their impact on the livelihood of smallholder farmers this study assessed the effectiveness and impact of the small reservoirs on smallholder vegetable farmers in northern ghana a participatory rating method using a 5 point likert scale was used to assess the effectiveness of srs in delivering multiple livelihood benefits and an endogenous switching regression model was applied to assess the srs impact using a primary data collected from 328 randomly sampled vegetable farmers results from the likert scale analysis show that most of the srs are either dysfunctional or underutilized and not effective in delivering multiple benefits results from the endogenous switching regression model show that there is only about 3 increase in the income of vegetable farmers participating in irrigated vegetable production using srs against the counterfactual situation but this change is insignificant statistically the current low level effectiveness and impact of srs could be enhanced by improving their management for example through the provision of incentive mechanisms such as subsidies to the private sector involvement in rehabilitation management and irrigation service provision and strengthening the capacity of existing water users associations furthermore small reserviors should be recognized not only as water sources for small scale irrigation but also as providers of multiple livelihood benefits to local communities and consequently should attract due attention in public resource allocation in their rehabilitation and management institutional capacity building keywords effectiveness multiple benefits smallholder irrigators small reservoirs vegetable production 1 introduction rain fed agriculture is the dominant form of agricultural production in northern ghana 1 1 northern ghana comprises of the three administrative regions in the north of the country i e northern upper east and upper west regions its productivity is severely curtailed by the uni modal rainfall pattern food grown during the rainy season is often insufficient to meet year round household food needs with some households frequently experiencing severe food insecurity for about four to five months annually timler et al 2014 on the other hand studies show that high potential exists for irrigated agriculture in northern ghana northern ghana is drained by the volta river system consisting of the white volta black volta oti and darka rivers ghana s total renewable water resources are estimated to be about 53 2 km3 year groundwater is estimated at 26 3 km3 year fao 2016 in the volta basin water for irrigation is sourced from rivers groundwater and stored water in natural and built infrastructure or reservoirs johnston and mccartney 2010 payen et al 2012 there are 22 medium and large public irrigation schemes in ghana covering about 14 700 ha irrigable area of which only about 9000 ha is actually under irrigation five out of the 22 schemes tono vea golinga bontanga and libga with storage capacities ranging from 5 9 to 93 mm3 are located in northern ghana additionally there are more than 500 small reservoirs and over 6280 boreholes managed by communities and smallholder farmers liebe et al 2005 johnston and mccartney 2010 water is also stored on farm in ponds and wetlands mccartney et al 2013 shallow wells are widely used for small scale irrigation ssi in several communities in northern ghana molden 2007 namara et al 2011 payen et al 2012 small reservoirs and dugouts are also in high demand because they support multiple livelihood benefits including irrigation livestock production fisheries and brick fabrication van de giesen et al 2002 birner 2008 namara 2010 however there is seasonality in the availability of some of these water resources because of the variability of the annual rainfall and climatic condition in northern ghana excess rainfall and runoff that is available during the wet season is underutilized while there is acute water shortage for agricultural use during the dry season thus agricultural water management awm interventions are progressively being suggested and promoted as a first step to enable positive development alleviating food insecurity and poverty among the smallholder farm households that dominate the agriculture sector in ghana mikhail et al 2011 awm is generally perceived as a key step towards improving low yielding smallholder farming systems in sub sahara africa barron et al 2008 particularly small scale irrigation using small water infrastructures uch as small reservoirs 2 2 small reservoirs are artificially created aquatic ecosystem the world commission on dams defines small reservoirs as a structure that has a height less than 15 meters and a storage capacity that ranges from fifty thousand to 1 million m3 however defining small reservoirs by volume height and irrigated area type of infrastructure or mode of management is site and situation specific and is often not easily comparable for example most reservoirs in burkina faso are large but very shallow with seasonal variations so storage capacity is not taken into account in the same way as for reservoirs in other locations there are more than 500 small reservoirs with irrigation potential in northern ghana and shallow wells for water storage and appropriate irrigation technologies are important complements to increase agricultural production and enhance the livelihoods of smallholder farmers northern ghana is endowed with a number of multi purpose small reservoirs srs many of the existing srs were established since the independence of ghana 1960 s by various donor agencies and the government of ghana to provide water for irrigation to promote dry season farming among smallholders good water storage infrastructure combined with ssi technologies can allow farmers to practice dry season farming and supplementary irrigation during dry spells in the rainy season thereby avoiding crop failure and allowing higher yields compared with sole reliance on rainfall evans et al 2012 fao 2012 balana et al 2016 found that dry season irrigation as the major benefit derived from small reservoirs small reservoirs over the last three decades have been increasingly seen as a way to develop small scale irrigation venot and krishnan 2011 besides their use for irrigation srs also provide multiple livelihood benefits such as livestock watering construction fishing and domestic uses small reservoirs are typically owned and managed communally through water users associations wuas though in some cases individuals own and manage the reservoirs namara et al 2011 namara et al 2014 however the multiple benefits communities derive from the srs in recent times are said to be declining posing negative consequences on the livelihoods of the smallholder farmers the northern rural growth programme nrgp 3 3 details of nrgp activities can be seen here http

invested in rehabilitation of small reservoirs for water storage and irrigation through gravity based water flow to improve agricultural production and provide other multiple livelihoods benefits to farmers however little is known about the effectiveness and livelihood impacts of small reservoirs in northern ghana to the best of our knowledge two key knowledge gaps exist with regard to our understanding of the srs in northern ghana 1 how effective these water bodies are in terms of delivering multiple livelihood benefits and 2 how important the srs are to the livelihoods of smallholders farmers in the area using primary data collected from randomly smapled smallholder farmers located around selected multi purpose small reservoirs in the upper east region of ghana and applying a five point likert scale analysis and the endogenous switching regression model this paper assessed the effectiveness of srs in delivery of multiple benefits and their impacts on the livelihoods of smallholder vegetable farmers in upper east region of ghana 2 methodological approach 2 1 the study area the upper east region is located in the north eastern corner of ghana between longitude 00 and 10 west and latitudes 10 30 n and 11 n the land is relatively flat with a few hills to the east and southeast the total land area is about 8842 km2 which translates into 2 7 of the total land area of the country initial field visits for site selection and characterization was conducted in upper east region to help identify the srs and understand their delivery of multiple livelihood benefits to the various communities in the region based on the information gathered during the field work the study was conducted in purposively selected communities in four districts in upper east region fig 1 a b and table 1 the selection of communities was based on the availability of multi purpose small water bodies reservoirs the field studies also helped to identify and establish key local contacts local government units and farmers to facilitate the actual fieldwork based on information gathered during the site selection and field characterization reconnaissance surveys were conducted to help gather information for the preparation of final field instruments the reconnaissance survey helped us in the identification and listing of various stakeholders particularly water users associations wuas farmers groups using srs for crop production and other uses such as domestic and livestock drinking and local and government institutions facilitating the management of the srs wuas are being actively promoted in the northern regions of ghana table 2 shows the distribution of active farmer groups in irrigated agriculture in the three northern regions of ghana as a result of rehabilitation of several small reservoirs and dugouts since 2007 by various agencies e g ghana social opportunities project gsop which rehabilitated 56 northern rural growth programme nrgp which rehabilitated 42 and the world food programme wfp which rehabilitated 12 dormant wuas have been revived mofa 2014 crops produced under rain fed are mostly grains such as maize rice millet sorghum groundnut and soybean whereas irrigated crops are mainly vegetables including tomato onion pepper okra and leafy vegetables competition to land for irrigated and rain fed crops is minimal farmers use the irrigable areas to cultivate cereals in the rainy season rain fed and vegetables in the dry season irrigated in some areas in the region e g kamega and binaba communities the irrigable area is used solely for rice production during the rainy season this enables them to do supplementary irrigation of rice during periods of dry spells land preparation for dry season production starts immediately after harvesting the wet season crops to take advantage of residual soil moisture 2 2 sampling and data collection based on the list of farmers provided during the reconnaissance surveys 5 5 this includes visits to study sites interviews with key informants consultation with agricultural extension workers discussion with community leaders and committee members of wuas to familiarize with study area and population multiple water uses reservoir management and irrigated crops a simple random sampling technique was used to select 328 smallholder vegetable farmers comprising of 159 irrigators using water from srs and 169 non irrigators from the study communities focus group discussions and interaction with key local farmers community leaders executive committee members of wuas as well as extension officers were conducted to gather contextual data a total of 15 focus group discussions fgds each comprising of 8 12 participants men group women groups and mixed men and women groups were held to understand community views on the uses access rules and management challenges of small reservoirs in the area this also helped to develop quantitative survey questionnaire face to face survey of the sample households were administered by well trained enumerators recruited from the local area and who have previous field work experience and conversant of the local language 2 3 empirical analysis this study applies a five point likert scale analysis to assess the effectiveness of srs in delivering multiple livelihood benefits to local communities and endogenous switching regression model to assess the impact of the srs on farmers income in the study area as highlighted in the previous section srs were established to provide multiple livelihood benefits to local communities such as irrigation water for livestock and domestic use in order to assess how effective the srs were in terms of delivering the expected multiple benefits a participatory ranking approach was implemented using the 5 point likert scale 1 not effective 2 slightly effective 3 moderately effective 4 very effective 5 extremely effective evaluated with the selected community members in all study communities as the small reservoirs investigated in this study are owned by the community and reservoirs water is generally accessible to individual farmers this was confirmed by community members during fgds for the purpose this study we assumed that an individual farmer who is a member of the community can have an option to practice irrigated vegetable production using water from a small reservoir or opt for a non irrigated practice a farmer s decision to engage in irrigated vegetable production can be conceptualized as a two step decision firstly a decision to grow vegetable crops and secondly to irrigate his her vegetables a number of factors such as farmer characteristics access to land and or credit and livestock ownership may affect the decisions and could lead to endogeneity and self selection problems if this is not accounted for it may not depict the estimation of the true impact of small reservoirs the endogenous switching regression therefore helps to jointly take into account the decision to engage in vegetables farming and irrigate the vegetables in a single framework again it allows the implementation of counterfactual experiments in estimating what the impact of srs could have been had non irrigators participated in the technology or if participants had not participated in the technology more precisely vegetable farmers are assumed to make a decision whether to undertake irrigated production using water from the sr or non irrigated practice this decision is assumed to be based on the expected total net income from vegetable production thus a farmer will only produce irrigated vegetables if the benefit of doing so is greater than that of the non irrigated vegetable production practice to derive the empirical model let the expected outcome of a vegetable farmer i for irrigated vegetables small reservoir as a water source be t s w i p and non irrigators rain fed vegetable grower t s w i n vegetable farmers are assumed to engage in irrigated production only if t s w i p t s w i n however both t s w i p and t s w i n are not observable while whether a vegetable farmer engage in irrigated production or not is observable the first step equation selection equation is estimated using the probit regression model as follows 1 t i j z i α η i j s w i p s w i n t 1 i f t i s w i p t i s w i n t 0 o t h e r w i s e tij is a latent variable that captures the expected outcome from a decision to grow irrigated vegetables by the farmer i vector z i represents the variables that affect irrigation decisions including socio economic and farming characteristics for the farmer i α is a vector of parameters to be estimated and η i is the error term with zero mean and variance σ η 2 the determinants of vegetable income depending on whether the framer chooses to practice irrigated production or not is evaluated in the second step two regime equations are estimated in the second step as specified below eqs 2 and 3 regime equation for irrigators using srs as a water source 2 y i s w i n x i n β s w i n ε i n regime equation for non irrigators 3 y i s w i p x i p β s w i p ε i p where y i s w i n and y i s w i p are the net total vegetable incomes for an irrigator and non irrigator x i n and x i p are sets of explanatory variables for eqs 2 and 3 β s w i n and β s w i p are the parameters to be estimated ε i n and ε i p are error terms with variances σ n 2 and σ p 2 respectively z i must have at least one more variable that is included in the eqs 2 and 3 thus engagement in other off farm business is used as additional instrumental variable in z i the unobservable characteristics of farmers that determine the decision to grow irrigated or non irrigated vegetables also affect the vegetable income of the famer in each regime therefore the full information maximum likelihood fiml estimation was used to simultaneously measure selection and regime equations using the endogenous switching regression model which takes into account sample self selection problems both the selection and impact equations were estimated jointly using the full information maximum likelihood estimation approach lokshin and sajaia 2004 upon the estimates of β s w i n and β s w i p both the conditional and unconditional expectations of vegetable incomes for both irrigators and non irrigators were calculated the vegetable incomes in counterfactual situations cannot be observed in this type of study thus their counterfactual value is estimated through β s w i n and β s w i p considering irrigators using srs as a treatment group we need to differentiate the actual vegetable income observed and its counterfactual for irrigators in order to calculate the average treatment effect on treated hereafter att this was done following the approach by di falco and veronesi 2013 where the att is calculated as in the eqs 4 6 expected vegetable income of an irrigator observed using the sr as water source is 4 e y i s w i p i 1 x i p β s w

ratio using eqs 4 and 5 yields att as follows 6 a t t e y i s w i p i 1 e y i s w i n i 1 3 insights from focus group discussions according to the community land in the irrigated areas around small reservoirs was allocated based on a number of criteria those whose land the small reservoirs were constructed were the first ones to get plots of land those who provided labour during the construction of the reservoirs were then accorded second priority the third category comprised those who wish to be irrigators and who were accommodated when a vacant plot becomes available overall there exists established criteria for access to land and it is generally fair however gender is still a major issue in land allocation in the study area as land is generally inherited through the male line patriarchy according to some community members a young male child might even own land ahead of an adult female pers comm a woman in binaba community water user associations wuas were important for irrigation management in the communities surveyed the rules governing wuas were largely developed during the establishment of the irrigation schemes from discussions in all communities where fgds were conducted all wuas are recognized by the district assemblies and are regulated as farmer based organizations fbos under the department of cooperatives which provides registration certificates committee membership of the wuas is male dominated in many communities gender balancing in access decision making and participation needs to be enhanced in order to improve the performance of the wuas in all the communities surveyed members claimed that the wuas were effectively implementing their byelaws and water is equitably allocated despite these claims however there were instances in various communities such as kamega binaba and winkogo where the downstream farmers did not harvest crops due to lack of water for the tail end farmers a levy is charged per plot holder ranging from 1 to 10 ghana cedi per season the amounts collected were said to be important for minor maintenance work through the wuas the farmers are mobilized to provide labour for canal repairs or boundary fence repairs in some cases those who could not provide labour without a reasonable excuse are fined and the cash receipt goes into the wua fund however the amount collected through water levy and fines are so little that it cannot cover major rehabilitation and maintenance works that was the main reason for the interventions of gsop nrgp and others programmes and ngos 4 results and discussions 4 1 socioeconomic characteristics of respondents results related to the socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents are presented in table 3 majority of the respondents were men 68 this may be due to the rigorous nature of farming thereby serving as deterrent for most females balana 2016 reported a similar finding in relation to gender and irrigated farming in northern ghana he looked at small reservoirs with built in canal infrastructure and those without canals though small reservoirs are more accessible for women farmers compared to large scale irrigation schemes yet small reservoirs without canals require heavy labour to lift water and limits women s engagement in irrigated production about 55 of the respondents were within the age category of 20 40 years and about half 49 had no formal education indicating a low level of education among the respondents most of them were married 85 with household size ranging from 5 to 10 persons a typical smallholder vegetable farmer has been cultivating vegetables for about 2 years more than half 51 5 of the smallholder vegetable farmers sampled for the study were not members to any water user associations wua who might have opted not to practice irrigated production farming was found to be the major occupation of the respondents and they cultivated an average of 2 5 acres per farmer majority of the smallholder vegetable farmers operate on land owned by the family or access land through the local chiefs who acts as the custodian of community land table 4 presents the types of vegetable cultivated by the respondents although smallholder vegetable farmers cultivate a range of crops the most cultivated vegetables were pepper 68 3 followed by tomato 58 2 okra 45 7 and onion 33 8 a few however cultivated eggplant 8 2 and cabbage 2 7 it can therefore be inferred that pepper tomato okra and onion are mostly cultivated by smallholder vegetable farmers in the upper east region the use of the srs for vegetable production serves an important example of the provisioning ecosystem services greenfacts 2001 4 2 benefits and effectiveness of srs the study found that the majority more than 70 of the respondents particularly members of the wuas derive multiple livelihood benefits provided by the srs particularly water for irrigation livestock drinking domestic use and for construction table 5 in all the communities dry season irrigation livestock watering and fishing aquaculture were identified as the major livelihood benefits derived from the srs many of the focus groups also identified additional issues and distinct perspectives on the livelihood benefits such as availability of water for domestic use and for building and plastering houses some focus groups esp male participants identified additional benefits such as swimming bathing and the presence of green vegetation around the reservoir which serve as feed for livestock in the dry season with regard to assessing the extent to which the srs provide the various benefits identified by the community i e to assess the performance of the small reservoirs against the delivery of the key benefits identified more than 90 of the study communities stated the supply of water by the srs for livestock watering as very effective kajelo was the only community which rated the availability of the reservoir for livestock watering below the very effective scale because in kjelo the reservoir dries up in years of inadequate rainfall and siltation due to poor maintenance the capacity of the srs to support fishing aquaculture received low rating in all communities except the male group in binaba and the mixed group in pusu namongo where it was rated as very good in pusu namongo a project called results 6 6 resilient and sustainable livelihoods transformation result project funded by canadian feed the children cftc and implemented in northern ghana it is a 6 year 2012 2018 19 million project that is being implemented by cftc in partnership with the association of church based development projects acdep http acdep org site index php programmes projects agriculture result project new funded by the canadian government restocked the reservoir in early 2015 with fingerlings and provided feed to the farmers the harvest was good and this encouraged the farmers to actively participate in the aquaculture project in binaba though the reservoir has not been restocked since its construction communities believe they get enough fish at least for home consumption the capacity of the reservoir to provide water for domestic use also received high ratings in many communities though the main purpose of the small reservoirs is to provide water for livestock and dry season crop production the performance ratings provided by the various study communities were not very encouraging this is mainly due to the siltation of the reservoirs reducing its capacity to store enough water for irrigation and fragmentation of land due to population growth the detailed ratings of the key benefits from srs are indicated in table 6 4 3 impacts of srs on income of smallholder vegetable farmers table 7 presents the differences in farm and household characteristics of irrigators using srs and non irrigators with their respective t values to test for significance of differences the t values suggest that some significant differences exist between smallholder vegetable farmers who use srs to irrigate their vegetables and those who do not the results show that farmers engagement in other businesses has a significant effect on their decision to practice irrigated vegetable production or not farmers who engaged in other businesses were found to be less likely to undertake dry season irrigated farming table 8 presents results from the estimated endogenous switching regression model presented in the second column of table 8 are the estimates from the selection models which explain the determinants of the likelihood of the vegetable farmer participating in irrigated farming the likelihood ratio test statistic for joint independence show that the equations are dependent also the chi square statistic indicates over identification in the regression specifications of income is significantly different from zero at 1 level therefore the null hypothesis of the influence of the instruments credit access off farm activity participation and fbo variables on participation in irrigated practices is rejected the ρ p a 1 484 implies self selection into irrigated farming by the vegetable farmers in the study area this also implies that participation in irrigation may impact differently on non irrigators should they decide to practice irrigated production the positive sign of the covariance term ρ p a also suggests the existence of negative selection bias and that vegetable farmers whose income are below average are more likely to undertake irrigated production it is worth noting that off farm work participation and extension visits were considered as possible endogenous variables the results indicate that the residual of the potential endogenous variable off farmresid was statistically significant at 1 level in the irrigator s outcome specification implying that accounting for possible endogeneity of this variable for users of small water infrastructure for irrigation is inappropriate in the study area similarly the residual of the potential endogenous variable extensionresid was statistically significant at 1 level in the non irrigators outcome specification suggesting that accounting for possible endogeneity of this variable for non participants of small water infrastructure is inappropriate in the study area the coefficient of the extension variable is positive and statistically significant at 1 level suggesting that vegetable farmers who have access to extension services are more likely to undertake irrigated farming the findings which concur with that of abdulai and huffman 2014 in northern ghana is not surprising considering the relevance of agricultural extension in providing vital information on efficient and sustainable agricultural technologies in developing countries it was found that the decision of a farmer to participate in irrigated vegetable production using water from small reservoirs is highly dependent on one s perception about small reservoirs this is shown by the highly significant and positive estimate for the perception variable perception srs by creating positive and correct mental attitude regarding the importance of the srs in providing multiple benefits to farmers and the community as a whole smallholder farmers could be encouraged to explore the benefits through irrigated vegetables and involve in management of srs the results in the last two columns of table 8 show that farmer s age contributes significantly to higher income from vegetable production among irrigators gender variable was found to be significantly different from zero for both irrigators and non irrigators this suggests that the income effects for vegetable farmers is more for men as compared to women education was found to have a positive impact on the income of both irrigators and non irrigators this implies that education contribute significantly to welfare in terms of income of vegetable farmers household size was found to have a significantly positive impact on the income of non irrigator vegetable farmers in the study area extension access had positive impact on the income of irrigators farmers perception was found to have a significantly positive impact on the income of irrigated vegetable farmers this implies that the attitude of vegetable farmers about small water infrastructure indirectly enhances their chances of gaining more income furthermore the ownership of other business besides vegetable farming also was found to contribute significantly to the income of both participating and non participating vegetable farmers 4 4 counterfactual analysis and treatment effects the results of the average treatment effect on the treated att from the endogenous switching regression esr estimation showed a positive but insignificant impact irrigators on vegetable farmers income table 9 the causal effects of participating in irrigation using small water infrastructure was found to be gh 41 63 per hectare suggesting that use of srs for irrigation by farmers results in about 3 13 increase in income of vegetable farmers irrigator farmers using srs on average obtain a net income of gh 1370 ha relative to gh 1328 ha for non irrigators the results from the propensity score matching psm technique showed that use of srs for irrigated vegetable production exerts positive but statistically insignificant impact on vegetable income specifically using small water infrastructure for irrigated vegetable production insignificantly increase vegetable income by ca 29 from the nearest neighbour matching algorithm ca 26 from the kernel based matching and ca 3 from the radius matching table 10 5 conclusion and recommendations the study has established that in addition to enhanced agricultural productivity the srs in the study area provide multiple livelihood benefits such as for livestock drinking fishing construction building recreation and other domestic use effectiveness of the srs in terms of delivery of the intended multiple benefits is not encouraging in general most of the srs are functioning below the potential capacity which may be explained by poor management and maintenance of the water storage infrastructure prioritization of various benefit items from the srs by the community members reveal that small scale irrigation and livestock watering are the most important livelihood benefits community members derive from the srs the counterfactual analysis shows that there is about 3 increase in the income of irrigated vegetable farmers using water from srs but the increase is not statistically significant this may be attributed to the underperformance of the srs due to siltation and inadequate water for irrigation though the present results show that the impact on household income of irrigated vegetable production using srs appears to be below the usually claimed high impact in northern ghana the impacts of srs can be enhanced by improving their management through for example the provision of incentive mechanisms such as subsidies to the private sector involvement in rehabilitation management and irrigation service providers strengthening the capacity of existing water users associations for effective and efficient management of reservoirs and recognizing the multiple benefits and the wider socio economic values of small

11349,agricultural water management particularly management of multi purpose small reservoirs srs in drier savanna areas of the northern ghana is being promoted as a key solution to improve agricultural production enhance food security and livelihoods of smallholder farm households however little empirical evidence exist on how effective these small water infrastructures are in terms of delivering multiple benefits and their impact on the livelihood of smallholder farmers this study assessed the effectiveness and impact of the small reservoirs on smallholder vegetable farmers in northern ghana a participatory rating method using a 5 point likert scale was used to assess the effectiveness of srs in delivering multiple livelihood benefits and an endogenous switching regression model was applied to assess the srs impact using a primary data collected from 328 randomly sampled vegetable farmers results from the likert scale analysis show that most of the srs are either dysfunctional or underutilized and not effective in delivering multiple benefits results from the endogenous switching regression model show that there is only about 3 increase in the income of vegetable farmers participating in irrigated vegetable production using srs against the counterfactual situation but this change is insignificant statistically the current low level effectiveness and impact of srs could be enhanced by improving their management for example through the provision of incentive mechanisms such as subsidies to the private sector involvement in rehabilitation management and irrigation service provision and strengthening the capacity of existing water users associations furthermore small reserviors should be recognized not only as water sources for small scale irrigation but also as providers of multiple livelihood benefits to local communities and consequently should attract due attention in public resource allocation in their rehabilitation and management institutional capacity building keywords effectiveness multiple benefits smallholder irrigators small reservoirs vegetable production 1 introduction rain fed agriculture is the dominant form of agricultural production in northern ghana 1 1 northern ghana comprises of the three administrative regions in the north of the country i e northern upper east and upper west regions its productivity is severely curtailed by the uni modal rainfall pattern food grown during the rainy season is often insufficient to meet year round household food needs with some households frequently experiencing severe food insecurity for about four to five months annually timler et al 2014 on the other hand studies show that high potential exists for irrigated agriculture in northern ghana northern ghana is drained by the volta river system consisting of the white volta black volta oti and darka rivers ghana s total renewable water resources are estimated to be about 53 2 km3 year groundwater is estimated at 26 3 km3 year fao 2016 in the volta basin water for irrigation is sourced from rivers groundwater and stored water in natural and built infrastructure or reservoirs johnston and mccartney 2010 payen et al 2012 there are 22 medium and large public irrigation schemes in ghana covering about 14 700 ha irrigable area of which only about 9000 ha is actually under irrigation five out of the 22 schemes tono vea golinga bontanga and libga with storage capacities ranging from 5 9 to 93 mm3 are located in northern ghana additionally there are more than 500 small reservoirs and over 6280 boreholes managed by communities and smallholder farmers liebe et al 2005 johnston and mccartney 2010 water is also stored on farm in ponds and wetlands mccartney et al 2013 shallow wells are widely used for small scale irrigation ssi in several communities in northern ghana molden 2007 namara et al 2011 payen et al 2012 small reservoirs and dugouts are also in high demand because they support multiple livelihood benefits including irrigation livestock production fisheries and brick fabrication van de giesen et al 2002 birner 2008 namara 2010 however there is seasonality in the availability of some of these water resources because of the variability of the annual rainfall and climatic condition in northern ghana excess rainfall and runoff that is available during the wet season is underutilized while there is acute water shortage for agricultural use during the dry season thus agricultural water management awm interventions are progressively being suggested and promoted as a first step to enable positive development alleviating food insecurity and poverty among the smallholder farm households that dominate the agriculture sector in ghana mikhail et al 2011 awm is generally perceived as a key step towards improving low yielding smallholder farming systems in sub sahara africa barron et al 2008 particularly small scale irrigation using small water infrastructures uch as small reservoirs 2 2 small reservoirs are artificially created aquatic ecosystem the world commission on dams defines small reservoirs as a structure that has a height less than 15 meters and a storage capacity that ranges from fifty thousand to 1 million m3 however defining small reservoirs by volume height and irrigated area type of infrastructure or mode of management is site and situation specific and is often not easily comparable for example most reservoirs in burkina faso are large but very shallow with seasonal variations so storage capacity is not taken into account in the same way as for reservoirs in other locations there are more than 500 small reservoirs with irrigation potential in northern ghana and shallow wells for water storage and appropriate irrigation technologies are important complements to increase agricultural production and enhance the livelihoods of smallholder farmers northern ghana is endowed with a number of multi purpose small reservoirs srs many of the existing srs were established since the independence of ghana 1960 s by various donor agencies and the government of ghana to provide water for irrigation to promote dry season farming among smallholders good water storage infrastructure combined with ssi technologies can allow farmers to practice dry season farming and supplementary irrigation during dry spells in the rainy season thereby avoiding crop failure and allowing higher yields compared with sole reliance on rainfall evans et al 2012 fao 2012 balana et al 2016 found that dry season irrigation as the major benefit derived from small reservoirs small reservoirs over the last three decades have been increasingly seen as a way to develop small scale irrigation venot and krishnan 2011 besides their use for irrigation srs also provide multiple livelihood benefits such as livestock watering construction fishing and domestic uses small reservoirs are typically owned and managed communally through water users associations wuas though in some cases individuals own and manage the reservoirs namara et al 2011 namara et al 2014 however the multiple benefits communities derive from the srs in recent times are said to be declining posing negative consequences on the livelihoods of the smallholder farmers the northern rural growth programme nrgp 3 3 details of nrgp activities can be seen here http

invested in rehabilitation of small reservoirs for water storage and irrigation through gravity based water flow to improve agricultural production and provide other multiple livelihoods benefits to farmers however little is known about the effectiveness and livelihood impacts of small reservoirs in northern ghana to the best of our knowledge two key knowledge gaps exist with regard to our understanding of the srs in northern ghana 1 how effective these water bodies are in terms of delivering multiple livelihood benefits and 2 how important the srs are to the livelihoods of smallholders farmers in the area using primary data collected from randomly smapled smallholder farmers located around selected multi purpose small reservoirs in the upper east region of ghana and applying a five point likert scale analysis and the endogenous switching regression model this paper assessed the effectiveness of srs in delivery of multiple benefits and their impacts on the livelihoods of smallholder vegetable farmers in upper east region of ghana 2 methodological approach 2 1 the study area the upper east region is located in the north eastern corner of ghana between longitude 00 and 10 west and latitudes 10 30 n and 11 n the land is relatively flat with a few hills to the east and southeast the total land area is about 8842 km2 which translates into 2 7 of the total land area of the country initial field visits for site selection and characterization was conducted in upper east region to help identify the srs and understand their delivery of multiple livelihood benefits to the various communities in the region based on the information gathered during the field work the study was conducted in purposively selected communities in four districts in upper east region fig 1 a b and table 1 the selection of communities was based on the availability of multi purpose small water bodies reservoirs the field studies also helped to identify and establish key local contacts local government units and farmers to facilitate the actual fieldwork based on information gathered during the site selection and field characterization reconnaissance surveys were conducted to help gather information for the preparation of final field instruments the reconnaissance survey helped us in the identification and listing of various stakeholders particularly water users associations wuas farmers groups using srs for crop production and other uses such as domestic and livestock drinking and local and government institutions facilitating the management of the srs wuas are being actively promoted in the northern regions of ghana table 2 shows the distribution of active farmer groups in irrigated agriculture in the three northern regions of ghana as a result of rehabilitation of several small reservoirs and dugouts since 2007 by various agencies e g ghana social opportunities project gsop which rehabilitated 56 northern rural growth programme nrgp which rehabilitated 42 and the world food programme wfp which rehabilitated 12 dormant wuas have been revived mofa 2014 crops produced under rain fed are mostly grains such as maize rice millet sorghum groundnut and soybean whereas irrigated crops are mainly vegetables including tomato onion pepper okra and leafy vegetables competition to land for irrigated and rain fed crops is minimal farmers use the irrigable areas to cultivate cereals in the rainy season rain fed and vegetables in the dry season irrigated in some areas in the region e g kamega and binaba communities the irrigable area is used solely for rice production during the rainy season this enables them to do supplementary irrigation of rice during periods of dry spells land preparation for dry season production starts immediately after harvesting the wet season crops to take advantage of residual soil moisture 2 2 sampling and data collection based on the list of farmers provided during the reconnaissance surveys 5 5 this includes visits to study sites interviews with key informants consultation with agricultural extension workers discussion with community leaders and committee members of wuas to familiarize with study area and population multiple water uses reservoir management and irrigated crops a simple random sampling technique was used to select 328 smallholder vegetable farmers comprising of 159 irrigators using water from srs and 169 non irrigators from the study communities focus group discussions and interaction with key local farmers community leaders executive committee members of wuas as well as extension officers were conducted to gather contextual data a total of 15 focus group discussions fgds each comprising of 8 12 participants men group women groups and mixed men and women groups were held to understand community views on the uses access rules and management challenges of small reservoirs in the area this also helped to develop quantitative survey questionnaire face to face survey of the sample households were administered by well trained enumerators recruited from the local area and who have previous field work experience and conversant of the local language 2 3 empirical analysis this study applies a five point likert scale analysis to assess the effectiveness of srs in delivering multiple livelihood benefits to local communities and endogenous switching regression model to assess the impact of the srs on farmers income in the study area as highlighted in the previous section srs were established to provide multiple livelihood benefits to local communities such as irrigation water for livestock and domestic use in order to assess how effective the srs were in terms of delivering the expected multiple benefits a participatory ranking approach was implemented using the 5 point likert scale 1 not effective 2 slightly effective 3 moderately effective 4 very effective 5 extremely effective evaluated with the selected community members in all study communities as the small reservoirs investigated in this study are owned by the community and reservoirs water is generally accessible to individual farmers this was confirmed by community members during fgds for the purpose this study we assumed that an individual farmer who is a member of the community can have an option to practice irrigated vegetable production using water from a small reservoir or opt for a non irrigated practice a farmer s decision to engage in irrigated vegetable production can be conceptualized as a two step decision firstly a decision to grow vegetable crops and secondly to irrigate his her vegetables a number of factors such as farmer characteristics access to land and or credit and livestock ownership may affect the decisions and could lead to endogeneity and self selection problems if this is not accounted for it may not depict the estimation of the true impact of small reservoirs the endogenous switching regression therefore helps to jointly take into account the decision to engage in vegetables farming and irrigate the vegetables in a single framework again it allows the implementation of counterfactual experiments in estimating what the impact of srs could have been had non irrigators participated in the technology or if participants had not participated in the technology more precisely vegetable farmers are assumed to make a decision whether to undertake irrigated production using water from the sr or non irrigated practice this decision is assumed to be based on the expected total net income from vegetable production thus a farmer will only produce irrigated vegetables if the benefit of doing so is greater than that of the non irrigated vegetable production practice to derive the empirical model let the expected outcome of a vegetable farmer i for irrigated vegetables small reservoir as a water source be t s w i p and non irrigators rain fed vegetable grower t s w i n vegetable farmers are assumed to engage in irrigated production only if t s w i p t s w i n however both t s w i p and t s w i n are not observable while whether a vegetable farmer engage in irrigated production or not is observable the first step equation selection equation is estimated using the probit regression model as follows 1 t i j z i α η i j s w i p s w i n t 1 i f t i s w i p t i s w i n t 0 o t h e r w i s e tij is a latent variable that captures the expected outcome from a decision to grow irrigated vegetables by the farmer i vector z i represents the variables that affect irrigation decisions including socio economic and farming characteristics for the farmer i α is a vector of parameters to be estimated and η i is the error term with zero mean and variance σ η 2 the determinants of vegetable income depending on whether the framer chooses to practice irrigated production or not is evaluated in the second step two regime equations are estimated in the second step as specified below eqs 2 and 3 regime equation for irrigators using srs as a water source 2 y i s w i n x i n β s w i n ε i n regime equation for non irrigators 3 y i s w i p x i p β s w i p ε i p where y i s w i n and y i s w i p are the net total vegetable incomes for an irrigator and non irrigator x i n and x i p are sets of explanatory variables for eqs 2 and 3 β s w i n and β s w i p are the parameters to be estimated ε i n and ε i p are error terms with variances σ n 2 and σ p 2 respectively z i must have at least one more variable that is included in the eqs 2 and 3 thus engagement in other off farm business is used as additional instrumental variable in z i the unobservable characteristics of farmers that determine the decision to grow irrigated or non irrigated vegetables also affect the vegetable income of the famer in each regime therefore the full information maximum likelihood fiml estimation was used to simultaneously measure selection and regime equations using the endogenous switching regression model which takes into account sample self selection problems both the selection and impact equations were estimated jointly using the full information maximum likelihood estimation approach lokshin and sajaia 2004 upon the estimates of β s w i n and β s w i p both the conditional and unconditional expectations of vegetable incomes for both irrigators and non irrigators were calculated the vegetable incomes in counterfactual situations cannot be observed in this type of study thus their counterfactual value is estimated through β s w i n and β s w i p considering irrigators using srs as a treatment group we need to differentiate the actual vegetable income observed and its counterfactual for irrigators in order to calculate the average treatment effect on treated hereafter att this was done following the approach by di falco and veronesi 2013 where the att is calculated as in the eqs 4 6 expected vegetable income of an irrigator observed using the sr as water source is 4 e y i s w i p i 1 x i p β s w

ratio using eqs 4 and 5 yields att as follows 6 a t t e y i s w i p i 1 e y i s w i n i 1 3 insights from focus group discussions according to the community land in the irrigated areas around small reservoirs was allocated based on a number of criteria those whose land the small reservoirs were constructed were the first ones to get plots of land those who provided labour during the construction of the reservoirs were then accorded second priority the third category comprised those who wish to be irrigators and who were accommodated when a vacant plot becomes available overall there exists established criteria for access to land and it is generally fair however gender is still a major issue in land allocation in the study area as land is generally inherited through the male line patriarchy according to some community members a young male child might even own land ahead of an adult female pers comm a woman in binaba community water user associations wuas were important for irrigation management in the communities surveyed the rules governing wuas were largely developed during the establishment of the irrigation schemes from discussions in all communities where fgds were conducted all wuas are recognized by the district assemblies and are regulated as farmer based organizations fbos under the department of cooperatives which provides registration certificates committee membership of the wuas is male dominated in many communities gender balancing in access decision making and participation needs to be enhanced in order to improve the performance of the wuas in all the communities surveyed members claimed that the wuas were effectively implementing their byelaws and water is equitably allocated despite these claims however there were instances in various communities such as kamega binaba and winkogo where the downstream farmers did not harvest crops due to lack of water for the tail end farmers a levy is charged per plot holder ranging from 1 to 10 ghana cedi per season the amounts collected were said to be important for minor maintenance work through the wuas the farmers are mobilized to provide labour for canal repairs or boundary fence repairs in some cases those who could not provide labour without a reasonable excuse are fined and the cash receipt goes into the wua fund however the amount collected through water levy and fines are so little that it cannot cover major rehabilitation and maintenance works that was the main reason for the interventions of gsop nrgp and others programmes and ngos 4 results and discussions 4 1 socioeconomic characteristics of respondents results related to the socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents are presented in table 3 majority of the respondents were men 68 this may be due to the rigorous nature of farming thereby serving as deterrent for most females balana 2016 reported a similar finding in relation to gender and irrigated farming in northern ghana he looked at small reservoirs with built in canal infrastructure and those without canals though small reservoirs are more accessible for women farmers compared to large scale irrigation schemes yet small reservoirs without canals require heavy labour to lift water and limits women s engagement in irrigated production about 55 of the respondents were within the age category of 20 40 years and about half 49 had no formal education indicating a low level of education among the respondents most of them were married 85 with household size ranging from 5 to 10 persons a typical smallholder vegetable farmer has been cultivating vegetables for about 2 years more than half 51 5 of the smallholder vegetable farmers sampled for the study were not members to any water user associations wua who might have opted not to practice irrigated production farming was found to be the major occupation of the respondents and they cultivated an average of 2 5 acres per farmer majority of the smallholder vegetable farmers operate on land owned by the family or access land through the local chiefs who acts as the custodian of community land table 4 presents the types of vegetable cultivated by the respondents although smallholder vegetable farmers cultivate a range of crops the most cultivated vegetables were pepper 68 3 followed by tomato 58 2 okra 45 7 and onion 33 8 a few however cultivated eggplant 8 2 and cabbage 2 7 it can therefore be inferred that pepper tomato okra and onion are mostly cultivated by smallholder vegetable farmers in the upper east region the use of the srs for vegetable production serves an important example of the provisioning ecosystem services greenfacts 2001 4 2 benefits and effectiveness of srs the study found that the majority more than 70 of the respondents particularly members of the wuas derive multiple livelihood benefits provided by the srs particularly water for irrigation livestock drinking domestic use and for construction table 5 in all the communities dry season irrigation livestock watering and fishing aquaculture were identified as the major livelihood benefits derived from the srs many of the focus groups also identified additional issues and distinct perspectives on the livelihood benefits such as availability of water for domestic use and for building and plastering houses some focus groups esp male participants identified additional benefits such as swimming bathing and the presence of green vegetation around the reservoir which serve as feed for livestock in the dry season with regard to assessing the extent to which the srs provide the various benefits identified by the community i e to assess the performance of the small reservoirs against the delivery of the key benefits identified more than 90 of the study communities stated the supply of water by the srs for livestock watering as very effective kajelo was the only community which rated the availability of the reservoir for livestock watering below the very effective scale because in kjelo the reservoir dries up in years of inadequate rainfall and siltation due to poor maintenance the capacity of the srs to support fishing aquaculture received low rating in all communities except the male group in binaba and the mixed group in pusu namongo where it was rated as very good in pusu namongo a project called results 6 6 resilient and sustainable livelihoods transformation result project funded by canadian feed the children cftc and implemented in northern ghana it is a 6 year 2012 2018 19 million project that is being implemented by cftc in partnership with the association of church based development projects acdep http acdep org site index php programmes projects agriculture result project new funded by the canadian government restocked the reservoir in early 2015 with fingerlings and provided feed to the farmers the harvest was good and this encouraged the farmers to actively participate in the aquaculture project in binaba though the reservoir has not been restocked since its construction communities believe they get enough fish at least for home consumption the capacity of the reservoir to provide water for domestic use also received high ratings in many communities though the main purpose of the small reservoirs is to provide water for livestock and dry season crop production the performance ratings provided by the various study communities were not very encouraging this is mainly due to the siltation of the reservoirs reducing its capacity to store enough water for irrigation and fragmentation of land due to population growth the detailed ratings of the key benefits from srs are indicated in table 6 4 3 impacts of srs on income of smallholder vegetable farmers table 7 presents the differences in farm and household characteristics of irrigators using srs and non irrigators with their respective t values to test for significance of differences the t values suggest that some significant differences exist between smallholder vegetable farmers who use srs to irrigate their vegetables and those who do not the results show that farmers engagement in other businesses has a significant effect on their decision to practice irrigated vegetable production or not farmers who engaged in other businesses were found to be less likely to undertake dry season irrigated farming table 8 presents results from the estimated endogenous switching regression model presented in the second column of table 8 are the estimates from the selection models which explain the determinants of the likelihood of the vegetable farmer participating in irrigated farming the likelihood ratio test statistic for joint independence show that the equations are dependent also the chi square statistic indicates over identification in the regression specifications of income is significantly different from zero at 1 level therefore the null hypothesis of the influence of the instruments credit access off farm activity participation and fbo variables on participation in irrigated practices is rejected the ρ p a 1 484 implies self selection into irrigated farming by the vegetable farmers in the study area this also implies that participation in irrigation may impact differently on non irrigators should they decide to practice irrigated production the positive sign of the covariance term ρ p a also suggests the existence of negative selection bias and that vegetable farmers whose income are below average are more likely to undertake irrigated production it is worth noting that off farm work participation and extension visits were considered as possible endogenous variables the results indicate that the residual of the potential endogenous variable off farmresid was statistically significant at 1 level in the irrigator s outcome specification implying that accounting for possible endogeneity of this variable for users of small water infrastructure for irrigation is inappropriate in the study area similarly the residual of the potential endogenous variable extensionresid was statistically significant at 1 level in the non irrigators outcome specification suggesting that accounting for possible endogeneity of this variable for non participants of small water infrastructure is inappropriate in the study area the coefficient of the extension variable is positive and statistically significant at 1 level suggesting that vegetable farmers who have access to extension services are more likely to undertake irrigated farming the findings which concur with that of abdulai and huffman 2014 in northern ghana is not surprising considering the relevance of agricultural extension in providing vital information on efficient and sustainable agricultural technologies in developing countries it was found that the decision of a farmer to participate in irrigated vegetable production using water from small reservoirs is highly dependent on one s perception about small reservoirs this is shown by the highly significant and positive estimate for the perception variable perception srs by creating positive and correct mental attitude regarding the importance of the srs in providing multiple benefits to farmers and the community as a whole smallholder farmers could be encouraged to explore the benefits through irrigated vegetables and involve in management of srs the results in the last two columns of table 8 show that farmer s age contributes significantly to higher income from vegetable production among irrigators gender variable was found to be significantly different from zero for both irrigators and non irrigators this suggests that the income effects for vegetable farmers is more for men as compared to women education was found to have a positive impact on the income of both irrigators and non irrigators this implies that education contribute significantly to welfare in terms of income of vegetable farmers household size was found to have a significantly positive impact on the income of non irrigator vegetable farmers in the study area extension access had positive impact on the income of irrigators farmers perception was found to have a significantly positive impact on the income of irrigated vegetable farmers this implies that the attitude of vegetable farmers about small water infrastructure indirectly enhances their chances of gaining more income furthermore the ownership of other business besides vegetable farming also was found to contribute significantly to the income of both participating and non participating vegetable farmers 4 4 counterfactual analysis and treatment effects the results of the average treatment effect on the treated att from the endogenous switching regression esr estimation showed a positive but insignificant impact irrigators on vegetable farmers income table 9 the causal effects of participating in irrigation using small water infrastructure was found to be gh 41 63 per hectare suggesting that use of srs for irrigation by farmers results in about 3 13 increase in income of vegetable farmers irrigator farmers using srs on average obtain a net income of gh 1370 ha relative to gh 1328 ha for non irrigators the results from the propensity score matching psm technique showed that use of srs for irrigated vegetable production exerts positive but statistically insignificant impact on vegetable income specifically using small water infrastructure for irrigated vegetable production insignificantly increase vegetable income by ca 29 from the nearest neighbour matching algorithm ca 26 from the kernel based matching and ca 3 from the radius matching table 10 5 conclusion and recommendations the study has established that in addition to enhanced agricultural productivity the srs in the study area provide multiple livelihood benefits such as for livestock drinking fishing construction building recreation and other domestic use effectiveness of the srs in terms of delivery of the intended multiple benefits is not encouraging in general most of the srs are functioning below the potential capacity which may be explained by poor management and maintenance of the water storage infrastructure prioritization of various benefit items from the srs by the community members reveal that small scale irrigation and livestock watering are the most important livelihood benefits community members derive from the srs the counterfactual analysis shows that there is about 3 increase in the income of irrigated vegetable farmers using water from srs but the increase is not statistically significant this may be attributed to the underperformance of the srs due to siltation and inadequate water for irrigation though the present results show that the impact on household income of irrigated vegetable production using srs appears to be below the usually claimed high impact in northern ghana the impacts of srs can be enhanced by improving their management through for example the provision of incentive mechanisms such as subsidies to the private sector involvement in rehabilitation management and irrigation service providers strengthening the capacity of existing water users associations for effective and efficient management of reservoirs and recognizing the multiple benefits and the wider socio economic values of small reservoirs i e ecosystem based management approach to attract public resource allocation in the rehabilitation and management of small reservoirs building farmers capacity in good agronomic and irrigation management practices and facilitating their access to improved seeds and other yield enhancing inputs and markets could also allow smallholder irrigators to fully utilize the currently underutilized available small water infrastructure in the region acknowledgements this work is part of a cgiar research program project on water land and ecosystems wle and supported by cgiar fund
