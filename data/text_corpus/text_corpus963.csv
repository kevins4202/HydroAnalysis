4815,both climate change and anthropogenic activities are known to induce streamflow change it is important to understand how it works here we integrate the long term water balance equation with the budyko framework to analytically attribute the mean annual streamflow change to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration caused by climate change and to changes in watershed properties caused by anthropogenic activities the attribution approach is applied to six sub basins in mekong river basin as a case study for attributing the decadal change in streamflow during 1960 2018 over the baseline 1960 1969 results indicate that the observed streamflow decadal changes are mostly due to anthropogenic activities with some decadal contributions from changes in precipitation

activities including land use change arrigoni et al 2010 dam construction and reservoir operation li et al 2017 as well as surface water and groundwater withdrawal and return flow tang et al 2017 can affect the partitioning of precipitation by altering the watershed properties attributing the streamflow changes to the climatic and anthropogenic drivers support the corresponding water resource

decomposition method for separating the climate and anthropogenic impacts on mean annual streamflow change based on the budyko diagram i e aridity index versus evapotranspiration ration however the existing methods to some extent have the limitations due to the complex model structure and large number of inputs it is difficult to use the hydrological modeling method for constructing the regional maps of climate and direct human induced streamflow change ponce and shetty 1995 the climate elasticity methods can easily compute the climate induced mean annual streamflow change but cannot compute the human induced streamflow change which depends on the observed total streamflow change so that these methods cannot be applied to the ungauged study areas ma et al 2008 the decomposition method is simple and can be easily extended to handle several comprehensive data sets han et al 2019 however this method treats the climate dryness index as one component which means that the contributions of individual climatic variables cannot be estimated separately wang and hejazi 2011 previous studies indicated that the responses of streamflow to precipitation change and potential evapotranspiration change are different usually the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation change is larger than that to potential evapotranspiration change tang et al 2013 under the climate change context changing patterns of both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration have been reported dore 2005 tabari et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 dinpashoh et al 2019 consequently it is very useful to go further and separate the climate induced streamflow change for more efficiently addressing the regional water scarcity conditions driven by changes in specific variables additionally only few studies partially discussed the roles of anthropogenic activities in the regional water cycle wang et al 2016 analytically derived the streamflow elasticity to climate change and watershed characteristics alteration where the streamflow sensitivity to watershed characteristics alteration represents the impacts of land use cover change in this paper a new attempt is made to attribute the mean annual streamflow change to climate induced and human induced streamflow change the climate induced impacts can be further decomposed into precipitation induced and potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow

analytically derive the contributions of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration changes caused by climate change and the contribution of human activities to the mean annual streamflow change details in section 2 the proposed approach will be applied to six sub basins in mekong river basin for attributing the decadal change in streamflow during 1960 2018 as a case study details in section 3 the implication and limitation of this approach will be discussed in section 4 and conclusion will be summarized in section 5 2 methods at long time scales the mean annual precipitation p is partitioned into mean annual streamflow q and evapotranspiration e and the water balance is as following 1 p e q budyko 1958 postulated that this partitioning of p is of the first order controlled by climate referred to aridity index i e which is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration and precipitation i e e p p based on many observations budyko 1974 proposed a function to describe the observed

to describe this relationship e g fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2008 wang and tang 2014 in this study the one parameter budyko equation derived recently based on the

defined as the ratio of initial evapotranspiration and total evapotranspiration the initial evapotranspiration is a portion of wetting which is only available for direct evapotranspiration such as the evapotranspiration occurring due to vegetation interception and water storage in topsoils the parameter of α reflects the impacts of watershed properties on the partitioning of p wang and tang 2014 when we consider the mean annual streamflow change from eq 1 we can obtain 3 dq d p d e where dq dp de are the total differentials of mean annual streamflow precipitation and evapotranspiration respectively the differentials represent the mean annual changes in these variables denoting eq 2 as e f p e p α we can express the total differential of e as 4 de f p d p f e p d e p f α d α substituting eq 4 to eq 3 and rearranging we obtain 5 dq 1 f p d p f e p d e p f α d α denoting dq p 1 f p d p dq e p f e p d e p and dq α f α d α the eq 4 can be expressed as 6 dq dq p dq e p dq α where dq e p dq p are the precipitation induced and the potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow change respectively and their summation is the climate induced streamflow change i e dq c dq p dq e p dq α is the parameter induced streamflow change the anthropogenic activities e g land use change irrigation and dam always alter the watershed properties for example if the land use changes from forest to bare land the soil properties e g porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity change accordingly the irrigation will change the water table and soil water content and the dam may change the local topography consequently in this study we consider that the changes in parameter i e α in different periods represent the impacts of anthropogenic activities on streamflow change and the parameter induced streamflow change is the human induced streamflow change from eq 2 we obtain 7 f p 1 2 α 2 α p e p 2 α 2 α e p 2 α 2 α p e p 2 4 α 2 α e p p 8 f e p 1 2 α 2 α p e p 2 α 2 α p 2 α

or actual evapotranspiration during pre change and post change periods the parameter α in different periods can be estimated and total differentials can be calculated based on the differences of variables between the pre change and post change period since our focus is the post change period and the pre change period is the reference by substituting the observations in post change period into eqs 10 to 12 the precipitation induced potential evapotranspiration induced and human induced streamflow change can be calculated respectively both climate induced and human induced streamflow change can be positive i e increase or negative i e decrease to compare the contributions of climate change and human activities can be estimated as 13 i q c dq c dq c d q α 100 14 i q α dq α dq c d q α 100

potential evapotranspiration change to the total streamflow change respectively 3 application to the mekong river basin 3 1 study area and data sources the mekong river is one of the most important transboundary rivers in the world flowing through six countries i e china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam with a total length of 4 350 km and a drainage area of 795 000 km2 mrc 2010 the annual streamflow is about 14 500 m3 s which is dominated primarily by southeast asian monsoons resulting in a flood season and a dry season within a hydrologic year mrc 2005 cochrane et al 2014 both climate change and human activities have exerted significant pressure on this basin with the increasing human actives dams and reservoirs has been constructed since the 1970s moreover the hydropower generation of the mekong river has kept increasing in recent years mrc 2010 the impacts of climate change and human activities on the streamflow change is therefore fundamental to water resource management and environmental protection and received considerable attentions recently in this study we will try to apply the attribution approach to this basin as a case study for quantifying the climate induced and human induced streamflow change the daily observed streamflow data during 1960 2018 at six mainstream gauges are obtained from the mekong river commission http portal mrcmekong org index as shown in fig 1 the monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data are obtained from climatic research unit timeseries cru ts data sets with the spatial resolution is 0 5 0 5 https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data cru ts gridded precipitation and other meteorological variables 1901 the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data for each sub basin are spatially averaged the original unit i e m3 s of daily streamflow is converted to millimeter per day i e mm day by dividing the area of each sub basin the daily and monthly values are summarized to obtain the annual values to attribute the streamflow change in different decades we divide the time series into 6 periods including the 1960s i e 1960 1969 1970s i e 1970 1979 1980s i e 1980 1989 1990s i e 1990 1999 2000s i e 2000 2009 and 2010s i e 2010 2018 this first period i e 1960s is the baseline period the decadal mean of streamflow precipitation potential evapotranspiration is calculated and the parameter in each decade is estimated by eq 2 the decadal changes are estimated by the difference of values between the baseline period and the post change periods the climate induced i e precipitation induced potential evapotranspiration induced and human induced streamflow change can be estimated by eqs 10 to 12 the values of α p and e p in eqs 10 to 12 are the values in the post change period e g 1970s or 2000s computing results in sub basin luang prabang is listed in table 1 as an example the dam database provided by the research program on water land and ecosystems wle greater mekong is used to validate the impacts of human activities on streamflow change 3 2 performance of the attribution method proposed in this study the observed streamflow changes in the post change periods relative to the baseline period in all subbasins are calculated as the example shows in column 11 in table 1 meanwhile the estimated streamflow changes in all study periods are computed by the attribution method i e eqs 6 10 to 12 fig 2 shows the observed streamflow change versus the estimated one it is seen that the data points follow the 1 1 line very well and the correlation coefficient is about 0 997 the absolute relative errors between the observed and estimated streamflow changes in all sub basins in all study periods are range from 0 2 to 20 6 results show that the performance of attribution approach in the study region is quite well several studies have estimated the climate induced and direct human induced mean annual streamflow changes for specific watersheds using different methods as mentioned above in section 1 e g zhang et al 2008 ma et al 2008 wang et al 2009 han et al 2019 the relative contributions of climate change and anthropogenic activities for these studies are listed in table 2 we estimate the climate and human induced streamflow changes based on the published data using 1 the decomposition method proposed by wang and hejazi 2011 and 2 the attribution approach proposed in this study and compare the estimated relative contributions of climate and anthropogenic activities by different methods as shown in table 2 the results calculated from these two methods are generally close to the published results the absolute differences of estimated relative contributions between the published results with attribution approach are generally less than 25 and most of them are less than 9 the absolute differences of estimated relative contributions between the decomposition method and the attribution approach are generally less than 22 and most of them are less than 5 notably in the estimation by wang et al 2009 the decreasing in precipitation in bai river basin is less than that in chao river basin however the contribution of climate in bai river estimated by decomposition method is 47 2 which is much larger than that in chao river i e 35 3 and this result is opposite with the published data suggesting that the attribution approach may be more reasonable 3 3 attribution of streamflow decadal change in this section the proposed attribution approach is utilized to attributing the decadal changes of streamflow in six sub basins in the mekong river basin fig 3 shows the precipitation induced potential evapotranspiration induced and human induced streamflow changes in the study area it is seen that the human induced streamflow changes i e blue bars in two sub basins close to the upper stream i e luang prabang and vientiane in all post change periods are negative indicating that the anthropogenic activities in these two sub basins mainly contribute to streamflow decreasing moreover the decreasing streamflow becomes more and more significant in the 2000s and 2010s differently the human induced streamflow changes in the two sub basins in the middle stream i e nakhon phanom and mukdahan are negative in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s and become positive afterwards indicating that human activities in these two sub basins contribute to the streamflow decreasing and increasing compared to other sub basins the magnitudes of human induced streamflow changes in pakse basin are relatively small and the trend is similar with the sub basins nakhon phanom and mukdahan the human induced streamflow changes in the sub basin close to the outlet of the mekong river basin i e stung treng are negative in the 1970s 1980s and 2010s and the change values are large in 1980s and 2010s compared to human impacts patterns of climate induced streamflow change emerge generally the precipitation induced streamflow changes are negative in the 1980s and 1990s and positive in the other post change periods across the six sub basins the magnitudes of the potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow changes are generally much smaller than the precipitation induced and human induced ones the potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow changes are generally negative as the gray bars shown in fig 3 indicating the changes in potential evapotranspiration in the study periods always contribute to streamflow decreasing 3 4 relative contributions to streamflow decadal changes fig 4 shows the relative contributions of the changes in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and human activities to the total streamflow change calculated by eqs 14 to 16 it is seen that the relative contribution of climate especially for precipitation is dominant in the 1970s and 1980s in luang prabang and vientiane sub basins after the 1980s the relative contribution of anthropogenic activities especially for the luange prabang basin increases significantly and the percentage reaches more than 70 the relative contributions of anthropogenic activities in the nakhon phanom and mukdahan basins are generally much larger than the relative contributions of climate change and the percentage of anthropogenic contributions are more than 60 in most changing periods except for the 1990s in the nakhon phanom and the 2000s in the mukdahan basins it is suggested that the streamflow change in these two sub basins is mainly dominated by the anthropogenic activities in the pakse basin the relative contributions of anthropogenic activities are much larger in the 1970s and 2010s and smaller in the other periods than those of climate changes in the stung treng basin located close to the outlet of the mekong river basin the relative contributions of anthropogenic activities are much larger in the 1970s 1980s and 2010s and much smaller in the 1990s and 2000s than those of climate changes and the relative contribution of anthropogenic activities almost reaches 100 in recent period i e 2010s generally the contributions of anthropogenic activities are dominant in recent period in all over the six sub basins and are especially significant in the downstream sub basins i e the pakse and stung treng basin climate change contributions are dominant in the 1990s for the nakhon phanom pakse and stung treng basins and are dominant in the 1970s and 1980s for the luang prabang and vientiane basins spatially the relative contributions of anthropogenic activities are larger in most changing periods in the nakhon phanom and mukdahan basins 4 discussion attributing the streamflow change is key for the prediction and management of global freshwater resources tang and lettenmaier 2012 zhang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 berghuijs et al 2017 it helps us to infer the potential impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the streamflow change in our case study it is seen that the human induced streamflow changes show different behaviors in different sub basins and periods markedly the human induced streamflow changes in three basins i e the nakhon phanom mukdahan and pakse basins in the cropland region are positive while are negative in the other basins after the 1990s see fig 4 previously some studies indicated that the rapid rate of water infrastructure e g dams development in the mekong river basin potentially affect the streamflow cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017 pokhrel et al 2018 han et al 2019 interestingly we found that the function of dams is for irrigation in the cropland but for hydropower in the other sub basins the water consumption tends to be high in the areas with a larger fraction of cropland wang and hejazi 2011 the irrigation scheme for the cropland in the mekong basin is the largest cochrane et al 2014 when the precipitation decreases in the 1980s and 1990s in basins in the cropland region crops there may depend on the irrigation and the estimated human induced streamflow changes are negative see fig 4 after l990s precipitation in the cropland region increasing significantly i e more than 50 mm and the precipitation induced streamflow change become positive with the water supply increasing significantly the irrigated crops in this region may be changed to the rain fed ones and the redundant water discharges in the mainstream it is seen that the human induced streamflow changes are positive there in recent periods to further unravel the impacts of anthropogenic activities we demonstrate the number of dams including the completed commissioned under construction and planned ones in the post change periods as shown in fig 5 it is seen that the trend of number of dams agrees with the relative contributions of human activities very well especially after 1990s see fig 4 due to lake of the irrigation data these discussions are open for the future studies although a direct validation of the estimated anthropogenic impacts is not available the meaningful relations between the estimated human induced streamflow change and the set of external validation data sets show the consistency of the proposed method the easy to obtain satellite observations may be a solution for the direct validation of the estimated anthropogenic impacts han et al 2020 explores the potential of satellite observations combined with hydrological modeling in elucidating reservoir behaviors in ungauged and or transboundary river basins the attribution approach provides a framework to analytically derive the human induced precipitation induced and potential evapotranspiration induced mean annual streamflow changes this new framework is simple and can be easily extended to many study watersheds under this framework the impacts of human activities on the hydrologic processes are identified by the changes in the model parameter the parameter e g α of budyko type equations reflect the impacts of watershed properties on the partitioning of p wang and tang 2014 deng et al 2019 the anthropogenic activities e g land use change irrigation and dam always alter the watershed properties for example if the land use changes from forest to bare land the soil properties e g porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity change accordingly the irrigation will change the water table and soil water content and the dam may change the local topography additionally the climate induced streamflow change in the new framework can be explicitly decomposed into precipitation induced and potential evapotranspiration induced one it is helpful to use this method for better understanding of the impact of individual climatic variable in the context of climate change on the mean annual streamflow change therefore it can provide an efficient tool for combining the projections of future climate change from general circulation models or regional climate models to project the climate change impact on streamflow in the future however the quality of observations can significantly affect the applicability of the attribution approach the parameter of this method has relatively clear physical meaning the ratio of initial evapotranspiration and total evapotranspiration ranging from 0 to 1 wang and tang 2014 tang et al 2017 when the quality of observations is poor the parameter may be negative and goes beyond its definition 5 summary and conclusion in this paper the analytical solutions of precipitation induced and potential evapotranspiration induced and direct human induced streamflow changes are derived by integrating the mean annual water balance with the budyko framework in the proposed method we identify the changes in parameter of budyko model in different periods with the anthropogenic impacts on streamflow change and the parameter induced streamflow change is the human induced streamflow change the newly proposed method is applied to six sub basins in the mekong river basin as a case study the attribution approach is verified by the published data in 18 watersheds as well as independent dataset on human activities e g dam database in this case study the decadal changes of streamflow during 1960 2018 over the baseline i e 1960 1969 are quantified results show that the potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow change is generally negative and most of the human induced streamflow changes are negative recently the relative contribution of anthropogenic activities to streamflow change is larger than that of climate change across the study basins spatially the human induced streamflow changes show the different trends in different sub basins and it may be attributed to the different functions of dams in different sub basins given the simplicity and explicitly of the analytical solutions it is feasible to use this method for constructing the regional map of the climate and human contributions to mean annual streamflow change furthermore the climate contributions can be estimated separately by this method and it is very useful for better understanding the impact of individual climatic variable in the context of climate change on mean annual streamflow additionally this method can provide an efficient tool for combining the projections of future climate change from general circulation models or regional climate models to project the climate change impact on streamflow in the future

or actual evapotranspiration during pre change and post change periods the parameter α in different periods can be estimated and total differentials can be calculated based on the differences of

eqs 10 to 12 the precipitation induced potential evapotranspiration induced and human induced streamflow change can be calculated respectively both climate induced and human induced streamflow change

transboundary rivers in the world flowing through six countries i e china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam with a total length of 4 350 km and a drainage area of 795 000 km2 mrc 2010 the annual streamflow is about 14 500 m3 s which is dominated primarily by southeast asian monsoons resulting in a flood season and a dry season within a hydrologic year mrc 2005 cochrane et al 2014 both climate change and human activities have exerted significant pressure on this basin with the increasing human actives dams and reservoirs has been constructed since the 1970s moreover the hydropower generation of the mekong river has kept increasing in recent years mrc 2010 the impacts of climate change and human activities on the streamflow change is therefore fundamental to water resource management and environmental protection and received considerable attentions recently in this study we will try to apply the attribution approach to this basin as a case study for quantifying the climate induced and human induced streamflow change the daily observed streamflow data during 1960 2018 at six mainstream gauges are obtained from the mekong river commission http portal mrcmekong org index as shown in fig 1 the monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data are obtained from climatic research unit timeseries cru ts data sets with the spatial resolution is 0 5 0 5 https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data cru ts gridded precipitation and other meteorological variables 1901 the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data for each sub basin are spatially averaged the original unit i e m3 s of daily streamflow is converted to millimeter per day i e mm day by dividing the area of each sub basin the daily and monthly values are summarized to obtain the annual values to attribute the streamflow change in different decades we divide the time series into 6 periods including the 1960s i e 1960 1969 1970s i e 1970 1979 1980s i e 1980 1989 1990s i e 1990 1999 2000s i e 2000 2009 and 2010s i e 2010 2018 this first period i e 1960s is the baseline period the decadal mean of streamflow precipitation potential evapotranspiration is calculated and the parameter in each decade is estimated by eq 2 the decadal changes are estimated by the difference of values between the baseline period and the post change periods the climate induced i e precipitation induced potential evapotranspiration induced and human induced streamflow change can be estimated by eqs 10 to 12 the values of α p and e p in eqs 10 to 12 are the values in the post change period e g 1970s or 2000s computing results in sub basin luang prabang is listed in table 1 as an example the dam database provided by the research program on water land and ecosystems wle greater mekong is used to validate the impacts of human activities on streamflow change 3 2 performance of the attribution method proposed in this study the observed streamflow changes in the post change periods relative to the baseline period in all subbasins are calculated as the example shows in column 11 in table 1 meanwhile the estimated streamflow changes in all study periods are computed by the attribution method i e eqs 6 10 to 12 fig 2 shows the observed streamflow change versus the estimated one it is seen that the data points follow the 1 1 line very well and the correlation coefficient is about 0 997 the absolute relative errors between the observed and estimated streamflow changes in all sub basins in all study periods are range from 0 2 to 20 6 results show that the performance of attribution approach in the study region is quite well several studies have estimated the climate induced and direct human induced mean annual streamflow changes for specific watersheds using different methods as mentioned above in section 1 e g zhang et al 2008 ma et al 2008 wang et al 2009 han et al 2019 the relative contributions of climate change and anthropogenic activities for these studies are listed in table 2 we estimate the climate and human induced streamflow changes based on the published data using 1 the decomposition method proposed by wang and hejazi 2011 and 2 the attribution approach proposed in this study and compare the estimated relative contributions of climate and anthropogenic activities by different methods as shown in table 2 the results calculated from these two methods are generally close to the published results the absolute differences of estimated relative contributions between the published results with attribution approach are generally less than 25 and most of them are less than 9 the absolute differences of estimated relative contributions between the decomposition method and the attribution approach are generally less than 22 and most of them are less than 5 notably in the estimation by wang et al 2009 the decreasing in precipitation in bai river basin is less than that in chao river basin however the contribution of climate in bai river estimated by decomposition method is 47 2 which is much larger than that in chao river i e 35 3 and this result is opposite with the published data suggesting that the attribution approach may be more reasonable 3 3 attribution of streamflow decadal change in this section the proposed attribution approach is utilized to attributing the decadal changes of streamflow in six sub basins in the mekong river basin fig 3 shows the precipitation induced potential evapotranspiration induced and human induced streamflow changes in the study area it is seen that the human induced streamflow changes i e blue bars in two sub basins close to the upper stream i e luang prabang and vientiane in all post change periods are negative indicating that the anthropogenic activities in these two sub basins mainly contribute to streamflow decreasing moreover the decreasing streamflow becomes more and more significant in the 2000s and 2010s differently the human induced streamflow changes in the two sub basins in the middle stream i e nakhon phanom and mukdahan are negative in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s and become positive afterwards indicating that human activities in these two sub basins contribute to the streamflow decreasing and increasing compared to other sub basins the magnitudes of human induced streamflow changes in pakse basin are relatively small and the trend is similar with the sub basins nakhon phanom and mukdahan the human induced streamflow changes in the sub basin close to the outlet of the mekong river basin i e stung treng are negative in the 1970s 1980s and 2010s and the change values are large in 1980s and 2010s compared to human impacts patterns of climate induced streamflow change emerge generally the precipitation induced streamflow changes are negative in the 1980s and 1990s and positive in the other post change periods across the six sub basins the magnitudes of the potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow changes are generally much smaller than the precipitation induced and human induced ones the potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow changes are generally negative as the gray bars shown in fig 3 indicating the changes in potential evapotranspiration in the study periods always contribute to streamflow decreasing 3 4 relative contributions to streamflow decadal changes fig 4 shows the relative contributions of the changes in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and human activities to the total streamflow change calculated by eqs 14 to 16 it is seen that the relative contribution of climate especially for precipitation is dominant in the 1970s and 1980s in luang prabang and vientiane sub basins after the 1980s the relative contribution of anthropogenic activities especially for the luange prabang basin increases significantly and the percentage reaches more than 70 the relative contributions of anthropogenic activities in the nakhon phanom and mukdahan basins are generally much larger than the relative contributions of climate change and the percentage of anthropogenic contributions are more than 60 in most changing periods except for the 1990s in the nakhon phanom and the 2000s in the mukdahan basins it is suggested that the streamflow change in these two sub basins is mainly dominated by the anthropogenic activities in the pakse basin the relative contributions of anthropogenic activities are much larger in the 1970s and 2010s and smaller in the other periods than those of climate changes in the stung treng basin located close to the outlet of the mekong river basin the relative contributions of anthropogenic activities are much larger in the 1970s 1980s and 2010s and much smaller in the 1990s and 2000s than those of climate changes and the relative contribution of anthropogenic activities almost reaches 100 in recent period i e 2010s generally the contributions of anthropogenic activities are dominant in recent period in all over the six sub basins and are especially significant in the downstream sub basins i e the pakse and stung treng basin climate change contributions are dominant in the 1990s for the nakhon phanom pakse and stung treng basins and are dominant in the 1970s and 1980s for the luang prabang and vientiane basins spatially the relative contributions of anthropogenic activities are larger in most changing periods in the nakhon phanom and mukdahan basins 4 discussion attributing the streamflow change is key for the prediction and management of global freshwater resources tang and lettenmaier 2012 zhang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 berghuijs et al 2017 it helps us to infer the potential impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the streamflow change in our case study it is seen that the human induced streamflow changes show different behaviors in different sub basins and periods markedly the human induced streamflow changes in three basins i e the nakhon phanom mukdahan and pakse basins in the cropland region are positive while are negative in the other basins after the 1990s see fig 4 previously some studies indicated that the rapid rate of water infrastructure e g dams development in the mekong river basin potentially affect the streamflow cochrane et al 2014 li et al 2017 pokhrel et al 2018 han et al 2019 interestingly we found that the function of dams is for irrigation in the cropland but for hydropower in the other sub basins the water consumption tends to be high in the areas with a larger fraction of cropland wang and hejazi 2011 the irrigation scheme for the cropland in the mekong basin is the largest cochrane et al 2014 when the precipitation decreases in the 1980s and 1990s in basins in the cropland region crops there may depend on the irrigation and the estimated human induced streamflow changes are negative see fig 4 after l990s precipitation in the cropland region increasing significantly i e more than 50 mm and the precipitation induced streamflow change become positive with the water supply increasing significantly the irrigated crops in this region may be changed to the rain fed ones and the redundant water discharges in the mainstream it is seen that the human induced streamflow changes are positive there in recent periods to further unravel the impacts of anthropogenic activities we demonstrate the number of dams including the completed commissioned under construction and planned ones in the post change periods as shown in fig 5 it is seen that the trend of number of dams agrees with the relative contributions of human activities very well especially after 1990s see fig 4 due to lake of the irrigation data these discussions are open for the future studies although a direct validation of the estimated anthropogenic impacts is not available the meaningful relations between the estimated human induced streamflow change and the set of external validation data sets show the consistency of the proposed method the easy to obtain satellite observations may be a solution for the direct validation of the estimated anthropogenic impacts han et al 2020 explores the potential of satellite observations combined with hydrological modeling in elucidating reservoir behaviors in ungauged and or transboundary river basins the attribution approach provides a framework to analytically derive the human induced precipitation induced and potential evapotranspiration induced mean annual streamflow changes this new framework is simple and can be easily extended to many study watersheds under this framework the impacts of human activities on the hydrologic processes are identified by the changes in the model parameter the parameter e g α of budyko type equations reflect the impacts of watershed properties on the partitioning of p wang and tang 2014 deng et al 2019 the anthropogenic activities e g land use change irrigation and dam always alter the watershed properties for example if the land use changes from forest to bare land the soil properties e g porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity change accordingly the irrigation will change the water table and soil water content and the dam may change the local topography additionally the climate induced streamflow change in the new framework can be explicitly decomposed into precipitation induced and potential evapotranspiration induced one it is helpful to use this method for better understanding of the impact of individual climatic variable in the context of climate change on the mean annual streamflow change therefore it can provide an efficient tool for combining the projections of future climate change from general circulation models or regional climate models to project the climate change impact on streamflow in the future however the quality of observations can significantly affect the applicability of the attribution approach the parameter of this method has relatively clear physical meaning the ratio of initial evapotranspiration and total evapotranspiration ranging from 0 to 1 wang and tang 2014 tang et al 2017 when the quality of observations is poor the parameter may be negative and goes beyond its definition 5 summary and conclusion in this paper the analytical solutions of precipitation induced and potential evapotranspiration induced and direct human induced streamflow changes are derived by integrating the mean annual water balance with the budyko framework in the proposed method we identify the changes in parameter of budyko model in different periods with the anthropogenic impacts on streamflow change and the parameter induced streamflow change is the human induced streamflow change the newly proposed method is applied to six sub basins in the mekong river basin as a case study the attribution approach is verified by the published data in 18 watersheds as well as independent dataset on human activities e g dam database in this case study the decadal changes of streamflow during 1960 2018 over the baseline i e 1960 1969 are quantified results show that the potential evapotranspiration induced streamflow change is generally negative and most of the human induced streamflow changes are negative recently the relative contribution of anthropogenic activities to streamflow change is larger than that of climate change across the study basins spatially the human induced streamflow changes show the different trends in different sub basins and it may be attributed to the different functions of dams in different sub basins given the simplicity and explicitly of the analytical solutions it is feasible to use this method for constructing the regional map of the climate and human contributions to mean annual streamflow change furthermore the climate contributions can be estimated separately by this method and it is very useful for better understanding the impact of individual climatic variable in the context of climate change on mean annual streamflow additionally this method can provide an efficient tool for combining the projections of future climate change from general circulation models or regional climate models to project the climate change impact on streamflow in the future

university no 967 east anning road lanzhou gansu 730070 china this manuscript was handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of stefano orlandini associate editor quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought is of great significance to sustainable water resource management but it remains difficult the key to solving this problem is determining how to scientifically select the natural reference tributary on the basis of existing research this paper puts forward a tributary comparison method that combines the drought propagation intensity index dpi with the human activity index to preliminarily and quantitatively determine the natural reference tributary from among all tributaries and then quantify the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries the empirical research was carried out in the upper reaches of the shiyang river in the eastern area of qilian mountain the results showed that firstly at the annual and seasonal scales the tributaries in the upper reaches of the shiyang river changed from hydrological humidification to hydrological aridification from west to east from 1961 to 2016 on the whole the hydrological aridification of huangyang river in the central part was the most serious but its hydrological drought duration and drought intensity showed a downward trend at a monthly scale secondly using the tributary comparison method xiying river was quantitatively selected as the natural reference tributary and the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries was quantified on the whole human activities will reduce hydrological drought duration and enhance hydrological drought intensity the empirical study further proved that the tributary comparison method has strong applicability in multi tributary areas with obvious differences in human activities and provides a useful supplement to existing research methods according to this method tributaries that are weakly affected by human activity or not affected at all can be selected and the tributaries least affected by human activity can also be identified on this basis the influence degree and direction of human activities in other tributaries on hydrological drought can be quantified keywords tributary comparison method quantifying human activity hydrological drought the upstream of shiyang river drought propagation intensity index dpi social 1 introduction drought is a serious type of natural disaster that causes severe environmental and socio economic problems agricultural losses and damage to natural ecosystems and society in many parts of the world prudhomme et al 2014 the american meteorological society classifies drought into four categories meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought heim 2002 hydrological drought considered one of the most important drought types can be defined as surface and groundwater resources with insufficient water consumption in a given water resource management system jiang et al 2019 this is an intermediate link of drought occurrence which is directly affected by meteorological drought and at the same time directly affects agricultural drought and socio economic drought once hydrological drought occurs it will have an immeasurable influence on the balance of regional water resource system wu et al 2016 carrying out hydrological drought research will not only further enrich the theoretical knowledge of drought but also provide support for the scientific management of water resources in the watershed therefore it is of great importance to fully understand the changing characteristics of hydrological drought and its driving factors dai et al 2019 the drought index is an indispensable basic tool for drought detection monitoring and influence assessment mishra and singh 2010 zargar et al 2011 which is usually used to determine the water conditions and the degree of water shortages in a certain area zhu et al 2016 according to the statistics of the world meteorological organization there are as many as 55 commonly used drought indexes including the standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the standardized runoff index sri and so on wang et al 2012 among them the standardized runoff index sri was proposed by shukla and wood in 2008 and is based on the concept of the standardized precipitation index spi this index is simple to calculate has multiple time scales and is sensitive to drought changes shukla and wood 2008 mo 2008 the evaluation results of drought and flood have good consistency and certain levels of applicability in different climatic regions and can accurately evaluate hydrological drought shao et al 2014 therefore the sri was selected as the index to study the changes in hydrological dry wet conditions and the spi is used as the index to study meteorological dry wet conditions traditionally most studies define drought as a natural phenomenon and climate change as the only driving factor of drought rangecroft et al 2019 however in recent years many studies have shown that human activities have had an important influence on drought drought processes and drought propagation aghakouchak et al 2015 wanders and wada 2015 van loon et al 2016 understanding the influence of human activities on hydrological drought is very important for improving water resource management and better preventing and alleviating drought but it is difficult to quantify the human influence on hydrological drought the key to quantifying human activities is determining how to distinguish the influences of climatic and human activities the best solution is to find a natural reference watershed and make a quantitative comparison with the hydrological drought characteristics of the watershed affected by human activities the key conditions of the natural reference watershed and the watershed affected by human activities is that the watershed characteristics are as similar as possible except for the elements of human disturbance but it is difficult to choose a natural reference watershed at present the methods for selecting natural reference watersheds are mainly as follows the large scale screening method wagener et al 2010 the observation modeling framework method van loon and van lanen 2013 paired catchments van loon et al 2019 the upstream downstream method rangecroft et al 2019 and the pre post disturbance method liu et al 2016 the above five methods provide a good idea of how to choose a natural reference watershed but retain some defects the first three methods all require a large number of watersheds long time series hydrological data and information on the types and degrees of human activities in the watershed while the latter two methods are uncertain the upstream downstream method ignores the influence of human activities that may exist upstream and the geographical environment between upstream and downstream areas may be quite different further the pre post disturbance method ignores the influence of climate change on hydrological drought in two periods at the same time these methods do not use unified indicators to quantify and distinguish between watersheds affected by human activities and natural reference watersheds these processes remain subjective and uncertain based on this and using the upper reaches of shiyang river as an example the present study proposes a tributary comparison method for determining a natural reference tributary from among tributaries and quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries the research contents of this paper include 1 the temporal and spatial variation of the hydrological dry wet characteristics in the upper reaches of shiyang river in the last 56 years 2 the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of hydrological drought events 3 quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in different tributaries using the tributary comparison method and discussing the applicability of this method the innovation of this paper lies in the following aspects first the tributary comparison method provides a new idea to quantify the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in different tributaries secondly this method solves the problem of time and space inconsistencies in the process of identifying a natural reference watershed thirdly this method combines the drought propagation intensity index dpi with the human activity index to quantitatively select natural reference tributaries which reduces the subjectivity and uncertainty in the process of determining natural reference tributaries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the shiyang river basin located in the arid region of northwest china is one of the inland river basins with the most prominent contradictions in its water resource supply and demand and has the most serious drought and water shortage its upstream originates from the northern slope of the eastern section of qilian mountain and is located between 101 41 103 48 e and 36 29 38 18 n with an altitude of 2000 5031 m and a total area of 11550 km2 fig 1 the climate is semi arid and semi humid with precipitation between 400 and 600 mm and potential evaporation between 880 and 1000 mm in the upper reaches of the shiyang river there are eight tributaries dajing river d j river gulang river g l river huangyang river h y river zamu river z m river jinta river j t river xiying river x y river dongda river d d river and xida river x d river as well as several small ditches and rivers which are short and have flow directions perpendicular to the direction of the mountains the source of the water supply is atmospheric precipitation and glacier meltwater feng et al 2004 in recent decades the overall trend of runoff from the upper reaches has been slightly reduced but the variation trend of runoff remains different in different tributaries li and liu 2011 zhou et al 2012 the change in runoff from the upper reaches directly affects the stability of the ecosystem in the upper region as well as the sustainable development of the social economy in the middle and lower reaches of the watershed the land use in the upper reaches of shiyang river is mainly forest land and grassland cultivated land and construction land are mainly distributed in the three tributaries in the east of the upper reaches of shiyang river where the influence of human activities is obvious the construction of water conservation projects directly affects the changes in runoff and further affects the change characteristics of hydrological drought except for zamu river and xiying river the other tributaries all had reservoirs built above their hydrological stations before the 1880s fig 1 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 hydrological and reservoir data the monthly runoff data for the eight hydrological control stations on the upper reaches of the shiyang river from 1961 to 2016 are taken from the shiyang river basin water resources bureau table 1 among them the gulang river lacks monthly runoff data for 28 years from 1961 to 1988 and the jinta river lacks monthly runoff data for 15 years from 1961 to 1975 to ensure the accuracy of the results the data are not artificially interpolated the reservoir and coefficient of reservoir storage capacity crsc data are taken from remote sensing visual interpretations basic situation of water conservancy in liangzhou district 2005 water affairs work manual of gulang 2007 and jinchang statistical yearbook 2 2 2 land use data the landsat tm remote sensing image data 1986 2000 and 2016 from the united states received by the china remote sensing satellite ground station are used in this paper with a resolution of 30 m and orbital numbers of 131 33 132 33 131 34 and 132 34 the data collection time ranges from june to september with less cloud cover and better image quality and meets the basic application requirements of remote sensing images firstly the processed remote sensing images were visually interpreted manually using the arcgis10 4 software next the interpretation results were further modified and verified through field investigations collected field training samples 125 samples and visiting native residents we determined that the average accuracy of interpretation is greater than 90 which meets our research needs lastly the land use types in the upper reaches of the shiyang river were classified according to the class i standard of classification of land use status in 2017 gb t 21010 2017 2 3 research methods 2 3 1 standardized runoff index sri mo 2008 argued that the sri can be calculated by imitating the standardized precipitation index spi mo 2008 the concrete calculation steps for spi refer to those used by husak et al 2007 shao et al calculated the sri using the calculation method of spi and proved that the calculated sri was correct and could be used in the study of drought and flood identification and their evolutionary processes shao et al 2014 both sri and spi have multiple time scales and different time scales reflect different drought and flood situations ye 2014 wang and zhang 2012 shukla and wood 2008 sri1 sri3 and sri12 are the values for one month three months and twelve months respectively the sri3 of the last month of each season and the sri12 of the last month of each year are taken as the hydrological drought value of the season and the annual scale march may is spring june august is summer september november is autumn and december february is winter the sri drought grades were classified based on previous studies guttman 1999 and the situation of the upper reaches of the shiyang river zhou et al 2019 as shown in table 2 2 3 2 runs theory yevjevich 1967 proposed applying runs theory to study drought characteristics as early as 1967 this method has the characteristics of identifying an independent drought event and judging the occurrence time and end time of the drought dai et al 2019 according to the runs theory drought is divided in this paper into three characteristics drought duration d drought severity s and drought intensity i a drought event occurs when sri 0 the negative run length is d unit month and the accumulated negative sri in a drought event is s that is the characteristics of the drought water shortage accumulated in a drought event formula 1 1 s j 1 d sri j the ratio of the s to d is i that is the average drought water shortage in the drought event formula 2 2 i s d 2 3 3 changing tendency rate the changing tendency rate is used to analyze the hydrological humidification and hydrological aridification of tributaries formula 3 3 a i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 where xi represents the year and yi represents the sri value when the changing tendency rate a is greater than 0 the sri value increases gradually showing the level hydrological humidification and the highest a value is the highest the hydrological humidification will be when a is less than 0 the sri value decreases gradually and indicates hydrological aridification the smaller the value of a is the higher the hydrological aridification will be 2 3 4 tributary comparison method quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought the tributary comparison method is suitable for watersheds with more than two tributaries as the influence of human activities in different tributaries is obviously different by constructing an indicator system that can reflect human activities the natural reference tributary is determined then the influence of human activities on the hydrological drought changes in other tributaries is quantified in this process it is important to build an indicator system that can reflect human activities 1 establishing an indicator system for the selected natural reference tributary there are eight tributaries in the upper reaches of shiyang river from west to east including d d river x d river x y river j t river z m river h y river g l river and d j river the hydrological processes of different tributaries are affected by human activities to different degrees considering previous studies van loon et al 2019 natural reference tributary here refers to a tributary with no or weak human activities and largely natural hydrological processes therefore in the process of identifying the natural reference tributary the key is selecting indicators that can reflect the intensity of human activities to the greatest extent firstly in the author s previous research found that hydrological drought is affected by meteorological drought and quantitatively analyzed the propagation process of meteorological drought to hydrological drought by constructing a drought propagation intensity index dpi and proposed the process of meteorological drought to hydrological drought when dpi is 1 there is peer to peer propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought zhou et al 2019 the reason for this situation is that changes in hydrological drought are directly controlled by the occurrence processes of meteorological drought and the intervention degree of human activities is weak therefore after the dpi value is taken as the primary index to identify the natural reference tributary secondly one of the most important functions of the reservoir is to regulate runoff so the reservoir has a significant influence on hydrological drought rangecroft et al 2019 van loon et al 2019 the coefficient of the reservoir s storage capacity the ratio of beneficial reservoir capacity to the average annual runoff is an important parameter to characterize a reservoir s regulation and storage capacity the larger its value is the stronger the reservoir s regulation capacity for hydrological process will be liu et al 2015 therefore the presence or absence of reservoirs and the coefficient of reservoir storage capacity are taken as the second index to identify the natural reference tributary finally the proportion of cultivated land and construction land pcc can accurately reflect the influence of human activities on hydrological processes in the watershed wu et al 2014 ma 2013 the smaller the pcc is the smaller the influence of human activities on hydrological drought will be when the pcc is less than 1 human activities are very weak therefore the pcc is taken as the third index for selecting a natural reference tributary according to the above ideas the natural reference tributary or tributary with the weakest influence of human activities can be identified the specific process is shown in fig 2 2 quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrologic drought after the natural reference tributary is identified referring to existing research results rangecroft et al 2019 van loon et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 we calculate the influence degree and direction of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries formula 4 4 δ dc x dc h dc n dc n 100 where δdcx refers to the percentage of the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in tributary x dcn is hydrological drought characteristic value drought duration d or drought intensity i of the natural reference tributary and dch represents the hydrological drought characteristic value drought duration d or drought intensity i of tributary x when δdcx 0 human activities have no effect on hydrological drought when δdcx 0 human activities aggravate the severity of hydrological drought when δdcx 0 human activities weaken the severity of hydrological drought the larger the absolute value of δdcx is the stronger the influence of human activities is 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variation characteristics of dry wet hydrology from 1961 to 2016 the sri changing tendency rate of tributaries in the upper reaches of shiyang river from west to east decreased fig 3 in other words the hydrological humidification of the western tributaries gradually transitioned toward hydrological aridification of the eastern tributaries among the tributaries the x d river and the d d river had the highest change tendency rate both positive indicating hydrological humidification the remaining tributaries all showed hydrological aridification and the h y river had the most serious hydrological aridification as shown in fig 4 based on the changing tendency rate of the sri in spring summer and autumn the western tributaries were higher than the eastern tributaries from 1961 to 2016 that is the tributaries from west to east gradually transitioned from hydrological humidification to hydrological aridification in spring the sri changing tendency rate of the d d river and x d river was higher than 0 indicating hydrological humidification other tributaries presented hydrological aridification especially the h y river which presented the most serious hydrological aridification except for the x d river in summer the other tributaries all indicated hydrological aridification in autumn the three tributaries in the east showed hydrological aridification in winter the changing tendency rate of sri showed a v shaped distribution except for the h y river the other tributaries indicated hydrological humidification 3 2 characteristics of hydrological drought events in the upper reaches of the shiyang river in terms of the mean value of the sri1 from 1961 to 2016 the hydrological drought duration and intensity of the tributaries from west to east were distributed in a single peak fig 5 the hydrological drought duration was the largest in z m river and the hydrological drought intensity was the largest in h y river from 1960 to 2016 the changing tendency rates of the drought characteristic parameters of the tributaries were different the hydrological drought duration showed a decreasing trend in the x d river d d river and h y river while the x y river z m river and d j river showed an increasing trend but the x d river presented the most significant change p 0 05 the hydrological drought intensity showed a decreasing trend in the d d river x y river and h y river while the x d river z m river and d j river showed an increasing trend but only the d d river had the most significant change p 0 05 3 3 quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought 3 3 1 selection of natural reference tributaries as shown in table 3 among the six tributaries in the upper reaches of the shiyang river the dpi values of the x d river and the h y river are higher than 1 so the intensity of the meteorological drought propagating to hydrological drought is strong that is hydrological drought is greater than meteorological drought the dpi of the z m river and d j river is less than 1 so the intensity of meteorological drought propagating to hydrological drought is weak the dpi of the d d river and x y river are close to 1 with peer to peer propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought moreover climate plays a leading role in hydrological drought with the h y river as a boundary the pcc in the three eastern rivers was much larger than that in the five western rivers the pcc of the h y river was the smallest the x y river and z m river did not have a reservoir ahead of the hydrological station the basic steps for selecting a natural reference tributary are as follows first select the tributaries with a dpi close to 1 the two tributaries of the d d river and the x y river were close to 1 which indicates peer to peer propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought it is very likely that the precipitation process played a leading role in hydrological drought secondly between the d d river and x y river the d d river has a reservoir ahead of the hydrological station while the x y river does not have a reservoir ahead of the hydrological station fig 1 the x y river without a reservoir is preferable finally further verifications were carried out among the two candidate tributaries the pcc of the x y river was smaller than that of the d d river and less than 1 which met the requirements of the natural reference tributary therefore the x y river was selected as the natural reference tributary 3 3 2 quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought taking the x y river as the natural reference tributary two hydrological drought characteristic indicators were selected hydrological drought duration and drought intensity formula 4 was used to calculate and analyze the influence of human activities on hydrological drought at a monthly scale for the x d river d d river z m river h y river and d j river a positive value indicates that human activities have aggravated hydrological drought while a negative value indicates that human activities have slowed hydrological drought the higher the absolute value of δdcx the greater the influence of human activities table 4 table 4 shows that overall the human activities in the upper reaches of shiyang river reduced the drought duration and increased the drought intensity of hydrological drought events among the tributaries the drought duration of x d river decreased the most and the drought intensity of h y river increased the most however inconsistent with the above characteristics the human activities in z m river increased the drought duration and the human activities in d j river reduced the drought intensity when drought events occur tributaries with operational reservoirs will reduce the drought duration and alleviate drought to a certain extent the higher the coefficient of reservoir storage capacity crsc is the shorter the drought duration of the drought event will be these two factors are significantly negatively correlated p 0 05 however due to the influence of other human activities such as farmland irrigation and domestic water the drought intensity of hydrological drought events can increase among the four tributaries with reservoirs the crsc of d j river was the highest having an obvious regulating effect on hydrological drought this effect not only reduced the hydrological drought duration but also reduced the hydrological drought intensity the crsc of the x d river ranked second presenting the largest reduction in hydrological drought duration and an obvious regulation effect of the reservoir the h y river had a smaller crsc the smallest reduction in hydrological drought duration and the largest increase in hydrological drought intensity 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with former research methods yoshihide wada et al concluded that human activities are one of the most important mechanisms that exacerbate hydrological drought and may continue to be the main factor affecting the intensity and frequency of drought in the future wada et al 2013 using the paired catchments method van loon et al 2019 concluded that when there was water transfer between basins the drought in many natural catchments was alleviated and when the groundwater was exploited the drought index of the basin generally deteriorated in the laohahe catchment study using the pre post disturbance method liu et al found that the duration and intensity of hydrologic drought increased with the participation of human activities liu et al 2016 rangecroft et al 2019 determined that due to the establishment of the reservoir hydrological drought was aggravated and the drought duration and drought intensity increased in the downstream area of the huasco basin in the arid area of northern chile rangecroft et al 2019 these study results are similar with the observation that human activities can increase the hydrologic drought intensity in the upstream area of shiyang river but are different from the results offered by this paper showing that the construction of reservoirs shortens the hydrologic drought duration the reason for this difference may be that the methods and intensity levels of human activities in different regions and their disturbance levels on the water cycle process are different thus changing the effects of reservoirs on hydrologic drought at the same time relevant studies have shown that whether scientific methods can be used to selected natural reference river directly affects the accuracy and precision of the research results jiang et al 2019 thus it remains very important to select a natural reference river this paper combined the drought propagation intensity index with human activity indicators and quantitatively selected a natural reference tributary which reduced the difficulty and uncertainty of subjective judgments and improved the scientificity and rationality of the quantitative methods this study thus deepens and complements existing methods through the quantitative analysis of the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in the eight tributaries of the upper shiyang river it is proved that the tributary comparison method is a suitable tool for quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought by using observational data empirical research suggests that this method and its ideas are widely applicable 4 2 applicability analysis of the tributary comparison method first this method is most suitable for multi tributary areas with obvious differences in human activities and at least one tributary with no human activities or very weak human activities in this case a natural reference tributary that is not influenced by human activities can be accurately selected secondly this method also has certain applicability for multi tributary areas where human activities have a greater influence with significant differences in this case according to the tributary comparison method a reference tributary with the weakest influence of human activities on hydrological drought can be selected based on the reference tributary the degree and direction of the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries can be calculated the calculation results can still quantitatively compare the differences in the influence of human activities on hydrological drought events in different tributaries 4 3 limitations and possible improvements to the tributary comparison method first the tributary comparison method and its research concepts have good applicability to multi tributary areas with obvious differences in the degree of human activities however this method is invalid for multi tributary areas with no obvious differences in human activities and those with no human activities secondly for multi tributary areas with more complex situations if it remains impossible to select a natural reference tributary or reference tributary after using the indicator system of this method fig 2 other indexes that can express the intensity of human activities can be correctly added to provide more complex selection finally by constructing an indicator system the selection process of a natural reference tributary is quantified this method provides ideas and frameworks for the determination and selection of a natural reference tributary this method and concept have strong applicability in the arid area of northwest china but when applied to other regions and watersheds these quantitative indicators need to be modified and improved appropriately according to the specific characteristics of the watershed itself and the characteristics of human activities for example concepts such as socio hydrological resilience eslamian et al 2019 can be introduced to further improve the accuracy and scientificity of the selection of a natural reference tributary 5 conclusions hydrological drought is one of the most important drought types once it occurs it has an immeasurable influence on the balance of regional water resource systems therefore quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought is of great significance to sustainable water resource management in this paper a tributary comparison method was proposed to quantitatively evaluate the influence of human activities on hydrological drought events the empirical research was carried out in the upper reaches of shiyang river in the eastern area of qilian mountain and the following conclusions were obtained the temporal and spatial variation in the hydrological humidification and aridification characteristics of the tributaries in the upper reaches of shiyang river were different as was the influence degree of human activitie firstly at annual and seasonal scales the tributaries in the upper reaches of shiyang river changed from hydrological humidification to hydrological aridification from west to east from 1961 to 2016 on the whole the hydrological aridification of the h y river in the central area was the most serious but its hydrological drought duration and drought intensity showed a downward trend at a monthly scale secondly during the four seasons the x d river indicated hydrological humidification while the h y river presented hydrological aridification at the same time with h y river as the boundary human activities in the eastern tributaries were greater than those in the western tributaries the distribution of the drought duration and drought intensity of the tributaries from west to east showed a single peak in which the drought duration was the largest in z m river while the drought intensity was the largest in h y river according to the idea of the tributary comparison method x y river was quantitatively selected as the natural reference tributary from which the influence degree and direction of human activities in other tributaries on hydrological drought can be quantified on the whole human activities will reduce the hydrological drought duration and enhance hydrological drought intensity the empirical study further proved that the tributary comparison method has strong applicability in multi tributary areas with obvious differences in human activities and offers a useful supplement to existing research methods this method provides a more specific conceptualization and framework for determining a natural reference tributary according to the idea of this method tributaries that experience no human activities or are weakly affected by human activities can be selected and the tributary least affected by human activity can also be identified on this basis the influence degree and direction of human activities in other tributaries on hydrological drought can be quantified this method reduces the difficulty and subjectivity of existing methods in determining a natural reference tributary by constructing quantitative indicators however for multi tributary areas with more complex situations the adjustment and optimization of quantitative indicators can be combined with existing methods to accurately select and determine the reference tributary which is also a research area that needs to be improved in future scientific research credit authorship contribution statement qiaoqiao li conceptualization methodology formal

influence of human activities on hydrological drought is of great significance to sustainable water resource management but it remains difficult the key to solving this problem is determining how to scientifically select the natural reference tributary on the basis of existing research this paper puts forward a tributary comparison method that combines the drought propagation intensity index dpi with the human activity index to preliminarily and quantitatively determine the natural reference tributary from among all tributaries and then quantify the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries the empirical research was carried out in the upper reaches of the shiyang river in the eastern area of qilian mountain the results showed that firstly at the annual and seasonal scales the tributaries in the upper reaches of the shiyang river changed from hydrological humidification to hydrological aridification from west to east from 1961 to 2016 on the whole the hydrological aridification of huangyang river in the central part was the most serious but its hydrological drought duration and drought intensity showed a downward trend at a monthly scale secondly using the tributary comparison method xiying river was quantitatively selected as the natural reference tributary and the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries was quantified on the whole human activities will reduce hydrological drought duration and enhance hydrological drought intensity the empirical study further proved that the tributary comparison method has strong applicability in multi tributary areas with obvious differences in human activities and provides a useful supplement to existing research methods according to this method tributaries that are weakly affected by human activity or not affected at all can be selected and the tributaries least affected by human activity can also be identified on this basis the influence degree and direction of human activities in other tributaries on hydrological drought can be quantified keywords tributary comparison method quantifying human activity hydrological drought the upstream of shiyang river drought propagation intensity index dpi social 1 introduction drought is a serious type of natural disaster that causes severe environmental and socio economic problems agricultural losses and damage to natural ecosystems and society in many parts of the world prudhomme et al 2014 the american meteorological society classifies drought into four categories meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought heim 2002 hydrological drought considered one of the most important drought types can be defined as surface and groundwater resources with insufficient water consumption in a given water resource management system jiang et al 2019 this is an intermediate link of drought occurrence which is directly affected by meteorological drought and at the same time directly affects agricultural drought and socio economic drought once hydrological drought occurs it will have an immeasurable influence on the balance of regional water resource system wu et al 2016 carrying out hydrological drought research will not only further enrich the theoretical knowledge of drought but also provide support for the scientific management of water resources in the watershed therefore it is of great importance to fully understand the changing characteristics of hydrological drought and its driving factors dai et al 2019 the drought index is an indispensable basic tool for drought detection monitoring and influence assessment mishra and singh 2010 zargar et al 2011 which is usually used to determine the water conditions and the degree of water shortages in a certain area zhu et al 2016 according to the statistics of the world meteorological organization there are as many as 55 commonly used drought indexes including the standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the standardized runoff index sri and so on wang et al 2012 among them the standardized runoff index sri was proposed by shukla and wood in 2008 and is based on the concept of the standardized precipitation index spi this index is simple to calculate has multiple time scales and is sensitive to drought changes shukla and wood 2008 mo 2008 the evaluation results of drought and flood have good consistency and certain levels of applicability in different climatic regions and can accurately evaluate hydrological drought shao et al 2014 therefore the sri was selected as the index to study the changes in hydrological dry wet conditions and the spi is used as the index to study meteorological dry wet conditions traditionally most studies define drought as a natural phenomenon and climate change as the only driving factor of drought rangecroft et al 2019 however in recent years many studies have shown that human activities have had an important influence on drought drought processes and drought propagation aghakouchak et al 2015 wanders and wada 2015 van loon et al 2016 understanding the influence of human activities on hydrological drought is very important for improving water resource management and better preventing and alleviating drought but it is difficult to quantify the human influence on hydrological drought the key to quantifying human activities is determining how to distinguish the influences of climatic and human activities the best solution is to find a natural reference watershed and make a quantitative comparison with the hydrological drought characteristics of the watershed affected by human activities the key conditions of the natural reference watershed and the watershed affected by human activities is that the watershed characteristics are as similar as possible except for the elements of human disturbance but it is difficult to choose a natural reference watershed at present the methods for selecting natural reference watersheds are mainly as follows the large scale screening method wagener et al 2010 the observation modeling framework method van loon and van lanen 2013 paired catchments van loon et al 2019 the upstream downstream method rangecroft et al 2019 and the pre post disturbance method liu et al 2016 the above five methods provide a good idea of how to choose a natural reference watershed but retain some defects the first three methods all require a large number of watersheds long time series hydrological data and information on the types and degrees of human activities in the watershed while the latter two methods are uncertain the upstream downstream method ignores the influence of human activities that may exist upstream and the geographical environment between upstream and downstream areas may be quite different further the pre post disturbance method ignores the influence of climate change on hydrological drought in two periods at the same time these methods do not use unified indicators to quantify and distinguish between watersheds affected by human activities and natural reference watersheds these processes remain subjective and uncertain based on this and using the upper reaches of shiyang river as an example the present study proposes a tributary comparison method for determining a natural reference tributary from among tributaries and quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries the research contents of this paper include 1 the temporal and spatial variation of the hydrological dry wet characteristics in the upper reaches of shiyang river in the last 56 years 2 the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of hydrological drought events 3 quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in different tributaries using the tributary comparison method and discussing the applicability of this method the innovation of this paper lies in the following aspects first the tributary comparison method provides a new idea to quantify the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in different tributaries secondly this method solves the problem of time and space inconsistencies in the process of identifying a natural reference watershed thirdly this method combines the drought propagation intensity index dpi with the human activity index to quantitatively select natural reference tributaries which reduces the subjectivity and uncertainty in the process of determining natural reference tributaries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the shiyang river basin located in the arid region of northwest china is one of the inland river basins with the most prominent contradictions in its water resource supply and demand and has the most serious drought and water shortage its upstream originates from the northern slope of the eastern section of qilian mountain and is located between 101 41 103 48 e and 36 29 38 18 n with an altitude of 2000 5031 m and a total area of 11550 km2 fig 1 the climate is semi arid and semi humid with precipitation between 400 and 600 mm and potential evaporation between 880 and 1000 mm in the upper reaches of the shiyang river there are eight tributaries dajing river d j river gulang river g l river huangyang river h y river zamu river z m river jinta river j t river xiying river x y river dongda river d d river and xida river x d river as well as several small ditches and rivers which are short and have flow directions perpendicular to the direction of the mountains the source of the water supply is atmospheric precipitation and glacier meltwater feng et al 2004 in recent decades the overall trend of runoff from the upper reaches has been slightly reduced but the variation trend of runoff remains different in different tributaries li and liu 2011 zhou et al 2012 the change in runoff from the upper reaches directly affects the stability of the ecosystem in the upper region as well as the sustainable development of the social economy in the middle and lower reaches of the watershed the land use in the upper reaches of shiyang river is mainly forest land and grassland cultivated land and construction land are mainly distributed in the three tributaries in the east of the upper reaches of shiyang river where the influence of human activities is obvious the construction of water conservation projects directly affects the changes in runoff and further affects the change characteristics of hydrological drought except for zamu river and xiying river the other tributaries all had reservoirs built above their hydrological stations before the 1880s fig 1 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 hydrological and reservoir data the monthly runoff data for the eight hydrological control stations on the upper reaches of the shiyang river from 1961 to 2016 are taken from the shiyang river basin water resources bureau table 1 among them the gulang river lacks monthly runoff data for 28 years from 1961 to 1988 and the jinta river lacks monthly runoff data for 15 years from 1961 to 1975 to ensure the accuracy of the results the data are not artificially interpolated the reservoir and coefficient of reservoir storage capacity crsc data are taken from remote sensing visual interpretations basic situation of water conservancy in liangzhou district 2005 water affairs work manual of gulang 2007 and jinchang statistical yearbook 2 2 2 land use data the landsat tm remote sensing image data 1986 2000 and 2016 from the united states received by the china remote sensing satellite ground station are used in this paper with a resolution of 30 m and orbital numbers of 131 33 132 33 131 34 and 132 34 the data collection time ranges from june to september with less cloud cover and better image quality and meets the basic application requirements of remote sensing images firstly the processed remote sensing images were visually interpreted manually using the arcgis10 4 software next the interpretation results were further modified and verified through field investigations collected field training samples 125 samples and visiting native residents we determined that the average accuracy of interpretation is greater than 90 which meets our research needs lastly the land use types in the upper reaches of the shiyang river were classified according to the class i standard of classification of land use status in 2017 gb t 21010 2017 2 3 research methods 2 3 1 standardized runoff index sri mo 2008 argued that the sri can be calculated by imitating the standardized precipitation index spi mo 2008 the concrete calculation steps for spi refer to those used by husak et al 2007 shao et al calculated the sri using the calculation method of spi and proved that the calculated sri was correct and could be used in the study of drought and flood identification and their evolutionary processes shao et al 2014 both sri and spi have multiple time scales and different time scales reflect different drought and flood situations ye 2014 wang and zhang 2012 shukla and wood 2008 sri1 sri3 and sri12 are the values for one month three months and twelve months respectively the sri3 of the last month of each season and the sri12 of the last month of each year are taken as the hydrological drought value of the season and the annual scale march may is spring june august is summer september november is autumn and december february is winter the sri drought grades were classified based on previous studies guttman 1999 and the situation of the upper reaches of the shiyang river zhou et al 2019 as shown in table 2 2 3 2 runs theory yevjevich 1967 proposed applying runs theory to study drought characteristics as early as 1967 this method has the characteristics of identifying an independent drought event and judging the occurrence time and end time of the drought dai et al 2019 according to the runs theory drought is divided in this paper into three characteristics drought duration d drought severity s and drought intensity i a drought event occurs when sri 0 the negative run length is d unit month and the accumulated negative sri in a drought event is s that is the characteristics of the drought water shortage accumulated in a drought event formula 1 1 s j 1 d sri j the ratio of the s to d is i that is the average drought water shortage in the drought event formula 2 2 i s d 2 3 3 changing tendency rate the changing tendency rate is used to analyze the hydrological humidification and hydrological aridification of tributaries formula 3 3 a i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 where xi represents the year and yi represents the sri value when the changing tendency rate a is greater than 0 the sri value increases gradually showing the level hydrological humidification and the highest a value is the highest the hydrological humidification will be when a is less than 0 the sri value decreases gradually and indicates hydrological aridification the smaller the value of a is the higher the hydrological aridification will be 2 3 4 tributary comparison method quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought the tributary comparison method is suitable for watersheds with more than two tributaries as the influence of human activities in different tributaries is obviously different by constructing an indicator system that can reflect human activities the natural reference tributary is determined then the influence of human activities on the hydrological drought changes in other tributaries is quantified in this process it is important to build an indicator system that can reflect human activities 1 establishing an indicator system for the selected natural reference tributary there are eight tributaries in the upper reaches of shiyang river from west to east including d d river x d river x y river j t river z m river h y river g l river and d j river the hydrological processes of different tributaries are affected by human activities to different degrees considering previous studies van loon et al 2019 natural reference tributary here refers to a tributary with no or weak human activities and largely natural hydrological processes therefore in the process of identifying the natural reference tributary the key is selecting indicators that can reflect the intensity of human activities to the greatest extent firstly in the author s previous research found that hydrological drought is affected by meteorological drought and quantitatively analyzed the propagation process of meteorological drought to hydrological drought by constructing a drought propagation intensity index dpi and proposed the process of meteorological drought to hydrological drought when dpi is 1 there is peer to peer propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought zhou et al 2019 the reason for this situation is that changes in hydrological drought are directly controlled by the occurrence processes of meteorological drought and the intervention degree of human activities is weak therefore after the dpi value is taken as the primary index to identify the natural reference tributary secondly one of the most important functions of the reservoir is to regulate runoff so the reservoir has a significant influence on hydrological drought rangecroft et al 2019 van loon et al 2019 the coefficient of the reservoir s storage capacity the ratio of beneficial reservoir capacity to the average annual runoff is an important parameter to characterize a reservoir s regulation and storage capacity the larger its value is the stronger the reservoir s regulation capacity for hydrological process will be liu et al 2015 therefore the presence or absence of reservoirs and the coefficient of reservoir storage capacity are taken as the second index to identify the natural reference tributary finally the proportion of cultivated land and construction land pcc can accurately reflect the influence of human activities on hydrological processes in the watershed wu et al 2014 ma 2013 the smaller the pcc is the smaller the influence of human activities on hydrological drought will be when the pcc is less than 1 human activities are very weak therefore the pcc is taken as the third index for selecting a natural reference tributary according to the above ideas the natural reference tributary or tributary with the weakest influence of human activities can be identified the specific process is shown in fig 2 2 quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrologic drought after the natural reference tributary is identified referring to existing research results rangecroft et al 2019 van loon et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 we calculate the influence degree and direction of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries formula 4 4 δ dc x dc h dc n dc n 100 where δdcx refers to the percentage of the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in tributary x dcn is hydrological drought characteristic value drought duration d or drought intensity i of the natural reference tributary and dch represents the hydrological drought characteristic value drought duration d or drought intensity i of tributary x when δdcx 0 human activities have no effect on hydrological drought when δdcx 0 human activities aggravate the severity of hydrological drought when δdcx 0 human activities weaken the severity of hydrological drought the larger the absolute value of δdcx is the stronger the influence of human activities is 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variation characteristics of dry wet hydrology from 1961 to 2016 the sri changing tendency rate of tributaries in the upper reaches of shiyang river from west to east decreased fig 3 in other words the hydrological humidification of the western tributaries gradually transitioned toward hydrological aridification of the eastern tributaries among the tributaries the x d river and the d d river had the highest change tendency rate both positive indicating hydrological humidification the remaining tributaries all showed hydrological aridification and the h y river had the most serious hydrological aridification as shown in fig 4 based on the changing tendency rate of the sri in spring summer and autumn the western tributaries were higher than the eastern tributaries from 1961 to 2016 that is the tributaries from west to east gradually transitioned from hydrological humidification to hydrological aridification in spring the sri changing tendency rate of the d d river and x d river was higher than 0 indicating hydrological humidification other tributaries presented hydrological aridification especially the h y river which presented the most serious hydrological aridification except for the x d river in summer the other tributaries all indicated hydrological aridification in autumn the three tributaries in the east showed hydrological aridification in winter the changing tendency rate of sri showed a v shaped distribution except for the h y river the other tributaries indicated hydrological humidification 3 2 characteristics of hydrological drought events in the upper reaches of the shiyang river in terms of the mean value of the sri1 from 1961 to 2016 the hydrological drought duration and intensity of the tributaries from west to east were distributed in a single peak fig 5 the hydrological drought duration was the largest in z m river and the hydrological drought intensity was the largest in h y river from 1960 to 2016 the changing tendency rates of the drought characteristic parameters of the tributaries were different the hydrological drought duration showed a decreasing trend in the x d river d d river and h y river while the x y river z m river and d j river showed an increasing trend but the x d river presented the most significant change p 0 05 the hydrological drought intensity showed a decreasing trend in the d d river x y river and h y river while the x d river z m river and d j river showed an increasing trend but only the d d river had the most significant change p 0 05 3 3 quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought 3 3 1 selection of natural reference tributaries as shown in table 3 among the six tributaries in the upper reaches of the shiyang river the dpi values of the x d river and the h y river are higher than 1 so the intensity of the meteorological drought propagating to hydrological drought is strong that is hydrological drought is greater than meteorological drought the dpi of the z m river and d j river is less than 1 so the intensity of meteorological drought propagating to hydrological drought is weak the dpi of the d d river and x y river are close to 1 with peer to peer propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought moreover climate plays a leading role in hydrological drought with the h y river as a boundary the pcc in the three eastern rivers was much larger than that in the five western rivers the pcc of the h y river was the smallest the x y river and z m river did not have a reservoir ahead of the hydrological station the basic steps for selecting a natural reference tributary are as follows first select the tributaries with a dpi close to 1 the two tributaries of the d d river and the x y river were close to 1 which indicates peer to peer propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought it is very likely that the precipitation process played a leading role in hydrological drought secondly between the d d river and x y river the d d river has a reservoir ahead of the hydrological station while the x y river does not have a reservoir ahead of the hydrological station fig 1 the x y river without a reservoir is preferable finally further verifications were carried out among the two candidate tributaries the pcc of the x y river was smaller than that of the d d river and less than 1 which met the requirements of the natural reference tributary therefore the x y river was selected as the natural reference tributary 3 3 2 quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought taking the x y river as the natural reference tributary two hydrological drought characteristic indicators were selected hydrological drought duration and drought intensity formula 4 was used to calculate and analyze the influence of human activities on hydrological drought at a monthly scale for the x d river d d river z m river h y river and d j river a positive value indicates that human activities have aggravated hydrological drought while a negative value indicates that human activities have slowed hydrological drought the higher the absolute value of δdcx the greater the influence of human activities table 4 table 4 shows that overall the human activities in the upper reaches of shiyang river reduced the drought duration and increased the drought intensity of hydrological drought events among the tributaries the drought duration of x d river decreased the most and the drought intensity of h y river increased the most however inconsistent with the above characteristics the human activities in z m river increased the drought duration and the human activities in d j river reduced the drought intensity when drought events occur tributaries with operational reservoirs will reduce the drought duration and alleviate drought to a certain extent the higher the coefficient of reservoir storage capacity crsc is the shorter the drought duration of the drought event will be these two factors are significantly negatively correlated p 0 05 however due to the influence of other human activities such as farmland irrigation and domestic water the drought intensity of hydrological drought events can increase among the four tributaries with reservoirs the crsc of d j river was the highest having an obvious regulating effect on hydrological drought this effect not only reduced the hydrological drought duration but also reduced the hydrological drought intensity the crsc of the x d river ranked second presenting the largest reduction in hydrological drought duration and an obvious regulation effect of the reservoir the h y river had a smaller crsc the smallest reduction in hydrological drought duration and the largest increase in hydrological drought intensity 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with former research methods yoshihide wada et al concluded that human activities are one of the most important mechanisms that exacerbate hydrological drought and may continue to be the main factor affecting the intensity and frequency of drought in the future wada et al 2013 using the paired catchments method van loon et al 2019 concluded that when there was water transfer between basins the drought in many natural catchments was alleviated and when the groundwater was exploited the drought index of the basin generally deteriorated in the laohahe catchment study using the pre post disturbance method liu et al found that the duration and intensity of hydrologic drought increased with the participation of human activities liu et al 2016 rangecroft et al 2019 determined that due to the establishment of the reservoir hydrological drought was aggravated and the drought duration and drought intensity increased in the downstream area of the huasco basin in the arid area of northern chile rangecroft et al 2019 these study results are similar with the observation that human activities can increase the hydrologic drought intensity in the upstream area of shiyang river but are different from the results offered by this paper showing that the construction of reservoirs shortens the hydrologic drought duration the reason for this difference may be that the methods and intensity levels of human activities in different regions and their disturbance levels on the water cycle process are different thus changing the effects of reservoirs on hydrologic drought at the same time relevant studies have shown that whether scientific methods can be used to selected natural reference river directly affects the accuracy and precision of the research results jiang et al 2019 thus it remains very important to select a natural reference river this paper combined the drought propagation intensity index with human activity indicators and quantitatively selected a natural reference tributary which reduced the difficulty and uncertainty of subjective judgments and improved the scientificity and rationality of the quantitative methods this study thus deepens and complements existing methods through the quantitative analysis of the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in the eight tributaries of the upper shiyang river it is proved that the tributary comparison method is a suitable tool for quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought by using observational data empirical research suggests that this method and its ideas are widely applicable 4 2 applicability analysis of the tributary comparison method first this method is most suitable for multi tributary areas with obvious differences in human activities and at least one tributary with no human activities or very weak human activities in this case a natural reference tributary that is not influenced by human activities can be accurately selected secondly this method also has certain applicability for multi tributary areas where human activities have a greater influence with significant differences in this case according to the tributary comparison method a reference tributary with the weakest influence of human activities on hydrological drought can be selected based on the reference tributary the degree and direction of the influence of human activities on hydrological drought in other tributaries can be calculated the calculation results can still quantitatively compare the differences in the influence of human activities on hydrological drought events in different tributaries 4 3 limitations and possible improvements to the tributary comparison method first the tributary comparison method and its research concepts have good applicability to multi tributary areas with obvious differences in the degree of human activities however this method is invalid for multi tributary areas with no obvious differences in human activities and those with no human activities secondly for multi tributary areas with more complex situations if it remains impossible to select a natural reference tributary or reference tributary after using the indicator system of this method fig 2 other indexes that can express the intensity of human activities can be correctly added to provide more complex selection finally by constructing an indicator system the selection process of a natural reference tributary is quantified this method provides ideas and frameworks for the determination and selection of a natural reference tributary this method and concept have strong applicability in the arid area of northwest china but when applied to other regions and watersheds these quantitative indicators need to be modified and improved appropriately according to the specific characteristics of the watershed itself and the characteristics of human activities for example concepts such as socio hydrological resilience eslamian et al 2019 can be introduced to further improve the accuracy and scientificity of the selection of a natural reference tributary 5 conclusions hydrological drought is one of the most important drought types once it occurs it has an immeasurable influence on the balance of regional water resource systems therefore quantifying the influence of human activities on hydrological drought is of great significance to sustainable water resource management in this paper a tributary comparison method was proposed to quantitatively evaluate the influence of human activities on hydrological drought events the empirical research was carried out in the upper reaches of shiyang river in the eastern area of qilian mountain and the following conclusions were obtained the temporal and spatial variation in the hydrological humidification and aridification characteristics of the tributaries in the upper reaches of shiyang river were different as was the influence degree of human activitie firstly at annual and seasonal scales the tributaries in the upper reaches of shiyang river changed from hydrological humidification to hydrological aridification from west to east from 1961 to 2016 on the whole the hydrological aridification of the h y river in the central area was the most serious but its hydrological drought duration and drought intensity showed a downward trend at a monthly scale secondly during the four seasons the x d river indicated hydrological humidification while the h y river presented hydrological aridification at the same time with h y river as the boundary human activities in the eastern tributaries were greater than those in the western tributaries the distribution of the drought duration and drought intensity of the tributaries from west to east showed a single peak in which the drought duration was the largest in z m river while the drought intensity was the largest in h y river according to the idea of the tributary comparison method x y river was quantitatively selected as the natural reference tributary from which the influence degree and direction of human activities in other tributaries on hydrological drought can be quantified on the whole human activities will reduce the hydrological drought duration and enhance hydrological drought intensity the empirical study further proved that the tributary comparison method has strong applicability in multi tributary areas with obvious differences in human activities and offers a useful supplement to existing research methods this method provides a more specific conceptualization and framework for determining a natural reference tributary according to the idea of this method tributaries that experience no human activities or are weakly affected by human activities can be selected and the tributary least affected by human activity can also be identified on this basis the influence degree and direction of human activities in other tributaries on hydrological drought can be quantified this method reduces the difficulty and subjectivity of existing methods in determining a natural reference tributary by constructing quantitative indicators however for multi tributary areas with more complex situations the adjustment and optimization of quantitative indicators can be combined with existing methods to accurately select and determine the reference tributary which is also a research area that needs to be improved in future scientific research credit authorship contribution statement qiaoqiao li conceptualization methodology formal

4817,the areal reduction factor arf is a concept widely used in many hydrological applications in this paper assuming a storm centered approach new empirical laws for arf estimation have been derived for the calabria region southern italy which are distinguished according to rainfall generation mechanisms typical of the mediterranean area specifically using data from the regional rain gauge network for the period 2002 2015 extreme events were separated into convective cells and frontal systems through a heuristic criterion to identify type dependent arfs significant differences were observed more intense convective precipitation events evidenced a more pronounced decrease in empirical arfs than storms related to frontal systems with reductions up to approximately 50 for the median values at about 2000 km2 results were also compared to some of the most widely used fixed area laws for arf evaluation overall these lead to larger values compared to storm centered arfs derived for the investigated region the proposed storm centered methodology can find important applications in providing reference limits of arf values to be properly used in the engineering design of hydraulic and hydrological infrastructures and appears particularly suited for effective and reliable flood defense in early warning systems keywords areal reduction factor rainfall fields analysis storm centered approaches 1 introduction the evaluation of an effective mean precipitation depth for a certain duration over a selected spatial domain i e a limited area or a catchment is crucial for many hydrological applications and engineering practices i storm event characterization for the design of hydraulic structures drainage systems flood control measures etc ii flood risk evaluations and iii rainfall threshold estimation over alert zones in early warning systems aimed at mitigating geo hydrological and hydraulic risk unfortunately rain gauge networks with long time series are often uneven or are not dense enough to allow for an appropriate characterization of spatial patterns and areal rainfall frequency thus effective areal average depths are commonly derived from point rainfall data using the areal reduction factor arf also known as depth area correction factor dacf wright et al 2014 an arf is generally defined as the ratio between the mean rainfall depth for a specified duration over a specific area and a point reference rainfall depth for the same duration areal estimation tends to be smaller than the maximum observed point precipitation depth as the domain area becomes larger so that the ratio ranges between 0 and 1 the usual graphical representation of arfs consists of a set of curves showing the variation with the areal extent for different rainfall durations the arf approach is crucial for many conventional methodologies particularly those suited for ungauged basins and over the last decades its estimation has received significant attention e g asquith and famiglietti 2000 bacchi and ranzi 1996 mineo et al 2018 omolayo 1993 pietersen et al 2015 rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 moreover the increased quality of quantitative precipitation estimates from radar and the longer time series that have become available have led to a renewed interest in recent years e g allen and degaetano 2005b durrans et al 2002 kim et al 2019 lombardo et al 2006 overeem et al 2010 pavlovic et al 2016 thorndahl et al 2019 wright et al 2014 a number of different methods to define or calculate this ratio have been proposed leading to arfs with different properties svensson and jones 2010 provide an outline of several issues affecting arf estimation which include factors relating to i characteristics of the rainfall itself generating mechanism spatial rainfall patterns seasonality duration ii physical characteristics of the investigated area geographical location morphology shape iii approaches to spatial interpolation and areal precipitation computation iv the source and or quality of data rain gauge or radar network density etc and v the methods used for arf calculation which can be grouped as analytical and empirical analytical approaches attempt to put arfs on a sound scientific basis and rely on assumptions of the spatial pattern isotropy and the statistical distribution of the rainfall process spatial correlation structure rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 crossing properties bacchi and ranzi 1996 scaling relationships in space and time de michele et al 2001 veneziano and langousis 2005 and asymptotic dependence structure le et al 2018 on the other hand empirical methods describe the observed relationships between point rainfall extremes and areal extremes over a range of areal extents and are generally data intensive and computationally laborious svensson and jones 2010 empirical arf estimations which are most frequently used can be further divided into two categories geographically fixed or fixed area approaches and storm centered approaches omolayo 1993 a fixed area methodology computes the ratio for a geographically fixed area and considers a representative point rainfall i e a representative location or an average of point values the point and the areal precipitation are usually assumed to have the same exceedance probability and are unlikely to be concurrent i e be produced from the same rainfall event or rainfall type two of the most widely used approaches the us weather bureau developed in the technical paper n 29 u s weather bureau 1958 often indicated as tp 29 and the flood studies report arfs national environmental research council nerc 1975 respectively derived in the united states and the united kingdom are both based on a fixed area formulation however they do not take into account the return period bell 1976 introduced the effect of the dependence from the return period in the nerc formulation the author found evidence for more rapidly decreasing arfs with an increasing return period in the intervening years several papers confirmed this behavior using a variety of methodologies allen and degaetano 2005a asquith and famiglietti 2000 le et al 2018 stewart 1989 an intercomparison of selected fixed area methods is proposed in pavlovic et al 2016 using high quality rainfall radar over the state of oklahoma and results indicated a significant uncertainty in arfs estimates regardless of the fixed area method used on the other hand in the storm centered approaches the point where the maximum rainfall depth is observed for a specific duration and the areal domain are not fixed the ratio as the name implies is calculated for an individual storm broadly speaking geographically fixed arfs can be considered as the result of averaging precipitation data while storm centered arfs represent the average of arf values for a large number of storms asquith and famiglietti 2000 noted that storm centered methodologies were not widely adopted partly because of difficult implementation of multi centered storms and the inevitable link with storm characteristics storm centered arfs are almost exclusively used in probable maximum precipitation pmp estimation or as a check to examine the validity of their fixed area counterparts wright et al 2014 omolayo 1993 pointed out that storm centered arfs should not be used for estimating areal rainfall of a particular frequency from point rainfall as they are unlikely to be concurrent conversely fixed area arfs are widely used in engineering design to convert design point rainfall depth or intensity into areal design rainfall depth or intensity with a given annual exceedance probability or return period moreover sivapalan and bloschl 1998 noted that geographically fixed formulations usually provide arf values which are greater than the storm centered arfs and resulting in a conservative arf evaluation this evidence although leading to possible overestimation of flood risk and overdesign of infrastructures that can be considered suitable in this kind of practice may have important implications in other contexts like water resources management to estimate available water supply and hydrometeorological early warning systems particularly while flooding is the result of highly complex meteorological systems wright et al 2014 the majority of conventional arfs often disregard important rainfall characteristics storm type season and generally are not intended to describe the spatial or temporal variability of design storms or the complex morphology of individual storms or to provide the basis for stochastic simulation myers 1980 consequently using inaccurate arf estimates can have serious drawbacks when for example areal rainfall thresholds are estimated in hydrometeorological early warning systems high values of arfs as those from geographically fixed methods provide rainfall thresholds that are rarely exceeded when compared to the areal estimates of actual storm events causing unwanted missed alarms these adverse impacts can be exacerbated when the spatiotemporal characteristics of extreme rainfall are complex and where multiple rainfall mechanisms occur over a specific area a number of studies have pointed to the effects of different synoptic weather types in the resulting arf estimates in southeast norway skaugen 1997 distinguished daily rainfall events into convective and frontal and concluded that the rate of decrease in arf curves for convective events is considerably greater than the rate for frontal events and becomes more pronounced for higher return periods i e for more extreme rainfall events using a more detailed classification huff and shipp 1969 found that the decay in spatial correlation is smaller in storms occurring in low pressure centers than at the fronts associated with mid latitude cyclones and that it is greatest in air mass storms wright et al 2014 examined storm centered arfs from a sample of five extreme storms in north carolina usa and compared them with arfs obtained from a larger population of storms with different characteristics they concluded that the storm type plays an important role in the variability of arf estimates more recently breinl et al 2020 estimated arfs varying in space and time using a fixed area method for austria and linked them to stratiform and convective rainfall processes that are the dominating rainfall processes in the region in this work a storm centered approach is applied to obtain a new arf formulation for a study area located in southern italy calabria region representing typical conditions of the mediterranean area specifically the effects on arf estimation for different precipitation systems occurring in the investigated area were determined dominating rainfall processes that trigger extreme precipitation events in southern italy are usually classified as convective systems short durations and small area and frontal or cyclonic phenomena larger area and longer durations or a combination of both e g lionello et al 2016 ulbrich et al 2012 to better understand the impacts of different rainfall patterns specific relationships of the arf as a function of rainfall duration and area have been evaluated for each storm category relying on an extensive storm events database the influence on arf of the spatial interpolation methods also accounting for elevation i e orographic effect was further assessed in addition a comparison with widely used arf relationships based on fixed area approaches was also carried out our focus is on hydrological applications concerning early warning systems ewss for which arf derivation can be crucial as errors in its estimation can contribute to render ewss less effective average areal rainfall over watersheds are often used as input in rainfall runoff transformation models to obtain the critical discharge values discharge thresholds in given cross sections for flood defence or to issue warnings moreover in the forecast and nowcast phases rainfall thresholds are widely assumed as the main elements of evaluation for the detection of potentially dangerous extremes events resulting in floods and landslides many regional scale warning systems for example rely on the use of rainfall thresholds for point and areal rainfall that apply over alert zones very often involving large areas 103 km2 a current practice for constructing areal rainfall thresholds uses fixed area arfs to convert estimates of extreme point rainfall derived from local intensity durationfrequency idf curves for fixed recurrence interval to a mean areal depth the paper is organized as follows section 2 concerns the case study the criteria for rainfall spatial interpolation storm identification and classification and the proposed methodology for storm centered arf derivation results of the comparison with fixed area arf expressions from literature and the derivation of new relationships differentiated for the investigated storm types are described in section 3 and discussed in section 4 section 5 summarizes the conclusions of the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the calabria region southern italy was selected as the study domain in the mediterranean area the western coast of the region is bordered by the tyrrhenian sea while the east and south coastlines face on the ionian sea the total area is approximately 15000 km2 and is predominantly hilly 49 2 of the area and mountainous 41 8 the climate is strongly influenced by the proximity of the sea but also by the orography a mediterranean climate is typical in the coastal zones however there are considerable differences in temperature and rainfall heights with the mountainous territory in interior areas which can reach elevations up to 2000 m the mean annual precipitation map over the entire region is approximately 1000 mm more than 80 occurring from october to april de luca and galasso 2018 federico et al 2010 the map varies from west to east and between mountains and lowlands along the west coast it averages approximately 900 mm and decreases to 700 mm in the northern part of the ionian coast map is usually greater than 1100 mm for elevations above of 500 m a s l with exceptions for some stations in the southern part of the region while it is usually less than 900 mm for valleys and for coastal areas this spatial variability is a consequence of the barrier effect of mountains on the perturbations that hit calabria from west to east indeed as pointed out in federico et al 2009 the majority of rainfall events are due to extra tropical cyclones generated close to the alps and in the western part of the mediterranean that impact the region from the tyrrhenian side instead cyclones from north africa and the balkans that mainly affect the ionian side are less frequent although often cause the most severe events the rainfall dataset used for this analysis is available from the website of the regional multi risk center http www cfd calabria it and consists of 20 min rain gauge data series until 2015 the rain gauge network comprises 155 rain gauges fig 1 homogeneously distributed over the region only rainfall data from 2002 were taken into consideration in order to have at least one working rain gauge per 150 km2 that means at least 100 stations were recording data at the same time over the investigated area 2 2 rainfall spatial interpolation to calculate areal precipitation point rainfalls from rain gauge network were interpolated generating precipitation fields on a regular grid with 1 km spatial resolution over the entire region although the spatial interpolation techniques have shown little influence on arfs allen and degaetano 2005a different approaches were here preliminarily compared for some extreme events occurred in the past specifically we considered both deterministic and geostatistical spatial interpolation techniques deterministic inverse distance weighting idw shepard 1968 the values at each arbitrary grid point are calculated with a weighted average of values available at rain stations with a weight that is inversely proportional to the square of the distance deterministic thiessen polygons tp thiessen 1911 the value of precipitation measured at a station is assigned to the whole area covered by the enclosing polygon from a thiessen polygon network however this very simple method provides unrealistic rainfall fields introducing discontinuous surfaces between adjacent polygons a modified inverse distance weighting midw chang et al 2005 the method adjusts the idw weights based on the difference in elevation between the ungauged grid point and the rain gauge ordinary kriging ok wackernagel 1995 it is a geostatistical approach and allows for obtaining indications about the variance of the estimation it is based on the definition of the spatial dependence structure of the data through the variogram function representing the correlation structure of the rainfall fields that must be estimated and modeled before the interpolation the variogram function is assumed to depend only on the distances between points geostatistical techniques present several advantages over simpler methods the ability to give unbiased predictions with minimum variance to take into account the spatial correlation between the data recorded at different rain gauges to provide a measure of prediction error kriging variance to accommodate secondary information in order to improve the interpolation results ly et al 2013 however geostatistical approaches like ok can be time consuming as different correlation structures are generally observed during different rainfall events on the other hand deterministic methods like idw tp and midw allow for shorter computation times and assigned weights are invariant being totally determined by the configuration of the rain gauge network thus they are recognized as more appropriate and practical for assessments involving a large number of interpolations moreover several studies concluded that geostatistical interpolation methods not including radar data as the secondary data source did not show significantly greater predictive skill for high resolution networks than simpler deterministic techniques and that particularly the idw method offers comparable performance for daily temporal resolutions or less kurtzman et al 2009 ly et al 2011 2013 yang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 fig 2 shows the cross validation results evaluated by considering cumulative rainfall height for some events regardless of interpolation method as expected observed rainfalls differ from the estimates but in general tp exhibits the worst performances it is also evident that the geostatistical approach provides no significant performance improvements compared to deterministic spatial interpolation methods and also including elevation adjustment in midw does not outperform idw similar considerations apply if areal precipitation estimates over specific spatial resolutions are compared for example the average rainfall estimates for square areas with 5 km and 45 km pixel size representative of small and large areas for two selected events reported in fig 3 reveal no marked differences between geostatistical and deterministic interpolation techniques in the following spatial interpolations rely on the idw method that appears to be a convenient alternative among those tested 2 3 storm identification and classification procedure storm identification was accomplished focusing on heavy rainfall events which were selected in space and time from the rain gauge network data series using a threshold criterion in this study it was assumed that a severe storm event occurs when the rain intensity observed in at least one rain gauge exceeds 16 mm 20 min i e 48 mm h see llasat 2001 indicated as i to distinguish independent storm events we assumed an inter arrival time also named inter event time or inter storm period of 6 h with rainfall intensity below a second threshold imin 5 mm 20 min as in wischmeier and smith 1978 based on the procedure described above 459 storm events were identified in the period between 2002 and 2015 the seasonal frequency histogram is illustrated in fig 4 a it can be observed that jja june july august and son september october november seasons with the 34 and 48 of the total number were most affected by intense events compared to djf december january february and mam march april may seasons with 7 and 11 of events respectively many studies focusing the attention on mediterranean extreme events e g lionello et al 2016 ulbrich et al 2012 have proposed the following classification for storm types cyclones or frontal systems fs this group comprises rainfall events with an extension of approximately 103 104 km2 willems 2001 in which cells or clusters of cells with a high intensity are often visible the duration of these events varies from several hours to several days moreover their motion extends hundreds of kilometers according to atmospheric circulation and ordinary extreme events i e more frequent and less severe on average are associated the maximum value for locally observed rainfall intensity usually ranges from 40 to 140 mm day rossi et al 2016 or greater these rainfall events are induced by the baroclinic cyclones the dominant phenomena in the mediterranean holton and hakim 1992 which occur when large masses of warm moist air meet cold air masses convective cells cc they comprise isolated storm cells which have a spatial extent of approximately 10 50 km2 waymire et al 1984 or clusters of cells compacted in circular shape or with a linear distribution squall line of up to 100 s of km2 these kinds of precipitation events are associated with convective movements of warm moist air masses towards the cold layers of the overlying atmosphere however they could be also supported by contributions of energy and water vapor from limited areas carried by a convergent flow of air masses the rainfall intensities observed from rain gauges can vary within a wide range typically 10 100 mm h and the total event duration spans from less than an hour to several hours depending on the number of active cells to be dissipated medicanes also known as tropical like cyclones tlc or hurricane like phenomena they are meteorological phenomena with tropical like characteristics a clear circular eyes surrounded by an eyewall and axisymmetric cloud pattern observed over the mediterranean sea the occurrence of medicanes has been described as less frequent than the other type of events on average 1 2 per year mainly between august and november and associated with vortices of great intensity and small scale reale and atlas 2001 these events usually generate cumulative rainfall up to 30 50 of map and cover areas reaching 100 1000 km2 in less than 24 h an accurate recognition of the distinct features of each category for the collected events can hardly be performed only from rain gauge data and requires the analysis of high resolution meteorological data dense marine observations and satellite images in the current study to address the identification of the physically different processes leading to storm events a heuristic criterion based on available information about hydrometeorological characteristics observed at rain gauges and visual inspection of rainfall patterns was adopted the 459 identified intense rainfall events were regrouped considering only convective cells cc and frontal systems fs as regards medicanes according to several surveys e g cavicchia and von storch 2011 davolio et al 2009 miglietta et al 2013 the website of universitat de les illes balears http meteorologia uib eu medicanes medicanes list html only three notable and well developed medicanes were associated to the study area during the study period 2002 2015 in consideration of their maximum value of cumulative rainfall and intensity duration and spatial extension these three events were encompassed into the fs class the classification was mostly based on the shape of the rainfall field and on its spatial extension as the main discriminants an event was classified as fs if it presents a spatial extension of at least 1000 km2 an event was flagged as cc if the associated rainfall field presented localized peaks surrounded by no precipitation areas berg et al 2013 thus including isolated storm cells or clusters of these a closely reexamination for each event was then performed considering additional investigations based on the observed maximum intensity point and areal duration orientation etc specifically 282 events were classified as fs while 177 events were flagged as cc fig 4b shows seasonal occurrence fs mainly occur in the son season 160 events i e 56 7 while the highest percentage of cc is observed in the jja season 95 events i e 53 6 these results confirm outcomes from other studies concerning the mediterranean area and particularly italy millán et al 2005 and borga et al 2007 observed that heavy rainfall events from frontal systems usually occur in autumn and borga et al 2007 davolio et al 2008 ruiz leo et al 2013 davini et al 2012 dayan et al 2015 found that convective phenomena are more frequent in summer table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of events for each class in terms of mean μ and standard deviation σ of duration d maximum extension amax cumulative precipitation p storm mean intensity i although significant uncertainty and subjectivity lie in the methodology used to distinguish precipitation types the resulting classification shows that the criteria used have been rather successful not only in separating small and large scale precipitations fields but also capable of discriminating some distinctive features of convective and frontal systems see greco et al 2020 for further details 2 4 storm centered arf derivation according to a storm centered approach an empirical arf estimation from individual storms as a function of rainfall duration and area is proposed the key feature of the storm centered approach is that the region where the areal rainfall is captured changes for each storm as well as the center point that corresponds to the rain gauge where the maximum rainfall height is observed for each storm in the catalog described in section 2 2 arf curves were derived according to two different procedures the first procedure consists of the following steps which were replicated for each storm j and duration d 1 3 6 12 and 24 h i the largest d hour point cumulated rainfall p j d recorded at a rain gauge and the corresponding pixel 1 km2 within the entire study area are identified ii the maximum average rainfall accumulation p j d a over an n pixel square area a centered on the pixel identified at the previous step was calculated as the mean of the of the rainfall values in the selected n n cells this process is repeated for n equal to 5 11 21 31 39 and 45 corresponding to areas of 25 121 441 961 1521 and 2025 km2 iii the d hour arf for the n pixel area a is estimated as the ratio 1 arf j d a p j d a p j d where p j d a is the maximum average rainfall of duration d over the area a corresponding to n n pixels for the j th storm the methodology assumes that for an individual event and for a specific duration the center of the n pixel square areas coincides with the pixel corresponding to the maximum point rainfall although this center is allowed to vary from duration to duration and from storm to storm this implies that the resulting arf is always 1 but does not necessarily decrease monotonically with area this approach will be indicated as arf j fc in the following where fc stands for fixed center to account more properly for multi center storms a variant of the fc scheme was applied at step ii the maximum of the average rainfall for an n pixel square area is identified through a moving window over the 15000 km2 region this implies that the point and the areal maximum rainfall heights can have different locations within the study domain the arf derived with this procedure hereinafter indicated as arf j mc where mc stands for moving center is expected to provide a slower decrease with the area than the corresponding arf j fc curves fig 5 provides an exemplification of the two tested approaches in defining the spatial domains for the identification of p j d a it should be pointed out that regardless of the spatial interpolation method the mean areal precipitation associated with pixels located nearby the coastline is affected by edge effects due to a lack of information beyond the spatial domain in these cases the average rainfall is calculated considering only pixels where a rainfall estimate is available and assumed valid for the whole n n area it is also worth to note that arfs are calculated considering precipitation estimates for square shaped areas that may not define the maximum precipitation volume within a given area value 2 5 fixed area arfs selected for comparison in order to more deeply explore the difference between storm centered and fixed area methods for the case study five arf geographically centered relationships from the literature were also employed in this work all the applied formulations depend on area and duration and are assumed to be invariant with the return period the selected relationships are widely used to calculate arfs in ungauged or poorly gauged contexts often in pluviometric regimes different from those used for their calibration mineo et al 2018 the first two approaches are well known formulations derived for the uk and usa and are extensively used in design practice the latter three were specifically estimated on different areas of the italian territory the corresponding equations with a expressed in km2 and d in h are

of events i e without discriminating fs and cc storm centered arf curves were estimated for each event following both the procedures namely arf fc and arf mc described in section 2 4 the arf curves derived from median values for the all storms dataset are shown in fig 6 in both cases for each investigated duration a monotonically decreasing pattern with the area is evident as expected arf values show a much sharper decrease for shorter durations this is related to the small areal extent of the short duration events on the contrary events with a long duration tend to be characterized by sustained rain rates over larger areas as expected for all the durations it is also evident that the initial median values of arf fc fig 6a recede more steeply for areas up to 100 km2 than arf mc curves fig 6b the decay of median arf fc at approximately 950 km2 exhibits values between 29 for d 1 h and 17 for d 24 h less than corresponding median arf mc this evidence is mainly due to the fact that the mc approach accounts also for the maximum value of areal precipitation located outside of the n pixel square area centered on the maximum point rainfall thus providing higher ratios than the fc approach from this perspective the mc methodology can be considered as more informative in the case of multicenter systems as it allows for capturing the presence of areal maxima occurring on distinct portions of the region for the same storm in addition edge effects can play a role particularly in arf fc estimation the mean areal precipitation centered on stations located at the boundary of the study domain can be significantly affected by errors to properly account for actual rainfall patterns during storm events the mc procedure which resulted in the most conservative curves i e less areal reductions was employed in the following analyses 3 2 comparison with fixed area arf equations graphical comparisons of box plots of the arf mc findings in the current study with the fixed area approaches introduced in section 2 5 are presented in fig 7 the box represents the interquartile range of evaluated arf mc values for the set of events with the line indicating the median value the whiskers extend from either side of the box to represent the 5th percentile for the bottom and the 95th percentile for the top of estimated storm centered arf values as expected results obtained using eagleson s expression and koutsoyiannis and xanthopoulos s formulation are consistently more conservative compared to empirical arf mc of the selected events while relationships derived for the italian territory lie closer to the observed storm centered arf values particularly for shorter durations arf mp values from moisello and papiri s equation are very close to the upper ends of the interquartile range for d 1 h and progressively move toward higher values with increasing durations in closer agreement with arf e and arf kx values for d 12 and 24 h for durations longer than 6 h and areas larger than 441 km2 arf p outperforms the other relationships besides the differences that are linked to the climatology of the calibrating regions the discrepancies between the two methodologies fixed area and storm centered can be attributed to how the two terms involved in the ratio estimation are calculated fixed area approaches rely on the equal frequency and not necessarily on the co occurrence of point and areal precipitations unlike storm centered methods storm centered arf considers at the denominator the heaviest point rainfall of a storm while fixed area approaches often consider an average of point measures over the investigated area in fig 7 for a fixed area of 121 km2 the difference between median values of storm centered arf mc and arf values from fixed area equations for a duration of 1 h ranges between 0 024 for arf mp and 0 361 with arf e for short durations the spread of the investigated fixed area relationships is noteworthy and tends to reduce for longer d differences between observed storm centered medians and fixed area equations are remarkable for larger areas e g varying between 0 283 and 0 489 for d 24 h and a 961 km2 with the highest difference corresponding to arf mp 3 3 storm centered arfs for different storm types considerable differences were found in the arf estimates considering rainfall events grouped according to storm type fig 8 shows box plots of storm centered arfs for fs and cc it is worthy to note that convective storms were associated with durations of a few hours and only a very limited number of events in the catalog exceeds a duration of 6 h as a consequence for larger durations arf values for fs events practically coincide with those already evaluated for the whole set of events the impact of storm selection criteria on subsequent arf estimation is evident arfs associated with cc are characterized by a sharper decreasing trend with area than those related to fs which are more conservative differences are also noticeable for small areas fig 8 confirming the evidence that neglecting important storm characteristics performs poorly in capturing the spatial pattern of rainfall of actual events for all the durations at about 100 km2 the median arf for fs storm type is already significantly larger than the median for cc events for example the 6 h median cc arf decays to approximately 20 less than the corresponding fs value moreover the spread of the arf distributions for the durations under consideration is almost symmetrical varying from small to large areas and the variability of arfs obtained from fs events is higher as evident from the box plot and whiskers particularly for larger areas this is because cc storms tend to produce high point accumulation and to reduce significantly average accumulation over increasing areas often including considerable portions with no rainfall on the other hand fs storms exhibit greater variability in the accumulated rainfall for large areas possibly related to the severity of the event and to its return period due to the relatively short record length of precipitation data available less than 15 years frequency considerations could not be adequately determined and this assessment is beyond the scope of the paper it is noteworthy that arfs never reach values greater than 1 and monotonically decrease with area revealing that the investigated events mostly develop around the location of storm maximum rainfall which is also valid for large scale frontal events and that tendency to multicell storm structure does not affect arfs fig 9 exemplifies the highly different spatial distribution of observed cumulated rainfall for two severe events included in the storm type classes fs and cc fig 9a refers to a fs event that hit the southeastern area of the region between october 30 and november 2 2015 hereinafter referred to as halloween event a large area was affected i e almost the entire region with relatively uniform rainfall occurring over a longer duration 39 rain gauges recorded daily rain higher than 100 mm reaching values of more than 300 mm in 24 h and 500 mm in 48 h fig 9b depicts a strongly convective event occurred on july 3 2006 on a restricted area around vibo valentia causing four deaths the exceptional nature of this storm is represented by the maximum rainfall of 202 6 mm in 6 h which corresponds to approximately 20 of the map for this site the selected events are typical examples of the two storm generating mechanisms and as expected arf values of the frontal halloween event are significantly higher than those of the convective vibo valentia event fig 10 shows how arf mc values obtained for the investigated events are positioned in the set of arf box plots produced by different events of the same type for larger durations and coarser spatial resolutions the halloween event presents arfs values are greater than the 75 percentile of the box plots thus highlighting the exceptional magnitude in terms of rainfall volume over a large area on the contrary the vibo valentia event characterized by a maximum cumulative point rainfall depth of 202 mm in 6 h shows arfs mainly less than the 25th percentile indicating a very heavy localized event moreover for both storm types fig 11 shows the number of times a specific rain gauge presented the maximum point value of cumulated rainfall over an investigated duration maximum point rainfall values for the cc storm type are mainly concentrated in mountainous areas thus corroborating the orographic effect concerning the fs storm type the distribution of maximum point values for each duration is mainly located in the southern part of the region with a non negligible number of peaks for short durations involving stations in the northern areas however the spatial distribution of point maximum rainfall ensures an adequate coverage in terms of events affecting different parts of the study domain and that the relationships proposed in the next section can be assumed valid over the entire region 3 4 derived storm centered relationships and performance measures new relationships for storm centered arf were developed in this study for the calabria region by fitting the median of the empirically estimated arf mc values for each storm type specifically the dependence of arf on area a km2 and duration d h is assessed through the following expression 7 arf d a 1 a γ d a c d which is similar to the formulation arf metal we tested different formulations not shown in deriving the new relationships and used the structure of eq 7 as it proved more suitable to reproduce the decay for large values of area the parameters γ a n d c depend on rainfall duration the first being expressed in km2 while the latter is dimensionless the constraints γ d 0 and c d 0 allow for obtaining arf mc 1 the dependence of γ d and c d on rainfall duration was determined by examining the parameters estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse for the following regression equations 8 γ d α γ d β γ 9 c d α c d β c fig 12 shows the fitted relationships along with the relative coefficients of determination r2 for each storm type clustering the estimated coefficients α γ β γ α c β c are also summarized in table 2 to quantify the goodness of fit for the relationships mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and bias were calculated for the residuals arf evaluated as differences between arfs values from the analytical curves and the median observed arfs 10 mae 1 n i 1 n arf i 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n arf i 2 12 bias 1 n i 1 n arf i the obtained performance metrics table 3 and the visual comparison with empirical storm centered arf values fig 13 reveal that the calibrated curves provide satisfactory arf estimates for the calabria region well representing also different storm types 4 discussion this study presents a storm centered approach to arf estimation and specific analytical formulations for the calabria region evaluated for the most common precipitation formation types that are characterized by distinctive rainfall spatial patterns a critical comparison with commonly used fixed area arfs has confirmed for the calabria region that these relationships are not suited to represent some properties of extreme rainfalls and tend to substantially larger arf values compared with storm centered formulations moreover most of the fixed area relationships here considered excluding mineo et al 2018 were derived for mean annual maxima corresponding to a 2 year return period but are often extrapolated in applications of up to 100 years return period values although several studies indicated a larger decrease in arf with increasing recurrence intervals the practice of using fixed area arf values can thus be considered as positively biased if compared to storm centered approach as stated in the introduction if it may be seen as precautionary although costly for design purposes the consequences in the definition of rainfall thresholds may lead to a reduction of the operational effectiveness of the ews in recognizing dangerous conditions based on the rainfall spatial distribution from rain gauge or numerical weather prediction nwp models similar considerations apply also to the determination of average rainfall input of hydrological models to obtain critical discharge values for flood warnings particularly for ungauged watersheds the adoption of less conservative thresholds i e high values may result in an increased number of missed alarms and associated cost of damage and victims that outweigh possible advantages deriving from keeping low the number of false alarms for these purposes areal rainfall estimation could be more efficiently obtained by using storm centered approaches expressly derived for the specific region with the rationale to obtain a better representation of actual rainfall patterns new approaches to fixed area arf estimates were recently introduced by bennett et al 2016 that proposed the intensity frequency duration area ifda methodology to explicitly consider regional variations in extreme rainfall the ifda approach directly incorporates area into site specific idf relationships but relying on precipitation of equal recurrence intervals appears to be more suited for design purposes nevertheless those authors recognize that the method deserves further investigations before being efficiently incorporated into design estimates and pose some limitations being allowed to provide values greater than 1 it has been also argued that the lack of representativeness of fixed area arfs is partly due to formulations that mix rainfall observations from different storms and different storm types wright et al 2014 the present study shows that storm centered arfs in calabria vary substantially and that storm type plays a significant role being able to distinguish two different behaviours storm events from cc tend to be spatially concentrated and of shorter durations than events related to fs whose arfs decay less rapidly with increasing area and show a greater variance for an area of 100 km2 which is representative of typical small watersheds in the region storm centered curves calibrated for fs events provide arf values at least 29 less than arf e and reach a reduction of approximately 50 at 1000 km2 corresponding to larger basins and close to the dimension of alert zones of the region as expected the cc relationship provides lower arf values at 100 km2 the reduction across the range of durations compared to arf e is nearly 45 for durations comparable to common watershed concentration times in calabria 1 3 h spatial and seasonal arf variations are only partially captured by considering distinctive storm types it is evident that challenges still exist in areal precipitation estimation in this perspective it is important to recognize the relevant degree of uncertainty that affects storm based arf relationships a notable variability resulted in arf estimates of given area and duration fig 7 besides the precipitation generating mechanism several other factors varying from storm to storm play a role like station density data quality location seasonality storm shape etc furthermore regardless of the spatial interpolation technique used the use of ground gauge rainfall has a number of disadvantages mostly relevant for complex terrains sideris et al 2020 because of the irregular station density bárdossy and pegram 2018 rainfall interpolation can introduce a relevant source of inaccuracies due to inherent spatial smoothing edge effects problems related to orography the shape of the domain considered for areal rainfall estimation etc the increasing availability of long term radar rainfall observations will likely progressively shift toward more robust arf estimation 5 conclusions this study presents new expressions for arf estimation based on a storm centered approach explicitly derived taking into account different precipitation systems occurring over the investigated area calabria region southern italy two distinct types of events were considered according to rainfall spatio temporal characteristics namely convective cells cc and frontal systems fs empirical arf values were derived from a rain gauge network dataset regarding the period 2002 2015 relating concurrent rain fields to pixel precipitation for individual storms a comparison with five fixed area expressions proposed in previous studies showed a considerably higher rate of spatial decay of rainfall for the observed events implying larger arf values when using fixed area formulations especially for long durations and for large areas the arf equations proposed in this study as a function of the rainfall area and durations were specifically determined for each category of storm type and resulted in good performance for representation of arf values in the study region specifically arfs associated with cc usually generate storms that are spatially concentrated and short in duration and are characterized by a sharper decreasing trend with the area than those related to fs which tend to affect larger storm areas these findings confirm the evidence that traditional geographically centered methods perform poorly in capturing the rainfall spatial pattern of actual events and support the necessity to incorporate storm characteristics into arf estimation for specific purposes there are some applications and primarily those concerning threshold definition for early warnings in which i prudent areal rainfall evaluation is recommended and ii the transposition of arf relationships that reflect different meteorological and topographical characteristics as well as the use of constant areal reduction factors across wide areas are inappropriate in this context storm centered approaches expressly derived for the specific region appear to be better suited for areal rainfall estimation in order to obtain a more appropriate representation of actual rainfall patterns the presented storm centered methodology and the derived arf formulations for different storm types will thus complement existing fixed area approaches can provide reference limits of arf values to be properly used in the engineering design of hydraulic and hydrological infrastructures and being more adherent to observed arfs in storm events appears to be particularly suited for a more effective and reliable thresholds definition for flood defense through early warning systems

4817,the areal reduction factor arf is a concept widely used in many hydrological applications in this paper assuming a storm centered approach new empirical laws for arf estimation have been derived for the calabria region southern italy which are distinguished according to rainfall generation mechanisms typical of the mediterranean area specifically using data from the regional rain gauge network for the period 2002 2015 extreme events were separated into convective cells and frontal systems through a heuristic criterion to identify type dependent arfs significant differences were observed more intense convective precipitation events evidenced a more pronounced decrease in empirical arfs than storms related to frontal systems with reductions up to approximately 50 for the median values at about 2000 km2 results were also compared to some of the most widely used fixed area laws for arf evaluation overall these lead to larger values compared to storm centered arfs derived for the investigated region the proposed storm centered methodology can find important applications in providing reference limits of arf values to be properly used in the engineering design of hydraulic and hydrological infrastructures and appears particularly suited for effective and reliable flood defense in early warning systems keywords areal reduction factor rainfall fields analysis storm centered approaches 1 introduction the evaluation of an effective mean precipitation depth for a certain duration over a selected spatial domain i e a limited area or a catchment is crucial for many hydrological applications and engineering practices i storm event characterization for the design of hydraulic structures drainage systems flood control measures etc ii flood risk evaluations and iii rainfall threshold estimation over alert zones in early warning systems aimed at mitigating geo hydrological and hydraulic risk unfortunately rain gauge networks with long time series are often uneven or are not dense enough to allow for an appropriate characterization of spatial patterns and areal rainfall frequency thus effective areal average depths are commonly derived from point rainfall data using the areal reduction factor arf also known as depth area correction factor dacf wright et al 2014 an arf is generally defined as the ratio between the mean rainfall depth for a specified duration over a specific area and a point reference rainfall depth for the same duration areal estimation tends to be smaller than the maximum observed point precipitation depth as the domain area becomes larger so that the ratio ranges between 0 and 1 the usual graphical representation of arfs consists of a set of curves showing the variation with the areal extent for different rainfall durations the arf approach is crucial for many conventional methodologies particularly those suited for ungauged basins and over the last decades its estimation has received significant

quality of quantitative precipitation estimates from radar and the longer time series that have become available have led to a renewed interest in recent years e g allen and degaetano 2005b durrans et

proposed leading to arfs with different properties svensson and jones 2010 provide an outline of several issues affecting arf estimation which include factors relating to i characteristics of the rainfall itself generating mechanism spatial rainfall patterns seasonality duration ii physical characteristics of the investigated area geographical location morphology shape iii approaches to spatial interpolation and areal precipitation computation iv the source and or quality of data rain gauge or radar network density etc and v the methods used for arf calculation which can be grouped as analytical and empirical analytical approaches attempt to put arfs on a sound scientific basis and rely on assumptions of the spatial pattern isotropy and the statistical distribution of the

et al 2001 veneziano and langousis 2005 and asymptotic dependence structure le et al 2018 on the other hand empirical methods describe the observed relationships between point rainfall extremes and areal extremes over a range of areal extents and are generally data intensive and computationally laborious svensson and jones 2010 empirical arf estimations which are most frequently used can be further divided into two categories geographically fixed or fixed area approaches and storm centered approaches omolayo 1993 a fixed area methodology computes the ratio for a geographically fixed area and considers a representative point rainfall i e a representative location or an average of point values the point and the areal precipitation are usually assumed to have the same exceedance probability and are unlikely to be concurrent i e be produced from the same rainfall event or rainfall type two of the most widely used approaches the us weather bureau developed in the technical paper n 29 u s weather bureau 1958 often indicated as tp 29 and the flood studies report arfs national environmental research council nerc 1975 respectively derived in the united states and the united kingdom are both based on a fixed area formulation however they do not take into account the return period bell 1976 introduced the effect of the dependence from the return period in the nerc formulation the author found evidence for more rapidly decreasing arfs with an increasing return period in the intervening years several papers confirmed this behavior using a variety of methodologies allen and degaetano 2005a asquith and famiglietti 2000 le et al 2018 stewart 1989 an intercomparison of selected fixed area methods is proposed in pavlovic et al 2016 using high quality rainfall radar over the state of oklahoma and results indicated a significant uncertainty in arfs estimates regardless of the fixed area method used on the other hand in the storm centered approaches the point where the maximum rainfall depth is observed for a specific duration and the areal domain are not fixed the ratio as the name implies is calculated for an individual storm broadly speaking geographically fixed arfs can be considered as the result of averaging precipitation data while storm centered arfs represent the average of arf values for a large number of storms asquith and famiglietti 2000 noted that storm centered methodologies were not widely adopted partly because of difficult implementation of multi centered storms and the inevitable link with storm characteristics storm centered arfs are almost exclusively used in probable maximum precipitation pmp estimation or as a check to examine the validity of their fixed area counterparts wright et al 2014 omolayo 1993 pointed out that storm centered arfs should not be used for estimating areal rainfall of a particular frequency from point rainfall as they are unlikely to be concurrent conversely fixed area arfs are widely used in engineering design to convert design point rainfall depth or intensity into areal design rainfall depth or intensity with a given annual exceedance probability or return period moreover sivapalan and bloschl 1998 noted that geographically fixed formulations usually provide arf values which are greater than the storm centered arfs and resulting in a conservative arf evaluation this evidence although leading to possible overestimation of flood risk and overdesign of infrastructures that can be considered suitable in this kind of practice may have important implications in other contexts like water resources management to estimate available water supply and hydrometeorological early warning systems particularly while flooding is the result of highly complex meteorological systems wright et al 2014 the majority of conventional arfs often disregard important rainfall characteristics storm type season and generally are not intended to describe the spatial or temporal variability of design storms or the complex morphology of individual storms or to provide the basis for stochastic simulation myers 1980 consequently using inaccurate arf estimates can have serious drawbacks when for example areal rainfall thresholds are estimated in hydrometeorological early warning systems high values of arfs as those from geographically fixed methods provide rainfall thresholds that are rarely exceeded when compared to the areal estimates of actual storm events causing unwanted missed alarms these adverse impacts can be exacerbated when the spatiotemporal characteristics of extreme rainfall are complex and where multiple rainfall mechanisms occur over a specific area a number of studies have pointed to the effects of different synoptic weather types in the resulting arf estimates in southeast norway skaugen 1997 distinguished daily rainfall events into convective and frontal and concluded that the rate of decrease in arf curves for convective events is considerably greater than the rate for frontal events and becomes more pronounced for higher return periods i e for more extreme rainfall events using a more detailed classification huff and shipp 1969 found that the decay in spatial correlation is smaller in storms occurring in low pressure centers than at the fronts associated with mid latitude cyclones and that it is greatest in air mass storms wright et al 2014 examined storm centered arfs from a sample of five extreme storms in north carolina usa and compared them with arfs obtained from a larger population of storms with different characteristics they concluded that the storm type plays an important role in the variability of arf estimates more recently breinl et al 2020 estimated arfs varying in space and time using a fixed area method for austria and linked them to stratiform and convective rainfall processes that are the dominating rainfall processes in the region in this work a storm centered approach is applied to obtain a new arf formulation for a study area located in southern italy calabria region representing typical conditions of the mediterranean area specifically the effects on arf estimation for different precipitation systems occurring in the investigated area were determined dominating rainfall processes that trigger extreme precipitation events in southern italy are usually classified as convective systems short durations and small area and frontal or cyclonic phenomena larger area and longer durations or a combination of both e g lionello et al 2016 ulbrich et al 2012 to better understand the impacts of different rainfall patterns specific relationships of the arf as a function of rainfall duration and area have been evaluated for each storm category relying on an extensive storm events database the influence on arf of the spatial interpolation methods also accounting for elevation i e orographic effect was further assessed in addition a comparison with widely used arf relationships based on fixed area approaches was also carried out our focus is on hydrological applications concerning early warning systems ewss for which arf derivation can be crucial as errors in its estimation can contribute to render ewss less effective average areal rainfall over watersheds are often used as input in rainfall runoff transformation models to obtain the critical discharge values discharge thresholds in given cross sections for flood defence or to issue warnings moreover in the forecast and nowcast phases rainfall thresholds are widely assumed as the main elements of evaluation for the detection of potentially dangerous extremes events resulting in floods and landslides many regional scale warning systems for example rely on the use of rainfall thresholds for point and areal rainfall that apply over alert zones very often involving large areas 103 km2 a current practice for constructing areal rainfall thresholds uses fixed area arfs to convert estimates of extreme point rainfall derived from local intensity durationfrequency idf curves for fixed recurrence interval to a mean areal depth the paper is organized as follows section 2 concerns the case study the criteria for rainfall spatial interpolation storm identification and classification and the proposed methodology for storm centered arf derivation results of the comparison with fixed area arf expressions from literature and the derivation of new relationships differentiated for the investigated storm types are described in section 3 and discussed in section 4 section 5 summarizes the conclusions of the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the calabria region southern italy was selected as the study domain in the mediterranean area the western coast of the region is bordered by the tyrrhenian sea while the east and south coastlines face on the ionian sea the total area is approximately 15000 km2 and is predominantly hilly 49 2 of the area and mountainous 41 8 the climate is strongly influenced by the proximity of the sea but also by the orography a mediterranean climate is typical in the coastal zones however there are considerable differences in temperature and rainfall heights with the mountainous territory in interior areas which can reach elevations up to 2000 m the mean annual precipitation map over the entire region is approximately 1000 mm more than 80 occurring from october to april de luca and galasso 2018 federico et al 2010 the map varies from west to east and between mountains and lowlands along the west coast it averages approximately 900 mm and decreases to 700 mm in the northern part of the ionian coast map is usually greater than 1100 mm for elevations above of 500 m a s l with exceptions for some stations in the southern part of the region while it is usually less than 900 mm for valleys and for coastal areas this spatial variability is a consequence of the barrier effect of mountains on the perturbations that hit calabria from west to east indeed as pointed out in federico et al 2009 the majority of rainfall events are due to extra tropical cyclones generated close to the alps and in the western part of the mediterranean that impact the region from the tyrrhenian side instead cyclones from north africa and the balkans that mainly affect the ionian side are less frequent although often cause the most severe events the rainfall dataset used for this analysis is available from the website of the regional multi risk center http www cfd calabria it and consists of 20 min rain gauge data series until 2015 the rain gauge network comprises 155 rain gauges fig 1 homogeneously distributed over the region only rainfall data from 2002 were taken into consideration in order to have at least one working rain gauge per 150 km2 that means at least 100 stations were recording data at the same time over the investigated area 2 2 rainfall spatial interpolation to calculate areal precipitation point rainfalls from rain gauge network were interpolated generating precipitation fields on a regular grid with 1 km spatial resolution over the entire region although the spatial interpolation techniques have shown little influence on arfs allen and degaetano 2005a different approaches were here preliminarily compared for some extreme events occurred in the past specifically we considered both deterministic and geostatistical spatial interpolation techniques deterministic inverse distance weighting idw shepard 1968 the values at each arbitrary grid point are calculated with a weighted average of values available at rain stations with a weight that is inversely proportional to the square of the distance deterministic thiessen polygons tp thiessen 1911 the value of precipitation measured at a station is assigned to the whole area covered by the enclosing polygon from a thiessen polygon network however this very simple method provides unrealistic rainfall fields introducing discontinuous surfaces between adjacent polygons a modified inverse distance weighting midw chang et al 2005 the method adjusts the idw weights based on the difference in elevation between the ungauged grid point and the rain gauge ordinary kriging ok wackernagel 1995 it is a geostatistical approach and allows for obtaining indications about the variance of the estimation it is based on the definition of the spatial dependence structure of the data through the variogram function representing the correlation structure of the rainfall fields that must be estimated and modeled before the interpolation the variogram function is assumed to depend only on the distances between points geostatistical techniques present several advantages over simpler methods the ability to give unbiased predictions with minimum variance to take into account the spatial correlation between the data recorded at different rain gauges to provide a measure of prediction error kriging variance to accommodate secondary information in order to improve the interpolation results ly et al 2013 however geostatistical approaches like ok can be time consuming as different correlation structures are generally observed during different rainfall events on the other hand deterministic methods like idw tp and midw allow for shorter computation times and assigned weights are invariant being totally determined by the configuration of the rain gauge network thus they are recognized as more appropriate and practical for assessments involving a large number of interpolations moreover several studies concluded that geostatistical interpolation methods not including radar data as the secondary data source did not show significantly greater predictive skill for high resolution networks than simpler deterministic techniques and that particularly the idw method offers comparable performance for daily temporal resolutions or less kurtzman et al 2009 ly et al 2011 2013 yang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 fig 2 shows the cross validation results evaluated by considering cumulative rainfall height for some events regardless of interpolation method as expected observed rainfalls differ from the estimates but in general tp exhibits the worst performances it is also evident that the geostatistical approach provides no significant performance improvements compared to deterministic spatial interpolation methods and also including elevation adjustment in midw does not outperform idw similar considerations apply if areal precipitation estimates over specific spatial resolutions are compared for example the average rainfall estimates for square areas with 5 km and 45 km pixel size representative of small and large areas for two selected events reported in fig 3 reveal no marked differences between geostatistical and deterministic interpolation techniques in the following spatial interpolations rely on the idw method that appears to be a convenient alternative among those tested 2 3 storm identification and classification procedure storm identification was accomplished focusing on heavy rainfall events which were selected in space and time from the rain gauge network data series using a threshold criterion in this study it was assumed that a severe storm event occurs when the rain intensity observed in at least one rain gauge exceeds 16 mm 20 min i e 48 mm h see llasat 2001 indicated as i to distinguish independent storm events we assumed an inter arrival time also named inter event time or inter storm period of 6 h with rainfall intensity below a second threshold imin 5 mm 20 min as in wischmeier and smith 1978 based on the procedure described above 459 storm events were identified in the period between 2002 and 2015 the seasonal frequency histogram is illustrated in fig 4 a it can be observed that jja june july august and son september october november seasons with the 34 and 48 of the total number were most affected by intense events compared to djf december january february and mam march april may seasons with 7 and 11 of events respectively many studies focusing the attention on mediterranean extreme events e g lionello et al 2016 ulbrich et al 2012 have proposed the following classification for storm types cyclones or frontal systems fs this group comprises rainfall events with an extension of approximately 103 104 km2 willems 2001 in which cells or clusters of cells with a high intensity are often visible the duration of these events varies from several hours to several days moreover their motion extends hundreds of kilometers according to atmospheric circulation and ordinary extreme events i e more frequent and less severe on average are associated the maximum value for locally observed rainfall intensity usually ranges from 40 to 140 mm day rossi et al 2016 or greater these rainfall events are induced by the baroclinic cyclones the dominant phenomena in the mediterranean holton and hakim 1992 which occur when large masses of warm moist air meet cold air masses convective cells cc they comprise isolated storm cells which have a spatial extent of approximately 10 50 km2 waymire et al 1984 or clusters of cells compacted in circular shape or with a linear distribution squall line of up to 100 s of km2 these kinds of precipitation events are associated with convective movements of warm moist air masses towards the cold layers of the overlying atmosphere however they could be also supported by contributions of energy and water vapor from limited areas carried by a convergent flow of air masses the rainfall intensities observed from rain gauges can vary within a wide range typically 10 100 mm h and the total event duration spans from less than an hour to several hours depending on the number of active cells to be dissipated medicanes also known as tropical like cyclones tlc or hurricane like phenomena they are meteorological phenomena with tropical like characteristics a clear circular eyes surrounded by an eyewall and axisymmetric cloud pattern observed over the mediterranean sea the occurrence of medicanes has been described as less frequent than the other type of events on average 1 2 per year mainly between august and november and associated with vortices of great intensity and small scale reale and atlas 2001 these events usually generate cumulative rainfall up to 30 50 of map and cover areas reaching 100 1000 km2 in less than 24 h an accurate recognition of the distinct features of each category for the collected events can hardly be performed only from rain gauge data and requires the analysis of high resolution meteorological data dense marine observations and satellite images in the current study to address the identification of the physically different processes leading to storm events a heuristic criterion based on available information about hydrometeorological characteristics observed at rain gauges and visual inspection of rainfall patterns was adopted the 459 identified intense rainfall events were regrouped considering only convective cells cc and frontal systems fs as regards medicanes according to several surveys e g cavicchia and von storch 2011 davolio et al 2009 miglietta et al 2013 the website of universitat de les illes balears http meteorologia uib eu medicanes medicanes list html only three notable and well developed medicanes were associated to the study area during the study period 2002 2015 in consideration of their maximum value of cumulative rainfall and intensity duration and spatial extension these three events were encompassed into the fs class the classification was mostly based on the shape of the rainfall field and on its spatial extension as the main discriminants an event was classified as fs if it presents a spatial extension of at least 1000 km2 an event was flagged as cc if the associated rainfall field presented localized peaks surrounded by no precipitation areas berg et al 2013 thus including isolated storm cells or clusters of these a closely reexamination for each event was then performed considering additional investigations based on the observed maximum intensity point and areal duration orientation etc specifically 282 events were classified as fs while 177 events were flagged as cc fig 4b shows seasonal occurrence fs mainly occur in the son season 160 events i e 56 7 while the highest percentage of cc is observed in the jja season 95 events i e 53 6 these results confirm outcomes from other studies concerning the mediterranean area and particularly italy millán et al 2005 and borga et al 2007 observed that heavy rainfall events from frontal systems usually occur in autumn and borga et al 2007 davolio et al 2008 ruiz leo et al 2013 davini et al 2012 dayan et al 2015 found that convective phenomena are more frequent in summer table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of events for each class in terms of mean μ and standard deviation σ of duration d maximum extension amax cumulative precipitation p storm mean intensity i although significant uncertainty and subjectivity lie in the methodology used to distinguish precipitation types the resulting classification shows that the criteria used have been rather successful not only in separating small and large scale precipitations fields but also capable of discriminating some distinctive features of convective and frontal systems see greco et al 2020 for further details 2 4 storm centered arf derivation according to a storm centered approach an empirical arf estimation from individual storms as a function of rainfall duration and area is proposed the key feature of the storm centered approach is that the region where the areal rainfall is captured changes for each storm as well as the center point that corresponds to the rain gauge where the maximum rainfall height is observed for each storm in the catalog described in section 2 2 arf curves were derived according to two different procedures the first procedure consists of the following steps which were replicated for each storm j and duration d 1 3 6 12 and 24 h i the largest d hour point cumulated rainfall p j d recorded at a rain gauge and the corresponding pixel 1 km2 within the entire study area are identified ii the maximum average rainfall accumulation p j d a over an n pixel square area a centered on the pixel identified at the previous step was calculated as the mean of the of the rainfall values in the selected n n cells this process is repeated for n equal to 5 11 21 31 39 and 45 corresponding to areas of 25 121 441 961 1521 and 2025 km2 iii the d hour arf for the n pixel area a is estimated as the ratio 1 arf j d a p j d a p j d where p j d a is the maximum average rainfall of duration d over the area a corresponding to n n pixels for the j th storm the methodology assumes that for an individual event and for a specific duration the center of the n pixel square areas coincides with the pixel corresponding to the maximum point rainfall although this center is allowed to vary from duration to duration and from storm to storm this implies that the resulting arf is always 1 but does not necessarily decrease monotonically with area this approach will be indicated as arf j fc in the following where fc stands for fixed center to account more properly for multi center storms a variant of the fc scheme was applied at step ii the maximum of the average rainfall for an n pixel square area is identified through a moving window over the 15000 km2 region this implies that the point and the areal maximum rainfall heights can have different locations within the study domain the arf derived with this procedure hereinafter indicated as arf j mc where mc stands for moving center is expected to provide a slower decrease with the area than the corresponding arf j fc curves fig 5 provides an exemplification of the two tested approaches in defining the spatial domains for the identification of p j d a it should be pointed out that regardless of the spatial interpolation method the mean areal precipitation associated with pixels located nearby the coastline is affected by edge effects due to a lack of information beyond the spatial domain in these cases the average rainfall is calculated considering only pixels where a rainfall estimate is available and assumed valid for the whole n n area it is also worth to note that arfs are calculated considering precipitation estimates for square shaped areas that may not define the maximum precipitation volume within a given area value 2 5 fixed area arfs selected for comparison in order to more deeply explore the difference between storm centered and fixed area methods for the case study five arf geographically centered relationships from the literature were also employed in this work all the applied formulations depend on area and duration and are assumed to be invariant with the return period the selected relationships are widely used to calculate arfs in ungauged or poorly gauged contexts often in pluviometric regimes different from those used for their calibration mineo et al 2018 the first two approaches are well known formulations derived for the uk and usa and are extensively used in design practice the latter three were specifically estimated on different areas of the italian territory the corresponding equations with a expressed in km2 and d in h are 1 koutsoyiannis and xanthopoulos 1999 re examined the arfs evaluated in the flood studies report national environmental research council nerc 1975 in the uk by fitting the following expression

of events i e without discriminating fs and cc storm centered arf curves were estimated for each event following both the procedures namely arf fc and arf mc described in section 2 4 the arf curves derived from median values for the all storms dataset are shown in fig 6 in both cases for each investigated duration a monotonically decreasing pattern with the area is evident as expected arf values show a much sharper decrease for shorter durations this is related to the small areal extent of the short duration events on the contrary events with a long duration tend to be characterized by sustained rain rates over larger areas as expected for all the durations it is also evident that the initial median values of arf fc fig 6a recede more steeply for areas up to 100 km2 than arf mc curves fig 6b the decay of median arf fc at approximately 950 km2 exhibits values between 29 for d 1 h and 17 for d 24 h less than corresponding median arf mc this evidence is mainly due to the fact that the mc approach accounts also for the maximum value of areal precipitation located outside of the n pixel square area centered on the maximum point rainfall thus providing higher ratios than the fc approach from this perspective the mc methodology can be considered as more informative in the case of multicenter systems as it allows for capturing the presence of areal maxima occurring on distinct portions of the region for the same storm in addition edge effects can play a role particularly in arf fc estimation the mean areal precipitation centered on stations located at the boundary of the study domain can be significantly affected by errors to properly account for actual rainfall patterns during storm events the mc procedure which resulted in the most conservative curves i e less areal reductions was employed in the following analyses 3 2 comparison with fixed area arf equations graphical comparisons of box plots of the arf mc findings in the current study with the fixed area approaches introduced in section 2 5 are presented in fig 7 the box represents the interquartile range of evaluated arf mc values for the set of events with the line indicating the median value the whiskers extend from either side of the box to represent the 5th percentile for the bottom and the 95th percentile for the top of estimated storm centered arf values as expected results obtained using eagleson s expression and koutsoyiannis and xanthopoulos s formulation are consistently more conservative compared to empirical arf mc of the selected events while relationships derived for the italian territory lie closer to the observed storm centered arf values particularly for shorter durations arf mp values from moisello and papiri s equation are very close to the upper ends of the interquartile range for d 1 h and progressively move toward higher values with increasing durations in closer agreement with arf e and arf kx values for d 12 and 24 h for durations longer than 6 h and areas larger than 441 km2 arf p outperforms the other relationships besides the differences that are linked to the climatology of the calibrating regions the discrepancies between the two methodologies fixed area and storm centered can be attributed to how the two terms involved in the ratio estimation are calculated fixed area approaches rely on the equal frequency and not necessarily on the co occurrence of point and areal precipitations unlike storm centered methods storm centered arf considers at the denominator the heaviest point rainfall of a storm while fixed area approaches often consider an average of point measures over the investigated area in fig 7 for a fixed area of 121 km2 the difference between median values of storm centered arf mc and arf values from fixed area equations for a duration of 1 h ranges between 0 024 for arf mp and 0 361 with arf e for short durations the spread of the investigated fixed area relationships is noteworthy and tends to reduce for longer d differences between observed storm centered medians and fixed area equations are remarkable for larger areas e g varying between 0 283 and 0 489 for d 24 h and a 961 km2 with the highest difference corresponding to arf mp 3 3 storm centered arfs for different storm types considerable differences were found in the arf estimates considering rainfall events grouped according to storm type fig 8 shows box plots of storm centered arfs for fs and cc it is worthy to note that convective storms were associated with durations of a few hours and only a very limited number of events in the catalog exceeds a duration of 6 h as a consequence for larger durations arf values for fs events practically coincide with those already evaluated for the whole set of events the impact of storm selection criteria on subsequent arf estimation is evident arfs associated with cc are characterized by a sharper decreasing trend with area than those related to fs which are more conservative differences are also noticeable for small areas fig 8 confirming the evidence that neglecting important storm characteristics performs poorly in capturing the spatial pattern of rainfall of actual events for all the durations at about 100 km2 the median arf for fs storm type is already significantly larger than the median for cc events for example the 6 h median cc arf decays to approximately 20 less than the corresponding fs value moreover the spread of the arf distributions for the durations under consideration is almost symmetrical varying from small to large areas and the variability of arfs obtained from fs events is higher as evident from the box plot and whiskers particularly for larger areas this is because cc storms tend to produce high point accumulation and to reduce significantly average accumulation over increasing areas often including considerable portions with no rainfall on the other hand fs storms exhibit greater variability in the accumulated rainfall for large areas possibly related to the severity of the event and to its return period due to the relatively short record length of precipitation data available less than 15 years frequency considerations could not be adequately determined and this assessment is beyond the scope of the paper it is noteworthy that arfs never reach values greater than 1 and monotonically decrease with area revealing that the investigated events mostly develop around the location of storm maximum rainfall which is also valid for large scale frontal events and that tendency to multicell storm structure does not affect arfs fig 9 exemplifies the highly different spatial distribution of observed cumulated rainfall for two severe events included in the storm type classes fs and cc fig 9a refers to a fs event that hit the southeastern area of the region between october 30 and november 2 2015 hereinafter referred to as halloween event a large area was affected i e almost the entire region with relatively uniform rainfall occurring over a longer duration 39 rain gauges recorded daily rain higher than 100 mm reaching values of more than 300 mm in 24 h and 500 mm in 48 h fig 9b depicts a strongly convective event occurred on july 3 2006 on a restricted area around vibo valentia causing four deaths the exceptional nature of this storm is represented by the maximum rainfall of 202 6 mm in 6 h which corresponds to approximately 20 of the map for this site the selected events are typical examples of the two storm generating mechanisms and as expected arf values of the frontal halloween event are significantly higher than those of the convective vibo valentia event fig 10 shows how arf mc values obtained for the investigated events are positioned in the set of arf box plots produced by different events of the same type for larger durations and coarser spatial resolutions the halloween event presents arfs values are greater than the 75 percentile of the box plots thus highlighting the exceptional magnitude in terms of rainfall volume over a large area on the contrary the vibo valentia event characterized by a maximum cumulative point rainfall depth of 202 mm in 6 h shows arfs mainly less than the 25th percentile indicating a very heavy localized event moreover for both storm types fig 11 shows the number of times a specific rain gauge presented the maximum point value of cumulated rainfall over an investigated duration maximum point rainfall values for the cc storm type are mainly concentrated in mountainous areas thus corroborating the orographic effect concerning the fs storm type the distribution of maximum point values for each duration is mainly located in the southern part of the region with a non negligible number of peaks for short durations involving stations in the northern areas however the spatial distribution of point maximum rainfall ensures an adequate coverage in terms of events affecting different parts of the study domain and that the relationships proposed in the next section can be assumed valid over the entire region 3 4 derived storm centered relationships and performance measures new relationships for storm centered arf were developed in this study for the calabria region by fitting the median of the empirically estimated arf mc values for each storm type specifically the dependence of arf on area a km2 and duration d h is assessed through the following expression 7 arf d a 1 a γ d a c d which is similar to the formulation arf metal we tested different formulations not shown in deriving the new relationships and used the structure of eq 7 as it proved more suitable to reproduce the decay for large values of area the parameters γ a n d c depend on rainfall duration the first being expressed in km2 while the latter is dimensionless the constraints γ d 0 and c d 0 allow for obtaining arf mc 1 the dependence of γ d and c d on rainfall duration was determined by examining the parameters estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse for the following regression equations 8 γ d α γ d β γ 9 c d α c d β c fig 12 shows the fitted relationships along with the relative coefficients of determination r2 for each storm type clustering the estimated coefficients α γ β γ α c β c are also summarized in table 2 to quantify the goodness of fit for the relationships mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and bias were calculated for the residuals arf evaluated as differences between arfs values from the analytical curves and the median observed arfs 10 mae 1 n i 1 n arf i 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n arf i 2 12 bias 1 n i 1 n arf i the obtained performance metrics table 3 and the visual comparison with empirical storm centered arf values fig 13 reveal that the calibrated curves provide satisfactory arf estimates for the calabria region well representing also different storm types 4 discussion this study presents a storm centered approach to arf estimation and specific analytical formulations for the calabria region evaluated for the most common precipitation formation types that are characterized by distinctive rainfall spatial patterns a critical comparison with commonly used fixed area arfs has confirmed for the calabria region that these relationships are not suited to represent some properties of extreme rainfalls and tend to substantially larger arf values compared with storm centered formulations moreover most of the fixed area relationships here considered excluding mineo et al 2018 were derived for mean annual maxima corresponding to a 2 year return period but are often extrapolated in applications of up to 100 years return period values although several studies indicated a larger decrease in arf with increasing recurrence intervals the practice of using fixed area arf values can thus be considered as positively biased if compared to storm centered approach as stated in the introduction if it may be seen as precautionary although costly for design purposes the consequences in the definition of rainfall thresholds may lead to a reduction of the operational effectiveness of the ews in recognizing dangerous conditions based on the rainfall spatial distribution from rain gauge or numerical weather prediction nwp models similar considerations apply also to the determination of average rainfall input of hydrological models to obtain critical discharge values for flood warnings particularly for ungauged watersheds the adoption of less conservative thresholds i e high values may result in an increased number of missed alarms and associated cost of damage and victims that outweigh possible advantages deriving from keeping low the number of false alarms for these purposes areal rainfall estimation could be more efficiently obtained by using storm centered approaches expressly derived for the specific region with the rationale to obtain a better representation of actual rainfall patterns new approaches to fixed area arf estimates were recently introduced by bennett et al 2016 that proposed the intensity frequency duration area ifda methodology to explicitly consider regional variations in extreme rainfall the ifda approach directly incorporates area into site specific idf relationships but relying on precipitation of equal recurrence intervals appears to be more suited for design purposes nevertheless those authors recognize that the method deserves further investigations before being efficiently incorporated into design estimates and pose some limitations being allowed to provide values greater than 1 it has been also argued that the lack of representativeness of fixed area arfs is partly due to formulations that mix rainfall observations from different storms and different storm types wright et al 2014 the present study shows that storm centered arfs in calabria vary substantially and that storm type plays a significant role being able to distinguish two different behaviours storm events from cc tend to be spatially concentrated and of shorter durations than events related to fs whose arfs decay less rapidly with increasing area and show a greater variance for an area of 100 km2 which is representative of typical small watersheds in the region storm centered curves calibrated for fs events provide arf values at least 29 less than arf e and reach a reduction of approximately 50 at 1000 km2 corresponding to larger basins and close to the dimension of alert zones of the region as expected the cc relationship provides lower arf values at 100 km2 the reduction across the range of durations compared to arf e is nearly 45 for durations comparable to common watershed concentration times in calabria 1 3 h spatial and seasonal arf variations are only partially captured by considering distinctive storm types it is evident that challenges still exist in areal precipitation estimation in this perspective it is important to recognize the relevant degree of uncertainty that affects storm based arf relationships a notable variability resulted in arf estimates of given area and duration fig 7 besides the precipitation generating mechanism several other factors varying from storm to storm play a role like station density data quality location seasonality storm shape etc furthermore regardless of the spatial interpolation technique used the use of ground gauge rainfall has a number of disadvantages mostly relevant for complex terrains sideris et al 2020 because of the irregular station density bárdossy and pegram 2018 rainfall interpolation can introduce a relevant source of inaccuracies due to inherent spatial smoothing edge effects problems related to orography the shape of the domain considered for areal rainfall estimation etc the increasing availability of long term radar rainfall observations will likely progressively shift toward more robust arf estimation 5 conclusions this study presents new expressions for arf estimation based on a storm centered approach explicitly derived taking into account different precipitation systems occurring over the investigated area calabria region southern italy two distinct types of events were considered according to rainfall spatio temporal characteristics namely convective cells cc and frontal systems fs empirical arf values were derived from a rain gauge network dataset regarding the period 2002 2015 relating concurrent rain fields to pixel precipitation for individual storms a comparison with five fixed area expressions proposed in previous studies showed a considerably higher rate of spatial decay of rainfall for the observed events implying larger arf values when using fixed area formulations especially for long durations and for large areas the arf equations proposed in this study as a function of the rainfall area and durations were specifically determined for each category of storm type and resulted in good performance for representation of arf values in the study region specifically arfs associated with cc usually generate storms that are spatially concentrated and short in duration and are characterized by a sharper decreasing trend with the area than those related to fs which tend to affect larger storm areas these findings confirm the evidence that traditional geographically centered methods perform poorly in capturing the rainfall spatial pattern of actual events and support the necessity to incorporate storm characteristics into arf estimation for specific purposes there are some applications and primarily those concerning threshold definition for early warnings in which i prudent areal rainfall evaluation is recommended and ii the transposition of arf relationships that reflect different meteorological and topographical characteristics as well as the use of constant areal reduction factors across wide areas are inappropriate in this context storm centered approaches expressly derived for the specific region appear to be better suited for areal rainfall estimation in order to obtain a more appropriate representation of actual rainfall patterns the presented storm centered methodology and the derived arf formulations for different storm types will thus complement existing fixed area approaches can provide reference limits of arf values to be properly used in the engineering design of hydraulic and hydrological infrastructures and being more adherent to observed arfs in storm events appears to be particularly suited for a more effective and reliable thresholds definition for flood defense through early warning systems

4818,the self organizing map som can supportively organize complex datasets such as highly dimensional flood inundation maps nevertheless som may produce distinct patterns after being trained with identical samples or may not converge in clustering highly dimensional datasets which causes usability concerns and prevents its applications from a broader spectrum motivated by such concerns two training strategies s1 and s2 were proposed to configure som based on a large number of highly dimensional flood inundation maps associated with two basins located in southern taiwan s1 focused mainly on the weights adjustments in the ordering stage while s2 would methodically balance the ordering and convergence activities on the weights adjustments the effectiveness and suitability of s1 and s2 were inspected in detail by using coverage ratio flip detector and five clustering indices based on their configured topological maps in the two basins the clustering results showed that the flip detector and the coverage ratio could visibly and objectively examine the suitability of the configured topological map it was noticed that the influences of the ordering and convergence stages upon both training strategies for building som could significantly affect the coverage ratio as well as flip condition comparing the som topological maps implemented separately with each strategy s2 strategy has a lower probability of causing a flipping situation and takes far fewer iterations to train a model of the same network size which indicates s2 is more efficient and effective than s1 in

fascinating ai clustering tool for classifying highly dimensional datasets where input vectors are projected onto a low dimensional grid map space in an ordered fashion so that more similar vectors will be associated with nodes closer to the grid whereas less similar vectors will be situated in nodes farther away from the grid kohonen 1990 som can project input vectors on prototypes of a two dimensional regular grid to form a topological map that can be effectively utilized to explore the properties of the data it has been broadly used in a wide variety of fields ranging from industrial

2014 2018 2019 notwithstanding som s wide applications configuring a suitable som for highly dimensional datasets such as a regional flood inundation map is a formidablechallenge there are three common problems of configuring som which are the twisting of the topological map non convergence and the determination of the number of neurons aoki et al 2009 breard and hamel 2018 besides it could produce dissimilar patterns in clustering even being trained by identical training datasets with the same parameters zhang et al 2018 these issues do cause usability concerns and prevent its applications from a broader spectrum motivated by these practical concerns we systematically explore the effectiveness and efficiency of two training strategies for configuring som as well as assess the suitability of the constructed som topological map using various evaluation indicators we construct the topological map and analyze the clustering results of spatial temporal distribution of regional flooding in two basins in tainan city taiwan we then present the results and evaluate the quality of the constructed topological maps encountered during model construction as well as provide further explanation of the proposed strategies assessed by evaluation indicators conclusions and suggestions are then given which consolidates study results and main findings of this study and suggests possible research directions for future works 2 methods this study proposes two training strategies to conquer three common problems i e the twisting of the topological map non convergence and the determination of the number of neurons commonly encountered when configuring som based on a number of regional inundation maps for two river basins and explore the efficiency and suitability of the constructed som topological maps using various evaluation indicators fig 1 shows the framework of the study which contains data collection som model construction topological maps exploration of results assessment on the effectiveness of training strategies and identification of the best network and training strategy the methodology proposed to build som and evaluation indicators are described in the following sections 2 1 building som som is commonly configured into a two dimensional lattice that represents a grid like structure among neurons nodes to form a topological map for tackling clustering problems and data exploration each neuron contains a vector with the same dimensionality of the input vector the neurons are subsequently adjusted during the training phase based on competitive learning where training is entirely data driven and the neurons of the map compete with each other alhoniemi et al 1999 in every iteration each training sample input vector is allocated to the neuron to which it best matches denoted as the best match neuron bmn where the representative central vector of the matched neuron is updated so that the bmn moves closer to the input vector besides the weights of bmn s neighboring neurons are methodically updated so that the surrounding neurons around the bmn are systematically adapted towards the training sample after completing the training process the final topology would show that the neurons on the grid become ordered where similar neurons stay closer to each other in contrast less similar neurons remain farther away from each other as a result training samples are distributed across the constructed topological map in a similarity preserving way a fundamental question is whether the topological map can well organize and meaningfully interpret the data after training to the best of our knowledge the clustering results are subject to variability in initial conditions convergence to local minima and sampling complexity chang et al 2014 mzelikahle et al 2017 we have experienced three significant problems when building the som topology including the twisting map the selection of the number of epochs and the optimal network size we propose a methodology to automatically configure som for establishing a meaningful topological map for a large number of highly dimensional flood inundation maps 2 2 mathematical formulation a brief mathematical formulation of som which is based mainly on kohonen 1990 is shown as follows the input vector x has n dimensions eq 1 each neuron is represented by an n dimensional weight vector eq 2 the best match neuron bmn winning neuron selection is shown in eq 3 the topological neighborhood i e the neighborhood of a neuron in a topological space in the kth iteration is shown in eq 4 the weight adjustment amount δwj of the jth neuron in the adjacent area is shown in eqs 4 7 where eq 6 defines a time varying neighborhood function around a winning neuron the final weight is expressed as eq 8 1 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n t 2 w j w j 1 w j 2 w j 3 w jn t j 1 2 3 m 3 q x min j x w j 2 j 1 2 3 m 4 r k r 0 exp k τ 1 k 0 1 2 5 τ 1 1000 l o g r 0 6 h q j k exp r j r q 2 2 r 2 k k 0 1 2 7 δ w j η k h q j k x k w j k k 0 1 2 8 w j k 1 w j k δ w j k 0 1 2 where m is the number of neurons wj is the weight vector of the jth neuron r k represents the topological neighborhood in the k th iteration r 0 is the initial radius preset to cover the size of all neurons so that all neurons will fall within the range corrected by the neighborhood function τ 1 is a constant value calculated by eq 5 h q j k denotes the amplitude of the topological neighborhood centered with the j th neuron r j and r q are the position of the j th node and the q th winner node in the topological map respectively and ɳ is the learning rate 2 3 weight adjustment process the initial weights of som are randomly generated where the relationship between neurons is of extreme disorder thus the weight adjustment is the crucial process to configure a suitable topological map the weight adjustment process is usually executed in two stages i e ordering and convergence where the ordering stage involves a rough training while the convergence stage is responsible for a finer training kohonen 1990 in the ordering stage the weight updating process will adjust the neurons of som so that the topological ordering of the weight vectors takes place in the convergence stage the weight updating process will adjust those neurons close to the best match neuron for fine tuning the topological map the number of iterations and the learning rates of these two stages would significantly affect the formation of the topology because the initial weights are in extreme disorder the learning rate and neighborhood radius should be set as large values in the first stage to make the topological map gradually present the order we have to tune the neurons so that neighboring neurons have similar weight vectors the initial learning rate ɳ0 usually starts at 0 1 and then the learning rate η k decreases gradually as the number of iterations k increases as shown in eq 9 τ2 is set as 1000 9 η k η 0 exp k τ 2 k 0 1 2 in the second stage smaller learning rate and neighborhood radius are favorable for fine tuning the topological map ɳ0 is changed to 0 01 and the range of neighborhood radius is also reduced so that only a few neurons staying close to the winner neuron would be fine tuned we notice that the initial learning rate in the second convergence stage is much smaller than that of the first ordering stage which is because the first stage is a rough training while the second stage is responsible for a finer training after a number of updating ex 1000 epochs the exponential decay formulas shown in the neighborhood function eq 6 will reduce to a small value thus the weight adjustment eqs 7 and 8 would be effected only a few neighboring neurons around the winning neuron the numbers of epochs for these two stages are crucial and must be set at first because such numbers could significantly influence the convergence as well as the suitability of the constructed topology 2 4 two training strategies two training strategies s1 s2 are proposed to investigate their effectiveness and suitability of som for constructing the flood inundation topologies of two river basins in tainan city taiwan the first strategy denoted as s1 intends to keep training the som network until no apparent changes occur in the weights of the neurons i e coverage change in the 500th iteration is less than 5 in the ordering stage the training is transferred to the convergence stage where the training stops if no obvious changes in the weight values can be made i e coverage change in the 500th iteration is less than 5 the second strategy denoted as s2 is to keep training the network until the coverage ratio of weights reaches 50 in the ordering stage then the weight adjustment process is transferred to the convergence stage and keeps on until no obvious changes in the weight values can be made i e coverage change in the 500th iteration is less than 5 we notice that s1 is implemented mainly in the ordering stage so that the weights adjustments in this stage will be conducted almost all the way to the end less than 5 in contrast s2 would simultaneously balance the ordering and convergence activities in the weight updating process for roughly configuring the topological map and then fine tuning the topological map 2 5 clustering evaluation indicators a variety of quality measures developed over the years attempt to quantify how well the underlying data can be represented by a topological map of som som can be trained with different map sizes to present the deviations of the data and thus identifying the optimal size of som is crucial and the first thing to decide if the map size is too small it will lose some important features that should be detected nevertheless if the map size is too big the differences between neurons clusters could be too little a number of clustering evaluation indicators were proposed in the literature which provided insights into the selection of a map size using quantitative indicators for instance srinivas et al 2008 showed different clustering indicators for finding the optimal number of clusters in flood frequency analyses and farsadnia et al 2014 combined som with three clustering methods to find the optimal number of clusters through different clustering indicators tian et al 2014 introduced the k nearest neighbor algorithm to improve self organizing maps for anomaly detection using healthy training data from experiments on cooling fan bearings nevertheless to the best of our knowledge there is no general theoretical principle to determine the optimum map size and there is no standard evaluation indicator created to evaluate the proximity between som neurons thus the suitability of the formulated som topology should be explored by using different clustering evaluation indicators here we compare quality measures by using five indicators to investigate the convergence and clustering effect distinguishable the classification of the som model the principles and physical meanings of the five indicators are explained as follows i the partition coefficient pc index proposed by bezdek 1981 shown in eq 10 presents the amount of overlap between clusters its membership degree is determined by the distance between the sample and the center of each cluster the closer the sample to the cluster center is the greater the membership degree is and vice versa therefore the larger the pc value is the closer the samples are to cluster centers which leads to a more obvious grouping effect the membership degrees of each sample corresponding to different clusters is calculated by eq 10 μ in eq 11 can be set as any value where the general setting is 2 the total membership degree should be 1 10 p c 1 n i 1 c j 1 n u ij 2 11 u ij 1 k 1 c x j c i x j c k 2 μ 1 i 1 c u ij 1 where u ij is the membership degree c i is the cluster center x j is the sample n is the input dimension the number of grids in the inundation map c is the number of clusters ii the classification entropy ce is an index of the entropy principle which calculated the fuzziness of the cluster partition farsadnia et al 2014 when the probability of the event is more uniform the entropy value is more unpredictable and larger the ce value is calculated by eq 12 the smaller the entropy is the smaller the ce is 12 c e 1 n i 1 c j 1 n u ij l o g u ij iii the xie beni xb indicator proposed by xie and beni 1991 shown in eq 13 is a function of the data set and the centroids of the clusters where the numerator is the deviation of the sample from the cluster center while the denominator is the smallest distance between different groups a smaller value of the xb index implies a small intra group deviation whereas a large distance between groups 13 x b i 1 c j 1 n u ij μ x j c i 2 n min i k c i c k 2 iv the davies bouldin index dbi proposed by davies and bouldin 1979 shown in eq 14 is a metric built to express the performance of clustering tools and to determine the number of clusters the dbi is similar to the xb indicator the smaller the dbi is the smaller the distance difference between the samples in the group is the larger the distance between the centers of different groups is the more distinguishable the classification is 14 d b i 1 c i 1 c max i j c i c j c i c j where c is the average distance from all samples of this cluster to the center of this cluster v the silhouette coefficient is created as a measure of cluster density and separation rousseeuw 1987 which can evaluate a particular clustering of a dataset and compare it with other clusterings of the same dataset layton et al 2013 the sc can be leveraged by measuring the correlation between the authorship distance method and the true authorship evaluating the quality of the distance method however we show that the sc can be severely affected by outliers the silhouette coefficient sc is shown in eq 15 s i ranges between 1 and 1 when the distance between groups is close there is no much difference between the value of a i and b i therefore the value of s i tends to 0 when the average distance between the samples in the cluster and the cluster center a is greater than the center distance between the cluster center and the other clusters b s is a negative value which means the classification is less suitable therefore the larger the sc value is the better the classification is 15 s i b i a i max a i b i s c 1 n i 1 n s i where a i is the average distance between the i th sample and the rest of the samples in the same cluster and b i is the minimum value from the set of average distance between the i th sample to all samples in other clusters when the distance within the cluster is small and the distance between the groups is large the sc value is closer to 1 thus the larger the sc value is the better the classification is 3 study areas and materials tainan city in southwestern taiwan covers an area of about 2200 square kilometers and its terrain comprises mainly alluvial plains the city is located in the south of the tropic of cancer and belongs to the subtropical climate rainfall is usually induced by monsoons and typhoons and more than 80 of the annual rainfall concentrates in the wet season june november typhoon induced torrential rain or thunderstorms are prone to flooding luermen creek and the yenshui creek in tainan city are our study areas fig 2 and their basic information is given in table 1 because there is no real monitoring inundation map we used simulation datasets maps as the data sources for training the som models the simulation datasets of the taiwan flooding potential map were obtained from the water resources planning and research institute water resources agency taiwan the sobek wl delft hydraulics 1995 which had been used to simulate regional flood inundation maps in taiwan ex doong et al 2016 yang et al 2018 was used to simulate the flooding in the study areas to provide flood simulation datasets twenty seven scenarios were designed by a combination of three rainfall duration 6 12 and 24 h with nine rainfall amounts 100 800 mm under various recurrences i e 2 up to 500 year of hydrological conditions a total of 27 rainfall events i e 3 durations 9 rainfall amounts constituted by various durations and rainfall amounts table 2 were used to simulate the corresponding flood inundation maps for both basins the grid size of the inundation map is 40 40 m2 we do not consider upland areas that have never been inundated i e less than 10 mm inundation depth under any condition so as to reduce the area as well as the input dimension for making computation less time consuming the luermen creek has 783 datasets 783 hourly inundation maps of 27 simulation scenarios and each dataset has 10 128 input dimensions grid s depths the yenshui creek has 1539 datasets 1539 hourly inundation maps of 27 simulation scenarios and each dataset has 54 751 input dimensions for each basin its datasets will be used as input vectors to configure a topological map as output thus the som training algorithm is applied to cluster a large number of highly dimensional flood inundation maps input vectors and configure a visible topological map in both basins individually 4 results and discussion this study proposes two strategies s1 s2 to configure som for each study watershed and assesses their effectiveness and convergence of the constructed topological maps both strategies use the same set of initial weights for training thereby we explore their effects on topology convergence and investigate their flipping situations the influences of the two strategies on building the som models are explored in detail through coverage ratio flip detector and five evaluation indicators of the clustering results the coverage ratio represents the coverage of the maximum and minimum weights of neurons as a percentage of the training data for example if the maximum and minimum weights of som are 0 8 and 0 2 respectively the coverage ratio is 60 these measures allow us to assess the adequacy of the configured topological map quantitatively 4 1 explore the flip detector for the configured som fig 3 presents a 4 4 topology 16 neurons of the configured som based on the 783 hourly inundation maps of the luermen creek basin by using the s2 training strategy where each circle represents one neuron the number in parentheses represents the neuron number and the number without parentheses represents the weight value of the neuron we notice that the weight value of a neuron is the mean inundation depth of all the grids in the study area ex 10 128 grids in the luermen as shown the weight value gradually increases from the lower right corner neuron 16 0 001 m to the upper left corner neuron 1 0 503 m a green arrow indicates the weight value increases in a correct direction where the neighboring relationship is maintained correctly while a red arrow represents the neighboring relationship is incorrect flip where the weight value increases in an incorrect direction if that is the case the topology needs to be retrained until the weight distribution is correct in this study a flip is identified if any two neighboring neuron values violate the rule of a correct direction and their difference is significantly large where a difference above 5 indicates a severe flipping while below 5 means an acceptable slight inversion as shown in fig 3 the pair of neurons 2 and 6 violate the rule red arrow but the difference between their weights is only about 0 8 indicating this is not a serious flipping situation and the difference in weight is within the acceptable range fig 4 shows the configured 4 4 som topological map using the 783 hourly inundation maps as shown the topological map includes 16 neurons and each neuron represents an average inundation map of the inundation depths at 10 128 grids for the basin where each grid denotes an area of 40 40 m2 the average inundation map is obtained by computing the average of the number of regional inundation maps clustered in a neuron as shown neuron 1 has the largest regional inundation depths where its average inundation depth is 0 503 m and a large portion of the grids have high inundation depth even high than 2 m in some grids in contrast neuron 16 has the smallest regional inundation depths where the average inundation depth is only 0 001 m and inundation does not occur in most of the grids the configured map has a suitable topological relationship where the regional inundation depths gradually increase from the lower right corner to the upper left corner 4 2 explore the efficiency of two training strategies both training strategies s1 s2 are used to construct the 3 3 4 4 and 5 5 topological models for the luermen creek basin and the yenshui creek basin the size and convergence of each constructed model are then assessed the training epoch iteration for both training strategies is shown in table 3 it appears it always takes fewer iterations to train a model of the same size by s2 than by s1 which clearly indicates s2 is more efficient than s1 in training the som models we notice that the s1 strategy is based mainly on the ordering phase which uses a large learning rate and neighborhood radius so that it is much easier to have a turn over condition and result in a flipping phenomenon table 4 presents the summarized results of the number of epochs and coverage ratio of som with three different sizes upon both training strategies s1 s2 in two phases p1 ordering phase p2 convergence phase for both basins the results indicate that 1 both strategies obtain similar final p2 coverage ratios in the three som models for the two basins 2 there is no much improvement increasing the coverage between p1 and p2 in respect of the s1 strategy while there is the significant improvement between p1 and p2 in respect of the s2 strategy 3 the number of epochs is much greater by using the s1 strategy than the s2 strategy and 4 the total training epoch of the s1 strategy is much longer larger than that of the s2 strategy in all the cases thus the s2 strategy is recommended which trains the network in the ordering phase until the coverage ratio of weights reaches 50 and then transfers the training to the convergence phase and continues training the weights until no obvious changes in the weight values are made taking the 3 3 som model for the luermen creek basin as an example fig 5 shows the cumulative ratio distribution at various numbers of iterations by both strategies s1 s2 the color dots are the neurons of the 3 3 som the nine vertical color lines are the average weight values of nine neurons corresponding to the cumulative rate curve the blue curve representing the cumulated average inundation depth of the counted datasets and the cumulative ratio of datasets from zero inundation depth to the maximum inundation depth it can be found that the neuron distribution of the two methods increases expands with the number of iterations ex 500 runs 5000 runs of s1 and 500 runs 3000 runs of s2 the initial weights concentrate in a small range ex from 0 55 to 0 72 in fig 5a and then expand ex from 0 25 to 0 98 in fig 5b gradually the neurons with maximum and minimum cumulative rates in the training process fall on the two neurons farthest from the diagonal neurons 3 and 7 respectively where no other neurons surpass these two neurons and their coverage ratios are 73 0 25 0 98 for s1 and 74 0 24 0 98 for s2 we notice that s1 requires 5000 runs iterations to train while s2 only takes 3000 runs the results indicate both strategies could provide almost the same coverage ratios and s2 could reach the coverage ratio in a much shorter time than s1 thus s2 is much more efficient and effective than s1 4 3 examine the suitability of configured soms by evaluation indicators next we explore the suitability of various sizes of som for clustering large numbers of inundation maps in the two study watersheds and assess their convergence the five clustering evaluation indicators are implemented to evaluate the proximity neighborhood relationship between som neurons and investigate the convergence of the constructed som during the training process by both training strategies as shown in fig 6 the values of pc ce and sc gradually increase while the values of xb and dbi decrease as the number of iterations increases these results indicate that both training strategies can gradually distinguish separate the cluster centers during the training process which also means the accuracy coverage ratio of classification gradually improves increases we notice that ce values are too small to be meaningful therefore ce is considered unsuitable for identifying the classification of flood inundation maps the value of sc does not change significantly along the training process mainly because the sc indicator could not clearly identify whether the differences are within the group or between the groups due to som s neighboring relationship thus the sc cannot be considered as an effective indicator for clustering the high dimensional flood inundation maps we find the value of xb as well as dbi is relatively large at the initial iteration number 500 times due to the randomly generated initial weights where the weights between neurons are commonly very small therefore the initial cluster centers neuron weights are very close to each other and the classification between samples is not clear enough resulting in considerably large values of xb and dbi after thousands of iterations the values of xb and dbi decrease significantly which means these indicators are valid here we further explore the suitability of various sizes of som based on coverage ratios table 4 presents the coverage ratios corresponding to three som sizes where a gradual increase in coverage ratio can be found as the map size increases we notice that the coverage ratio corresponding to the 3 3 map size is relatively small less than 77 and thus the 3 3 map size is not considered applicable taking the yenshui creek basin as an example fig 7 shows the cumulative ratio for both of luermen creek basin and the yenshui creek it indicates that the coverage ratio corresponding to 5 5 map is slightly higher than that of the 4 4 map 82 vs 81 for yenshui and 83 vs 79 for luermen nevertheless the cumulative ratios of the neurons in 5 5 models stay close together and its standard deviation std at 2000 iterations is small 0 198 for yenshui and 0 200 for luermen which suggests the model might encounter over fitting in contrast the 4 4 model has a larger std 0 229 for yenshui and 0 218 for luermen and more dispersed cumulative ratios at 2500 iterations thus we consider the 4 4 topography is the best choice for both basins fig 8 presents the constructed 4 4 topological maps of both basins where a continuously gradual weight change along the diagonal neurons and the nice proximity among neighboring neurons could be visibly identified som with 4 4 neurons provided the best mixture of classification presentation and track neuron numbers in clusters producing a typology supporting our analysis the benefits of this topological map are the ability to meaningfully categorize a large number of observed or simulated inundation maps as well as the visibility of the topological map to easily and visibly identify the best match inundation map according to the estimated and or monitored hydrological condition 5 conclusions som has been used extensively as an analytical and visualization tool in exploratory data analysis the constructed topology could be visualized to give an insight into the topographic relationships of high dimensional flood inundation maps thus som could be a very promising application to regional flood warning systems if it is integrated with other machine learning models based on regional rainfall patterns such as the way how som was applied in the previous studies chang et al 2014 2018 nevertheless som may produce different patterns and or non convergence after training and thus causes usability concerns in this study we propose two training strategies s1 and s2 to train som models using a large number of highly dimensional flood inundation maps of two basins located in southern taiwan and investigate their effectiveness and suitability of the constructed som models we notice that s1 focuses mainly on the weights adjustments in the ordering stage to almost all the way to the end while s2 would simultaneously balance the ordering and convergence activities on the weights adjustments we examine the coverage ratio and the flipping of the topological map when the som model is applied to a large number of high dimensional regional flood inundation maps the main contributions of the proposed training strategies and evaluation indicators of the constructed som are four fold and summarized as follows 1 comparing the two training strategies for constructing som models for the two study basins s2 has a lower probability of causing a flipping situation and takes much less training time fewer iterations to build a model of the same size than by s1 which clearly indicates s2 is more efficient than s1 in training the som models 2 the analytical results of the three constructed topological maps i e 3 3 4 4 and 5 5 for both basins indicate that the coverage ratio of the 3 3 map size is relatively low whereas the 5 5 map size has some neurons with very similar accumulation ratios and result in an over fitting situation the 4 4 map size has a larger variation and well dispersed cumulative coverage ratios thus we consider the 4 4 topography is the best choice for both basins 3 the flip detector implemented in this study could visibly present and exam the suitability of the configured topological map the computed coverage ratio along the training process could clearly indicate the suitability of the som map sizes and objectively assess the suitability of the topological map for a study area 4 among the five indicators pc xb and dbi can clearly express the training process as effective classification the ce values are too small to compare and the sc cannot well display the som map for the highly dimensional regional flood inundation applications thus ce and sc would not be recommended as effective evaluation indicators for assessing som s classification of regional flood maps in short pc xb and dbi can show the training of som is effective in categorization however ce and sc could not show effectiveness som is capable of clustering and data mining and is widely used in various hydrological processes configuring som could face issues of twisting topological maps and non convergence which prevents som applications from a broader spectrum this study explores two weight adjustment strategies s1 s2 in detail and the results suggest s2 strategy which methodically balances the ordering and convergence activities on weight adjustment could more effectively and efficiently construct a suitable topological map than the s1 strategy thus s2 training strategy could be applied to effectively clustering a large number of highly dimensional datasets

4818,the self organizing map som can supportively organize complex datasets such as highly dimensional flood inundation maps nevertheless som may produce distinct patterns after being trained with identical samples or may not converge in clustering highly dimensional datasets which causes usability concerns and prevents its applications from a broader spectrum motivated by such concerns two training strategies s1 and s2 were proposed to configure som based on a large number of highly dimensional flood inundation maps associated with two basins located in southern taiwan s1 focused mainly on the weights adjustments in the ordering stage while s2 would methodically balance the ordering and convergence activities on the weights adjustments the effectiveness and suitability of s1 and s2 were inspected in detail by using coverage ratio flip detector and five clustering indices based on their configured topological maps in the two basins the clustering results showed that the flip detector and the coverage ratio could visibly and objectively examine the suitability of the configured topological map it was noticed that the influences of the ordering and convergence stages upon both training strategies for building som could significantly affect the coverage ratio as well as flip condition comparing the som topological maps implemented separately with each strategy s2 strategy has a lower probability of causing a flipping situation and takes far fewer iterations to train a model of the same network size which indicates s2 is more efficient and effective than s1 in configuring the som topological map for representing regional flood inundation maps keywords self organizing map som flood inundation map topological map artificial intelligence ai 1 introduction in the face of increased flooding disaster prevention is a crucial task for urbanized cities over the last decades many flood simulation models have been developed to provide storm event based urban

fascinating ai clustering tool for classifying highly dimensional datasets where input vectors are projected onto a low dimensional grid map space in an ordered fashion so that more similar vectors will be associated with nodes closer to the grid whereas less similar vectors will be situated in nodes farther away from the grid kohonen 1990 som can project input vectors on prototypes of a two

2014 2018 2019 notwithstanding som s wide applications configuring a suitable som for highly dimensional datasets such as a regional flood inundation map is a formidablechallenge there are three common problems of configuring som which are the twisting of the topological map non convergence and the determination of the number of neurons aoki et al 2009 breard and hamel 2018 besides it could produce dissimilar patterns in clustering even being trained by identical training datasets with the same parameters zhang et al 2018 these issues do cause usability concerns and prevent its applications from a broader spectrum motivated by these practical concerns we systematically explore the effectiveness and efficiency of two training strategies for configuring som as well as assess the suitability of the constructed som topological map using various evaluation indicators we construct the topological map and analyze the clustering results of spatial temporal distribution of regional flooding in two basins in tainan city taiwan we then present the results and evaluate the quality of the constructed topological maps encountered during model construction as well as provide further explanation of the proposed strategies assessed by evaluation indicators conclusions and suggestions are then given which consolidates study results and main findings of this study and suggests possible research directions for future works 2 methods this study proposes two training strategies to conquer three common problems i e the twisting of the topological map non convergence and the determination of the number of neurons commonly encountered when configuring som based on a number of regional inundation maps for two river basins and explore the efficiency and suitability of the constructed som topological maps using various evaluation indicators fig 1 shows the framework of the study which contains data collection som model construction topological maps exploration of results assessment on the effectiveness of training strategies and identification of the best network and training strategy the methodology proposed to build som and evaluation indicators are described in the following sections 2 1 building som som is commonly configured into a two dimensional lattice that represents a grid like structure among neurons nodes to form a topological map for tackling clustering problems and data exploration each neuron contains a vector with the same dimensionality of the input vector the neurons are subsequently adjusted during the training phase based on competitive learning where training is entirely data driven and the neurons of the map compete with each other alhoniemi et al 1999 in every iteration each training sample input vector is allocated to the neuron to which it best matches denoted as the best match neuron bmn where the representative central vector of the matched neuron is updated so that the bmn moves closer to the input vector besides the weights of bmn s neighboring neurons are methodically updated so that the surrounding neurons around the bmn are systematically adapted towards the training sample after completing the training process the final topology would show that the neurons on the grid become ordered where similar neurons stay closer to each other in contrast less similar neurons remain farther away from each other as a result training samples are distributed across the constructed topological map in a similarity preserving way a fundamental question is whether the topological map can well organize and meaningfully interpret the data after training to the best of our knowledge the clustering results are subject to variability in initial conditions convergence to local minima and sampling complexity chang et al 2014 mzelikahle et al 2017 we have experienced three significant problems when building the som topology including the twisting map the selection of the number of epochs and the optimal network size we propose a methodology to automatically configure som for establishing a meaningful topological map for a large number of highly dimensional flood inundation maps 2 2 mathematical formulation a brief mathematical formulation of som which is based mainly on kohonen 1990 is shown as follows the input vector x has n dimensions eq 1 each neuron is represented by an n dimensional weight vector eq 2 the best match neuron bmn winning neuron selection is shown in eq 3 the topological neighborhood i e the neighborhood of a neuron in a topological space in the kth iteration is shown in eq 4 the weight adjustment amount δwj of the jth neuron in the adjacent area is shown in eqs 4 7 where eq 6 defines a time varying neighborhood function around a winning neuron the final weight is expressed as eq 8 1 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n t 2 w j w j 1 w j 2 w j 3 w jn t j 1 2 3 m 3 q x min j x w j 2 j 1 2 3 m 4 r k r 0 exp k τ 1 k 0 1 2 5 τ 1 1000 l o g r 0 6 h q j k exp r j r q 2 2 r 2 k k 0 1 2 7 δ w j η k h q j k x k w j k k 0 1 2 8 w j k 1 w j k δ w j k 0 1 2 where m is the number of neurons wj is the weight vector of the jth neuron r k represents the topological neighborhood in the k th iteration r 0 is the initial radius preset to cover the size of all neurons so that all neurons will fall within the range corrected by the neighborhood function τ 1 is a constant value calculated by eq 5 h q j k denotes the amplitude of the topological neighborhood centered with the j th neuron r j and r q are the position of the j th node and the q th winner node in the topological map respectively and ɳ is the learning rate 2 3 weight adjustment process the initial weights of som are randomly generated where the relationship between neurons is of extreme disorder thus the weight adjustment is the crucial process to configure a suitable topological map the weight adjustment process is usually executed in two stages i e ordering and convergence where the ordering stage involves a rough training while the convergence stage is responsible for a finer training kohonen 1990 in the ordering stage the weight updating process will adjust the neurons of som so that the topological ordering of the weight vectors takes place in the convergence stage the weight updating process will adjust those neurons close to the best match neuron for fine tuning the topological map the number of iterations and the learning rates of these two stages would significantly affect the formation of the topology because the initial weights are in extreme disorder the learning rate and neighborhood radius should be set as large values in the first stage to make the topological map gradually present the order we have to tune the neurons so that neighboring neurons have similar weight vectors the initial learning rate ɳ0 usually starts at 0 1 and then the learning rate η k decreases gradually as the number of iterations k increases as shown in eq 9 τ2 is set as 1000 9 η k η 0 exp k τ 2 k 0 1 2 in the second stage smaller learning rate and neighborhood radius are favorable for fine tuning the topological map ɳ0 is changed to 0 01 and the range of neighborhood radius is also reduced so that only a few neurons staying close to the winner neuron would be fine tuned we notice that the initial learning rate in the second convergence stage is much smaller than that of the first ordering stage which is because the first stage is a rough training while the second stage is responsible for a finer training after a number of updating ex 1000 epochs the exponential decay formulas shown in the neighborhood function eq 6 will reduce to a small value thus the weight adjustment eqs 7 and 8 would be effected only a few neighboring neurons around the winning neuron the numbers of epochs for these two stages are crucial and must be set at first because such numbers could significantly influence the convergence as well as the suitability of the constructed topology 2 4 two training strategies two training strategies s1 s2 are proposed to investigate their effectiveness and suitability of som for constructing the flood inundation topologies of two river basins in tainan city taiwan the first strategy denoted as s1 intends to keep training the som network until no apparent changes occur in the weights of the neurons i e coverage change in the 500th iteration is less than 5 in the ordering stage the training is transferred to the convergence stage where the training stops if no obvious changes in the weight values can be made i e coverage change in the 500th iteration is less than 5 the second strategy denoted as s2 is to keep training the network until the coverage ratio of weights reaches 50 in the ordering stage then the weight adjustment process is transferred to the convergence stage and keeps on until no obvious changes in the weight values can be made i e coverage change in the 500th iteration is less than 5 we notice that s1 is implemented mainly in the ordering stage so that the weights adjustments in this stage will be conducted almost all the way to the end less than 5 in contrast s2 would simultaneously balance the ordering and convergence activities in the weight updating process for roughly configuring the topological map and then fine tuning the topological map 2 5 clustering evaluation indicators a variety of quality measures developed over the years attempt to quantify how well the underlying data can be represented by a topological map of som som can be trained with different map sizes to present the deviations of the data and thus identifying the optimal size of som is crucial and the first thing to decide if the map size is too small it will lose some important features that should be detected nevertheless if the map size is too big the differences between neurons clusters could be too little a number of clustering evaluation indicators were proposed in the literature which provided insights into the selection of a map size using quantitative indicators for instance srinivas et al 2008 showed different clustering indicators for finding the optimal number of clusters in flood frequency analyses and farsadnia et al 2014 combined som with three clustering methods to find the optimal number of clusters through different clustering indicators tian et al 2014 introduced the k nearest neighbor algorithm to improve self organizing maps for anomaly detection using healthy training data from experiments on cooling fan bearings nevertheless to the best of our knowledge there is no general theoretical principle to determine the optimum map size and there is no standard evaluation indicator created to evaluate the proximity between som neurons thus the suitability of the formulated som topology should be explored by using different clustering evaluation indicators here we compare quality measures by using five indicators to investigate the convergence and clustering effect distinguishable the classification of the som model the principles and physical meanings of the five indicators are explained as follows i the partition coefficient pc index proposed by bezdek 1981 shown in eq 10 presents the amount of overlap between clusters its membership degree is determined by the distance between the sample and the center of each cluster the closer the sample to the cluster center is the greater the membership degree is and vice versa therefore the larger the pc value is the closer the samples are to cluster centers which leads to a more obvious grouping effect the membership degrees of each sample corresponding to different clusters is calculated by eq 10 μ in eq 11 can be set as any value where the general setting is 2 the total membership degree should be 1 10 p c 1 n i 1 c j 1 n u ij 2 11 u ij 1 k 1 c x j c i x j c k 2 μ 1 i 1 c u ij 1 where u ij is the membership degree c i is the cluster center x j is the sample n is the input dimension the number of grids in the inundation map c is the number of clusters ii the classification entropy ce is an index of the entropy principle which calculated the fuzziness of the cluster partition farsadnia et al 2014 when the probability of the event is more uniform the entropy value is more unpredictable and larger the ce value is calculated by eq 12 the smaller the entropy is the smaller the ce is 12 c e 1 n i 1 c j 1 n u ij l o g u ij iii the xie beni xb indicator proposed by xie and beni 1991 shown in eq 13 is a function of the data set and the centroids of the clusters where the numerator is the deviation of the sample from the cluster center while the denominator is the smallest distance between different groups a smaller value of the xb index implies a small intra group deviation whereas a large distance between groups 13 x b i 1 c j 1 n u ij μ x j c i 2 n min i k c i c k 2 iv the davies bouldin index dbi proposed by davies and bouldin 1979 shown in eq 14 is a metric built to express the performance of clustering tools and to determine the number of clusters the dbi is similar to the xb indicator the smaller the dbi is the smaller the distance difference between the samples in the group is the larger the distance between the centers of different groups is the more distinguishable the classification is 14 d b i 1 c i 1 c max i j c i c j c i c j where c is the average distance from all samples of this cluster to the center of this cluster v the silhouette coefficient is created as a measure of cluster density and separation rousseeuw 1987 which can evaluate a particular clustering of a dataset and compare it with other clusterings of the same dataset layton et al 2013 the sc can be leveraged by measuring the correlation between the authorship distance method and the true authorship evaluating the quality of the distance method however we show that the sc can be severely affected by outliers the silhouette coefficient sc is shown in eq 15 s i ranges between 1 and 1 when the distance between groups is close there is no much difference between the value of a i and b i therefore the value of s i tends to 0 when the average distance between the samples in the cluster and the cluster center a is greater than the center distance between the cluster center and the other clusters b s is a negative value which means the classification is less suitable therefore the larger the sc value is the better the classification is 15 s i b i a i max a i b i s c 1 n i 1 n s i where a i is the average distance between the i th sample and the rest of the samples in the same cluster and b i is the minimum value from the set of average distance between the i th sample to all samples in other clusters when the distance within the cluster is small and the distance between the groups is large the sc value is closer to 1 thus the larger the sc value is the better the classification is 3 study areas and materials tainan city in southwestern taiwan covers an area of about 2200 square kilometers and its terrain comprises mainly alluvial plains the city is located in the south of the tropic of cancer and belongs to the subtropical climate rainfall is usually induced by monsoons and typhoons and more than 80 of the annual rainfall concentrates in the wet season june november typhoon induced torrential rain or thunderstorms are prone to flooding luermen creek and the yenshui creek in tainan city are our study areas fig 2 and their basic information is given in table 1 because there is no real monitoring inundation map we used simulation datasets maps as the data sources for training the som models the simulation datasets of the taiwan flooding potential map were obtained from the water resources planning and research institute water resources agency taiwan the sobek wl delft hydraulics 1995 which had been used to simulate regional flood inundation maps in taiwan ex doong et al 2016 yang et al 2018 was used to simulate the flooding in the study areas to provide flood simulation datasets twenty seven scenarios were designed by a combination of three rainfall duration 6 12 and 24 h with nine rainfall amounts 100 800 mm under various recurrences i e 2 up to 500 year of hydrological conditions a total of 27 rainfall events i e 3 durations 9 rainfall amounts constituted by various durations and rainfall amounts table 2 were used to simulate the corresponding flood inundation maps for both basins the grid size of the inundation map is 40 40 m2 we do not consider upland areas that have never been inundated i e less than 10 mm inundation depth under any condition so as to reduce the area as well as the input dimension for making computation less time consuming the luermen creek has 783 datasets 783 hourly inundation maps of 27 simulation scenarios and each dataset has 10 128 input dimensions grid s depths the yenshui creek has 1539 datasets 1539 hourly inundation maps of 27 simulation scenarios and each dataset has 54 751 input dimensions for each basin its datasets will be used as input vectors to configure a topological map as output thus the som training algorithm is applied to cluster a large number of highly dimensional flood inundation maps input vectors and configure a visible topological map in both basins individually 4 results and discussion this study proposes two strategies s1 s2 to configure som for each study watershed and assesses their effectiveness and convergence of the constructed topological maps both strategies use the same set of initial weights for training thereby we explore their effects on topology convergence and investigate their flipping situations the influences of the two strategies on building the som models are explored in detail through coverage ratio flip detector and five evaluation indicators of the clustering results the coverage ratio represents the coverage of the maximum and minimum weights of neurons as a percentage of the training data for example if the maximum and minimum weights of som are 0 8 and 0 2 respectively the coverage ratio is 60 these measures allow us to assess the adequacy of the configured topological map quantitatively 4 1 explore the flip detector for the configured som fig 3 presents a 4 4 topology 16 neurons of the configured som based on the 783 hourly inundation maps of the luermen creek basin by using the s2 training strategy where each circle represents one neuron the number in parentheses represents the neuron number and the number without parentheses represents the weight value of the neuron we notice that the weight value of a neuron is the mean inundation depth of all the grids in the study area ex 10 128 grids in the luermen as shown the weight value gradually increases from the lower right corner neuron 16 0 001 m to the upper left corner neuron 1 0 503 m a green arrow indicates the weight value increases in a correct direction where the neighboring relationship is maintained correctly while a red arrow represents the neighboring relationship is incorrect flip where the weight value increases in an incorrect direction if that is the case the topology needs to be retrained until the weight distribution is correct in this study a flip is identified if any two neighboring neuron values violate the rule of a correct direction and their difference is significantly large where a difference above 5 indicates a severe flipping while below 5 means an acceptable slight inversion as shown in fig 3 the pair of neurons 2 and 6 violate the rule red arrow but the difference between their weights is only about 0 8 indicating this is not a serious flipping situation and the difference in weight is within the acceptable range fig 4 shows the configured 4 4 som topological map using the 783 hourly inundation maps as shown the topological map includes 16 neurons and each neuron represents an average inundation map of the inundation depths at 10 128 grids for the basin where each grid denotes an area of 40 40 m2 the average inundation map is obtained by computing the average of the number of regional inundation maps clustered in a neuron as shown neuron 1 has the largest regional inundation depths where its average inundation depth is 0 503 m and a large portion of the grids have high inundation depth even high than 2 m in some grids in contrast neuron 16 has the smallest regional inundation depths where the average inundation depth is only 0 001 m and inundation does not occur in most of the grids the configured map has a suitable topological relationship where the regional inundation depths gradually increase from the lower right corner to the upper left corner 4 2 explore the efficiency of two training strategies both training strategies s1 s2 are used to construct the 3 3 4 4 and 5 5 topological models for the luermen creek basin and the yenshui creek basin the size and convergence of each constructed model are then assessed the training epoch iteration for both training strategies is shown in table 3 it appears it always takes fewer iterations to train a model of the same size by s2 than by s1 which clearly indicates s2 is more efficient than s1 in training the som models we notice that the s1 strategy is based mainly on the ordering phase which uses a large learning rate and neighborhood radius so that it is much easier to have a turn over condition and result in a flipping phenomenon table 4 presents the summarized results of the number of epochs and coverage ratio of som with three different sizes upon both training strategies s1 s2 in two phases p1 ordering phase p2 convergence phase for both basins the results indicate that 1 both strategies obtain similar final p2 coverage ratios in the three som models for the two basins 2 there is no much improvement increasing the coverage between p1 and p2 in respect of the s1 strategy while there is the significant improvement between p1 and p2 in respect of the s2 strategy 3 the number of epochs is much greater by using the s1 strategy than the s2 strategy and 4 the total training epoch of the s1 strategy is much longer larger than that of the s2 strategy in all the cases thus the s2 strategy is recommended which trains the network in the ordering phase until the coverage ratio of weights reaches 50 and then transfers the training to the convergence phase and continues training the weights until no obvious changes in the weight values are made taking the 3 3 som model for the luermen creek basin as an example fig 5 shows the cumulative ratio distribution at various numbers of iterations by both strategies s1 s2 the color dots are the neurons of the 3 3 som the nine vertical color lines are the average weight values of nine neurons corresponding to the cumulative rate curve the blue curve representing the cumulated average inundation depth of the counted datasets and the cumulative ratio of datasets from zero inundation depth to the maximum inundation depth it can be found that the neuron distribution of the two methods increases expands with the number of iterations ex 500 runs 5000 runs of s1 and 500 runs 3000 runs of s2 the initial weights concentrate in a small range ex from 0 55 to 0 72 in fig 5a and then expand ex from 0 25 to 0 98 in fig 5b gradually the neurons with maximum and minimum cumulative rates in the training process fall on the two neurons farthest from the diagonal neurons 3 and 7 respectively where no other neurons surpass these two neurons and their coverage ratios are 73 0 25 0 98 for s1 and 74 0 24 0 98 for s2 we notice that s1 requires 5000 runs iterations to train while s2 only takes 3000 runs the results indicate both strategies could provide almost the same coverage ratios and s2 could reach the coverage ratio in a much shorter time than s1 thus s2 is much more efficient and effective than s1 4 3 examine the suitability of configured soms by evaluation indicators next we explore the suitability of various sizes of som for clustering large numbers of inundation maps in the two study watersheds and assess their convergence the five clustering evaluation indicators are implemented to evaluate the proximity neighborhood relationship between som neurons and investigate the convergence of the constructed som during the training process by both training strategies as shown in fig 6 the values of pc ce and sc gradually increase while the values of xb and dbi decrease as the number of iterations increases these results indicate that both training strategies can gradually distinguish separate the cluster centers during the training process which also means the accuracy coverage ratio of classification gradually improves increases we notice that ce values are too small to be meaningful therefore ce is considered unsuitable for identifying the classification of flood inundation maps the value of sc does not change significantly along the training process mainly because the sc indicator could not clearly identify whether the differences are within the group or between the groups due to som s neighboring relationship thus the sc cannot be considered as an effective indicator for clustering the high dimensional flood inundation maps we find the value of xb as well as dbi is relatively large at the initial iteration number 500 times due to the randomly generated initial weights where the weights between neurons are commonly very small therefore the initial cluster centers neuron weights are very close to each other and the classification between samples is not clear enough resulting in considerably large values of xb and dbi after thousands of iterations the values of xb and dbi decrease significantly which means these indicators are valid here we further explore the suitability of various sizes of som based on coverage ratios table 4 presents the coverage ratios corresponding to three som sizes where a gradual increase in coverage ratio can be found as the map size increases we notice that the coverage ratio corresponding to the 3 3 map size is relatively small less than 77 and thus the 3 3 map size is not considered applicable taking the yenshui creek basin as an example fig 7 shows the cumulative ratio for both of luermen creek basin and the yenshui creek it indicates that the coverage ratio corresponding to 5 5 map is slightly higher than that of the 4 4 map 82 vs 81 for yenshui and 83 vs 79 for luermen nevertheless the cumulative ratios of the neurons in 5 5 models stay close together and its standard deviation std at 2000 iterations is small 0 198 for yenshui and 0 200 for luermen which suggests the model might encounter over fitting in contrast the 4 4 model has a larger std 0 229 for yenshui and 0 218 for luermen and more dispersed cumulative ratios at 2500 iterations thus we consider the 4 4 topography is the best choice for both basins fig 8 presents the constructed 4 4 topological maps of both basins where a continuously gradual weight change along the diagonal neurons and the nice proximity among neighboring neurons could be visibly identified som with 4 4 neurons provided the best mixture of classification presentation and track neuron numbers in clusters producing a typology supporting our analysis the benefits of this topological map are the ability to meaningfully categorize a large number of observed or simulated inundation maps as well as the visibility of the topological map to easily and visibly identify the best match inundation map according to the estimated and or monitored hydrological condition 5 conclusions som has been used extensively as an analytical and visualization tool in exploratory data analysis the constructed topology could be visualized to give an insight into the topographic relationships of high dimensional flood inundation maps thus som could be a very promising application to regional flood warning systems if it is integrated with other machine learning models based on regional rainfall patterns such as the way how som was applied in the previous studies chang et al 2014 2018 nevertheless som may produce different patterns and or non convergence after training and thus causes usability concerns in this study we propose two training strategies s1 and s2 to train som models using a large number of highly dimensional flood inundation maps of two basins located in southern taiwan and investigate their effectiveness and suitability of the constructed som models we notice that s1 focuses mainly on the weights adjustments in the ordering stage to almost all the way to the end while s2 would simultaneously balance the ordering and convergence activities on the weights adjustments we examine the coverage ratio and the flipping of the topological map when the som model is applied to a large number of high dimensional regional flood inundation maps the main contributions of the proposed training strategies and evaluation indicators of the constructed som are four fold and summarized as follows 1 comparing the two training strategies for constructing som models for the two study basins s2 has a lower probability of causing a flipping situation and takes much less training time fewer iterations to build a model of the same size than by s1 which clearly indicates s2 is more efficient than s1 in training the som models 2 the analytical results of the three constructed topological maps i e 3 3 4 4 and 5 5 for both basins indicate that the coverage ratio of the 3 3 map size is relatively low whereas the 5 5 map size has some neurons with very similar accumulation ratios and result in an over fitting situation the 4 4 map size has a larger variation and well dispersed cumulative coverage ratios thus we consider the 4 4 topography is the best choice for both basins 3 the flip detector implemented in this study could visibly present and exam the suitability of the configured topological map the computed coverage ratio along the training process could clearly indicate the suitability of the som map sizes and objectively assess the suitability of the topological map for a study area 4 among the five indicators pc xb and dbi can clearly express the training process as effective classification the ce values are too small to compare and the sc cannot well display the som map for the highly dimensional regional flood inundation applications thus ce and sc would not be recommended as effective evaluation indicators for assessing som s classification of regional flood maps in short pc xb and dbi can show the training of som is effective in categorization however ce and sc could not show effectiveness som is capable of clustering and data mining and is widely used in various hydrological processes configuring som could face issues of twisting topological maps and non convergence which prevents som applications from a broader spectrum this study explores two weight adjustment strategies s1 s2 in detail and the results suggest s2 strategy which methodically balances the ordering and convergence activities on weight adjustment could more effectively and efficiently construct a suitable topological map than the s1 strategy thus s2 training strategy could be applied to effectively clustering a large number of highly dimensional datasets into a meaningful topological map for visibly explaining datasets in a wider spectrum credit authorship contribution statement li chiu chang conceptualization methodology supervision writing original

4819,streamflow forecasting is a crucial task for hydropower operations flood forecasting and water resource use optimization ensemble streamflow prediction esp is commonly used in the case of long term lead times a few months or seasons ahead esp covers the use of historical meteorological scenarios in driving a hydrological model to generate an ensemble of possible future streamflow many studies have evaluated methods for selecting optimal subsets of scenarios to improve forecasting skill and indeed this is still an ongoing area of research in this study we propose a procedure that calculates the maximum potential skill of a classic esp forecast a genetic algorithm ga is used to determine the best possible set of climatological scenarios given any ensemble size along with providing a direct estimate of the esp forecasting potential in hindcast experiments the method can be used as a reference for comparing other methods to esp the procedure is also used to compare classical esp a well established forecasting method with two new methods namely the analogue method and the contingency table ct approach a discriminant analysis is finally implemented to attempt to identify key features of esp members that performed well as compared to their counterparts using historic climatology and climate indices it is shown while there exists a potential for improvement a lot of research must still be realized to exploit this potential the procedure was tested over two basins in canada in general results showed that for any forecast date decreasing the ensemble size led to a higher potential for better forecasting skills however the method does not yet allow identifying the subset of the entire climatology to be used to maximize the esp forecast performance keywords ensemble streamflow prediction genetic algorithm potential skill crps 1 introduction hydrological forecasting is important for enhancing the efficiency of water infrastructure management and agriculture as well as for expanding the hydropower sector clark and hay 2004 gutiérrez and dracup 2001 and decreasing losses due to hydrological phenomena such as droughts and floods guide to hydrological practices volume ii wmo typically hydrological forecasts are generated by driving a hydrological model with one or multiple weather forecasts for the upcoming days or weeks for short and medium term forecasting to months seasons and even years for long term forecasting using historical weather scenarios if a single meteorological scenario is used to drive the hydrological model the outcome is a deterministic forecast streamflow event however this does not allow assessing the uncertainty brought upon the decision making process by the deterministic forecast therefore driving the hydrological model with multiple meteorological scenarios is a preferred alternative and returns a probabilistic ensemble of possible future streamflow scenarios even though in some instances probabilistic forecasts are more difficult to interpret it has been almost two decades since krzysztofowicz 2001 mentioned the benefits of probabilistic forecasts over deterministic forecasts for instance probabilistic forecasts are able to express uncertainty make risk based decisions and better communicate this information to end users in addition since hydrological forecasts inherently deal with unknown future events it makes more sense to convey forecasts in a probabilistic manner rather than in a deterministic one another issue relating to hydrological forecasting is the presence of different sources of uncertainty including hydrological model structure and parameterization forcings and initial conditions moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 all these sources are accompanied by the nonlinearity and complexity of the atmospheric system thus making it imperative to implement probabilistic forecasts cloke and pappenberger 2009 1 1 options for hydrological forecasting for short term streamflow forecasting numerical weather prediction nwp can be used as weather models are known to be skillful to up to approximately 10 days depending on the region cuo et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 for longer periods nwp becomes unreliable and the ensemble streamflow prediction esp method provides a baseline for further hydrological forecasting lead times monhart et al 2019 the simplest method for use in generating ensemble streamflow involves sampling historical streamflow timeseries directly from the historical record however this method disregards the impacts of the initial hydrologic state to overcome this limitation esp using climatology for streamflow forecasting was introduced by twedt et al 1977 and day 1985 in this framework a hydrological model initialized with observed meteorological data is forced with historical climatological data to produce streamflow scenarios for the desired forecast period with each scenario being referred to as a member and an ensemble consisting of multiple members harrigan et al 2018 in this study the esp method is implemented and the term ensemble is used to describe the multitude of climate scenarios as well as the resulting fan of possible streamflow scenarios in esp the forecasts are bounded by historical weather measurements and therefore any extreme weather event that is not already present in the historical database cannot be forecasted adequately however they do provide information where none would be available otherwise 1 2 esp strengths and limitations esp is widely used in different forecasting centers throughout the world buizza et al 2018 and has been considered as constituting the baseline for future forecasting techniques harrigan et al 2018 showed the high streamflow forecasting skill of esp over 314 basins in the uk issued for lead times varying from one to six months although its performance varies by catchment and is a function of various factors such as the amount of base flow and the initialization month while esp is the reference method for seasonal forecasting monhart et al 2019 its skill is still relatively limited for longer term forecasts lucatero et al 2018 it also contains biases and inconsistencies in its skill harrigan et al 2018 mendoza et al 2017 these limitations are mostly attributable to the fact that esp does not consider any information other than historical climatology nor does it allow conditioning of the forecast on expected weather in the near future while esp assigns the same probability of occurrence to all members it is clear that both wet and dry scenarios cannot occur simultaneously and therefore the forecasting skill could potentially be improved by including this information in esp forecasts in addition the esp method cannot take into account climate variability either internal or anthropogenically forced which is a drawback in terms of climate change nor can it forecast extreme events that were not in the historical climatology other methods have been proposed in the literature to provide more reliability and accuracy than esp for instance arnal et al 2018 employed seasonal climate forecasts for seasonal streamflow forecasting rather than using historical meteorological scenarios they concluded that on average in the first month of lead time their method was more skilled than esp the method s performance varied depending on the region and forecast issue time and the authors concluded that a better understanding is needed in terms of the link between hydrological and meteorological variables moreover emerton et al 2018 presented glofas global scale operational seasonal hydro meteorological forecasting system as a worldwide streamflow forecasting system this system is most suitable for cases where no other forecasting method is applicable however notwithstanding some promising results for lead times up to 4 months it showed an over prediction tendency and in some cases was less skillful than esp 1 2 1 methods proposed to improve esp forecasting skill it is generally expected that adding information i e either adding members or subsetting higher quality members to esp forecasts should enable improvements over the basic esp framework as the probabilistic nature of the method then has more information allowing it to adequately determine the uncertainty of future streamflow for further improvements both pre processing processing of inputs to the hydrological model kang et al 2010 and post processing direct adjustment of the streamflow ensembles zalachori et al 2012 verkade et al 2013 have been proposed but they typically rely on all members including those that could possibly be considered non realistic depending on the hydrometeorological conditions prevalent on the forecast issue date furthermore some challenges are encountered when trying to rebuild meteorological and hydrological scenarios after processing the forecast distributions nonetheless some headway is being made in rebuilding appropriate scenarios from distributions bellier et al 2017 2018 whereas esp is de facto a scenario based method furthermore finding appropriate transfer functions between expected future climate states probability of being in a wet or dry period amount of precipitations etc and esp member weighting is a challenging task for example the natural climate variability induces a great deal of uncertainty in the prediction of future streamflows one way climate variability can be considered in esp is by taking into account large scale climate indices such as enso and pdo grantz et al 2005 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 studies have been conducted that point to a correlation between some climate indices and streamflow or with other related factors such as the snow water equivalent swe and precipitation for instance el niño southern oscillation enso is one of the factors that influences precipitation patterns over western north america in the case of western north america wetter winters in the south and drier winters in the north occur more frequently during el niño s warming phase dettinger et al 1998 trenberth 1997 zhang et al 2010 in addition mccabe et al 2004 showed that the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo account for 52 of the total variance of drought frequency in the u s such correlations and connections convincingly lead to the conclusion that climate indices can be considered as uncertainty reducing sources for streamflow forecasting therefore some studies have proposed methods that take advantage of teleconnections and large scale climate indices to improve climatological forecasting through esp in their case study najafi et al 2012 considered correlations between climate signals and streamflow as predictive factors they considered different weights for esp members and for each forecast date they chose different sets of climatological scenarios their results were promising for predicting spring runoff beckers et al 2016 considered el niño southern oscillation enso to distinguish between different esp traces they selected historical scenarios according to the similarities between the enso index in the forecast year and the historic year they then generated more scenarios stochastically by conditioning on enso to compensate for data removed in the previous phase they found a 5 10 skill improvement in two of three case studies while both of these studies showed improvements in long range forecasting neither could evaluate how much skill could have been gained if an ideal method were to be used and how close their methods got to achieving this target with an ideal method being one that would return the best possible forecast skill given the esp members on hand simpler methods such as in yao and georgakakos 2001 were also considered the authors introduced the analogue method involving selections from historical traces in this method traces are ranked according to the euclidean distance between past and inflows at forecast date based on this proximity method they selected the most similar historical traces as probable realizations of future streamflow results for march june were especially satisfying in terms of forecasting biases koutsoyiannis et al 2008 also used the analogue method in a trial and error procedure to determine the best length of the backward looking predictor period and the number of historical traces used in the ensemble similarly to this study svensson 2016 proposed river flow forecasting using hydrological persistence and historical analogues and found that the analogue method performed better for longer lead times the analogue method was cited as a possible benchmarking method for further studies svensson 2016 1 3 study novelty and objectives the current literature includes many studies which address methods to improve esp and results are often compared to classic esp results to determine improvements brought by proposed methods in this study classic esp refers to the esp method without any modification and considering that all historical scenarios have an equiprobable chance of occurring in the forecast period however to our knowledge no study has attempted to determine the theoretical maximum skill that could be achieved through esp methods either quantitatively or qualitatively this so called theoretical maximum skill is an equivalent of maximum forecast skill which could be gained by using historical scenarios in esp this information could help extract as much forecasting accuracy as possible from esp forecasts as well as to identify some member properties that could be useful for differentiating members that will lead to better predictions from the rest thus the aim of this study is to quantify the theoretical maximum skill present in historical meteorological scenarios for long term streamflow forecasting given any ensemble size a secondary objective is to determine how to best identify a subset of available members to produce a skillful ensemble for esp forecasting 2 data and case studies this study was performed on two catchments in canada one in the province of quebec matawin river hereafter referred to as the qc catchment and the other in the province of british columbia chilko river hereafter referred to as the bc catchment both catchments are snowmelt dominated and have similar climates as shown in fig 1 the hydrometeorological data were taken from the canopex hydrological database which contains hydrometeorological data for 698 catchments across canada arsenault et al 2016 the observed weather data daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures in canopex are sourced from the natural resources canada gridded climate database hutchinson et al 2009 hydrometric data in canopex comes from environment and climate change canada s water survey canada wsc hydrometric database climate data covers the 1950 2010 period while hydrometric data includes all available observations over the same period for this study given the need to generate ensembles based on historical meteorological data two catchments were selected covering the complete 61 year study period 1950 2010 3 material and methods 3 1 hydrological model for this study a hydrological model was employed to generate ensemble streamflow forecasts from historical climate data the hydrological model selected for this purpose was hmets martel et al 2017 a lumped conceptual model that has been shown to perform well in a wide range of hydroclimatic conditions including in snowmelt dominated regions for instance it was used by troin et al 2015 for north american catchments hmets has 21 free parameters 10 of which are related to the snowpack melting and refreezing processes 6 to horizontal water routing 4 to vertical water balance and 1 to evapotranspiration scaling as inputs hmets needs daily maximum and minimum temperature data as well as daily solid and liquid precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which has been estimated by the oudin formula oudin et al 2005 3 1 1 meteorological data processing precipitation data was first divided into snow and rain using a linear interpolation based on the mean daily temperature for days with mean temperature above 3 c the precipitation was considered as rainfall while precipitation during days with mean air temperature below 1 c was considered entirely as snow for days when air temperature averaged between 1 c and 3 c the fractions of liquid and solid precipitations were linearly interpolated according to that same scale 3 1 2 hmets calibration for both catchments hmets was calibrated on the entire hydrometeorological time series using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy cmaes hansen et al 2003 the full available period was used as it allows maximizing the information content in the parameter set arsenault et al 2018 cmaes was given a budget of 15 000 model evaluations to converge to an acceptable solution and the nse calibration was 0 60 for the bc catchment and 0 80 for the qc catchment 3 1 3 synthetic streamflow hmets was first driven by the historical meteorological data to generate a long term simulated streamflow series this synthetic streamflow was considered as a proxy for the observed streamflow to remove errors in the hydrological model initial conditions many studies have used this method to overcome the need to compensate for model drift e g alfieri et al 2014 arsenault and côté 2019 harrigan et al 2018 pappenberger et al 2015 the first year of simulated discharge was removed as the results were unstable due to the hydrological model warm up 3 2 generating ensemble members in this study climatology based esp forecasts were generated using the following steps the implementation is similar to that used in harrigan et al 2018 in that the initial conditions are found by forcing the model with observed meteorology as simulated flow on the historical period is also used as pseudo observations it implies that initial conditions are always perfect in this framework hereinafter the ensemble generated by using all the available members always excluding the member of the actual forecast date is referred to as full esp 3 3 forecast verification in the present study the continuous ranked probability score crps hersbach 2000 was used to evaluate the forecast skill against the corresponding pseudo observed streamflow crps is one of the recommended skill scores for forecast verification pappenberger et al 2015 which provides information on the forecast reliability and resolution hersbach 2000 we focus on the accumulated inflows on long horizons as this is an important criterion when evaluating reservoir drawdown rates and long term production capacity in hydropower systems crps is a quantitative technique that measures the accuracy of the forecast by calculating the area between the prediction cumulative distribution function cdf and the cdf of observations zamo and naveau 2018 it is important to note that the ensemble size can thus play a role on the crps value with larger ensembles providing lower crps values given the ensembles have the same statistics ferro et al 2008 lower values of crps signify that the ensemble members are closer to the target value in this case the accumulated streamflow 3 4 proposed procedure to calculate the potential of using climatological data in esp in the esp method all members are considered equiprobable this consideration is simplistic but in the face of uncertainty if no other discriminating factor is available it becomes difficult to provide a means of weighting or selecting members however as some previous studies suggest bojariu and gimeno 2003 mudelsee et al 2003 it could be possible to extract information on various scales from autocorrelations in inflow structures which could then be used to inform on future streamflow characteristics this would allow weighting some members higher than others based on a probabilistic view in this step of the study the aim is to maximize the benefits of using particular subsets of the esp forecast members for hydrological forecasting we seek to obtain the best possible performance i e the smallest crps value for any ensemble size m the target of the hydrological forecasting in this study is to predict the cumulative amount of inflows ci at the end of the forecast period an experiment was designed to evaluate the possible gains in performance based on the available members in other words for each possible ensemble size m a series of possible combinations of m members without replacement were generated and the crps computed this allowed estimating the shape of the esp forecast response domain it is worth noting that the ensemble size must have at least one member less than the full esp ensemble to allow sampling of possible combinations of esp subsets for comparison with the full esp basic scenario the objective here is to verify the possibility of obtaining a better crps by using a better selection of members than by using the full ensemble to find the best set of m members it was necessary to compare different combinations of members from the full set of n members and compare their resulting crps the study was hence performed in hindcast mode to allow retroactive verification of the forecast skill finding the best combination of m members from an ensemble of size n may be considered to be a deterministic binary optimization problem where each member is attributed a value of 1 if it is selected and 0 otherwise a black box optimization tool using the genetic algorithm ga whitley and tutorial 1994 was used to find the best combinations of members for all values of m the optimization aims to minimize the crps using a binary selection i e each parameter can be set to either 1 select the given member or 0 do not include the member in the ensemble with one parameter per available member the only constraint was to force the ga to select a given number of members in order to determine the best combination of members if one were to use 1 2 3 n members in the reduced ensemble the algorithm was run independently for each value of m as opposed to a single multi objective optimization which would have provided the multi objective pareto front the mono objective approach was chosen in order to better characterize the response landscape and not omit any points that could be dominated from an objectively better score in the multi objective space the main caveat to this approach is that the results are dependent on the convergence skill of the algorithm in the high dimensional parameter space e g selecting 25 out of 45 possible members means there are more than 3x1012 possible combinations therefore ga can help converge towards the optimum solution but the actual optimum might be left undiscovered wu and chau 2006 nonetheless this method provides a more targeted approach than a brute force one the potential of an m member esp ensemble forecast would be calculated as follows δ c r p s m crps full e s p crps ga m where crps fullesp denotes a crps value corresponding to considering all members in the forecast and crps ga m denotes the smallest crps while considering m members as determined by the ga algorithm a positive value of δcrpsm delta indicates that there is potential for improving the forecast by selecting a subset of esp members rather than including all the scenarios for example in fig 2 the skill of the full esp ensemble is compared to that of the best performing combination of m members with m 1 2 n in terms of crps for the bc catchment and a random lead time and forecast date for illustrative purposes the red star indicates the crps for the full esp while the blue circles show the crps for different ensemble sizes obtained by the ga method the horizontal red line indicates the potential to improve the forecast skill for each ensemble size the difference between the full esp and the ga derived ensemble with the lowest crps is the potential improvement which could be obtained with the available members fig 2 shows an example of the ga optimization for different numbers of members in the ensembles there is a clear trend as the the size of the ensemble is decreased that the best possible crps values improves as well the results of the ga approach in fig 2 are somewhat unsurprising as it is expected that selecting members with full knowledge of the target during optimization should lead to better results the question then becomes how much of the δcrpsm value can be extracted by using information available to the modeler at the time of forecast essentially how can this information be used to translate the potential into real forecasting skill one possible approach would be to attempt to identify the factors that discriminate desirable members from undesirable ones here we implemented two methods to refine the member selection based on information available to the hydrologist during the forecast 3 5 contingency table ct in this method we assumed that the status of the precipitation or discharge tested over a period preceding the initial date of forecast is the most important factor for selecting esp members climatological scenarios the method is based on a historically driven contingency table ct it then goes on to propose considering a certain period of variable length prior to the forecast date and then using the period s hydrometeorological conditions as predictors for the forecast period as was done in hwang and carbone 2009 svensson 2016 and madrigal et al 2018 the method was implemented as follows 1 choose two periods the first is the period before the forecast date which will serve as the predictor period the second is the forecast duration simply called the forward period 2 choose the variable which is going to be forecasted precipitation streamflow or other at a daily time step 3 calculate a representative value of the chosen variable over the predictor period for example average precipitation which serves as the predictor to the model for all years except for the year of the forecast date 4 discretize the predictor values from the previous step into p categories we classify the data into three categories p 3 a wet if the value is in the top tercile b normal if the value is located in the second tercile c dry if the value is located in the third tercile 5 for each value in step 3 also compute and categorize the historical observed inflows during the forward period following the predictor period for example for a given year the predictor could be categorized as wet and the forward period that immediately follows which corresponds to the forecast duration of the forecast date could be categorized as dry these are the targets that will be used to define and populate the different cells of the ct note that the target values are computed on the same initial date of forecast but on all the other available years in the dataset 6 build the ct by classifying the data into a 1st order 3 by 3 conditional transition matrix between the predictor period state and the forward period state this will allow identifying probabilistic transitions from the state in the predictor period to the forward period for example what would be the chance of having a wet period after a dry period 7 estimate and classify the predictor period value for the forecast date the period right before the initial forecast date from the ct establish the probabilities of having a wet normal dry forecast period based on the predictor period state then select a subset of members of the full esp ensemble that best represent the probabilities of the future states by random sampling from the appropriate classes for example if the contingency table predicts a 60 chance of the forecast being wet then build a new ensemble that contains 60 of wet scenarios from the available set through random sampling of the wet years and dry years independently 3 6 reassemble esp with perfect information about the forecast period in the last method we hypothesized that characterizing the predictor and forward periods according to their relative average precipitation or discharge would improve the forecast skill over using the entire set due to the resulting improved probability representation to test this claim in this section we introduce a variant we name the ct perfect information esp ct perfect ct perfect refers to the idea that the exact state of the forecast period is assumed to be known so only the members that are from the same category wet dry normal are used in the forecasting step without considering the predictor period state consequently this method is an extension of the ct method but which does not require a probabilistic assessment of the future state as the method uses otherwise unknowable information for its discrete and perfect classification i e the future period based on the precipitation variable is going to be wet with complete certainty we introduce this method as a benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of the ct method under uncertainty 3 7 analogue method the analogue method assumes that the best predictor of the forecast period is the predictor period immediately preceding the forecast in this case the best esp member to select as the future realization is the one whose predictor period hydrometeorological properties are most similar to those of the forecast date this scenario is then selected as a member of the improved and reduced size esp members can be added to the forecast predictor period in descending order of similarity the similarity can be measured using a so called analogy factor that consists of two features 1 hydrometeorological properties precipitation or discharge and 2 a statistical aggregation metric of the hydrometeorological variable i e the sum average or maximum value the process can be implemented following these steps 1 define a predictor period as for step 1 of the ct method 2 choose a predictor variable precipitation discharge or other in this study the discharge was selected for this step 3 calculate the accumulated value of the chosen variable discharge over the predictor period for all years serving as predictors to the analogue method 4 calculate the absolute difference between the accumulated simulated discharge for all predictor periods except for the year of the forecast date and the accumulated simulated discharge for the period before the actual forecast date δ i with i indicating the corresponding ensemble member 5 rank δ i i 1 n in ascending order 6 choose the first m members from the ordered set from step 5 and use the climate data from their forecast periods as inputs to the hydrological model to generate the new esp for the real time forecast 3 8 random selection of esp forecast members a random sampling from the available members was also investigated as a baseline method for each value of m 1 2 n 1 with n being the number of available years to select from we sampled m members randomly to compose the esp forecast this process was repeated 1000 times for each value of m the choice was made to select 1000 random samples for each value of m as the distribution of the results obtained always converged before that value therefore the sample size was sufficient to explore the response space 3 9 exploration of member characteristics based on forecasting performance the results obtained through the ga method were analyzed to attempt to determine whether there were any characteristics they shared in common that could help identify the members to select when sampling in an esp forecasting framework this analysis is similar to a discriminant analysis where the members composing the optimal ensemble hereafter referred to as best members are compared to ensembles of the same size containing the worst members i e the ones that generate an ensemble that provides the worst crps according to a set of hydrometeorological characteristics for this analysis the combinations of five members out of all available members that returned 1 the best and 2 the worst results in terms of crps were identified and investigated to determine how they differed in hopes of shedding light on the reasons behind their opposite behaviors in forecasting the best members were selected from the five member ga optimization solution while the five worst were taken from the random sampling that returned the worst crps and that did not include members that were in the best five member ensemble the comparison between the two groups was performed based on the following four indices over the predictor periods 1 the relative difference between mean values of temperature and precipitation of the forward period and predictor periods of each of the best worst members relative d e l t a f o r m e a n α i α i α forward α forward where α denotes the daily temperature or precipitation either during the forward period mean value α forward or during the period denoted by the best or worst member i mean value α i 2 the same as 1 but using the standard deviation instead of the mean of variable α 3 the correlation between temperature and precipitation data of the forward period and each of the best worst members 4 the relative difference between the average of various climate indices during the forward period and that of the best worst members this methodology was developed to attempt to reverse engineer the characteristics of the members that lead to good and bad forecasts rather than attempting to determine the explanatory variables a priori 4 results the results in this section are first presented for a single forecast case and are then extended to integrate the notion of reliability of the esp forecasting methods and to analyze their statistics in the first case forecasts were issued on july 1st 1990 with a 90 day lead time the predictor period was also set to the 90 day window ending on the forecast date of july 1st different methods implemented in this study were then analyzed and compared according to crps as can be seen in fig 3 qc catchment and 4 bc catchment the x axis shows forecast crps values and the y axis shows the ensemble size theoretical optimums correspond to results of subsets selected by the ga method for different ensemble sizes the full esp corresponds to results of considering all historical scenarios as is usually implemented in esp studies ct q and ct p correspond to the ct method considering the streamflow and precipitation as predictor variables respectively ct q perfect and ct p perfect correspond to results of ct q and ct p while having access to the actual state of the forecast period the analogue markers identify the crps skill using the analogue method considering streamflow as the predictor variable multiple interesting patterns emerge from figs 3 and 4 first random sampling either does not improve in the best case or indeed deteriorates in the worse case the crps versus using the whole ensemble the fewer the members the worse the median value the pattern seen in figs 3 and 4 was reproduced in essentially all tests performed i e for each of the 12 initial forecast start dates and various lengths of predictor and forecast windows not shown this observation is in agreement with the findings of ferro et al 2008 some member combinations perform better than others but without any other discriminating information adding more members seems to be the correct approach it can also be seen that the best combinations found by the ga algorithm the theoretical optimal points progressively improve as the number of members decreases except for the single member case this indicates that the information is present in the esp ensemble but we must find a way to extract it adequately this can be seen as the potential improvement for the forecast date i e the maximum improvement that could be possible to gain from selecting members perfectly as for the conditional methods ct and their variants both with discharge q and precipitation p the results vary by catchment the ct using available information performs better than full esp in the qc catchment but the opposite was observed in the bc catchment comparing ct results with and without having access to perfect information shows that merely having access to this information does not automatically improve the results this could be due to the fact that the contingency table is probabilistic and therefore contains a certain amount of uncertainty hence knowing the future state will not automatically mean that the ensemble members that are selected will perform better a more thorough investigation is presented in section 4 1 the analogue method performs similarly if not slightly worse to that of the full esp albeit with a certain variability based on the ensemble size none of the tested methods come close to systematically matching the ga optimal forecast skill this may be seen as an inability of the proposed methods to properly describe the uncertainty in the forecasting process and in the future forecast state in other words the factors that have been used to help identify future forecast states in the proposed methods do not provide enough insight to improve upon the full esp in a reliable way these results have to be interpreted carefully as they represent a single snapshot of the forecast performance for a single day and cover a single set of predictor and forecast periods the process was then repeated for each year in the dataset providing results for the years 1955 to 2004 for the bc catchment as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows crps values for the 50 initial dates of forecast starting on july 1st of each available year for three esp sampling methods using a 90 day predictor period and a forward period of the same duration for the bc catchment a and qc catchment b in fig 5 the full esp method is compared to 1 the ct with precipitation as a predictor variable and 2 the ct with precipitation as a predictor but with perfect knowledge of the future precipitation classification for the bc catchment in 37 cases out of 50 the perfect information method scored the lowest crps values indicating its better forecast skill versus the other methods in the remaining cases the full esp method performed slightly better than the perfect information method results are similar for the qc catchment the 74 success rate seen with the perfect information method here may be the result of knowledge of the true future state in a categorical sense i e knowing if it will be wetter or dryer than average without actually specifying the precipitation amounts in other words improving long term precipitation forecast trends could significantly improve the esp performance however since the method is not systematically better even in the case of perfect knowledge there would still be some untapped potential that could perhaps be accessed by using other variables and predictors it is important to note that the results shown in figs 3 5 point to the full esp method being similar or slightly better than the analogue and ct methods depending on the number of ensemble members a series of tests on other forecast periods lead times and predictor period lengths showed similar results and the crps was typically better for full esp than for reduced size ensembles implementing the analogue or ct methods results not shown figs 6 and 7 show the results of the analysis of the ensemble member characteristics on forecasting performance for the bc catchment for the four previously defined indices these analyses were done for july 1st as the forecast issue date and were repeated 40 times from 1966 to 2005 considering 90 days before the forecast date and 90 days following the forecast date in fig 6 the histograms each include 200 values i e 40 years 5 members per year the x axis represents the relative difference between the predictor period of the selected esp member and the forward period the predictive variables are the temperature left column and precipitation right column and the three rows show the results when comparing the difference in means top row standard deviations center row and correlations bottom row the blue and red histograms show the results for the best and worst members respectively it can be seen that the distributions of both histograms are very similar and that none of the selected variables allowed generating a clear pathway to separate good members from bad ones fig 7 shows the distributions of the relative difference between 1 the averages of climate indices in the predictor period of each of five best worst members for the 40 forecast years and 2 the values of the associated forward period indices the four climate indices that were employed are the pacific north american pna multivariate el niño southern oscillation index mei pacific decadal oscillation pdo and southern oscillation index soi the results show that while there seems to be some minor differences in some of the distributions especially in the variability of the pdo and soi distributions these differences are not statistically significant and do not allow for efficient discrimination between the desirable and undesirable members the analyses in figs 6 and 7 were performed on a multitude of forecast dates predictor period durations and forecast lead times with similar results which are not shown these predictor variables thus seem insufficient to allow the identification of members that maximize the forecast skill 5 analysis and discussion in this study we proposed a procedure to quantify the theoretical potential of using historical weather observations as probable scenarios in an ensemble streamflow prediction approach for long term discharge forecasting typically all members in esp forecasting are considered as equally probable however in this study we used a procedure to determine the best possible combinations of members for different esp ensemble sizes the ga approach allowed finding these combinations in hindcasting mode with perfect knowledge about the hydrometeorological states to be forecasted while this approach is not available to the forecaster in real time the rationale however was to use it to quantify the theoretical limit that could be achieved using the historical climatology on hand various esp member selection techniques were tested to analyze their ranking as compared to the theoretical optimum and the full esp ensemble each method was tested with a range of parameters such as the initial date of forecast the duration of the predictor period and the lead time in almost all tests lower crps values could be obtained with smaller ensemble sizes but at the same time expected crps values increased if the members of the subset were selected randomly one important message obtained from this study is that when performing an esp forecast using climatology there is a strong chance that some members present in the dataset could possibly be excluded in order to improve the forecast skill in that sense decreasing the ensemble size can improve the forecast skill through the elimination of improbable scenarios this selection also carries a risk because a desirable member may be removed instead of an undesirable one in which case the forecast skill will degrade therefore research efforts should focus on increasing the ability to probabilistically categorize the future hydrological regime wetter or dryer than average and condition the esp member selection on those probabilities as noted previously many studies have investigated this very subject either through climate indices long term nwp forecasts or other means and the present study will help quantify the potential skill attainable with those methods as shown in figs 3 and 4 and from the numerous results obtained during the tests performed in this study the results of the ct and the analogue methods were highly variable and depended on the lead time the predictor period length the predictor variable the initial date of forecast and the catchment characteristics in the case of ct the method was not reliable enough to be recommended for use when the predictor was the streamflow or the precipitation ct perfect variants were implemented to better test the potential of the ct method as such it was conducted under conditions without uncertainty regarding precipitation during the forecast period on average ct perfect results were much better than those obtained using the full esp meaning that improving the overall forecasted precipitation category wet or dry accounts for a significant portion of the ability of the methods to select desirable members the skill could probably be further increased by finding better predictors than the average previous precipitation or streamflow for example in a multivariate setting adding information from climate indices and combinations thereof to the precipitation and temperature could be envisioned as well consideration could also be given to using other statistics than those used in this study the analogue method was generally less skillful than the full esp and this could be attributed to the same problem encountered with the ct method i e the predictor period variables are not good enough predictors for future inflows or precipitation although the results of the member selection methods shown herein did lead to forecast skill improvements the methods presented could be useful to researchers in esp forecasting and water resource management for two reasons first before implementing an esp forecasting system the procedure could be used in hindcasting mode to determine how much potential the forecast may yield given its specific parameters initial date predictor period duration and lead time available observation record this could serve as a reference to help manage any expectations and determine the limits of the approach before any more efforts are deployed second the procedure could be used to benchmark analyze and improve existing methods that are currently being used in practice to generate esp forecasts this would allow quantifying improvements on a relative scale with a known baseline value this type of evaluation could be repeated as many times as needed in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the method s performance the proposed method to investigate relationships and correlations between desirable members and hydroclimatic indicators could also be used to help develop member selection methods in the general tests performed in this study no strong relationship was found in other words simply considering the average value of precipitation or temperature during the predictor period was not enough to indicate the forward period characteristics more complex predictors could potentially allow such a relationship to be exposed there are many other metrics and combinations of metrics that could be investigated including for instance those in feng et al 2016 hossain et al 2018 hossain et al 2019 and konapala et al 2018 non linear combination methods could also be tested with this approach which was out of the scope of this paper this study proposes a method to quantify the skill of an esp forecast using reduced ensemble sizes by selecting fewer but more desirable members however there are some general limitations to using this approach first the historical dataset must be long enough to represent multiple climatological states over the catchment in order to have a realistic chance of portraying the climatological uncertainty selecting a subset of an already small ensemble would prove difficult as the transition probabilities would be ill defined second the fact that the ensemble size changes during the subsetting process induces a bias in the crps calculation as shown in ferro et al 2008 this effect was not explicitly accounted for in this study but the impact should be minimal because 1 the response is similar to what would be expected with the corrections and 2 even with our best methods and attempts we were unsuccessful at identifying which of the members in the reduced ensemble should be selected therefore even for a given size ensemble we were unable to improve the method also climate change signals could be present in the observed dataset used to define the esp members there is a legitimate claim that esp members from multiple decades ago could be unrepresentative of the current climatological state in such cases while care should be taken when building the esp ensemble determining how to do so is a challenge in itself it is possible that by weighting the members differently or by excluding some entirely a more reliable ensemble could be built another limitation relates to the selection of catchments used in this study the two catchments are snowmelt dominated and thus have somewhat similar hydrological regimes perhaps this method could provide different results in contrasting climate regimes although the identification of the maximum potential skill would probably be similar finally it is important to note that this study did not make use of pre or post processing of ensemble members but rather used historical data directly the pre processing step could conceivably use the quantification and selection methods in this study to improve the accuracy of processed ensembles for long term streamflow forecasting 6 conclusion this study presents a procedure to quantify the potential skill of ensemble streamflow prediction esp using historical climatological data in typical implementations of esp all available members are used to add diversity to the ensemble and all members are considered equally likely to occur in the future however knowing some information about the future state can help focus the esp member selection on the expected conditions one way of doing so is by removing members that are unlikely to be realized in the future this study describes a method to determine the best possible members for any ensemble size and to weigh the risk and potential benefit of using a member selection approach three approaches were tested and while two ct and analogue did not lead to skill improvement the ct perfect procedure allowed to determine that classifying the climatological state of the forecast period could improve long term forecasting accuracy the maximum potential improvement was quantified using a ga method to find the best combination of members for any ensemble size it provides a means of comparison between results of various methods such as the random selection of members and the theoretical optimum to the full esp ensemble this quantification could help improve esp forecasting by providing a more consistent baseline than relative reductions in crps as is typically done in the literature finally a method was proposed to help differentiate desirable from the undesirable members in a consistent manner for esp forecasting using the theoretically optimal esp members properties and correlating them to hydroclimatological indices in hindcasting mode although the results show that the selected variables are not good predictors of this relationship the method could be employed in future research to attempt to determine the most efficient predictors and quantify their levels of success credit authorship contribution statement behmard sabzipour conceptualization data curation

4819,streamflow forecasting is a crucial task for hydropower operations flood forecasting and water resource use optimization ensemble streamflow prediction esp is commonly used in the case of long term lead times a few months or seasons ahead esp covers the use of historical meteorological scenarios in driving a hydrological model to generate an ensemble of possible future streamflow many studies have evaluated methods for selecting optimal subsets of scenarios to improve forecasting skill and indeed this is still an ongoing area of research in this study we propose a procedure that calculates the maximum potential skill of a classic esp forecast a genetic algorithm ga is used to determine the best possible set of climatological scenarios given any ensemble size along with providing a direct estimate of the esp forecasting potential in hindcast experiments the method can be used as a reference for comparing other methods to esp the procedure is also used to compare classical esp a well established forecasting method with two new methods namely the analogue method and the contingency table ct approach a discriminant analysis is finally implemented to attempt to identify key features of esp members that performed well as compared to their counterparts using historic climatology and climate indices it is shown while there exists a potential for improvement a lot of research must still be realized to exploit this potential the procedure was tested over two basins in canada in general results showed that for any forecast date decreasing the ensemble size led to a higher potential for better forecasting skills however the method does not yet allow identifying the subset of the entire climatology to be used to maximize the esp forecast performance keywords ensemble streamflow prediction genetic algorithm potential skill crps 1 introduction hydrological forecasting is important for enhancing the efficiency of water infrastructure management and agriculture as well as for expanding the hydropower sector clark and hay 2004 gutiérrez and dracup 2001 and decreasing losses due to hydrological phenomena such as droughts and floods guide to hydrological practices volume ii wmo typically hydrological forecasts are generated by driving a hydrological model with one or multiple weather forecasts for the upcoming days or weeks for short and medium term forecasting to months seasons and even years for long term forecasting using historical weather scenarios if a single meteorological scenario is used to drive the hydrological model the outcome is a deterministic forecast streamflow event however this does not allow assessing the uncertainty brought upon the decision making process by the deterministic forecast therefore driving the hydrological model with multiple meteorological scenarios is a preferred alternative and returns a probabilistic ensemble of possible future streamflow scenarios even though in some instances probabilistic forecasts are more difficult to interpret it has been almost two decades since krzysztofowicz 2001 mentioned the benefits of probabilistic forecasts over deterministic forecasts for instance probabilistic forecasts are able to express uncertainty make risk based decisions and better communicate this information to end users in addition since hydrological forecasts inherently deal with unknown future events it makes more sense to convey forecasts in a probabilistic manner rather than in a deterministic one another issue relating to hydrological forecasting is the presence of different sources of uncertainty including hydrological model structure and parameterization forcings and initial conditions moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 all these sources are accompanied by the nonlinearity and complexity of the atmospheric system thus making it imperative to implement probabilistic forecasts cloke and pappenberger 2009 1 1 options for hydrological forecasting for short term streamflow forecasting numerical weather prediction nwp can be used as weather models are known to be skillful to up to approximately 10 days depending on the region cuo et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 for longer periods nwp becomes unreliable and the ensemble streamflow prediction esp method provides a baseline for further hydrological forecasting lead times monhart et al 2019 the simplest method for use in generating ensemble streamflow involves sampling historical streamflow timeseries directly from the historical record however this method disregards the impacts of the initial hydrologic state to overcome this limitation esp using climatology for streamflow forecasting was introduced by twedt et al 1977 and day 1985 in this framework a hydrological model initialized with observed meteorological data is forced with historical climatological data to produce streamflow scenarios for the desired forecast period with each scenario being referred to as a member and an ensemble consisting of multiple members harrigan et al 2018 in this study the esp method is implemented and the term ensemble is used to describe the multitude of climate scenarios as well as the resulting fan of possible streamflow scenarios in esp the forecasts are bounded by historical weather measurements and therefore any extreme weather event that is not already present in the historical database cannot be forecasted adequately however they do provide information where none would be available otherwise 1 2 esp strengths and limitations esp is widely used in different forecasting centers throughout the world buizza et al 2018 and has been considered as constituting the baseline for future forecasting techniques harrigan et al 2018 showed the high streamflow forecasting skill of esp over 314 basins in the uk issued for lead times varying from one to six months although its performance varies by catchment and is a function of various factors such as the amount of base flow and the initialization month while esp is the reference method for seasonal forecasting monhart et al 2019 its skill is still relatively limited for longer term forecasts lucatero et al 2018 it also contains biases and inconsistencies in its skill harrigan et al 2018 mendoza et al 2017 these limitations are mostly attributable to the fact that esp does not consider any information other than historical climatology nor does it allow conditioning of the forecast on expected weather in the near future while esp assigns the same probability of occurrence to all members it is clear that both wet and dry scenarios cannot occur simultaneously and therefore the forecasting skill could potentially be improved by including this information in esp forecasts in addition the esp method cannot take into account climate variability either internal or anthropogenically forced which is a drawback in terms of climate change nor can it forecast extreme events that were not in the historical climatology other methods have been proposed in the literature to provide more reliability and accuracy than esp for instance arnal et al 2018 employed seasonal climate forecasts for seasonal streamflow forecasting rather than using historical meteorological scenarios they concluded that on average in the first month of lead time their method was more skilled than esp the method s performance varied depending on the region and forecast issue time and the authors concluded that a better understanding is needed in terms of the link between hydrological and meteorological variables moreover emerton et al 2018 presented glofas global scale operational seasonal hydro meteorological forecasting system as a worldwide streamflow forecasting system this system is most suitable for cases where no other forecasting method is applicable however notwithstanding some promising results for lead times up to 4 months it showed an over prediction tendency and in some cases was less skillful than esp 1 2 1 methods proposed to improve esp forecasting skill it is generally expected that adding information i e either adding members or subsetting higher quality members to esp forecasts should enable improvements over the basic esp framework as the probabilistic nature of the method then has more information allowing it to adequately determine the uncertainty of future streamflow for further improvements both pre processing processing of inputs to the hydrological model kang et al 2010 and post processing direct adjustment of the streamflow ensembles zalachori et al 2012 verkade et al 2013 have been proposed but they typically rely on all members including those that could possibly be considered non realistic depending on the hydrometeorological conditions prevalent on the forecast issue date furthermore some challenges are encountered when trying to rebuild meteorological and hydrological scenarios after processing the forecast distributions nonetheless some headway is being made in rebuilding appropriate scenarios from distributions bellier et al 2017 2018 whereas esp is de facto a scenario based method furthermore finding appropriate transfer functions between expected future climate states probability of being in a wet or dry period amount of precipitations etc and esp member weighting is a challenging task for example the natural climate variability induces a great deal of uncertainty in the prediction of future streamflows one way climate variability can be considered in esp is by taking into account large scale climate indices such as enso and pdo grantz et al 2005 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 studies have been conducted that point to a correlation between some climate indices and streamflow or with other related factors such as the snow water equivalent swe and precipitation for instance el niño southern oscillation enso is one of the factors that influences precipitation patterns over western north america in the case of western north america wetter winters in the south and drier winters in the north occur more frequently during el niño s warming phase dettinger et al 1998 trenberth 1997 zhang et al 2010 in addition mccabe et al 2004 showed that the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo account for 52 of the total variance of drought frequency in the u s such correlations and connections convincingly lead to the conclusion that climate indices can be considered as uncertainty reducing sources for streamflow forecasting therefore some studies have proposed methods that take advantage of teleconnections and large scale climate indices to improve climatological forecasting through esp in their case study najafi et al 2012 considered correlations between climate signals and streamflow as predictive factors they considered different weights for esp members and for each forecast date they chose different sets of climatological scenarios their results were promising for predicting spring runoff beckers et al 2016 considered el niño southern oscillation enso to distinguish between different esp traces they selected historical scenarios according to the similarities between the enso index in the forecast year and the historic year they then generated more scenarios stochastically by conditioning on enso to compensate for data removed in the previous phase they found a 5 10 skill improvement in two of three case studies while both of these studies showed improvements in long range forecasting neither could evaluate how much skill could have been gained if an ideal method were to be used and how close their methods got to achieving this target with an ideal method being one that would return the best possible forecast skill given the esp members on hand simpler methods such as in yao and georgakakos 2001 were also considered the authors introduced the analogue method involving selections from historical traces in this method traces are ranked according to the euclidean distance between past and inflows at forecast date based on this proximity method they selected the most similar historical traces as probable realizations of future streamflow results for march june were especially satisfying in terms of forecasting biases koutsoyiannis et al 2008 also used the analogue method in a trial and error procedure to determine the best length of the backward looking predictor period and the number of historical traces used in the ensemble similarly to this study svensson 2016 proposed river flow forecasting using hydrological persistence and historical analogues and found that the analogue method performed better for longer lead times the analogue method was cited as a possible benchmarking method for further studies svensson 2016 1 3 study novelty and objectives the current literature includes many studies which address methods to improve esp and results are often compared to classic esp results to determine improvements brought by proposed methods in this study classic esp refers to the esp method without any modification and considering that all historical scenarios have an equiprobable chance of occurring in the forecast period however to our knowledge no study has attempted to determine the theoretical maximum skill that could be achieved through esp methods either quantitatively or qualitatively this so called theoretical maximum skill is an equivalent of maximum forecast skill which could be gained by using historical scenarios in esp this information could help extract as much forecasting accuracy as possible from esp forecasts as well as to identify some member properties that could be useful for differentiating members that will lead to better predictions from the rest thus the aim of this study is to quantify the theoretical maximum skill present in historical meteorological scenarios for long term streamflow forecasting given any ensemble size a secondary objective is to determine how to best identify a subset of available members to produce a skillful ensemble for esp forecasting 2 data and case studies this study was performed on two catchments in canada one in the province of quebec matawin river hereafter referred to as the qc catchment and the other in the province of british columbia chilko river hereafter referred to as the bc catchment both catchments are snowmelt dominated and have similar climates as shown in fig 1 the hydrometeorological data were taken from the canopex hydrological database which contains hydrometeorological data for 698 catchments across canada arsenault et al 2016 the observed weather data daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures in canopex are sourced from the natural resources canada gridded climate database hutchinson et al 2009 hydrometric data in canopex comes from environment and climate change canada s water survey canada wsc hydrometric database climate data covers the 1950 2010 period while hydrometric data includes all available observations over the same period for this study given the need to generate ensembles based on historical meteorological data two catchments were selected covering the complete 61 year study period 1950 2010 3 material and methods 3 1 hydrological model for this study a hydrological model was employed to generate ensemble streamflow forecasts from historical climate data the hydrological model selected for this purpose was hmets martel et al 2017 a lumped conceptual model that has been shown to perform well in a wide range of hydroclimatic conditions including in snowmelt dominated regions for instance it was used by troin et al 2015 for north american catchments hmets has 21 free parameters 10 of which are related to the snowpack melting and refreezing processes 6 to horizontal water routing 4 to vertical water balance and 1 to evapotranspiration scaling as inputs hmets needs daily maximum and minimum temperature data as well as daily solid and liquid precipitation and potential evapotranspiration which has been estimated by the oudin formula oudin et al 2005 3 1 1 meteorological data processing precipitation data was first divided into snow and rain using a linear interpolation based on the mean daily temperature for days with mean temperature above 3 c the precipitation was considered as rainfall while precipitation during days with mean air temperature below 1 c was considered entirely as snow for days when air temperature averaged between 1 c and 3 c the fractions of liquid and solid precipitations were linearly interpolated according to that same scale 3 1 2 hmets calibration for both catchments hmets was calibrated on the entire hydrometeorological time series using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy cmaes hansen et al 2003 the full available period was used as it allows maximizing the information content in the parameter set arsenault et al 2018 cmaes was given a budget of 15 000 model evaluations to converge to an acceptable solution and the nse calibration was 0 60 for the bc catchment and 0 80 for the qc catchment 3 1 3 synthetic streamflow hmets was first driven by the historical meteorological data to generate a long term simulated streamflow series this synthetic streamflow was considered as a proxy for the observed streamflow to remove errors in the hydrological model initial conditions many studies have used this method to overcome the need to compensate for model drift e g alfieri et al 2014 arsenault and côté 2019 harrigan et al 2018 pappenberger et al 2015 the first year of simulated discharge was removed as the results were unstable due to the hydrological model warm up 3 2 generating ensemble members in this study climatology based esp forecasts were generated using the following steps the implementation is similar to that used in harrigan et al 2018 in that the initial conditions are found by forcing the model with observed meteorology as simulated flow on the historical period is also used as pseudo observations it implies that initial conditions are always perfect in this framework hereinafter the ensemble generated by using all the available members always excluding the member of the actual forecast date is referred to as full esp 3 3 forecast verification in the present study the continuous ranked probability score crps hersbach 2000 was used to evaluate the forecast skill against the corresponding pseudo observed streamflow crps is one of the recommended skill scores for forecast verification pappenberger et al 2015 which provides information on the forecast reliability and resolution hersbach 2000 we focus on the accumulated inflows on long horizons as this is an important criterion when evaluating reservoir drawdown rates and long term production capacity in hydropower systems crps is a quantitative technique that measures the accuracy of the forecast by calculating the area between the prediction cumulative distribution function cdf and the cdf of observations zamo and naveau 2018 it is important to note that the ensemble size can thus play a role on the crps value with larger ensembles providing lower crps values given the ensembles have the same statistics ferro et al 2008 lower values of crps signify that the ensemble members are closer to the target value in this case the accumulated streamflow 3 4 proposed procedure to calculate the potential of using climatological data in esp in the esp method all members are considered equiprobable this consideration is simplistic but in the face of uncertainty if no other discriminating factor is available it becomes difficult to provide a means of weighting or selecting members however as some previous studies suggest bojariu and gimeno 2003 mudelsee et al 2003 it could be possible to extract information on various scales from autocorrelations in inflow structures which could then be used to inform on future streamflow characteristics this would allow weighting some members higher than others based on a probabilistic view in this step of the study the aim is to maximize the benefits of using particular subsets of the esp forecast members for hydrological forecasting we seek to obtain the best possible performance i e the smallest crps value for any ensemble size m the target of the hydrological forecasting in this study is to predict the cumulative amount of inflows ci at the end of the forecast period an experiment was designed to evaluate the possible gains in performance based on the available members in other words for each possible ensemble size m a series of possible combinations of m members without replacement were generated and the crps computed this allowed estimating the shape of the esp forecast response domain it is worth noting that the ensemble size must have at least one member less than the full esp ensemble to allow sampling of possible combinations of esp subsets for comparison with the full esp basic scenario the objective here is to verify the possibility of obtaining a better crps by using a better selection of members than by using the full ensemble to find the best set of m members it was necessary to compare different combinations of members from the full set of n members and compare their resulting crps the study was hence performed in hindcast mode to allow retroactive verification of the forecast skill finding the best combination of m members from an ensemble of size n may be considered to be a deterministic binary optimization problem where each member is attributed a value of 1 if it is selected and 0 otherwise a black box optimization tool using the genetic algorithm ga whitley and tutorial 1994 was used to find the best combinations of members for all values of m the optimization aims to minimize the crps using a binary selection i e each parameter can be set to either 1 select the given member or 0 do not include the member in the ensemble with one parameter per available member the only constraint was to force the ga to select a given number of members in order to determine the best combination of members if one were to use 1 2 3 n members in the reduced ensemble the algorithm was run independently for each value of m as opposed to a single multi objective optimization which would have provided the multi objective pareto front the mono objective approach was chosen in order to better characterize the response landscape and not omit any points that could be dominated from an objectively better score in the multi objective space the main caveat to this approach is that the results are dependent on the convergence skill of the algorithm in the high dimensional parameter space e g selecting 25 out of 45 possible members means there are more than 3x1012 possible combinations therefore ga can help converge towards the optimum solution but the actual optimum might be left undiscovered wu and chau 2006 nonetheless this method provides a more targeted approach than a brute force one the potential of an m member esp ensemble forecast would be calculated as follows δ c r p s m crps full e s p crps ga m where crps fullesp denotes a crps value corresponding to considering all members in the forecast and crps ga m denotes the smallest crps while considering m members as determined by the ga algorithm a positive value of δcrpsm delta indicates that there is potential for improving the forecast by selecting a subset of esp members rather than including all the scenarios for example in fig 2 the skill of the full esp ensemble is compared to that of the best performing combination of m members with m 1 2 n in terms of crps for the bc catchment and a random lead time and forecast date for illustrative purposes the red star indicates the crps for the full esp while the blue circles show the crps for different ensemble sizes obtained by the ga method the horizontal red line indicates the potential to improve the forecast skill for each ensemble size the difference between the full esp and the ga derived ensemble with the lowest crps is the potential improvement which could be obtained with the available members fig 2 shows an example of the ga optimization for different numbers of members in the ensembles there is a clear trend as the the size of the ensemble is decreased that the best possible crps values improves as well the results of the ga approach in fig 2 are somewhat unsurprising as it is expected that selecting members with full knowledge of the target during optimization should lead to better results the question then becomes how much of the δcrpsm value can be extracted by using information available to the modeler at the time of forecast essentially how can this information be used to translate the potential into real forecasting skill one possible approach would be to attempt to identify the factors that discriminate desirable members from undesirable ones here we implemented two methods to refine the member selection based on information available to the hydrologist during the forecast 3 5 contingency table ct in this method we assumed that the status of the precipitation or discharge tested over a period preceding the initial date of forecast is the most important factor for selecting esp members climatological scenarios the method is based on a historically driven contingency table ct it then goes on to propose considering a certain period of variable length prior to the forecast date and then using the period s hydrometeorological conditions as predictors for the forecast period as was done in hwang and carbone 2009 svensson 2016 and madrigal et al 2018 the method was implemented as follows 1 choose two periods the first is the period before the forecast date which will serve as the predictor period the second is the forecast duration simply called the forward period 2 choose the variable which is going to be forecasted precipitation streamflow or other at a daily time step 3 calculate a representative value of the chosen variable over the predictor period for example average precipitation which serves as the predictor to the model for all years except for the year of the forecast date 4 discretize the predictor values from the previous step into p categories we classify the data into three categories p 3 a wet if the value is in the top tercile b normal if the value is located in the second tercile c dry if the value is located in the third tercile 5 for each value in step 3 also compute and categorize the historical observed inflows during the forward period following the predictor period for example for a given year the predictor could be categorized as wet and the forward period that immediately follows which corresponds to the forecast duration of the forecast date could be categorized as dry these are the targets that will be used to define and populate the different cells of the ct note that the target values are computed on the same initial date of forecast but on all the other available years in the dataset 6 build the ct by classifying the data into a 1st order 3 by 3 conditional transition matrix between the predictor period state and the forward period state this will allow identifying probabilistic transitions from the state in the predictor period to the forward period for example what would be the chance of having a wet period after a dry period 7 estimate and classify the predictor period value for the forecast date the period right before the initial forecast date from the ct establish the probabilities of having a wet normal dry forecast period based on the predictor period state then select a subset of members of the full esp ensemble that best represent the probabilities of the future states by random sampling from the appropriate classes for example if the contingency table predicts a 60 chance of the forecast being wet then build a new ensemble that contains 60 of wet scenarios from the available set through random sampling of the wet years and dry years independently 3 6 reassemble esp with perfect information about the forecast period in the last method we hypothesized that characterizing the predictor and forward periods according to their relative average precipitation or discharge would improve the forecast skill over using the entire set due to the resulting improved probability representation to test this claim in this section we introduce a variant we name the ct perfect information esp ct perfect ct perfect refers to the idea that the exact state of the forecast period is assumed to be known so only the members that are from the same category wet dry normal are used in the forecasting step without considering the predictor period state consequently this method is an extension of the ct method but which does not require a probabilistic assessment of the future state as the method uses otherwise unknowable information for its discrete and perfect classification i e the future period based on the precipitation variable is going to be wet with complete certainty we introduce this method as a benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of the ct method under uncertainty 3 7 analogue method the analogue method assumes that the best predictor of the forecast period is the predictor period immediately preceding the forecast in this case the best esp member to select as the future realization is the one whose predictor period hydrometeorological properties are most similar to those of the forecast date this scenario is then selected as a member of the improved and reduced size esp members can be added to the forecast predictor period in descending order of similarity the similarity can be measured using a so called analogy factor that consists of two features 1 hydrometeorological properties precipitation or discharge and 2 a statistical aggregation metric of the hydrometeorological variable i e the sum average or maximum value the process can be implemented following these steps 1 define a predictor period as for step 1 of the ct method 2 choose a predictor variable precipitation discharge or other in this study the discharge was selected for this step 3 calculate the accumulated value of the chosen variable discharge over the predictor period for all years serving as predictors to the analogue method 4 calculate the absolute difference between the accumulated simulated discharge for all predictor periods except for the year of the forecast date and the accumulated simulated discharge for the period before the actual forecast date δ i with i indicating the corresponding ensemble member 5 rank δ i i 1 n in ascending order 6 choose the first m members from the ordered set from step 5 and use the climate data from their forecast periods as inputs to the hydrological model to generate the new esp for the real time forecast 3 8 random selection of esp forecast members a random sampling from the available members was also investigated as a baseline method for each value of m 1 2 n 1 with n being the number of available years to select from we sampled m members randomly to compose the esp forecast this process was repeated 1000 times for each value of m the choice was made to select 1000 random samples for each value of m as the distribution of the results obtained always converged before that value therefore the sample size was sufficient to explore the response space 3 9 exploration of member characteristics based on forecasting performance the results obtained through the ga method were analyzed to attempt to determine whether there were any characteristics they shared in common that could help identify the members to select when sampling in an esp forecasting framework this analysis is similar to a discriminant analysis where the members composing the optimal ensemble hereafter referred to as best members are compared to ensembles of the same size containing the worst members i e the ones that generate an ensemble that provides the worst crps according to a set of hydrometeorological characteristics for this analysis the combinations of five members out of all available members that returned 1 the best and 2 the worst results in terms of crps were identified and investigated to determine how they differed in hopes of shedding light on the reasons behind their opposite behaviors in forecasting the best members were selected from the five member ga optimization solution while the five worst were taken from the random sampling that returned the worst crps and that did not include members that were in the best five member ensemble the comparison between the two groups was performed based on the following four indices over the predictor periods 1 the relative difference between mean values of temperature and precipitation of the forward period and predictor periods of each of the best worst members relative d e l t a f o r m e a n α i α i α forward α forward where α denotes the daily temperature or precipitation either during the forward period mean value α forward or during the period denoted by the best or worst member i mean value α i 2 the same as 1 but using the standard deviation instead of the mean of variable α 3 the correlation between temperature and precipitation data of the forward period and each of the best worst members 4 the relative difference between the average of various climate indices during the forward period and that of the best worst members this methodology was developed to attempt to reverse engineer the characteristics of the members that lead to good and bad forecasts rather than attempting to determine the explanatory variables a priori 4 results the results in this section are first presented for a single forecast case and are then extended to integrate the notion of reliability of the esp forecasting methods and to analyze their statistics in the first case forecasts were issued on july 1st 1990 with a 90 day lead time the predictor period was also set to the 90 day window ending on the forecast date of july 1st different methods implemented in this study were then analyzed and compared according to crps as can be seen in fig 3 qc catchment and 4 bc catchment the x axis shows forecast crps values and the y axis shows the ensemble size theoretical optimums correspond to results of subsets selected by the ga method for different ensemble sizes the full esp corresponds to results of considering all historical scenarios as is usually implemented in esp studies ct q and ct p correspond to the ct method considering the streamflow and precipitation as predictor variables respectively ct q perfect and ct p perfect correspond to results of ct q and ct p while having access to the actual state of the forecast period the analogue markers identify the crps skill using the analogue method considering streamflow as the predictor variable multiple interesting patterns emerge from figs 3 and 4 first random sampling either does not improve in the best case or indeed deteriorates in the worse case the crps versus using the whole ensemble the fewer the members the worse the median value the pattern seen in figs 3 and 4 was reproduced in essentially all tests performed i e for each of the 12 initial forecast start dates and various lengths of predictor and forecast windows not shown this observation is in agreement with the findings of ferro et al 2008 some member combinations perform better than others but without any other discriminating information adding more members seems to be the correct approach it can also be seen that the best combinations found by the ga algorithm the theoretical optimal points progressively improve as the number of members decreases except for the single member case this indicates that the information is present in the esp ensemble but we must find a way to extract it adequately this can be seen as the potential improvement for the forecast date i e the maximum improvement that could be possible to gain from selecting members perfectly as for the conditional methods ct and their variants both with discharge q and precipitation p the results vary by catchment the ct using available information performs better than full esp in the qc catchment but the opposite was observed in the bc catchment comparing ct results with and without having access to perfect information shows that merely having access to this information does not automatically improve the results this could be due to the fact that the contingency table is probabilistic and therefore contains a certain amount of uncertainty hence knowing the future state will not automatically mean that the ensemble members that are selected will perform better a more thorough investigation is presented in section 4 1 the analogue method performs similarly if not slightly worse to that of the full esp albeit with a certain variability based on the ensemble size none of the tested methods come close to systematically matching the ga optimal forecast skill this may be seen as an inability of the proposed methods to properly describe the uncertainty in the forecasting process and in the future forecast state in other words the factors that have been used to help identify future forecast states in the proposed methods do not provide enough insight to improve upon the full esp in a reliable way these results have to be interpreted carefully as they represent a single snapshot of the forecast performance for a single day and cover a single set of predictor and forecast periods the process was then repeated for each year in the dataset providing results for the years 1955 to 2004 for the bc catchment as shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows crps values for the 50 initial dates of forecast starting on july 1st of each available year for three esp sampling methods using a 90 day predictor period and a forward period of the same duration for the bc catchment a and qc catchment b in fig 5 the full esp method is compared to 1 the ct with precipitation as a predictor variable and 2 the ct with precipitation as a predictor but with perfect knowledge of the future precipitation classification for the bc catchment in 37 cases out of 50 the perfect information method scored the lowest crps values indicating its better forecast skill versus the other methods in the remaining cases the full esp method performed slightly better than the perfect information method results are similar for the qc catchment the 74 success rate seen with the perfect information method here may be the result of knowledge of the true future state in a categorical sense i e knowing if it will be wetter or dryer than average without actually specifying the precipitation amounts in other words improving long term precipitation forecast trends could significantly improve the esp performance however since the method is not systematically better even in the case of perfect knowledge there would still be some untapped potential that could perhaps be accessed by using other variables and predictors it is important to note that the results shown in figs 3 5 point to the full esp method being similar or slightly better than the analogue and ct methods depending on the number of ensemble members a series of tests on other forecast periods lead times and predictor period lengths showed similar results and the crps was typically better for full esp than for reduced size ensembles implementing the analogue or ct methods results not shown figs 6 and 7 show the results of the analysis of the ensemble member characteristics on forecasting performance for the bc catchment for the four previously defined indices these analyses were done for july 1st as the forecast issue date and were repeated 40 times from 1966 to 2005 considering 90 days before the forecast date and 90 days following the forecast date in fig 6 the histograms each include 200 values i e 40 years 5 members per year the x axis represents the relative difference between the predictor period of the selected esp member and the forward period the predictive variables are the temperature left column and precipitation right column and the three rows show the results when comparing the difference in means top row standard deviations center row and correlations bottom row the blue and red histograms show the results for the best and worst members respectively it can be seen that the distributions of both histograms are very similar and that none of the selected variables allowed generating a clear pathway to separate good members from bad ones fig 7 shows the distributions of the relative difference between 1 the averages of climate indices in the predictor period of each of five best worst members for the 40 forecast years and 2 the values of the associated forward period indices the four climate indices that were employed are the pacific north american pna multivariate el niño southern oscillation index mei pacific decadal oscillation pdo and southern oscillation index soi the results show that while there seems to be some minor differences in some of the distributions especially in the variability of the pdo and soi distributions these differences are not statistically significant and do not allow for efficient discrimination between the desirable and undesirable members the analyses in figs 6 and 7 were performed on a multitude of forecast dates predictor period durations and forecast lead times with similar results which are not shown these predictor variables thus seem insufficient to allow the identification of members that maximize the forecast skill 5 analysis and discussion in this study we proposed a procedure to quantify the theoretical potential of using historical weather observations as probable scenarios in an ensemble streamflow prediction approach for long term discharge forecasting typically all members in esp forecasting are considered as equally probable however in this study we used a procedure to determine the best possible combinations of members for different esp ensemble sizes the ga approach allowed finding these combinations in hindcasting mode with perfect knowledge about the hydrometeorological states to be forecasted while this approach is not available to the forecaster in real time the rationale however was to use it to quantify the theoretical limit that could be achieved using the historical climatology on hand various esp member selection techniques were tested to analyze their ranking as compared to the theoretical optimum and the full esp ensemble each method was tested with a range of parameters such as the initial date of forecast the duration of the predictor period and the lead time in almost all tests lower crps values could be obtained with smaller ensemble sizes but at the same time expected crps values increased if the members of the subset were selected randomly one important message obtained from this study is that when performing an esp forecast using climatology there is a strong chance that some members present in the dataset could possibly be excluded in order to improve the forecast skill in that sense decreasing the ensemble size can improve the forecast skill through the elimination of improbable scenarios this selection also carries a risk because a desirable member may be removed instead of an undesirable one in which case the forecast skill will degrade therefore research efforts should focus on increasing the ability to probabilistically categorize the future hydrological regime wetter or dryer than average and condition the esp member selection on those probabilities as noted previously many studies have investigated this very subject either through climate indices long term nwp forecasts or other means and the present study will help quantify the potential skill attainable with those methods as shown in figs 3 and 4 and from the numerous results obtained during the tests performed in this study the results of the ct and the analogue methods were highly variable and depended on the lead time the predictor period length the predictor variable the initial date of forecast and the catchment characteristics in the case of ct the method was not reliable enough to be recommended for use when the predictor was the streamflow or the precipitation ct perfect variants were implemented to better test the potential of the ct method as such it was conducted under conditions without uncertainty regarding precipitation during the forecast period on average ct perfect results were much better than those obtained using the full esp meaning that improving the overall forecasted precipitation category wet or dry accounts for a significant portion of the ability of the methods to select desirable members the skill could probably be further increased by finding better predictors than the average previous precipitation or streamflow for example in a multivariate setting adding information from climate indices and combinations thereof to the precipitation and temperature could be envisioned as well consideration could also be given to using other statistics than those used in this study the analogue method was generally less skillful than the full esp and this could be attributed to the same problem encountered with the ct method i e the predictor period variables are not good enough predictors for future inflows or precipitation although the results of the member selection methods shown herein did lead to forecast skill improvements the methods presented could be useful to researchers in esp forecasting and water resource management for two reasons first before implementing an esp forecasting system the procedure could be used in hindcasting mode to determine how much potential the forecast may yield given its specific parameters initial date predictor period duration and lead time available observation record this could serve as a reference to help manage any expectations and determine the limits of the approach before any more efforts are deployed second the procedure could be used to benchmark analyze and improve existing methods that are currently being used in practice to generate esp forecasts this would allow quantifying improvements on a relative scale with a known baseline value this type of evaluation could be repeated as many times as needed in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the method s performance the proposed method to investigate relationships and correlations between desirable members and hydroclimatic indicators could also be used to help develop member selection methods in the general tests performed in this study no strong relationship was found in other words simply considering the average value of precipitation or temperature during the predictor period was not enough to indicate the forward period characteristics more complex predictors could potentially allow such a relationship to be exposed there are many other metrics and combinations of metrics that could be investigated including for instance those in feng et al 2016 hossain et al 2018 hossain et al 2019 and konapala et al 2018 non linear combination methods could also be tested with this approach which was out of the scope of this paper this study proposes a method to quantify the skill of an esp forecast using reduced ensemble sizes by selecting fewer but more desirable members however there are some general limitations to using this approach first the historical dataset must be long enough to represent multiple climatological states over the catchment in order to have a realistic chance of portraying the climatological uncertainty selecting a subset of an already small ensemble would prove difficult as the transition probabilities would be ill defined second the fact that the ensemble size changes during the subsetting process induces a bias in the crps calculation as shown in ferro et al 2008 this effect was not explicitly accounted for in this study but the impact should be minimal because 1 the response is similar to what would be expected with the corrections and 2 even with our best methods and attempts we were unsuccessful at identifying which of the members in the reduced ensemble should be selected therefore even for a given size ensemble we were unable to improve the method also climate change signals could be present in the observed dataset used to define the esp members there is a legitimate claim that esp members from multiple decades ago could be unrepresentative of the current climatological state in such cases while care should be taken when building the esp ensemble determining how to do so is a challenge in itself it is possible that by weighting the members differently or by excluding some entirely a more reliable ensemble could be built another limitation relates to the selection of catchments used in this study the two catchments are snowmelt dominated and thus have somewhat similar hydrological regimes perhaps this method could provide different results in contrasting climate regimes although the identification of the maximum potential skill would probably be similar finally it is important to note that this study did not make use of pre or post processing of ensemble members but rather used historical data directly the pre processing step could conceivably use the quantification and selection methods in this study to improve the accuracy of processed ensembles for long term streamflow forecasting 6 conclusion this study presents a procedure to quantify the potential skill of ensemble streamflow prediction esp using historical climatological data in typical implementations of esp all available members are used to add diversity to the ensemble and all members are considered equally likely to occur in the future however knowing some information about the future state can help focus the esp member selection on the expected conditions one way of doing so is by removing members that are unlikely to be realized in the future this study describes a method to determine the best possible members for any ensemble size and to weigh the risk and potential benefit of using a member selection approach three approaches were tested and while two ct and analogue did not lead to skill improvement the ct perfect procedure allowed to determine that classifying the climatological state of the forecast period could improve long term forecasting accuracy the maximum potential improvement was quantified using a ga method to find the best combination of members for any ensemble size it provides a means of comparison between results of various methods such as the random selection of members and the theoretical optimum to the full esp ensemble this quantification could help improve esp forecasting by providing a more consistent baseline than relative reductions in crps as is typically done in the literature finally a method was proposed to help differentiate desirable from the undesirable members in a consistent manner for esp forecasting using the theoretically optimal esp members properties and correlating them to hydroclimatological indices in hindcasting mode although the results show that the selected variables are not good predictors of this relationship the method could be employed in future research to attempt to determine the most efficient predictors and quantify their levels of success credit authorship contribution statement behmard sabzipour conceptualization data curation
