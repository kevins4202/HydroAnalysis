19115,the photocatalytic decomposition of bromate bro3 a possible human carcinogen has attracted much attention because of its high efficiency and easier combination with ultraviolet uv disinfection in water treatment plants in this study the fe ii ti iv layered double hydroxides ldhs have been made through a facile hydrothermal method and used as an alternative photocatalyst for reduction of bro3 ldhs prepared at a fe ti molar ratio of 0 5 and ph 7 0 denoted as feti 0 5 ph 7 0 exhibited the highest bro3 removal efficiency removal rate constant 0 067 0 002 min 1 compared to commercial tio2 and the ldhs prepared at different phs or different fe ti ratios the presence of alcohols in water enhanced the photocatalytic reduction of bro3 due to the greater abundance of electrons caused by alcohols effectively reacting with holes the neutral ph also favors the degradation of bro3 however the presence of nitrate and nitrite can inhibit the degradation process due to their reactions with hydrated electrons eaq and hydrogen atom radicals h cyclic degradation runs and magnetic separation techniques demonstrated the superior reusability of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh for bro3 removal the removal rate of bro3 under uv was higher than that without uv indicating that the decomposition proceeded primarily via a photo reductive mechanism induced by eaq and h and thus degradation pathways are proposed moreover when tested in tap water greater than 90 of bro3 was removed after 60 min reaction in uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh systems in the presence of 5 v v methanol this demonstrates the high potential for such systems for removing bro3 from disinfected drinking water this work may shed lights on the design of effective photocatalysts for the enhanced degradation of bro3 in water plants and the influence of constituents in raw water on the treatment keywords alcohols addition bromate removal reductive species tap water uv layered double hydroxides system 1 introduction bromate bro3 is an oxyhalide disinfection by products which is produced through oxidation ozonation or chlorination of bromide br containing water haag and holgne 1983 weinberg et al 2003 generally the concentration of br is 14 200 μg l in natural fresh water jung et al 2017 and 67 mg l in seawater flury and papritz 1993 due to dwindling freshwater reserves and increasing global water demand the use of br containing seawater in water treatment has become common xiao et al 2017c when the water has a br concentration over 20 μg l bro3 will form during the ozonation process von gunten 2003 since bro3 exerts mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on human beings campbell 2006 crofton 2006 kurokawa et al 1990 the international agency for research on cancer iarc has classified bro3 as a group 2b or possible human carcinogen accordingly the world health organization the united states environmental protection agency european commission and ministry of health p r china have strictly regulated the bro3 concentration to be lower than 10 μg l in drinking water there are a variety of treatment methods to eliminate bro3 in water such as biological remediation davidson et al 2011 chemical reduction wang et al 2009 photocatalytic process xiao et al 2017b and electrochemical technique mao et al 2014 techniques effectively reduce bro3 by using glucose starch pyruvate acetate or ethanol as electron donors hijnen et al 1995 van ginkel et al 2005 however the application of biological technique may be limited due to the continuous release of biomass and excessive organics during the removal process chemical reduction technologies are efficient and cost effective in decomposing bro3 using zero valent iron hijnen et al 1999 ferrous ions siddiqui et al 1994 activated carbon adsorption reduction huang and chen 2004 and photocatalysis huang et al 2014 compared to other reduction methods photocatalytic processes exhibited high efficiency in bro3 degradation more stable performance over a wide ph range and easier combination with uv disinfection which indicates that it has a high potential for practical applications in water treatment plants as known tio2 heterogeneous photocatalysis could efficiently reduce bro3 to br mainly because of the photo excited reaction mills et al 1996 noguchi et al 2002 further studies on tio2 coated matrix were carried out in order to increase the migration of photo generated electrons e and thus enhance the removal of bro3 for instance bro3 degradation was promoted on the n type tio2 coated with graphene huang et al 2014 or pseudoboehmite hong et al 2003 or co doped with graphene oxide go and fluorine atoms f with 001 facets zhang et al 2017 or in the presence of alcohols with uv illumination lin et al 2016 probably due to the suppressed recombination of electron hole pairs and improved e transport although heterogeneous photocatalytic systems have been proven to be robust in decomposing bro3 mills et al 1996 the process appears uneconomic and impractical due to the poor reusability of heterogeneous photocatalysts many literature have shown that layered double hydroxides ldhs could be reused as adsorbents more than four times chitrakar et al 2011 zhong et al 2013 chitrakar et al 2011 reported that feal ldhs remained stable during 30 days supported by no significant decline in bro3 reduction also ldhs with large surface area would improve the adsorption of contaminants onto the composites which might thus contribute to the enhanced photo reduction of bro3 considering that titanium ti containing materials have shown e induced rapid reactions under uv illumination buxton et al 1988 we are inspired to design the ldhs that incorporate titanium the uv feti ldhs system was thereby proposed as a method to decompose bro3 to the best of our knowledge few studies have explored the photocatalytic ability of ldhs in degrading bro3 in this study feti ldhs photocatalysts were prepared characterized and used to remove bro3 in both deionized water and tap water with uv illumination the performance of feti ldhs was evaluated and compared with that of the commercial tio2 the dramatic influence of several constituents in water such as alcohols nitrate nitrite and hydrogen ion concentration i e ph on the degradation of bro3 is reported also the reusability and stability of feti ldhs as well as the mechanisms of bro3 decomposition were investigated in the absence or presence of alcohols the degradation pathway was proposed for the uv feti ldhs process in the presence of alcohols 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fecl2 4h2o ticl4 nabro3 nabr naoh h2so4 methanol ethanol and propanol were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china the commercial tio2 was obtained from evonik degussa specialty chemicals co ltd all the chemical reagents applied in this work were of analytical grade 18 2 mω cm deionized di water was used throughout the study 0 1 mm bromate bro3 samples were prepared by diluting a stock solution of 10 mm in di water tap water was collected from local water plants that treat raw water of yangtze river for testing the performance of uv feti ldhs systems major characteristics of tap water are summarized in table s1 2 2 preparation of feti ldhs nanoparticles the methodology for preparation of feti ldhs has been described elsewhere chitrakar et al 2011 briefly a mixture of 0 1 mole fecl2 4h2o and 0 02 mole ticl4 at a fe ti molar ratio of 5 was dissolved in 60 ml ultrapure water the resulting solution was added slowly to 150 ml of di water with stirring at 25 c and ph 7 0 0 2 and ph 9 0 0 2 which was maintained through continuous addition of 1 mol l naoh subsequently the suspensions were transferred into 350 cm3 teflon tubes and maintained at 120 c for 24 h the product was isolated via centrifuging washing with ultrapure water and finally drying overnight at 60 c the feti ldhs were also prepared at different fe ti molar ratios i e 1 and 0 5 by dissolving 0 02 and 0 01 mole fecl2 4h2o respectively with 0 02 mole ticl4 in 60 ml ultrapure water these composites were denoted feti n mainly including ferrous hydroxide and titanic hydroxide figs 1 and s1 where n represents molar ratios of fe ti n 0 5 1 and 5 2 3 characterization and detection techniques the x ray powder pattern of the sample was recorded using an x ray diffractometer xrd d8 advance bruker corp with cu ka radiation operating at 40 kv voltage and 40 ma current patterns of feti composites were recorded from 5 to 80 in 2θ with a 0 02 step width and a scanning rate of 2 4 min 1 the morphology of feti ldhs was evaluated using a transmission electron microscope tem fei tecnai g2 20 surface elemental compositions of feti ldhs were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific thermal analysis experiments were investigated by a thermogravimetric analysis tg dta discovery thermogravimetric analyzer ta instrument with nitrogen gas n2 as a carrier gas at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 up to 800 c the surface of feti ldhs was investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 5700 thermo nicolet corp the specific surface area of the sample was determined on an asap2460 analyzer following the multipoint n2 adsorption brunauer emmett teller bet method asap2460 micromeritics atlanta usa after degassing samples at 120 c for 1 h spectrophotometric measurements were conducted using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 3600 shimadzu in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm photoluminescence pl spectra were measured at room temperature on a fluorescence spectrophotometer fls980 edinburgh instruments at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm elemental analyses were performed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes agilent solution ph was determined with a ph meter la ph10 hach and the calibration using standard buffers at ph 3 50 6 50 7 10 8 50 and 10 50 was made routinely before measurements at room temperature the concentrations of methanol and its oxidization products were determined by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector 6890n fid agilent inorganic anions bro3 and br were quantified by an ion chromatograph dionex ics 1000 a dionex as19 analytical column 4 250 mm and an ag19 guard column 4 50 mm were applied to separate bro3 from br the detection limits were about 100 nm for all anions 2 4 photocatalytic experiments the photo reactor and methodology for illumination experiments have been described elsewhere liu et al 2014 briefly the cylindrical photo reactor described in our previous studies had a volume v of 1 6 l and was equipped with a low pressure mercury uv lamp uv l cnlight china xiao et al 2017b unless otherwise noted experiments were designed and carried out at a neutral ph which is a typical ph of drinking water the photo reactor was thermostated at 25 0 5 c all the experiments were conducted in cylindrical quartz tube reactors without any gas sparging the tube reactor has a diameter of 20 mm and a length of 20 cm in the tube the solution took the length of 17 cm from the bottom and the headspace of air took 3 cm at the top in addition there was a stopper at the opening of the tube thus gas transfer from the air to the solution is expected to be limited prior to photocatalytic reduction of bro3 a dark experiment was conducted without uv illumination to investigate the adsorption of the anion on feti ldhs samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and filtered by 0 22 μm membrane to measure the residual bro3 in the solution all experiments were repeated independently at least twice and average values along with the standard deviation are presented 3 results and discussions 3 1 physical characterization and composition of catalyst fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of composites with different fe ti prepared at ph 7 0 and ph 9 0 these composites exhibited moderately symmetric reflections of the basal 003 006 and 009 planes which is characteristic of a typical layered structure chitrakar et al 2011 zhong et al 2013 layered structures were observed in the tem images shown in fig 2 the slight dissymmetric reflections at the corresponding degree fig 1 were possibly attributable to the changes of lattice parameter in different samples compared to that prepared at ph 9 0 the feti 0 5 samples at ph 7 0 produced significantly higher intensity and sharper peaks suggesting that the crystallinity of composites was greatly enhanced under neutral conditions from fig 1 as the fe ti molar ratio increased from 0 5 to 5 at the same ph the characteristic peaks 003 and 009 of hydrotalcites decreased and the 006 peak changed little the reduced intensity of peaks 003 and 009 with increasing fe ti implies that low loading of iron species enhanced generation of brucite like compounds the reduced intensity of peaks 003 and 009 with increasing fe ti implies that a small iron species loading enhanced generation of brucite like compounds this is probably attributed to the increasing of positive surface charge yang et al 2012 accordingly the bonds between double hydroxide layers and chlorides in the interlayer would be strengthened in the existence of iron species cavani et al 1991 however if too much iron was on the brucite like sheets then the crystal structure of the feti ldhs might be destroyed and amorphous and non brucite composites might be formed similar phenomena were also observed by yang et al 2012 thereby there was an optimal fe ti ratio of about 0 5 at which the maximum bro3 degradation ability and the highest density of free electrons were achieved as will be shown in the following sections moreover as shown in fig 1 the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 composites exhibited xrd patterns of iron oxide jcpds 26 1136 and jcpds 29 0713 anatase icdd 70 6826 and rutile tio2 icdd 82 514 which was in agreement with that of commercial tio2 and goethite to investigate the composition of feti composites the chemical analysis of cations anions and water molecules was investigated and the results were shown in table s2 of supporting information the chemical formula of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh was determined to be fe0 29ti0 71 oh 2 cl1 42 0 49 h2o by icp aes and tg dta the actual fe ti 0 42 in ldh was slightly lower than the designed value of 0 5 due to the volatility of ticl4 moreover tem was used to characterize the morphology of feti ldhs as shown in fig 2a the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh are sheet like nanoparticles with an average size of 10 nm with the fe ti ratio of 5 fig 2c many composite particles reached up to 60 nm thereby the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh consists of much smaller nanoparticles than other feti ldhs also the bet surface area of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh was determined as 183 3 m2 g which was approximately 1 9 2 1 and 2 8 times higher than the feti 1 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 5 ph 7 0 ldh and the feti 0 5 ph 9 0 ldh respectively as shown in table s2 these observations indicate that small iron species loading on the composites fe ti molar ratio of 0 5 resulted in the decrease of particle size as well as the increase in surface area 3 2 photoluminescence and uv absorbance of catalyst fig 3 illustrates photoluminescence pl emission spectra of feti ldhs at excitation wavelength of 300 nm obviously the emission bands of composites ranged from 380 to 550 nm similar phenomena were observed by huang et al 2014 and the authors reported that the luminescence from localized tio2 containing composites surface states was attributed to the recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs as shown in fig 3 pl intensity of the feti ldhs decreased with a decline in loaded iron species at ph 7 0 but all significantly lower than tio2 this was probably due to the smaller particle size at the lower iron loading as presented in fig 2 the time required for the migration of electron e from where it is excited inside the feti ldhs crystal to the surface of crystal was reduced when the size of feti ldhs nanoparticles become smaller hence the recombination of electron and hole was greatly hindered for small particles the feti ldhs compared to that of large particles the commercial tio2 1 0 μm in size for similar reasons the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh has lowest emission intensity than other feti ldhs fig 4 further depicts uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of feti ldhs the intensity of light absorption by feti ldhs at wavelengths longer than 300 nm was found to follow the following sequence ranging from the highest to the lowest the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 1 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 5 ph 7 0 ldh and the feti 0 5 ph 9 0 ldh this result shows that a decreased amount of iron species integrated on ldhs composites surface significantly improved uv light absorption ability probably because of the small particle size and high specific surface area table s2 and fig 2 reportedly it is possible to determine band gap energies by using the kubelka munk treatment on the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of nanostructures escobedo morales et al 2007 thus we present the transformed kubelka munk function versus the energy of light in fig s2 compared with that of commercial tio2 about 3 2 ev the band gap energy of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 1 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 5 ph 7 0 ldh and the feti 0 5 ph 9 0 ldh was determined to be 1 51 1 89 2 09 and 2 23 ev respectively these values were obtained as the value on the x axis of the tangent to the linear portion of the absorption spectra in a rising region fig s2 the narrowed band gap energy in fig s2 was possibly attributed to the formation of feo band in the composites which was shown in ftir spectra 578 5 cm 1 of fig s3 the results in figs 3 and 4 suggest that the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh may have higher density of free electrons under uv radiation and thus a higher efficacy in photo degradation of bro3 3 3 reduction efficiency of ldhs for bro3 fig 5 shows degradation of bro3 in the uv feti ldhs process as a function of reaction time in the presence of 5 methanol approximately 17 50 and 82 of bro3 were removed within 60 min under uv irradiation using feti 0 5 ph 9 0 feti 5 ph 7 0 and feti 1 ph 7 0 respectively in contrast feti 0 5 ph 7 0 could remove 99 9 of bro3 from the initial concentration of 0 1 mm after 60 min less than 10 of bro3 removals was due to the adsorption on feti ldhs prior to photocatalytic reduction as shown in fig s4 the removals of bro3 by adsorption on feti 0 5 ph 9 0 feti 5 ph 7 0 feti 1 ph 7 0 and feti 0 5 ph 7 0 was 6 9 7 9 8 8 and 10 at 120 min respectively this corresponds well to their specific surface areas in table s2 the adsorption took 60 min to reach an equilibrium also feti 0 5 ph 7 0 exhibited higher bro3 decay rates when illuminated by uv compared to the rates by the ldh without uv and by uv without the ldh as depicted in fig s5 this indicates that the decomposition of bro3 in uv feti ldhs system was dominantly due to photocatalytic reduction instead of adsorption or direct photolysis the first order reaction rate constant k of bromate degradation was 0 067 0 002 min 1 with feti 0 5 ph 7 0 which was greater than that of the commercial tio2 0 021 min 1 in fig s6 at the same dosage and greater than that for tio2 reported in previous studies 0 0094 0 059 min 1 huang et al 2014 xiao et al 2017b feti 0 5 ph 7 0 was thus selected as the photocatalyst for the following experiments because of its high photocatalytic efficacy in reducing bromate 3 4 the effect of the type and concentration of alcohol catalyst dosage and ph on degradation kinetics of bromate reportedly the concentration of alcohols was around 0 03 μg l in surface water in europe arp et al 2005 0 002 0 012 mg l in the atlantic ocean beale et al 2013 williams et al 2004 and 220 400 mg l in oilfield wastewater effluent ren et al 2012 the alcohol containing wastewater effluent is expected to greatly elevate the alcohol concentrations in the receiving water bodies and also the raw water taken by the water treatment plants nearby alcohols such as methanol ethanol and n propanol are effective hole scavengers thus it is interesting to study the influence of alcohols on the degradation of bro3 in the advanced reduction system for drinking water treatment their effects on bro3 removal was studied in tio2 heterogeneous photocatalytic systems lin et al 2016 although mechanisms of the enhanced photocatalytic reduction in the presence of alcohols were proposed the evidence is indirect as alcohols degradation products were not measured in addition there has been no report on bro3 degradation with uv feti ldhs in the presence of various concentrations of alcohols the effect of methanol concentration on the removal of bro3 was thus evaluated in uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh systems as shown in fig 6 a bro3 reduction was enhanced with the concentration of methanol the dose of 5 methanol facilitated the degradation of bro3 to higher than 99 9 in uv feti ldh systems at the end of the 60 min treatment lin et al 2016 reported that the bro3 reduction was noticeably increased with methanol addition which was primarily ascribed to the suppressed recombination of electron hole pairs as alcohols act as hole scavengers however as methanol concentration further increased there was no obvious promotion of bro3 removal in uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh systems it is possibly due to that a low concentration of methanol 5 was capable enough of scavenging h thus excessive methanol did not significantly improve the suppression of recombination process resulting in a minor elevation in bro3 removal fig 6b shows the influence of alcohol type on bro3 degradation at constant concentrations of alcohols 5 v v there were similar levels of bro3 degradation at the same catalyst dosages this indicates that the increase in the carbon number of alcohols did not remarkably affect the decomposition of bro3 probably because the oxidation of alcohols did not involve breaking carbon carbon bonds fig 6b also shows the effect of catalyst dosage on bro3 degradation in the presence of alcohols as shown in fig 6b a ldh dosage of 0 5 g l showed the highest degradation of bro3 after 60 min 99 9 which was greater than that for a dosage of 1 g l 82 similar trends have been observed in other photocatalytic systems such as bro3 degradation by c60 modified bi2moo6 under visible light irradiation and phenol degradation by tio2 under uv irradiation hong et al 2001 zhao et al 2011 the elevated concentration of photocatalysts at 1 g l ldh may have led to more significant aggregation of ldh in the solution and thereby resulted in the lower degradation performance for bro3 clearly there was similar degradation behavior for all ldhs at all dosages in the presence of ethanol and propanol this indicates the type of alcohols played a less important role in the degradation of bro3 methanol was selected as the representative alcohol to investigate the effectiveness and mechanisms of bro3 removal by uv ldhs systems because of its relatively simple structure fig 7 a shows removal efficiencies of bro3 at different phs the degradation of bro3 was promoted when ph increased from 3 5 to 7 1 but declined when it increased from 7 1 to 10 5 the fastest decomposition was obtained at ph 7 1 fig 7a c this is probably due to the decrease in surface charge as ph increased which is shown by zeta potentials in fig 7d at ph values higher than the isoelectric point 6 8 the surface would be negatively charged there was less bro3 adsorbed on feti ldhs because of the interaction between the anion and the negatively charged surface of photocatalyst hence a lower decay rate of bro3 was observed at ph 7 1 in uv feti ldh processes as illustrated in fig 7 at a ph below the isoelectric point the number of adsorption sites may increase because ldhs composites became predominantly positively charged this would contribute to more bro3 adsorbed on the surface of feti ldhs thus resulting in the enhancement of bro3 decay however we noticed a remarkable inhibition of bro3 degradation at ph 7 1 suggesting that solution ph might affect the photocatalytic decomposition of bro3 by another route zhang et al observed that bro3 removal was hindered at ph lower than 5 5 and totally retarded at ph 1 5 in tio2 photocatalytic systems and the authors demonstrated that the hindrance of bro3 degradation at an acidic ph was due to the loss of e and the generation of oxidizing radicals zhang et al 2010 moreover it has been reported that ph could regulate the interconversion between hydrated electrons eaq and hydrogen atom radicals h li et al 2012 xiao et al 2017b for instance the decline in the solution ph contributed to an increase in eaq consumption and further promoting h formation according to the research reported by our group xiao et al 2017b the effective quantum efficiency for bro3 removal induced by h was about one third of that induced by eaq the yield difference between h and eaq might thus account for the significant decrease of degradation kinetics of bro3 under acidic environments therefore these observations substantiate that uv feti ldh systems can remove bro3 from drinking water which normally has a ph near neutral 3 5 stability in reactivity after long term storage and reusability as uv feti ldhs systems were proposed to be an alternative technique for bro3 degradation it is significant to test whether such a process was stable and whether the ldhs can be reused for multiple times to evaluate the stability of the reactivity of feti ldhs after preparation samples of feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh were stored in a tightly capped bottle 15 cm3 for 1 15 30 and 60 days at 20 0 5 c according to fig 8 a the 60 min removal percentage of bro3 by uv ldh systems stayed around 95 after 30 days storage removal at 60 min dropped to 79 after 60 days storage probably due to the partial oxidation of fe2 to fe3 in the ldh structure chitrakar et al 2011 similar phenomena were observed in previous studies where bro3 was decomposed by fe ii al iii ldhs alone zhong et al 2013 additionally the photocatalytic performance of feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh exposed to air during storage was lower than that of the sealed ldh fig s7 this is primarily due to the increased formation of fe3 when stored in air as evidenced by the fact that the color of the particles changes from grey green to mahogany fig s7 thereby we recommend that the nanoparticles be sealed and stored at low temperatures lower than room temperatures but above zero degree in dry and dark conditions fig 8b further shows the reusability of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh nearly complete bro3 decomposition 99 9 was achieved after 60 min for the first run subsequently the feti ldh was separated through filtration washed by ultrapure water and ultimately dried in a vacuum before the use in the repeated bro3 degradation experiment for testing its reusability the average weight loss of the feti ldh was 23 5 in each recycle six repeated experiments were carried out using the same recycling procedure for the same feti ldh results show that the uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh could be reused for multiple times considering that significant bro3 removal greater than 85 was obtained within 60 min for the sixth cycle additionally compared to filtration 67 2 separation efficiencies of the feti ldh was remarkably improved via magnetic separation techniques 98 6 as shown in fig s8 3 6 the effect of no2 and no3 it was reported that reactive reductants such as eaq and h could be formed in the tio2 and ferrous iron containing photocatalytic systems potterill et al 1936 zhang et al 2010 to elucidate the mechanism of bro3 removal in the uv feti ldh process no3 and no2 were employed as quenchers to study their separate inhibitory effects on bro3 degradation the direct photolysis of no3 and no2 was negligible due to their weak uv absorption and low quantum yields at 254 nm herrmann 2007 xiao et al 2017a no3 and no2 are good scavengers for eaq eqs 1 and 2 whereas only no2 is good quenchers for h eq 4 buxton et al 1988 gonzalez et al 2004 1 n o 3 e a q n o 3 2 k 1 9 7 10 9 m 1 s 1 2 n o 2 e a q n o 2 2 k 2 4 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 n o 3 h n o 3 h k 3 1 4 10 6 m 1 s 1 4 n o 2 h n o o h k 4 7 1 10 8 m

20 after 60 min in the presence of equal amounts of no3 and no2 0 4 mm respectively since no3 is capable of scavenging eaq but unable to quench h bro3 reacts with h 15 times faster than no3 does as shown by rate constants for reactions described by eqs 3 and 5 the moderate inhibition of bro3 decomposition by no3 demonstrated that a significant role of eaq in the process the greater inhibition of bro3 decay by no2 in 60 min 80 demonstrated that h also played an important role in decomposition of bro3 during the first 10 min of reaction the inhibition of bro3 decay by no2 was not stronger than that of no3 indicating that the reduction of bro3 was initially dominated by the reaction with eaq it may have taken a while for h to accumulate as the products of the reactions of eaq with water and h eqs 6 and 13 to a sufficient concentration so that h can have significant contribution to bro3 reduction approximately 19 bro3 removal in no2 solutions within 60 min was mainly attributed to adsorption onto feti 0 5 ph 7 0 as shown by the results in fig s9 thereby eaq and h appear to be the dominant reactive species which were responsible for bro3 decomposition in uv feti ldhs systems 3 7 degradation pathway to explain degradation pathway of bro3 in the uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh system identification and quantitative determination of major products were investigated fig 10 a depicts generation of various bromine br containing products and the total masses of br during the process of bro3 degradation by uv feti ldh systems in fig 10a degradation of bro3 in the photocatalytic process was accompanied with the increase of br concentration within 60 min the total bromine remained comparatively constant in the range of 0 09 0 0956 mm in the solution this indicates that partially reduced intermediates react more rapidly than does bro3 xiao et al 2017b a small amount 4 4 10 of bromine was believed to remain adsorbed onto the ldh which is consistent with that about 19 br containing compounds 0 019 mm adsorbed onto the composites in fig s9 to gain insights into the role played by alcohols in removing bro3 in the water in the uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh process the removal of methanol and its products formed during the process were further investigated as illustrated in fig 10b higher than 99 5 degradation of methanol was achieved carbon dioxide co2 was the primary product of methanol degradation as indicated by the nearly complete removal of total organic carbon toc fig 10b also the inset of fig 10b shows that only a small amount of methyl formate 55 μg l was formed via reaction of methanol and formic acid it can be further concluded that the obvious increase in decomposition of bro3 in the presence of alcohols was mainly attributed to highly efficient formation of electrons by applying alcohols as h quenchers scavenging of h by methanol could also have secondary effects by producing oxidized species that could interact with intermediates of bro3 reduction however the intermediates too evanescent to be detected in the presence of methanol additionally the xrd spectra of feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh after photocatalytic reaction were analyzed fig s10 clearly a peak for amorphous titanium oxybromide was observed along with peaks associated with a mixture of crystalline goethite anatase and rutile titanium dioxide and the ldh residue based on the previous discussion a pathway for degradation of bro3 on the feti ldh with uv illumination is proposed in scheme 1 jung et al 2014 xiao et al 2017b the destruction of bro3 occurred by adsorption onto the ldhs followed by photocatalytic reduction adsorption occurred through ion exchange between cl and bro3 and reduction to br occurred by reaction with eaq and h subsequently the innocuous products br entered into the solution via exchange with cl notably the photocatalytic reduction of bro3 was enhanced in the presence of alcohols co2 as well as methyl formate hcooch3 were predominant products of oxidation of methanol contributing to h scavenging and eaq yield enhancement reportedly eaq is one of the most reactive radicals buxton et al 1988 siefermann and abel 2011 and always takes part in reductive reactions at diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 according to scheme 1 and eqs 7 11 buxton et al 1988 siddiqui et al 1994 eaq produced in the uv feti ldhs system can react rapidly with bro3 and br was the major br containing product notably eaq could synchronously be converted into h by reaction with h and h2o buxton et al 1988 via eqs 6 and 12 conversely h can form eaq by reaction with oh eq 13 indicating a significant role of ph in bro3 degradation by regulating the yields of h and eaq 6 e a q h 2 o h o h k 6 1 9 10 1 m 1 s 1 7 e a q b r o

was the yangtze river and the results are compared to those obtained with deionized di water in fig 11 this figure shows that concentrations of bro3 decreased with time after 60 min concentrations of bro3 in both waters were lower in the presence of uv feti ldh than with uv alone the degradation percentage of bro3 was approximately 90 in tap water and 99 9 in di water after 60 min the results suggest that significant removal of bro3 could be achieved following disinfection in real water treatment plants if our uv feti ldh system is used in the absence of alcohols however the degradation percentage of bro3 in the tap water is expected to be lower than what is shown in fig 11 as demonstrated in fig 6a the degradation percentage of bro3 in tap water was lower than that in di water due to the existence of radical quenchers in tap water such as nitrate table s1 in addition the concentration of dissolved oxygen in di and tap water remained 8 mg l during the degradation process as shown in fig s11 even if the rate constants of oxygen reacting with eaq or h 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 are higher than that of bro3 reacting with them 3 4 109 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively and the concentration of dissolved oxygen 0 25 mm is higher than that of bro3 0 1 mm initially the negligible competition of dissolved oxygen for eaq and h is likely due to that bro3 can be adsorbed onto the surface of ldh as demonstrated by fig s4 the negatively charged bro3 underwent electrostatic attraction with fe2 or ti4 on the surface of ldh resulting in significant adsorption thus the elevation of bro3 concentration in the near surface region of ldh could have resulted in almost no competition of dissolved oxygen for eaq and h 4 conclusions feti ldhs were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method and used for the first time as an alternative photocatalyst in advanced reduction of bro3 for water treatment the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh exhibited a higher bro3 removal efficiency than commercial tio2 and other feti ldhs prepared at other ph values and other fe ti ratios after 60 min almost complete degradation of bro3 99 9 was observed when using the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh under uv irradiation in the presence of 5 alcohols the presence of alcohols resulted in the enhanced photocatalytic removal of bro3 mainly because alcohols are hole scavengers in uv feti ldh processes the results suggest that bro3 could be effectively removed using our uv feti ldh system in water treatment in the absence of alcohols the efficacy in reducing bro3 would be lower due to insufficient electron donors cyclic degradation runs and magnetic separation techniques further demonstrated the superior reusability of the ldh for bro3 removal quenching and adsorption experiments demonstrated a predominant role of eaq and h in reducing bro3 over the adsorption in uv feti ldh systems furthermore mass balance calculation of bromine showed that br was the major product and degradation pathways were proposed accordingly large concentrations of nitrate 0 4 mm reduced the amount of bro3 degraded primarily due to scavenging of photo generated electrons by nitrate nevertheless the feti ldh was proposed as a promising photocatalyst for bro3 degradation feti ldhs are also promising in the removal of other contaminants such as clox x 1 2 3 and 4 ioy y 1 3 and 6 and seo4 2 in water treatment plants due to their similar chemical properties to bro3 moreover the experimental methods for catalyzer synthesis could be useful for other

19115,the photocatalytic decomposition of bromate bro3 a possible human carcinogen has attracted much attention because of its high efficiency and easier combination with ultraviolet uv disinfection in water treatment plants in this study the fe ii ti iv layered double hydroxides ldhs have been made through a facile hydrothermal method and used as an alternative photocatalyst for reduction of bro3 ldhs prepared at a fe ti molar ratio of 0 5 and ph 7 0 denoted as feti 0 5 ph 7 0 exhibited the highest bro3 removal efficiency removal rate constant 0 067 0 002 min 1 compared to commercial tio2 and the ldhs prepared at different phs or different fe ti ratios the presence of alcohols in water enhanced the photocatalytic reduction of bro3 due to the greater abundance of electrons caused by alcohols effectively reacting with holes the neutral ph also favors the degradation of bro3 however the presence of nitrate and nitrite can inhibit the degradation process due to their reactions with hydrated electrons eaq and hydrogen atom radicals h cyclic degradation runs and magnetic separation techniques demonstrated the superior reusability of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh for bro3 removal the removal rate of bro3 under uv was higher than that without uv indicating that the decomposition proceeded primarily via a photo reductive mechanism induced by eaq and h and thus degradation pathways are proposed moreover when tested in tap water greater than 90 of bro3 was removed after 60 min reaction in uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh systems in the presence of 5 v v methanol this demonstrates the high potential for such systems for removing bro3 from disinfected drinking water this work may shed lights on the design of effective photocatalysts for the enhanced degradation of bro3 in water plants and the influence of constituents in raw water on the treatment keywords alcohols addition bromate removal reductive species tap water uv layered double hydroxides system 1 introduction bromate bro3 is an oxyhalide disinfection by products which is produced through oxidation ozonation or chlorination of bromide br containing water haag and holgne 1983 weinberg et al 2003 generally the concentration of br is 14 200 μg l in natural fresh water jung et al 2017 and 67 mg l in seawater flury and papritz 1993 due to dwindling freshwater reserves and increasing global water demand the use of br containing seawater in water treatment has become common xiao et al 2017c when the water has a br concentration over 20 μg l bro3 will form during the ozonation process von gunten 2003 since bro3 exerts mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on human beings campbell 2006 crofton 2006 kurokawa et al 1990 the international agency for research on cancer iarc has classified bro3 as a group 2b or possible human carcinogen accordingly the world health organization the united states environmental protection agency european commission and ministry of health p r china have strictly regulated the bro3 concentration to be lower than 10 μg l in drinking water there are a variety of treatment methods to eliminate bro3 in water such as biological remediation davidson et al 2011 chemical reduction wang et al 2009 photocatalytic process xiao et al 2017b and electrochemical technique mao et al 2014 techniques effectively reduce bro3 by using glucose starch pyruvate acetate or ethanol as electron donors hijnen et al 1995 van ginkel et al 2005 however the application of biological technique may be limited due to the continuous release of biomass and excessive organics during the removal process chemical reduction technologies are efficient and cost effective in decomposing bro3 using zero valent iron hijnen et al 1999 ferrous ions siddiqui et al 1994 activated carbon adsorption reduction huang and chen 2004 and photocatalysis huang et al 2014 compared to other reduction methods photocatalytic processes exhibited high efficiency in bro3 degradation more stable performance over a wide ph range and easier combination with uv disinfection which indicates that it has a high potential for practical applications in water treatment plants as known tio2 heterogeneous photocatalysis could efficiently reduce bro3 to br mainly because of the photo excited reaction mills et al 1996 noguchi et al 2002 further studies on tio2 coated matrix were carried out in order to increase the migration of photo generated electrons e and thus enhance the removal of bro3 for instance bro3 degradation was promoted on the n type tio2 coated with graphene huang et al 2014 or pseudoboehmite hong et al 2003 or co doped with graphene oxide go and fluorine atoms f with 001 facets zhang et al 2017 or in the presence of alcohols with uv illumination lin et al 2016 probably due to the suppressed recombination of electron hole pairs and improved e transport although heterogeneous photocatalytic systems have been proven to be robust in decomposing bro3 mills et al 1996 the process appears uneconomic and impractical due to the poor reusability of heterogeneous photocatalysts many literature have shown that layered double hydroxides ldhs could be reused as adsorbents more than four times chitrakar et al 2011 zhong et al 2013 chitrakar et al 2011 reported that feal ldhs remained stable during 30 days supported by no significant decline in bro3 reduction also ldhs with large surface area would improve the adsorption of contaminants onto the composites which might thus contribute to the enhanced photo reduction of bro3 considering that titanium ti containing materials have shown e induced rapid reactions under uv illumination buxton et al 1988 we are inspired to design the ldhs that incorporate titanium the uv feti ldhs system was thereby proposed as a method to decompose bro3 to the best of our knowledge few studies have explored the photocatalytic ability of ldhs in degrading bro3 in this study feti ldhs photocatalysts were prepared characterized and used to remove bro3 in both deionized water and tap water with uv illumination the performance of feti ldhs was evaluated and compared with that of the commercial tio2 the dramatic influence of several constituents in water such as alcohols nitrate nitrite and hydrogen ion concentration i e ph on the degradation of bro3 is reported also the reusability and stability of feti ldhs as well as the mechanisms of bro3 decomposition were investigated in the absence or presence of alcohols the degradation pathway was proposed for the uv feti ldhs process in the presence of alcohols 2 materials and methods 2 1

degussa specialty chemicals co ltd all the chemical reagents applied in this work were of analytical grade 18 2 mω cm deionized di water was used throughout the study 0 1 mm bromate bro3 samples were prepared by diluting a stock solution of 10 mm in di water tap water was collected from local water plants that treat raw water of yangtze river for testing the performance of uv feti ldhs systems major characteristics of tap water are summarized in table s1 2 2 preparation of feti ldhs nanoparticles the methodology for preparation of feti ldhs has been described elsewhere chitrakar et al 2011 briefly a mixture of 0 1 mole fecl2 4h2o and 0 02 mole ticl4 at a fe ti molar ratio of 5 was dissolved in 60 ml ultrapure water the resulting solution was added slowly to 150 ml of di water with stirring at 25 c and ph 7 0 0 2 and ph 9 0 0 2 which was maintained through continuous addition of 1 mol l naoh subsequently the suspensions were transferred into 350 cm3 teflon tubes and maintained at 120 c for 24 h the product was isolated via centrifuging washing with ultrapure water and finally drying overnight at 60 c the feti ldhs were also prepared at different fe ti molar ratios i e 1 and 0 5 by dissolving 0 02 and 0 01 mole fecl2 4h2o respectively with 0 02 mole ticl4 in 60 ml ultrapure water these composites were denoted feti n mainly including ferrous hydroxide and titanic hydroxide figs 1 and s1 where n represents molar ratios of fe ti n 0 5 1 and 5 2 3 characterization and detection techniques the x ray powder pattern of the sample was recorded using an x ray diffractometer xrd d8 advance bruker corp with cu ka radiation operating at 40 kv voltage and 40 ma current patterns of feti composites were recorded from 5 to 80 in 2θ with a 0 02 step width and a scanning rate of 2 4 min 1 the morphology of feti ldhs was evaluated using a transmission electron microscope tem fei tecnai g2 20 surface elemental compositions of feti ldhs were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific thermal analysis experiments were investigated by a thermogravimetric analysis tg dta discovery thermogravimetric analyzer ta instrument with nitrogen gas n2 as a carrier gas at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 up to 800 c the surface of feti ldhs was investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 5700 thermo nicolet corp the specific surface area of the sample was determined on an asap2460 analyzer following the multipoint n2 adsorption brunauer emmett teller bet method asap2460 micromeritics atlanta usa after degassing samples at 120 c for 1 h spectrophotometric measurements were conducted using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 3600 shimadzu in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm photoluminescence pl spectra were measured at room temperature on a fluorescence spectrophotometer fls980 edinburgh instruments at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm elemental analyses were performed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes agilent solution ph was determined with a ph meter la ph10 hach and the calibration using standard buffers at ph 3 50 6 50 7 10 8 50 and 10 50 was made routinely before measurements at room temperature the concentrations of methanol and its oxidization products were determined by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector 6890n fid agilent inorganic anions bro3 and br were quantified by an ion chromatograph dionex ics 1000 a dionex as19 analytical column 4 250 mm and an ag19 guard column 4 50 mm were applied to separate bro3 from br the detection limits were about 100 nm for all anions 2 4 photocatalytic experiments the photo reactor and methodology for illumination experiments have been described elsewhere liu et al 2014 briefly the cylindrical photo reactor described in our previous studies had a volume v of 1 6 l and was equipped with a low pressure mercury uv lamp uv l cnlight china xiao et al 2017b unless otherwise noted experiments were designed and carried out at a neutral ph which is a typical ph of drinking water the photo reactor was thermostated at 25 0 5 c all the experiments were conducted in cylindrical quartz tube reactors without any gas sparging the tube reactor has a diameter of 20 mm and a length of 20 cm in the tube the solution took the length of 17 cm from the bottom and the headspace of air took 3 cm at the top in addition there was a stopper at the opening of the tube thus gas transfer from the air to the solution is expected to be limited prior to photocatalytic reduction of bro3 a dark experiment was conducted without uv illumination to investigate the adsorption of the anion on feti ldhs samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and filtered by 0 22 μm membrane to measure the residual bro3 in the solution all experiments were repeated independently at least twice and average values along with the standard deviation are presented 3 results and discussions 3 1 physical characterization and composition of catalyst fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of composites with different fe ti prepared at ph 7 0 and ph 9 0 these composites exhibited moderately symmetric reflections of the basal 003 006 and 009 planes which is characteristic of a typical layered structure chitrakar et al 2011 zhong et al 2013 layered structures were observed in the tem images shown in fig 2 the slight dissymmetric reflections at the corresponding degree fig 1 were possibly attributable to the changes of lattice parameter in different samples compared to that prepared at ph 9 0 the feti 0 5 samples at ph 7 0 produced significantly higher intensity and sharper peaks suggesting that the crystallinity of composites was greatly enhanced under neutral conditions from fig 1 as the fe ti molar ratio increased from 0 5 to 5 at the same ph the characteristic peaks 003 and 009 of hydrotalcites decreased and the 006 peak changed little the reduced intensity of peaks 003 and 009 with increasing fe ti implies that low loading of iron species enhanced generation of brucite like compounds the reduced intensity of peaks 003 and 009 with increasing fe ti implies that a small iron species loading enhanced generation of brucite like compounds this is probably attributed to the increasing of positive surface charge yang et al 2012 accordingly the bonds between double hydroxide layers and chlorides in the interlayer would be strengthened in the existence of iron species cavani et al 1991 however if too much iron was on the brucite like sheets then the crystal structure of the feti ldhs might be destroyed and amorphous and non brucite composites might be formed similar phenomena were also observed by yang et al 2012 thereby there was an optimal fe ti ratio of about 0 5 at which the maximum bro3 degradation ability and the highest density of free electrons were achieved as will be shown in the following sections moreover as shown in fig 1 the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 composites exhibited xrd patterns of iron oxide jcpds 26 1136 and jcpds 29 0713 anatase icdd 70 6826 and rutile tio2 icdd 82 514 which was in agreement with that of commercial tio2 and goethite to investigate the composition of feti composites the chemical analysis of cations anions and water molecules was investigated and the results were shown in table s2 of supporting information the chemical formula of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh was determined to be fe0 29ti0 71 oh 2 cl1 42 0 49 h2o by icp aes and tg dta the actual fe ti 0 42 in ldh was slightly lower than the designed value of 0 5 due to the volatility of ticl4 moreover tem was used to characterize the morphology of feti ldhs as shown in fig 2a the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh are sheet like nanoparticles with an average size of 10 nm with the fe ti ratio of 5 fig 2c many composite particles reached up to 60 nm thereby the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh consists of much smaller nanoparticles than other feti ldhs also the bet surface area of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh was determined as 183 3 m2 g which was approximately 1 9 2 1 and 2 8 times higher than the feti 1 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 5 ph 7 0 ldh and the feti 0 5 ph 9 0 ldh respectively as shown in table s2 these observations indicate that small iron species loading on the composites fe ti molar ratio of 0 5 resulted in the decrease of particle size as well as the increase in surface area 3 2 photoluminescence and uv absorbance of catalyst fig 3 illustrates photoluminescence pl emission spectra of feti ldhs at excitation wavelength of 300 nm obviously the emission bands of composites ranged from 380 to 550 nm similar phenomena were observed by huang et al 2014 and the authors reported that the luminescence from localized tio2 containing composites surface states was attributed to the recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs as shown in fig 3 pl intensity of the feti ldhs decreased with a decline in loaded iron species at ph 7 0 but all significantly lower than tio2 this was probably due to the smaller particle size at the lower iron loading as presented in fig 2 the time required for the migration of electron e from where it is excited inside the feti ldhs crystal to the surface of crystal was reduced when the size of feti ldhs nanoparticles become smaller hence the recombination of electron and hole was greatly hindered for small particles the feti ldhs compared to that of large particles the commercial tio2 1 0 μm in size for similar reasons the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh has lowest emission intensity than other feti ldhs fig 4 further depicts uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of feti ldhs the intensity of light absorption by feti ldhs at wavelengths longer than 300 nm was found to follow the following sequence ranging from the highest to the lowest the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 1 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 5 ph 7 0 ldh and the feti 0 5 ph 9 0 ldh this result shows that a decreased amount of iron species integrated on ldhs composites surface significantly improved uv light absorption ability probably because of the small particle size and high specific surface area table s2 and fig 2 reportedly it is possible to determine band gap energies by using the kubelka munk treatment on the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra of nanostructures escobedo morales et al 2007 thus we present the transformed kubelka munk function versus the energy of light in fig s2 compared with that of commercial tio2 about 3 2 ev the band gap energy of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 1 ph 7 0 ldh the feti 5 ph 7 0 ldh and the feti 0 5 ph 9 0 ldh was determined to be 1 51 1 89 2 09 and 2 23 ev respectively these values were obtained as the value on the x axis of the tangent to the linear portion of the absorption spectra in a rising region fig s2 the narrowed band gap energy in fig s2 was possibly attributed to the formation of feo band in the composites which was shown in ftir spectra 578 5 cm 1 of fig s3 the results in figs 3 and 4 suggest that the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh may have higher density of free electrons under uv radiation and thus a higher efficacy in photo degradation of bro3 3 3 reduction efficiency of ldhs for bro3 fig 5 shows degradation of bro3 in the uv feti ldhs process as a function of reaction time in the presence of 5 methanol approximately 17 50 and 82 of bro3 were removed within 60 min under uv irradiation using feti 0 5 ph 9 0 feti 5 ph 7 0 and feti 1 ph 7 0 respectively in contrast feti 0 5 ph 7 0 could remove 99 9 of bro3 from the initial concentration of 0 1 mm after 60 min less than 10 of bro3 removals was due to the adsorption on feti ldhs prior to photocatalytic reduction as shown in fig s4 the removals of bro3 by adsorption on feti 0 5 ph 9 0 feti 5 ph 7 0 feti 1 ph 7 0 and feti 0 5 ph 7 0 was 6 9 7 9 8 8 and 10 at 120 min respectively this corresponds well to their specific surface areas in table s2 the adsorption took 60 min to reach an equilibrium also feti 0 5 ph 7 0 exhibited higher bro3 decay rates when illuminated by uv compared to the rates by the ldh without uv and by uv without the ldh as depicted in fig s5 this indicates that the decomposition of bro3 in uv feti ldhs system was dominantly due to photocatalytic reduction instead of adsorption or direct photolysis the first order reaction rate constant k of bromate degradation was 0 067 0 002 min 1 with feti 0 5 ph 7 0 which was greater than that of the commercial tio2 0 021 min 1 in fig s6 at the same dosage and greater than that for tio2 reported in previous studies 0 0094 0 059 min 1 huang et al 2014 xiao et al 2017b feti 0 5 ph 7 0 was thus selected as the photocatalyst for the following experiments because of its high photocatalytic efficacy in reducing bromate 3 4 the effect of the type and concentration of alcohol catalyst dosage and ph on degradation kinetics of bromate reportedly the concentration of alcohols was around 0 03 μg l in surface water in europe arp et al 2005 0 002 0 012 mg l in the atlantic ocean beale et al 2013 williams et al 2004 and 220 400 mg l in oilfield wastewater effluent ren et al 2012 the alcohol containing wastewater effluent is expected to greatly elevate the alcohol concentrations in the receiving water bodies and also the raw water taken by the water treatment plants nearby alcohols such as methanol ethanol and n propanol are effective hole scavengers thus it is interesting to study the influence of alcohols on the degradation of bro3 in the advanced reduction system for drinking water treatment their effects on bro3 removal was studied in tio2 heterogeneous photocatalytic systems lin et al 2016 although mechanisms of the enhanced photocatalytic reduction in the presence of alcohols were proposed the evidence is indirect as alcohols degradation products were not measured in addition there has been no report on bro3 degradation with uv feti ldhs in the presence of various concentrations of alcohols the effect of methanol concentration on the removal of bro3 was thus evaluated in uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh systems as shown in fig 6 a bro3 reduction was enhanced with the concentration of methanol the dose of 5 methanol facilitated the degradation of bro3 to higher than 99 9 in uv feti ldh systems at the end of the 60 min treatment lin et al 2016 reported that the bro3 reduction was noticeably increased with methanol addition which was primarily ascribed to the suppressed recombination of electron hole pairs as alcohols act as hole scavengers however as methanol concentration further increased there was no obvious promotion of bro3 removal in uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh systems it is possibly due to that a low concentration of methanol 5 was capable enough of scavenging h thus excessive methanol did not significantly improve the suppression of recombination process resulting in a minor elevation in bro3 removal fig 6b shows the influence of alcohol type on bro3 degradation at constant concentrations of alcohols 5 v v there were similar levels of bro3 degradation at the same catalyst dosages this indicates that the increase in the carbon number of alcohols did not remarkably affect the decomposition of bro3 probably because the oxidation of alcohols did not involve breaking carbon carbon bonds fig 6b also shows the effect of catalyst dosage on bro3 degradation in the presence of alcohols as shown in fig 6b a ldh dosage of 0 5 g l showed the highest degradation of bro3 after 60 min 99 9 which was greater than that for a dosage of 1 g l 82 similar trends have been observed in other photocatalytic systems such as bro3 degradation by c60 modified bi2moo6 under visible light irradiation and phenol degradation by tio2 under uv irradiation hong et al 2001 zhao et al 2011 the elevated concentration of photocatalysts at 1 g l ldh may have led to more significant aggregation of ldh in the solution and thereby resulted in the lower degradation performance for bro3 clearly there was similar degradation behavior for all ldhs at all dosages in the presence of ethanol and propanol this indicates the type of alcohols played a less important role in the degradation of bro3 methanol was selected as the representative alcohol to investigate the effectiveness and mechanisms of bro3 removal by uv ldhs systems because of its relatively simple structure fig 7 a shows removal efficiencies of bro3 at different phs the degradation of bro3 was promoted when ph increased from 3 5 to 7 1 but declined when it increased from 7 1 to 10 5 the fastest decomposition was obtained at ph 7 1 fig 7a c this is probably due to the decrease in surface charge as ph increased which is shown by zeta potentials in fig 7d at ph values higher than the isoelectric point 6 8 the surface would be negatively charged there was less bro3 adsorbed on feti ldhs because of the interaction between the anion and the negatively charged surface of photocatalyst hence a lower decay rate of bro3 was observed at ph 7 1 in uv feti ldh processes as illustrated in fig 7 at a ph below the isoelectric point the number of adsorption sites may increase because ldhs composites became predominantly positively charged this would contribute to more bro3 adsorbed on the surface of feti ldhs thus resulting in the enhancement of bro3 decay however we noticed a remarkable inhibition of bro3 degradation at ph 7 1 suggesting that solution ph might affect the photocatalytic decomposition of bro3 by another route zhang et al observed that bro3 removal was hindered at ph lower than 5 5 and totally retarded at ph 1 5 in tio2 photocatalytic systems and the authors demonstrated that the hindrance of bro3 degradation at an acidic ph was due to the loss of e and the generation of oxidizing radicals zhang et al 2010 moreover it has been reported that ph could regulate the interconversion between hydrated electrons eaq and hydrogen atom radicals h li et al 2012 xiao et al 2017b for instance the decline in the solution ph contributed to an increase in eaq consumption and further promoting h formation according to the research reported by our group xiao et al 2017b the effective quantum efficiency for bro3 removal induced by h was about one third of that induced by eaq the yield difference between h and eaq might thus account for the significant decrease of degradation kinetics of bro3 under acidic environments therefore these observations substantiate that uv feti ldh systems can remove bro3 from drinking water which normally has a ph near neutral 3 5 stability in reactivity after long term storage and reusability as uv feti ldhs systems were proposed to be an alternative technique for bro3 degradation it is significant to test whether such a process was stable and whether the ldhs can be reused for multiple times to evaluate the stability of the reactivity of feti ldhs after preparation samples of feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh were stored in a tightly capped bottle 15 cm3 for 1 15 30 and 60 days at 20 0 5 c according to fig 8 a the 60 min removal percentage of bro3 by uv ldh systems stayed around 95 after 30 days storage removal at 60 min dropped to 79 after 60 days storage probably due to the partial oxidation of fe2 to fe3 in the ldh structure chitrakar et al 2011 similar phenomena were observed in previous studies where bro3 was decomposed by fe ii al iii ldhs alone zhong et al 2013 additionally the photocatalytic performance of feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh exposed to air during storage was lower than that of the sealed ldh fig s7 this is primarily due to the increased formation of fe3 when stored in air as evidenced by the fact that the color of the particles changes from grey green to mahogany fig s7 thereby we recommend that the nanoparticles be sealed and stored at low temperatures lower than room temperatures but above zero degree in dry and dark conditions fig 8b further shows the reusability of the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh nearly complete bro3 decomposition 99 9 was achieved after 60 min for the first run subsequently the feti ldh was separated through filtration washed by ultrapure water and ultimately dried in a vacuum before the use in the repeated bro3 degradation experiment for testing its reusability the average weight loss of the feti ldh was 23 5 in each recycle six repeated experiments were carried out using the same recycling procedure for the same feti ldh results show that the uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh could be reused for multiple times considering that significant bro3 removal greater than 85 was obtained within 60 min for the sixth cycle additionally compared to filtration 67 2 separation efficiencies of the feti ldh was remarkably improved via magnetic separation techniques 98 6 as shown in fig s8 3 6 the effect of no2 and no3 it was reported that reactive reductants such as eaq and h could be formed in the tio2 and ferrous iron containing photocatalytic systems potterill et al 1936 zhang et al 2010 to elucidate the mechanism of bro3 removal in the uv feti ldh process no3 and no2 were employed as quenchers to study their separate inhibitory effects on bro3 degradation the direct photolysis of no3 and no2 was negligible due to their weak uv absorption and low quantum yields at 254 nm herrmann 2007 xiao et al 2017a no3 and no2 are good scavengers for eaq eqs 1 and 2 whereas only no2 is good quenchers for h eq 4 buxton et al 1988 gonzalez et al 2004 1 n o 3 e a q n o 3 2 k 1 9 7 10 9 m 1 s 1 2 n o 2 e a q n o 2 2 k 2 4 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 n o 3 h n o 3 h k 3 1 4 10 6 m 1 s 1 4 n o 2 h n o o h k 4 7 1 10 8 m

20 after 60 min in the presence of equal amounts of no3 and no2 0 4 mm respectively since no3 is capable of scavenging eaq but unable to quench h bro3 reacts with h 15 times faster than no3 does as shown by rate constants for reactions described by eqs 3 and 5 the moderate inhibition of bro3 decomposition by no3 demonstrated that a significant role of eaq in the process the greater inhibition of bro3 decay by no2 in 60 min 80 demonstrated that h also played an important role in decomposition of bro3 during the first 10 min of reaction the inhibition of bro3 decay by no2 was not stronger than that of no3 indicating that the reduction of bro3 was initially dominated by the reaction with eaq it may have taken a while for h to accumulate as the products of the reactions of eaq with water and h eqs 6 and 13 to a sufficient concentration so that h can have significant contribution to bro3 reduction approximately 19 bro3 removal in no2 solutions within 60 min was mainly attributed to adsorption onto feti 0 5 ph 7 0 as shown by the results in fig s9 thereby eaq and h appear to be the dominant reactive species which were responsible for bro3 decomposition in uv feti ldhs systems 3 7 degradation pathway to explain degradation pathway of bro3 in the uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh system identification and quantitative determination of major products were investigated fig 10 a depicts generation of various bromine br containing products and the total masses of br during the process of bro3 degradation by uv feti ldh systems in fig 10a degradation of bro3 in the photocatalytic process was accompanied with the increase of br concentration within 60 min the total bromine remained comparatively constant in the range of 0 09 0 0956 mm in the solution this indicates that partially reduced intermediates react more rapidly than does bro3 xiao et al 2017b a small amount 4 4 10 of bromine was believed to remain adsorbed onto the ldh which is consistent with that about 19 br containing compounds 0 019 mm adsorbed onto the composites in fig s9 to gain insights into the role played by alcohols in removing bro3 in the water in the uv feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh process the removal of methanol and its products formed during the process were further investigated as illustrated in fig 10b higher than 99 5 degradation of methanol was achieved carbon dioxide co2 was the primary product of methanol degradation as indicated by the nearly complete removal of total organic carbon toc fig 10b also the inset of fig 10b shows that only a small amount of methyl formate 55 μg l was formed via reaction of methanol and formic acid it can be further concluded that the obvious increase in decomposition of bro3 in the presence of alcohols was mainly attributed to highly efficient formation of electrons by applying alcohols as h quenchers scavenging of h by methanol could also have secondary effects by producing oxidized species that could interact with intermediates of bro3 reduction however the intermediates too evanescent to be detected in the presence of methanol additionally the xrd spectra of feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh after photocatalytic reaction were analyzed fig s10 clearly a peak for amorphous titanium oxybromide was observed along with peaks associated with a mixture of crystalline goethite anatase and rutile titanium dioxide and the ldh residue based on the previous discussion a pathway for degradation of bro3 on the feti ldh with uv illumination is proposed in scheme 1 jung et al 2014 xiao et al 2017b the destruction of bro3 occurred by adsorption onto the ldhs followed by photocatalytic reduction adsorption occurred through ion exchange between cl and bro3 and reduction to br occurred by reaction with eaq and h subsequently the innocuous products br entered into the solution via exchange with cl notably the photocatalytic reduction of bro3 was enhanced in the presence of alcohols co2 as well as methyl formate hcooch3 were predominant products of oxidation of methanol contributing to h scavenging and eaq yield enhancement reportedly eaq is one of the most reactive radicals buxton et al 1988 siefermann and abel 2011 and always takes part in reductive reactions at diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 according to scheme 1 and eqs 7 11 buxton et al 1988 siddiqui et al 1994 eaq produced in the uv feti ldhs system can react rapidly with bro3 and br was the major br containing product notably eaq could synchronously be converted into h by reaction with h and h2o buxton et al 1988 via eqs 6 and 12 conversely h can form eaq by reaction with oh eq 13 indicating a significant role of ph in bro3 degradation by regulating the yields of h and eaq 6 e a q h 2 o h o h k 6 1 9 10 1 m 1 s 1 7 e a q b r o

was the yangtze river and the results are compared to those obtained with deionized di water in fig 11 this figure shows that concentrations of bro3 decreased with time after 60 min concentrations of bro3 in both waters were lower in the presence of uv feti ldh than with uv alone the degradation percentage of bro3 was approximately 90 in tap water and 99 9 in di water after 60 min the results suggest that significant removal of bro3 could be achieved following disinfection in real water treatment plants if our uv feti ldh system is used in the absence of alcohols however the degradation percentage of bro3 in the tap water is expected to be lower than what is shown in fig 11 as demonstrated in fig 6a the degradation percentage of bro3 in tap water was lower than that in di water due to the existence of radical quenchers in tap water such as nitrate table s1 in addition the concentration of dissolved oxygen in di and tap water remained 8 mg l during the degradation process as shown in fig s11 even if the rate constants of oxygen reacting with eaq or h 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 are higher than that of bro3 reacting with them 3 4 109 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively and the concentration of dissolved oxygen 0 25 mm is higher than that of bro3 0 1 mm initially the negligible competition of dissolved oxygen for eaq and h is likely due to that bro3 can be adsorbed onto the surface of ldh as demonstrated by fig s4 the negatively charged bro3 underwent electrostatic attraction with fe2 or ti4 on the surface of ldh resulting in significant adsorption thus the elevation of bro3 concentration in the near surface region of ldh could have resulted in almost no competition of dissolved oxygen for eaq and h 4 conclusions feti ldhs were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method and used for the first time as an alternative photocatalyst in advanced reduction of bro3 for water treatment the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh exhibited a higher bro3 removal efficiency than commercial tio2 and other feti ldhs prepared at other ph values and other fe ti ratios after 60 min almost complete degradation of bro3 99 9 was observed when using the feti 0 5 ph 7 0 ldh under uv irradiation in the presence of 5 alcohols the presence of alcohols resulted in the enhanced photocatalytic removal of bro3 mainly because alcohols are hole scavengers in uv feti ldh processes the results suggest that bro3 could be effectively removed using our uv feti ldh system in water treatment in the absence of alcohols the efficacy in reducing bro3 would be lower due to insufficient electron donors cyclic degradation runs and magnetic separation techniques further demonstrated the superior reusability of the ldh for bro3 removal quenching and adsorption experiments demonstrated a predominant role of eaq and h in reducing bro3 over the adsorption in uv feti ldh systems furthermore mass balance calculation of bromine showed that br was the major product and degradation pathways were proposed accordingly large concentrations of nitrate 0 4 mm reduced the amount of bro3 degraded primarily due to scavenging of photo generated electrons by nitrate nevertheless the feti ldh was proposed as a promising photocatalyst for bro3 degradation feti ldhs are also promising in the removal of other contaminants such as clox x 1 2 3 and 4 ioy y 1 3 and 6 and seo4 2 in water treatment plants due to their similar chemical properties to bro3 moreover the experimental methods for catalyzer synthesis could be useful for other

19116,efficient media designs for microbial quorum quenching qq are essential to enable maximal biofouling control in membrane bioreactors mbrs here we introduce a novel double layered biocarrier design which has qq bacteria in the shell layer with biostimulating agents in the core for effective membrane biofouling control confining the biostimulant within dense polymer materials permits its controlled release over an extended period the provision of the biostimulant from the core to the outer shell where the qq bacteria are encapsulated facilitates their prolonged survival and active life the core shell structured qq bead with the stimulant inside which inhibits biofilm formation shows the best fouling mitigation in laboratory testing of mbrs while enhancing signal molecule degradation and lowering exopolymer secretion this new layered qq bead which has dual functions of bioaugmentation and biostimulation supports a highly efficient and sustainable anti biofouling strategy graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial quorum quenching biofouling control biostimulation layered media structure membrane bioreactor 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology is widely used for advanced wastewater treatment and reuse shannon et al 2008 son et al 2017 however membrane biofouling has been the longstanding technical weakness of mbr and remains unresolved le clech et al 2006 soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps were found to be responsible for membrane fouling in mbr shi et al 2017 2018 particularly it has been revealed that biofouling results from the cell to cell communications called quorum sensing qs using signal molecules such as n acyl homoserine lactones ahls davies et al 1998 kyungmin et al 2009 qs is associated with the microbial sensing system that allows bacteria to induce their gene expression and physiological behavior in a cell density dependent manner huang et al 2016 in recent years stopping such microbial communication called quorum quenching qq has been explored in mbrs lee et al 2018b oh and lee 2018 qq was found to be successful in biofouling control by degrading signal molecules using qq enzymes fetzner 2015 yeon et al 2009 qq bacteria oh et al 2012 or qq fungi lee et al 2016a when the qq strategy was combined with a conventional fouling control method such as chemically enhanced backwashing with chlorine a synergistic effect on fouling mitigation occurred weerasekara et al 2016 for practical applications of the qq strategy qq bacteria were encapsulated in a porous vessel oh et al 2012 or in hydrogel polymer media in various forms such as beads taghavi jeloudar et al 2013 sheets nahm et al 2017 or cylinders lee et al 2016b the qq bacteria based approach which was considered as a bioaugmentation strategy el fantroussi and agathos 2005 seemed to be viable and promising in biofouling control lee et al 2018a due to the problem of mass transfer in the encapsulation media however qq bacteria in the inner part of the media seemed difficult to access food and nutrient and thus became inactive lee et al 2016b limiting their qq activity and system stability during long term use another qq strategy in mbr was proposed based on biostimulation which promoted and enriched the indigenous qq bacteria by adding biotic stimulants gamma caprolactone gcl whose chemical structure is analogous to ahls was found to be one of the best biostimulants for qq bacteria among seventeen compounds tested cirou et al 2007 yu et al 2016 a critical issue of this biostimulation approach was that the biostimulant was not species specific and could be used not only by qq bacteria but also by other bacteria that did not have qq ability cirou et al 2007 mistargeting the biostimulant made it inefficient which caused stimulant dosage requirements and costs to rise for more effective qq based biofouling control in mbrs the issues associated with the inactivation of qq bacteria in the qq bioaugmentation strategy and the mistargeting of qq biostimulation should be addressed in addition as far as we were aware there had not been any studies conducted which integrated bioaugmentation and biostimulation as a qq strategy for biofouling control therefore the focus of the present study was to develop and test a new bio carrier structure for more efficient and sustainable qq a novel attempt to incorporate a biostimulant e g gcl inside a bio media encapsulating qq bacteria e g rhodococcus sp bh4 was made several polymeric materials such as alginate polyvinyl alcohol pva and polysulfone psf were utilized for the preparation of qq media a dense polymeric core was designed for controlled release of the biostimulant over time to promote an extended operational qq life lee et al 2000 pekarek et al 1994 in this study we report on core shell structured qq beads which have several different core materials formed inside a shell composed of hydrogel polymer media encapsulating qq bacteria we intended that this double layered qq structure opened a new avenue in qq media design which would promote biofouling control in mbrs enabled by bioaugmentation with simultaneous biostimulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of core shell structured beads several polymeric materials were used to prepare the core of the qq beads which were designed to enclose the biostimulant gcl and to enable a slow controlled release details are as follows for core a gcl 10 w v was added into an alginate solution 4 w v with gentle mixing the mixture was then dripped into a cacl2 solution 3 w v through a nozzle forming coagulated beads with a soaking time of 3 h which were collected for final washing in deionized water for core b i e core a with outer psf coating layers the wet core a beads were rolled in polymer solutions 10 15 or 20 w w psf dissolved in the solvent n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp and then they were coagulated and immersed in deionized water for 1 h with gentle stirring for core c gcl 10 w v was added to the psf solution 10 15 or 20 w v dissolved in nmp which was dripped into deionized water and then agitated gently for 1 h the average diameter of the bead cores was approximately 2 mm the shell layer that entrapped the qq bacteria bh4 was prepared based on a previous method for cell encapsulation lee et al 2016a the cores prepared in advance were rolled in a mixture of 10 pva 1 alginate and 20 bh4 cells dry weight in mass the cores coated with the hydrogel layer were immersed in a crosslinking solution with the 7 4 m ratio of boric acid cacl2 for 3 h to form the shell layer the core shell structured bead was then immersed in 0 2 m na2so4 solution for further stabilization for 8 h 2 2 mbr system three laboratory scale mbrs with a working volume of 2 l were constructed while installing a submerged membrane module made of kolon polyvinyl difluoride hollow fibers with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and an effective surface area of 94 cm2 fig s1 according to the operating conditions table s1 proper media beads were loaded to the reactors at a volume ratio of 0 5 lee et al 2016a briefly mbr1 was always operated in conventional mode without beads but different beads were added into mbr2 and mbr3 for each phase no beads were added into mbr2 and mbr3 in phase 1 so that all three mbrs were run in conventional mode to check the fouling pattern of the three mbrs in phase 2 vacant beads bead 1 were dosed to mbr2 while qq beads without gcl bead 3 were added to mbr3 the effects of physical shear and qq on membrane fouling were evaluated and compared in this phase in phase 3 qq beads without gcl bead 3 were added to mbr2 and qq beads with gcl bead 4 to mbr3 the biostimulation effect on the qq performance and consequent fouling control was thus assessed in phase 4 gcl bead bead 2 and qq beads with gcl bead 4 were added to mbr2 and mbr3 respectively to examine and compare the sole biostimulant effect and its combination with qq on mbr fouling control the mbrs were fed with synthetic wastewater whose ingredients are detailed in table s2 the feed was prepared daily and stored at 4 c supplying it to the mbrs the feed pump was controlled using a level sensor to keep the reactor volume at a constant level 2 l the permeate flux was set at 30 l m2 h with a cyclic operation of 19 min filtration suction and 1 min relaxation no filtration the hydraulic and sludge residence times of all mbrs were 7 5 h and 40 d respectively while maintaining the organic loading rate at 0 755 kg cod m3 d continuous air sparging was performed through an air diffuser underneath the membrane module using an air pump at an air flow rate of 1 0 l min corresponding to 72 s 1 in velocity gradient the transmembrane pressure tmp profile was continuously recorded on a laptop computer using a digital pressure transducer zse 40f smc japan and a digital multimeter m 3850d metex korea 2 3 qq bacteria cultivation and activity tests to examine the effect of biostimulants on the growth and activity of qq bacteria rhodococcus sp bh4 was cultured in luria bertani lb broth with and without adding gcl 1 g l or glucose 1 g l at 30 c and 200 rpm for 24 h the m9 minimal mm medium details are provided in supplementary information was also used for culturing bh4 and gcl 1 g l or glucose 1 g l was added as the sole carbon source bh4 cultivation in the mm medium lasted for 7 d at 30 c and 200 rpm optical density was determined at 600 nm od600 for each culture to evaluate the degree of bh4 growth the bh4 cells harvested were subjected to qq activity tests the bh4 culture broth was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded the cell pellets were collected and diluted to od600 of 1 0 using tris hcl buffer ph 7 50 mm an equal volume of n octanoyl homoserine lactone c8 hsl 400 nm was added to the cell suspension which raised the final c8 hsl and od600 levels to 200 nm and 0 5 respectively c8 hsl was chosen in this study because it has been identified in the literature as one of the major signal molecules in mbr systems kyungmin et al 2009 and indeed it was found to be most abundant in this study the qq activity of bh4 for other ahls and ahl degradation mechanism can be found in previous studies oh et al 2013 weerasekara et al 2014 after shaking the bh4 and c8 hsl mixture at 200 rpm and 30 c in due course the c8 hsl concentration was adopted as the indicator of qq activity similarly the qq activity of the core shell structured beads was determined by adding them 0 5 v v into the c8 hsl solution 200 nm and then measuring the c8 hsl level over time 2 4 controlled gcl release test twenty of each bead core prepared as described above were placed in a conical tube containing 50 ml of deionized water and then continuously agitated in a shaker at 200 rpm and 30 c the extract was replaced daily by fresh deionized water the gcl concentration in the extract was determined by using a liquid chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer detector thermo scientific tsq quantum access max triple quadrupole mass spectrometer lc ms ms in selected reaction monitoring srm mode with the specific pairs of m z values associated with the precursor and fragment ions i e 115 1 68 9 and 115 1 97 0 the cumulative release was calculated by dividing the total amount of gcl released by the total gcl amount initially loaded to the core the initial gcl content in the core was determined by retrieving the gcl from the core as follows for core a it was re dissolved by shaking it in a solution containing 0 1 m disodium edta plus 0 2 m sodium citrate and the re dissolved gcl was measured using the lc ms ms for core b its psf coating layer was peeled off and the gcl contained inside was determined for core c it was first ground in a solvent acetonitrile and the debris of core c in the solvent was sonicated for 30 min the gcl extracted was measured using a lc ms ms for accurate determination of gcl in the different solvents the calibration curves were established separately under the specific conditions 2 5 signal molecule measurement c8 hsl was measured by using the lc ms ms the column used was a hypersil gold c18 column 25003 052130 the mobile phase eluent whose flow rate was set at 250 μl min was composed of acetonitrile 30 and deionized water 70 both with 0 1 formic acid the injection volume was 20 μl details for the ms parameters are as follows spray voltage 3500 v shealth gas pressure 45 arbitrary unit au ion sweep gas pressure 2 0 au auxiliary gas pressure 10

constructed with valid correlation coefficients of 0 99 the samples for the lc ms ms analysis were prepared as follows the dissolved fraction of activated sludge mixed liquor was obtained through centrifugation 4000 rpm followed by filtration using a 0 45 μm filter other samples e g activity test samples containing bh4 cells or qq beads were only passed through the 0 45 μm filter the particle free sample 5 ml was loaded to the auto sampler of the lc ms ms with an online solid phase extraction column thermo hypersil aq 25312 022130 for pre concentration of the c8 hsl 2 6 extraction and measurement of smp and eps the mixed liquor 50 ml taken from mbrs was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and the filtrate was used for the determination of smp while eps was extracted from the biomass as described in weerasekara et al 2014 the biomass pellet collected by centrifugation was resuspended in a 0 8 nacl solution and then heated at 80 c for 30 min the solution was centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the filtrate contained the eps extracted from the biomass the concentrations of carbohydrates and proteins present in the smp and eps samples were determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 and the modified lowry method peterson 1977 respectively 2 7 analysis of microbial floc size and treatment efficiency the microbial floc size distributions were determined using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls 13320 beckman coulter usa the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by the dichromate method apha 1998 a dichromate digestion reagent ul hach usa which has a cod detection range of 0 7 40 0 mg l was used with a

surface morphologies of beads were visualized using a video microscope sv 35 sometech korea while the core and shell pores in the bead were observed using a scanning electron microscope su8220 hitachi japan the bh4 cells present in fresh and used beads were stained using a backlight live dead staining kit molecular probes eugene or and observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm 700 carl zeiss germany 2 9 biofilm formation assay the inhibition of biofilm formation by different kinds of beads was determined based on the microtiter dish biofilm formation assay method o toole 2011 activated sludge was incubated for 24 h at 30 c in polystyrene 96 well plates containing lb broth with fresh or used beads the bacteria and beads in the 96 well plates were washed off three times using deionized water the biofilm left in the wells was stained using 1 crystal violet for 15 min washed three time with deionized water and dried out completely the well was then destained with 95 ethanol for 10 min at room temperature the absorbance of the solution containing crystal violet was determined at 595 nm using a microplate reader synergy 2 biotek usa eight replicate wells from each sample were prepared and analyzed and their average and standard deviation values were calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of biostimulant on qq bacteria growth and signal molecule degradation gcl which can promote the qq bacteria in activated sludge cirou et al 2007 2011 yu et al 2016 was used as the qq biostimulant in the present study and rhodococcus sp bh4 a previously isolated qq species that can effectively degrade ahls lee et al 2016b nahm et al 2017 oh et al 2012 taghavi jeloudar et al 2013 was adopted as the qq bacterium fig 1 shows the effects of gcl on the growth and activity of bh4 gcl was added into the lb and m9 media to stimulate bh4 cultivation under eutrophic and oligotrophic conditions respectively the c8 hsl degrading activities of different cultures were assessed as shown in fig 1a gcl and glucose added to the lb broth did not promote bh4 growth the statistical probability value based on one way analysis of variance i e p value 0 106 which was attributed to the fact that the lb medium was already nutrition rich enough to support bh4 growth however the gcl in the lb medium still contributed to an increase in the c8 hsl degrading activity fig 1b wastewater streams are not a nutrition rich diet for microbes like the lb broth was and so the gcl effect on qq biostimulation was further tested in the mm broth where it was completely assimilated by bh4 fig s2 and enhanced bh4 growth unlike the case of glucose addition to mm p value 2 66 10 7 fig 1c in addition gcl in the mm significantly improved the qq activity of bh4 fig 1d which confirmed the effect of gcl on bh4 stimulation showing its potential in wastewater treatment applications 3 2 evaluating the controlled release of gcl biostimulant from polymer bead cores to enable the slow release of the biostimulant gcl from the inner core several different core materials and structures were prepared e g alginate beads coagulated with calcium ions core a alginate beads coated with polysulfone core b and polysulfone psf beads core c as shown in fig 2 a c respectively cores b and c were examined with varying psf contents for optimizing the controlled gcl release as shown in fig 2d e and fig s3 the gcl release from core a was completed within approximately 5 d which appeared to be too short to sustain its long term biostimulation effect the fast release was probably due to the porous structure of core a as the pore diameter of core a was approximately 100 μm see fig s4a core b and core c with different psf contents showed a small burst of release in the beginning and a slow diffusive release later the steady controlled release of gcl from cores b and c could be ascribed to the dense psf structure figs s4b and c the gcl release duration from the cores was estimated using the higuchi model siepmann and peppas 2001 which was found to fit well with the result of psf cores fig s5 cores b and c showed a stable longtime release for more than 440 d and the release duration was extended further with higher psf contents fig 2e in addition the initial amount of gcl loaded in the bead cores was evaluated and compared for different cores the core c group had greater gcl loadings than the core a and core b groups fig s6 the least gcl loss occurred in the core c group possibly owing to their relatively simple preparation procedures considering the gcl loading and release core c with 15 psf was found to be suitable for use in the next step of preparation of core shell structured qq beads 3 3 core shell structured qq beads with controlled gcl release the shell layer outside the core core c with 15 psf was formed using a mixture of pva and alginate see fig s4d which was encapsulating the qq bacteria and then the whole bead was soaked in the calcium boric acid solution for cross linking lee et al 2016a fig 3 a shows the key steps for preparing the bead that has a core with a controlled release character of the biostimulant gcl and a shell encapsulating qq bacteria bh4 several different types of core shell structured qq beads were prepared fig 3b and their qq efficacies were evaluated fig 3c and d the initial qq activity levels of bead 3 and bead 4 were almost the same fig 3c after cultivation for 7 d in the supernatant of activated sludge however the qq activity of bead 4 remained unchanged while that of bead 3 slightly declined in addition gcl release from bead 2 to the supernatant of activated sludge was observed but no gcl was detected in the supernatant with bead 4 fig s7 the result demonstrated the complete assimilation of gcl by the qq bacteria bh4 present in the shell layer and on this basis it was considered that the core shell double layered bead helped to successfully sustain qq activity due to in situ biostimulation with controlled gcl release from the core to the shell 3 4 membrane biofouling control the core shell structured qq beads were applied to the mbr system to demonstrate their biofouling control efficacy fig 4 and figure s8 show the profiles for tmp buildup which is an indicator of membrane fouling as well as the concentrations of smp eps and ahl in three mbrs in phase 1 the three reactors were all operated in conventional mbr mode without beads added their operation time 7 11 7 25 d did not show any significant differences confirming that they were in an identical fouling state see table s1 in phase 2 bead 1 vacant bead and bead 3 qq bead without gcl were added into mbr2 and mbr3 respectively bead 3 prolonged the operation time 13 56 d while significantly delaying fouling while bead 1 had only a marginal effect on fouling delay 8 21 d the eps carbohydrates and proteins and signal molecule c8 hsl concentrations in mbr3 also decreased iqbal et al 2018 tan et al 2014 whereas in mbr2 the smp eps and c8 hsl concentrations were similar to those of the control mbr1 on this basis it was considered that the fouling delay in mbr3 with bead 3 could be ascribed to the qq effect but slight fouling retardation in mbr2 with vacant beads bead 1 could have occurred due to the physical shearing action of the beads taghavi jeloudar et al 2013 in phase 3 the performance of core shell structured beads containing both gcl biostimulant and qq bacteria bead 4 was tested against bead 3 qq bead without gcl the tmp profile and fouling time fig 4 a and b revealed that both bead 3 12 83 d and bead 4 18 81 d mitigated membrane fouling significantly and also reduced the eps and c8 hsl levels iqbal et al 2018 tan et al 2014 notably bead 4 achieved much greater fouling control than bead 3 p value 0 016 which supported the hypothesis that the qq bead coupled with in situ biostimulation using gcl was superior in fouling control compared to the normal qq bead as shown by its qq activity fig 3d in phase 4 the effect of gcl biostimulation on biofouling control was further examined using bead 2 and its performance was compared with that of bead 4 mbr2 containing bead 2 had a slight fouling retardation average fouling time 7 94 d compared to the control mbr1 6 13 d although the smp eps and ahl levels for mbr2 were comparable to those of mbr1 the reduced fouling in mbr2 could again be attributed to the physical shear effect in fact the average fouling time for mbr with bead 2 i e mbr2 in phase 4 was comparable with that of mbr with vacant beads mbr2 in phase 2 showing the p value of 0 335 that is statistically there was no significant difference between them however mbr3 with bead 4 showed considerable fouling mitigation average fouling time 18 56 d which implied that the biostimulation alone was not sufficient enough for biofouling mitigation and that superior fouling control was possible with the novel core shell structured qq bead which combined in situ biostimulation with bioaugmentation as demonstrated above by mbr3 in phases 3 and 4 the characteristics of mixed liquor and removal efficiencies of organics and nutrients did not change significantly for the three mbrs operated under the various experimental conditions figs s8 and s9 the result revealed that the new qq strategy with core shell structured beads mitigated membrane fouling significantly but without deteriorating or sacrificing any biological treatment performances it has been reported that previously tested qq media e g vessel and sheet did not affect biological treatment efficiency iqbal et al 2018 weerasekara et al 2014 3 5 sustainable activity and growth of qq bacteria in core shell structured beads the sustainability of qq bacteria in core shell structured beads was examined by comparing the activity of fresh and used qq beads fig 5 a shows the ahl degradation profiles for bead 3 and bead 4 before fresh and after used their use for the mbrs in phase 3 that is the two types of beads were used for approximately 39 d and then retrieved from the mbrs the qq activity of used bead 3 decreased relatively significantly compared to that of its fresh counterpart whereas used bead 4 maintained its initial high level of activity the sustained qq activity of bead 4 reflected the biostimulation effect of its gcl without the gcl biostimulant e g bead 3 the qq bacteria present in the under nourished part inner zone of the biomedium shell did not flourish the viability of bh4 cells in beads 3 and 4 was monitored using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm before and after their use live bh4 cells in the shell layer of both beads were bright green see fig 5b c the whole shell layer of used bead 4 was still green indicating that the cells were alive after use fig 5e however the inner part of bead 3 shell turned red fig 5d indicating that some of the cells in the zone were dead this result demonstrated the merit of a double layered bead structure with qq bacteria in the shell and gcl in the core consequently it was apparent that core shell structured qq beads which integrated bioaugmentation and biostimulation in one medium enhanced the viability of qq bacteria while supporting sustainable qq efficacy during long term mbr operations 3 6 enhanced biofilm formation control by core shell structured qq beads to further confirm the efficacy of core shell structured qq beads biofilm formation tests were conducted using fresh and used beads the absorbance and intensity of crystal violet color indicated the degree of biofilm formed fig 6 as described in section 2 9 it was apparent that fresh beads 3 and 4 inhibited biofilm formation substantially although beads 1 and 2 did not after use phase 3 bead 4 still maintained the inhibiting capability against biofilm formation but bead 3 lost this capacity the result demonstrated the effectiveness of in situ biostimulation in the design of qq bacteria augmenting media 4 conclusions a double layered qq bead with a biostimulating agent gcl in its core and encapsulated qq bacteria bh4 in its shell has been successfully fabricated this bead enabled highly efficient and sustainable biofouling control in mbrs gcl has a clear stimulating effect on the growth of bh4 capable of microbial quorum sensing inhibition through the degradation of signal molecules such as c8 hsl the results have demonstrated the potential of gcl in its application to the mbr treatment of wastewater with limited food supplies for microbes dense polymer bead cores were predicted to be able to continue stable gcl release for more than several hundred days preparing a single polysulfone core with confined gcl of varying amounts was shown to be simple and the core shell structured bead containing gcl in the psf core and bh4 in the shell sustained its qq activity after exposure to the supernatant of activated sludge the new qq media design demonstrated superior fouling control compared to other types of bead structures during mbr operations as it contributed to lowering the ahl and eps levels responsible for membrane biofouling the layered qq bead with gcl in the core exhibited ongoing qq activity after long term use in an mbr e g 39 d in phase 3 indicating that the provision of gcl from the core to the bacteria bh4 in the shell led to the qq bacteria staying alive the layered bifunctional media demonstrated improved inhibition of biofilm formation when compared with other types of media tested and we contend that this new biomedium has potential for a wide range of engineering applications associated with the control of biofouling acknowledgements this research was supported by the national research foundation of korea grant no 2016r1a2b2013776 funded

19116,efficient media designs for microbial quorum quenching qq are essential to enable maximal biofouling control in membrane bioreactors mbrs here we introduce a novel double layered biocarrier design which has qq bacteria in the shell layer with biostimulating agents in the core for effective membrane biofouling control confining the biostimulant within dense polymer materials permits its controlled release over an extended period the provision of the biostimulant from the core to the outer shell where the qq bacteria are encapsulated facilitates their prolonged survival and active life the core shell structured qq bead with the stimulant inside which inhibits biofilm formation shows the best fouling mitigation in laboratory testing of mbrs while enhancing signal molecule degradation and lowering exopolymer secretion this new layered qq bead which has dual functions of bioaugmentation and biostimulation supports a highly efficient and sustainable anti biofouling strategy graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial quorum quenching biofouling control biostimulation layered media structure membrane bioreactor 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr technology is widely used for advanced wastewater treatment and reuse shannon et al 2008 son et al 2017 however membrane biofouling has been the longstanding technical weakness of mbr and remains unresolved le clech et al 2006 soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps were found to be responsible for membrane fouling in mbr shi et al 2017 2018 particularly it has been revealed that biofouling results from the cell to cell communications called quorum sensing qs using signal molecules such as n acyl homoserine lactones ahls davies et al 1998 kyungmin et al 2009 qs is associated with the microbial sensing system that allows bacteria to induce their gene expression and physiological behavior in a cell density dependent manner huang et al 2016 in recent years stopping such microbial communication called quorum quenching qq has been explored in mbrs lee et al 2018b oh and lee 2018 qq was found to be successful in biofouling control by degrading signal molecules using qq enzymes fetzner 2015 yeon et al 2009 qq bacteria oh et al 2012 or qq fungi lee et al 2016a when the qq strategy was combined with a conventional fouling control method such as chemically enhanced backwashing with chlorine a synergistic effect on fouling mitigation occurred weerasekara et al 2016 for practical applications of the qq strategy qq bacteria were encapsulated in a porous vessel oh et al 2012 or in hydrogel polymer media in various forms such as beads taghavi jeloudar et al 2013 sheets nahm et al 2017 or cylinders lee et al 2016b the qq bacteria based approach which was considered as a bioaugmentation strategy el fantroussi and agathos 2005 seemed to be viable and promising in biofouling control lee et al 2018a due to the problem of mass transfer in the encapsulation media however qq bacteria in the inner part of the media seemed difficult to access food and nutrient and thus became inactive lee et al 2016b limiting their qq activity and system stability during long term use another qq strategy in mbr was proposed based on biostimulation which promoted and enriched the indigenous qq bacteria by adding biotic stimulants gamma caprolactone gcl whose chemical structure is analogous to ahls was found to be one of the best biostimulants for qq bacteria among seventeen compounds tested cirou et al 2007 yu et al 2016 a critical issue of this biostimulation approach was that the biostimulant was not species specific and could be used not only by qq bacteria but also by other bacteria that did not have qq ability cirou et al 2007 mistargeting the biostimulant made it inefficient which caused stimulant dosage requirements and costs to rise for more effective qq based biofouling control in mbrs the issues associated with the inactivation of qq bacteria in the qq bioaugmentation strategy and the mistargeting of qq biostimulation should be addressed in addition as far as we were aware there had not been any studies conducted which integrated bioaugmentation and biostimulation as a qq strategy for biofouling control therefore the focus of the present study was to develop and test a new bio carrier structure for more efficient and sustainable qq a novel attempt to incorporate a biostimulant e g gcl inside a bio media encapsulating qq bacteria e g rhodococcus sp bh4 was made several polymeric materials such as alginate polyvinyl alcohol pva and polysulfone psf were utilized for the preparation of qq media a dense polymeric core was designed for controlled release of the biostimulant over time to promote an extended operational qq life lee et al 2000 pekarek et al 1994 in this study we report on core shell structured qq beads which have several different core materials formed inside a shell composed of hydrogel polymer media encapsulating qq bacteria we intended that this double layered qq structure opened a new avenue in qq media design which would promote biofouling control in mbrs enabled by bioaugmentation with simultaneous biostimulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of core shell structured beads several polymeric materials were used to prepare the core of the qq beads which were designed to enclose the biostimulant gcl and to enable a slow controlled release details are as follows for core a gcl 10 w v was added into an alginate solution 4 w v with gentle mixing the mixture was then dripped into a cacl2 solution 3 w v through a nozzle forming coagulated beads with a soaking time of 3 h which were collected for final washing in deionized water for core b i e core a with outer psf coating layers the wet core a beads were rolled in polymer solutions 10 15 or 20 w w psf dissolved in the solvent n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp and then they were coagulated and immersed in deionized water for 1 h with gentle stirring for core c gcl 10 w v was added to the psf solution 10 15 or 20 w v dissolved in nmp which was dripped into deionized water and then agitated gently for 1 h the average diameter of the bead cores was approximately 2 mm the shell layer that entrapped the qq bacteria bh4 was prepared based on a previous method for cell encapsulation lee et al 2016a the cores prepared in advance were rolled in a mixture of 10 pva 1 alginate and 20 bh4 cells dry weight in mass the cores coated with the hydrogel layer were immersed in a crosslinking solution with the 7 4 m ratio of boric acid cacl2 for 3 h to form the shell layer the core shell structured bead was then immersed in 0 2 m na2so4 solution for further stabilization for 8 h 2 2 mbr system three laboratory scale mbrs with a working volume of 2 l were constructed while installing a submerged membrane module made of kolon polyvinyl difluoride hollow fibers with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and an effective surface area of 94 cm2 fig s1 according to the operating conditions table s1 proper media beads were loaded to the reactors at a volume ratio of 0 5 lee et al 2016a briefly mbr1 was always operated in conventional mode without beads but different beads were added into mbr2 and mbr3 for each phase no beads were added into mbr2 and mbr3 in phase 1 so that all three mbrs were run in conventional mode to check the fouling pattern of the three mbrs in phase 2 vacant beads bead 1 were dosed to mbr2 while qq beads without gcl bead 3 were added to mbr3 the effects of physical shear and qq on membrane fouling were evaluated and compared in this phase in phase 3 qq beads without gcl bead 3 were added to mbr2 and qq beads with gcl bead 4 to mbr3 the biostimulation effect on the qq performance and consequent fouling control was thus assessed in phase 4 gcl bead bead 2 and qq beads with gcl bead 4 were added to mbr2 and mbr3 respectively to examine and compare the sole biostimulant effect and its combination with qq on mbr fouling control the mbrs were fed with synthetic wastewater whose ingredients are detailed in table s2 the feed was prepared daily and stored at 4 c supplying it to the mbrs the feed pump was controlled using a level sensor to keep the reactor volume at a constant level 2 l the permeate flux was set at 30 l m2 h with a cyclic operation of 19 min filtration suction and 1 min relaxation no filtration the hydraulic and sludge residence times of all mbrs were 7 5 h and 40 d respectively while maintaining the organic loading rate at 0 755 kg cod m3 d continuous air sparging was performed through an air diffuser underneath the membrane module using an air pump at an air flow rate of 1 0 l min corresponding to 72 s 1 in velocity gradient the transmembrane pressure tmp profile was continuously recorded on a laptop computer using a digital pressure transducer zse 40f smc japan and a digital multimeter m 3850d metex korea 2 3 qq bacteria cultivation and activity tests to examine the effect of biostimulants on the growth and activity of qq bacteria rhodococcus sp bh4 was cultured in luria bertani lb broth with and without adding gcl 1 g l or glucose 1 g l at 30 c and 200 rpm for 24 h the m9 minimal mm medium details are provided in supplementary information was also used for culturing bh4 and gcl 1 g l or glucose 1 g l was added as the sole carbon source bh4 cultivation in the mm medium lasted for 7 d at 30 c and 200 rpm optical density was determined at 600 nm od600 for each culture to evaluate the degree of bh4 growth the bh4 cells harvested were subjected to qq activity tests the bh4 culture broth was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded the cell pellets were collected and diluted to od600 of 1 0 using tris hcl buffer ph 7 50 mm an equal volume of n octanoyl homoserine lactone c8 hsl 400 nm was added to the cell suspension which raised the final c8 hsl and od600 levels to 200 nm and 0 5 respectively c8 hsl was chosen in this study because it has been identified in the literature as one of the major signal molecules in mbr systems kyungmin et al 2009 and indeed it was found to be most abundant in this study the qq activity of bh4 for other ahls and ahl degradation mechanism can be found in previous studies oh et al 2013 weerasekara et al 2014 after shaking the bh4 and c8 hsl mixture at 200 rpm and 30 c in due course the c8 hsl concentration was adopted as the indicator of qq activity similarly the qq activity of the core shell structured beads was determined by adding them 0 5 v v into the c8 hsl solution 200 nm and then measuring the c8 hsl level over time 2 4 controlled gcl release test twenty of each bead core prepared as described above were placed in a conical tube containing 50 ml of deionized water and then continuously agitated in a shaker at 200 rpm and 30 c the extract was replaced daily by fresh deionized water the gcl concentration in the extract was determined by using a liquid chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer detector thermo scientific tsq quantum access max triple quadrupole mass spectrometer lc ms ms in selected reaction monitoring srm mode with the specific pairs of m z values associated with the precursor and fragment ions i e 115 1 68 9 and 115 1 97 0 the cumulative release was calculated by dividing the total amount of gcl released by the total gcl amount initially loaded to the core the initial gcl content in the core was determined by retrieving the gcl from the core as follows for core a it was re dissolved by shaking it in a solution containing 0 1 m disodium edta plus 0 2 m sodium citrate and the re dissolved gcl was measured using the lc ms ms for core b its psf coating layer was peeled off and the gcl contained inside was determined for core c it was first ground in a solvent acetonitrile and the debris of core c in the solvent was sonicated for 30 min the gcl extracted was measured using a lc ms ms for accurate determination of gcl in the different solvents the calibration curves were established separately under the specific conditions 2 5 signal molecule measurement c8 hsl was measured by using the lc ms ms the column used was a hypersil gold c18 column 25003 052130 the mobile phase eluent whose flow rate was set at 250 μl min was composed of acetonitrile 30 and deionized water 70 both with 0 1 formic acid the injection volume was 20 μl details for the ms parameters are as follows spray voltage 3500 v shealth gas pressure 45 arbitrary unit au ion sweep gas pressure 2 0 au auxiliary gas pressure 10 au capillary temperature 300 c collision pressure 1 5 mtorr srm mode was used to collect the data for the two most intensive ion pairs 228 102 228 127 standard curves ranging from 1 nm to 400 nm were constructed with valid correlation coefficients of 0 99 the samples for the lc ms ms analysis were prepared as follows the dissolved fraction of activated sludge mixed liquor was obtained through centrifugation 4000 rpm followed by filtration using a 0 45 μm filter other samples e g activity test samples containing bh4 cells or qq beads were only passed through the 0 45 μm filter the particle free sample 5 ml was loaded to the auto sampler of the lc ms ms with an online solid phase extraction column thermo hypersil aq 25312 022130 for pre concentration of the c8 hsl 2 6 extraction and measurement of smp and eps the mixed liquor 50 ml taken from mbrs was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and the filtrate was used for the determination of smp while eps was extracted from the biomass as described in weerasekara et al 2014 the biomass pellet collected by centrifugation was resuspended in a 0 8 nacl solution and then heated at 80 c for 30 min the solution was centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the filtrate contained the eps extracted from the biomass the concentrations of carbohydrates and proteins present in the smp and eps samples were determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 and the modified lowry method peterson 1977 respectively 2 7 analysis of microbial floc size and treatment efficiency the microbial floc size distributions were determined using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls 13320 beckman coulter usa the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by the dichromate method apha 1998 a dichromate digestion reagent ul hach usa which has a cod detection range of 0 7 40 0 mg l was used with a cod reactor drb 200 hach usa ammonia total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp levels were determined according to the standard methods apha 1998 2 8 visualization of core shell structured beads the surface morphologies of beads were visualized using a video microscope sv 35 sometech korea while the core and shell pores in the bead were observed using a scanning electron microscope su8220 hitachi japan the bh4 cells present in fresh and used beads were stained using a backlight live dead staining kit molecular probes eugene or and observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm 700 carl zeiss germany 2 9 biofilm formation assay the inhibition of biofilm formation by different kinds of beads was determined based on the microtiter dish biofilm formation assay method o toole 2011 activated sludge was incubated for 24 h at 30 c in polystyrene 96 well plates containing lb broth with fresh or used beads the bacteria and beads in the 96 well plates were washed off three times using deionized water the biofilm left in the wells was stained using 1 crystal violet for 15 min washed three time with deionized water and dried out completely the well was then destained with 95 ethanol for 10 min at room temperature the absorbance of the solution containing crystal violet was determined at 595 nm using a microplate reader synergy 2 biotek usa eight replicate wells from each sample were prepared and analyzed and their average and standard deviation values were calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of biostimulant on qq bacteria growth and signal molecule degradation gcl which can promote the qq bacteria in activated sludge cirou et al 2007 2011 yu et al 2016 was used as the qq biostimulant in the present study and rhodococcus sp bh4 a previously isolated qq species that can effectively degrade ahls lee et al 2016b nahm et al 2017 oh et al 2012 taghavi jeloudar et al 2013 was adopted as the qq bacterium fig 1 shows the effects of gcl on the growth and activity of bh4 gcl was added into the lb and m9 media to stimulate bh4 cultivation under eutrophic and oligotrophic conditions respectively the c8 hsl degrading activities of different cultures were assessed as shown in fig 1a gcl and glucose added to the lb broth did not promote bh4 growth the statistical probability value based on one way analysis of variance i e p value 0 106 which was attributed to the fact that the lb medium was already nutrition rich enough to support bh4 growth however the gcl in the lb medium still contributed to an increase in the c8 hsl degrading activity fig 1b wastewater streams are not a nutrition rich diet for microbes like the lb broth was and so the gcl effect on qq biostimulation was further tested in the mm broth where it was completely assimilated by bh4 fig s2 and enhanced bh4 growth unlike the case of glucose addition to mm p value 2 66 10 7 fig 1c in addition gcl in the mm significantly improved the qq activity of bh4 fig 1d which confirmed the effect of gcl on bh4 stimulation showing its potential in wastewater treatment applications 3 2 evaluating the controlled release of gcl biostimulant from polymer bead cores to enable the slow release of the biostimulant gcl from the inner core several different core materials and structures were prepared e g alginate beads coagulated with calcium ions core a alginate beads coated with polysulfone core b and polysulfone psf beads core c as shown in fig 2 a c respectively cores b and c were examined with varying psf contents for optimizing the controlled gcl release as shown in fig 2d e and fig s3 the gcl release from core a was completed within approximately 5 d which appeared to be too short to sustain its long term biostimulation effect the fast release was probably due to the porous structure of core a as the pore diameter of core a was approximately 100 μm see fig s4a core b and core c with different psf contents showed a small burst of release in the beginning and a slow diffusive release later the steady controlled release of gcl from cores b and c could be ascribed to the dense psf structure figs s4b and c the gcl release duration from the cores was estimated using the higuchi model siepmann and peppas 2001 which was found to fit well with the result of psf cores fig s5 cores b and c showed a stable longtime release for more than 440 d and the release duration was extended further with higher psf contents fig 2e in addition the initial amount of gcl loaded in the bead cores was evaluated and compared for different cores the core c group had greater gcl loadings than the core a and core b groups fig s6 the least gcl loss occurred in the core c group possibly owing to their relatively simple preparation procedures considering the gcl loading and release core c with 15 psf was found to be suitable for use in the next step of preparation of core shell structured qq beads 3 3 core shell structured qq beads with controlled gcl release the shell layer outside the core core c with 15 psf was formed using a mixture of pva and alginate see fig s4d which was encapsulating the qq bacteria and then the whole bead was soaked in the calcium boric acid solution for cross linking lee et al 2016a fig 3 a shows the key steps for preparing the bead that has a core with a controlled release character of the biostimulant gcl and a shell encapsulating qq bacteria bh4 several different types of core shell structured qq beads were prepared fig 3b and their qq efficacies were evaluated fig 3c and d the initial qq activity levels of bead 3 and bead 4 were almost the same fig 3c after cultivation for 7 d in the supernatant of activated sludge however the qq activity of bead 4 remained unchanged while that of bead 3 slightly declined in addition gcl release from bead 2 to the supernatant of activated sludge was observed but no gcl was detected in the supernatant with bead 4 fig s7 the result demonstrated the complete assimilation of gcl by the qq bacteria bh4 present in the shell layer and on this basis it was considered that the core shell double layered bead helped to successfully sustain qq activity due to in situ biostimulation with controlled gcl release from the core to the shell 3 4 membrane biofouling control the core shell structured qq beads were applied to the mbr system to demonstrate their biofouling control efficacy fig 4 and figure s8 show the profiles for tmp buildup which is an indicator of membrane fouling as well as the concentrations of smp eps and ahl in three mbrs in phase 1 the three reactors were all operated in conventional mbr mode without beads added their operation time 7 11 7 25 d did not show any significant differences confirming that they were in an identical fouling state see table s1 in phase 2 bead 1 vacant bead and bead 3 qq bead without gcl were added into mbr2 and mbr3 respectively bead 3 prolonged the operation time 13 56 d while significantly delaying fouling while bead 1 had only a marginal effect on fouling delay 8 21 d the eps carbohydrates and proteins and signal molecule c8 hsl concentrations in mbr3 also decreased iqbal et al 2018 tan et al 2014 whereas in mbr2 the smp eps and c8 hsl concentrations were similar to those of the control mbr1 on this basis it was considered that the fouling delay in mbr3 with bead 3 could be ascribed to the qq effect but slight fouling retardation in mbr2 with vacant beads bead 1 could have occurred due to the physical shearing action of the beads taghavi jeloudar et al 2013 in phase 3 the performance of core shell structured beads containing both gcl biostimulant and qq bacteria bead 4 was tested against bead 3 qq bead without gcl the tmp profile and fouling time fig 4 a and b revealed that both bead 3 12 83 d and bead 4 18 81 d mitigated membrane fouling significantly and also reduced the eps and c8 hsl levels iqbal et al 2018 tan et al 2014 notably bead 4 achieved much greater fouling control than bead 3 p value 0 016 which supported the hypothesis that the qq bead coupled with in situ biostimulation using gcl was superior in fouling control compared to the normal qq bead as shown by its qq activity fig 3d in phase 4 the effect of gcl biostimulation on biofouling control was further examined using bead 2 and its performance was compared with that of bead 4 mbr2 containing bead 2 had a slight fouling retardation average fouling time 7 94 d compared to the control mbr1 6 13 d although the smp eps and ahl levels for mbr2 were comparable to those of mbr1 the reduced fouling in mbr2 could again be attributed to the physical shear effect in fact the average fouling time for mbr with bead 2 i e mbr2 in phase 4 was comparable with that of mbr with vacant beads mbr2 in phase 2 showing the p value of 0 335 that is statistically there was no significant difference between them however mbr3 with bead 4 showed considerable fouling mitigation average fouling time 18 56 d which implied that the biostimulation alone was not sufficient enough for biofouling mitigation and that superior fouling control was possible with the novel core shell structured qq bead which combined in situ biostimulation with bioaugmentation as demonstrated above by mbr3 in phases 3 and 4 the characteristics of mixed liquor and removal efficiencies of organics and nutrients did not change significantly for the three mbrs operated under the various experimental conditions figs s8 and s9 the result revealed that the new qq strategy with core shell structured beads mitigated membrane fouling significantly but without deteriorating or sacrificing any biological treatment performances it has been reported that previously tested qq media e g vessel and sheet did not affect biological treatment efficiency iqbal et al 2018 weerasekara et al 2014 3 5 sustainable activity and growth of qq bacteria in core shell structured beads the sustainability of qq bacteria in core shell structured beads was examined by comparing the activity of fresh and used qq beads fig 5 a shows the ahl degradation profiles for bead 3 and bead 4 before fresh and after used their use for the mbrs in phase 3 that is the two types of beads were used for approximately 39 d and then retrieved from the mbrs the qq activity of used bead 3 decreased relatively significantly compared to that of its fresh counterpart whereas used bead 4 maintained its initial high level of activity the sustained qq activity of bead 4 reflected the biostimulation effect of its gcl without the gcl biostimulant e g bead 3 the qq bacteria present in the under nourished part inner zone of the biomedium shell did not flourish the viability of bh4 cells in beads 3 and 4 was monitored using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm before and after their use live bh4 cells in the shell layer of both beads were bright green see fig 5b c the whole shell layer of used bead 4 was still green indicating that the cells were alive after use fig 5e however the inner part of bead 3 shell turned red fig 5d indicating that some of the cells in the zone were dead this result demonstrated the merit of a double layered bead structure with qq bacteria in the shell and gcl in the core consequently it was apparent that core shell structured qq beads which integrated bioaugmentation and biostimulation in one medium enhanced the viability of qq bacteria while supporting sustainable qq efficacy during long term mbr operations 3 6 enhanced biofilm formation control by core shell structured qq beads to further confirm the efficacy of core shell structured qq beads biofilm formation tests were conducted using fresh and used beads the absorbance and intensity of crystal violet color indicated the degree of biofilm formed fig 6 as described in section 2 9 it was apparent that fresh beads 3 and 4 inhibited biofilm formation substantially although beads 1 and 2 did not after use phase 3 bead 4 still maintained the inhibiting capability against biofilm formation but bead 3 lost this capacity the result demonstrated the effectiveness of in situ biostimulation in the design of qq bacteria augmenting media 4 conclusions a double layered qq bead with a biostimulating agent gcl in its core and encapsulated qq bacteria bh4 in its shell has been successfully fabricated this bead enabled highly efficient and sustainable biofouling control in mbrs gcl has a clear stimulating effect on the growth of bh4 capable of microbial quorum sensing inhibition through the degradation of signal molecules such as c8 hsl the results have demonstrated the potential of gcl in its application to the mbr treatment of wastewater with limited food supplies for microbes dense polymer bead cores were predicted to be able to continue stable gcl release for more than several hundred days preparing a single polysulfone core with confined gcl of varying amounts was shown to be simple and the core shell structured bead containing gcl in the psf core and bh4 in the shell sustained its qq activity after exposure to the supernatant of activated sludge the new qq media design demonstrated superior fouling control compared to other types of bead structures during mbr operations as it contributed to lowering the ahl and eps levels responsible for membrane biofouling the layered qq bead with gcl in the core exhibited ongoing qq activity after long term use in an mbr e g 39 d in phase 3 indicating that the provision of gcl from the core to the bacteria bh4 in the shell led to the qq bacteria staying alive the layered bifunctional media demonstrated improved inhibition of biofilm formation when compared with other types of media tested and we contend that this new biomedium has potential for a wide range of engineering applications associated with the control of biofouling acknowledgements this research was supported by the national research foundation of korea grant no 2016r1a2b2013776 funded

cathode the experimental results show the destruction of 4 np 60 ml 10 mg l can be as high as 99 in addition the yields of ch3oh and c2h5oh were 98 29 μmol l and 40 95 μmol l respectively which represents a conversion of 41 8 of 4 np into liquid fuels the electron efficiency was 73 1 in addition we found that 3d hexagonal arrays of co3o4 with different morphologies can be obtained by adding different amounts of urea we also investigated the formation mechanism of novel 3d hexagonal co3o4 arrays for the first time a mechanism was proposed to explain the electrocatalytic steps involved in the conversion of 4 np to ch3oh and c2h5oh and the synergetic effects between aops and electrocatalysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes co2 reduction electrooxidation electroreduction organic pollutants sulfate radical 1 introduction with rapid economic development in the past few decades the discharge of wastewater and the emission of greenhouse gases have become the two most serious environmental problems that humans are facing choi et al 2010 centi et al 2013 accordingly extensive studies have focused on the oxidation of organic compounds in wastewaters into co2 and the reduction of co2 into liquid fuels zou et al 2016 dong et al 2017 cao et al 2015 advanced oxidation processes aops are promising technologies to degrade organic compounds in aqueous media because they can generate highly reactive species such as oh and so4 radicals that quickly oxidize a broad range of organic pollutants ghanbari and moradi 2017 there have been many reports about the destruction of organic pollutants by so4 that have been produced by peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxodisulfate pds huang et al 2017a hu et al 2017a pms and pds generate so4 using a high energy input e g heating uv irradiation or ultrasound govindan et al 2014 yang et al 2010 in addition some transition metal ions such as co2 mn2 fe2 and cu2 can generate so4 or and oh by using pds or pms which leads to the efficient degradation of organic pollutants in water zeng et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 deng et al 2017a electrochemical oxidation eo is an excellent technology for degrading organic pollutants in wastewater jiang et al 2017 zhao and zhu 2006 the simplest and most popular eo is anodic oxidation ao where organics can be oxidized directly at the anode surface by electron transfer active anodes and or indirectly oxidized by radicals that are generated at the anode inactive anodes i e oh and so4 moreira et al 2017 some materials such as ruo2 iro2 pbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd chai et al 2017 have been studied and confirmed to be good candidates for organic pollutant degradation by eo it is well known that boron doped diamond bdd electrodes have attracted much interest because of their high electrocatalytic activity for the activation of pms or pds that quickly oxidize a broad range of organic pollutants song et al 2018 matzek et al 2018 farhat et al 2015 however the price of bdd is very high causing the application of bdd to be severely limited in real wastewater treatment therefore it is urgent to develop cheap efficient and stable materials for the activation of pms or pds to generate highly reactive species of oh and so4 radicals furthermore until now there have been no reports on the combination of electrocatalytic oxidation with aops based on so4 from the activation of transition metal oxides for the degradation of organic pollutants in theory if an electrode had good electrocatalytic properties for the degradation of organic pollutants and could simultaneously activate pms or pds to generate so4 it would be highly efficient in degrading organic pollutants cobalt oxides have been used for the activation of pms especially co3o4 this has been extensively reported and cobalt oxides are effective because they have valence states that can provide electrons for the reduction of pms or pds to generate sulfate radicals hu et al 2017b shao et al 2017 in addition cobalt oxides are good electrocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants studies have been conducted using co3o4 as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation and dye destruction yadav and purkait 2015a b 2016 furthermore co3o4 has been extensively investigated in electrochemical oxidation reactions such as oxygen evolution reactions bergmann et al 2015 and water oxidation xue et al 2017 to date co3o4 with different morphologies including nanocubes nanowires nanospheres and nanotubes have been extensively investigated jing et al 2012 however these powdered forms of co3o4 used as electrodes have limited electrocatalytic performance and they are difficult to cycle therefore it is urgent to prepare co3o4 with novel array morphologies on electrodes to improve their overall performance electrochemical co2 reduction to liquid fuels is considered to be one of the most efficient mechanisms for the reduction of co2 which generates various reduced products including hcooh ch3oh c2h5oh ch4 and so on the electrocatalysts for co2 reduction can be divided into three groups metallic nonmetallic and molecular catalysts among all of the metallic catalysts cu based catalysts exhibit good catalytic ability to produce a wide range of co2 reduction products including hcooh hoffman et al 2017 c2h5oh chi et al 2014 and c2h4 reller et al 2017 despite many reports on the electroreduction of co2 and the degradation of organic pollutants by aops or electrocatalysis there are no reports on the coupling of organic pollutant degradation with electrocatalytic co2 reduction in a catalytic system to achieve highly efficient one pot conversion of organic pollutants to liquid fuels i e hcooh ch3oh and c2h5oh based on this discussion we prepared co3o4 arrays as an anode for the electrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and flower like cuo as a cathode for electrocatalytic co2 reduction we first coupled electrocatalytic oxidation with aops based on so4 from the activation of transition metal oxides for the degradation of organic pollutants in order to improve the removal efficiency of organic pollutants in addition we proposed a mechanism to explain the electrocatalytic steps involved in the conversion of 4 np to ch3oh and c2h5oh and the synergetic effects between aops and electrocatalysis as well as electrocatalytic oxidation and electrocatalytic reduction 2 experimental methods 2 1 characterizations and analytical methods analytical grade reagents and chemicals were used without further purification detailed information for the chemicals and characterizations is provided in the supporting information text s1 in addition the detailed preparation processes for the 3d hexagram co3o4 anode and the flower like cuo cathode are available in the supporting information text s1 2 2 degradation of 4 np and electrocatalytic reduction of co2 2 2 1 degradation of 4 np by electrocatalysis and aops detailed information for the degradation of 4 np by aops is discussed in the supporting information text s2 degradation of 4 np by electrocatalysis and aops was performed using a potentiostat chi 630e electrochemical workstation shanghai chenhua china at room temperature 25 c in an h type cell in which a piece of nafion 117 membrane was used as a separator ag agcl was the reference electrode while a pt foil and the as prepared co3o4 area 6 cm2 actual area insert solution 3 75 cm2 were respectively used as the cathode and anode the electrolyte used in the anodic and cathodic compartments was 0 1 m na2so4 60 ml with 10 mg l 4 np and 0 1 m khco3 60 ml respectively an appropriate amount of pms was added to the reactor of anodic compartments before the catalytic reaction the electrocatalytic system was continuously stirred throughout the process the potential was set at 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v vs ag agcl between the anode and reference electrode the solution was sampled from the anodic compartment at prescribed intervals and was filtered by a cellulose acetate membrane 0 45 μm after which methanol was added to quench the radicals the degradation rate of 4 np was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer mapada v 1100d in this situation 4 np was degraded by both electrocatalysis and the aops were performed according to the same process as used for the 4 np degradation by electrocatalysis we also conducted control experiments using the electrocatalytic process in which no pms was added the only difference was the absence of pms during the catalytic reaction 2 2 2 electrocatalytic reduction of co2 cuo area 6 cm2 actual area insert solution 3 75 cm2 was used as cathode for co2 electroreduction we used a three electrode electrochemical h type cell system ag agcl was the reference electrode while pt foil and cuo were respectively used as the anode and cathode the electrolytes used in the anodic and cathodic compartments were 0 1 m na2so4 60 ml and 0 1 m khco3 60 ml respectively prior to electrocatalysis the cathodic electrolyte was purged with co2 for 30 min to become saturated with co2 the potential was set as 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v vs ag agcl between the cathode and reference electrode during electrocatalysis a given amount of solution was collected from the cathodic reaction cell at given time intervals and was filtered by a cellulose acetate membrane 0 45 μm subsequently ch3oh and c2h5oh concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph gc 7890a fid db wax agilent america 2 2 3 catalytic degradation of 4 np coupled with electrocatalytic reduction of co2 the experimental process of the 4 np degradation by electrocatalytic oxidation and aops coupled with simultaneous electrocatalytic reduction of co2 is similar to that of degradation of 4 np by electrocatalysis and aops the differences are that cuo was used as a cathode for co2 electroreduction and that co2 originated from 4 np mineralization was transported from the anode to the cathode by nitrogen gas as a carrier gas the electrolyte used in the anodic and cathodic compartments was 0 1 m na2so4 60 ml with 10 mg l 4 np and 0 1 m khco3 60 ml respectively the potentials were set at 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v vs ag agcl between the cathode and reference electrode the analyses of products from the anode and cathode are the same as those used for degradation by electrocatalytic oxidation and aops and the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrode characterizations the crystalline properties of the as prepared co3o4 and cuo were analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd as shown in figs s1a and s1b in the supporting information si the as prepared co3o4 and cuo have a good crystallinity in addition there were no impurity peaks observed in the as prepared co3o4 and cuo the as prepared co3o4 that was prepared using 0 2 g 0 5 g 1 0 g and 1 5 g urea is hereafter called co0 2 co0 5 co1 0 and co1 5 respectively furthermore compared to the xrd of co0 5 before the electrocatalytic reaction there was nearly no change for co0 5 after 2 h of reaction time indicating that co0 5 shows good stability as a comparison there is an obvious peak of cu in the xrd patterns of cuo after 2 h of catalytic reaction time indicating that cuo was partially reduced to cu during the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 this is consistent with previous studies li and kanan 2012 huang et al 2017b the results of the raman spectra and ft ir spectra further confirm the formation of co3o4 figs s1c and s1d in si details are provided in the supporting information text s3 the morphologies of the as prepared co0 2 co0 5 co1 0 co1 5 and cuo electrodes were examined using sem and tem as shown in fig s2a the co0 2 shows a rose like morphology with a diameter of approximately 6 7 μm whereas the co0 5 exhibits a novel hexagonal morphology with a rough surface consisting of nanoparticles which is different than that of co3o4 reported in the literature fig s2b shen et al 2015 li et al 2011 hong et al 2017 with the increase in urea weight the surface of the hexagonal co3o4 becomes smooth figs s2c and s2d in si the results confirm that the amount of urea plays an important role in the morphology of the co3o4 meanwhile tem images of co0 5 figs s3a b reveal that the hexagon of co3o4 consists of many nanoparticles the lattice spacing of 0 286 nm corresponds to the 2 2 0 facet of co3o4 fig s3c in si edx analysis demonstrates the existence of co and o in the co0 5 catalyst fig s3d in si as shown in fig s4 the as prepared cuo material shows a flower like microstructure composed of numerous nanosheets the tem image shows that the width of a single nanosheet is approximately 110 nm fig s4c the hrtem image shows a lattice spacing of 0 24 nm corresponding to the 1 1 1 facet of cuo fig s4d the edx analysis of the cuo indicates that only cu and o are present in the flower like cuo fig s5 the results of the electrochemical impedance spectra eis show that the co0 5 electrode exhibited relatively lower charge transfer resistance which was beneficial for enhanced electronic interactions fig s6a in si as shown in fig s6b the cuo catalyst exhibited a lower charge transfer resistance which was beneficial during the electroreduction of co2 3 2 catalytic degradation of 4 np fig s7a displays the degradation of 4 np in the systems of only the pms solution and only the as prepared co0 2 co0 5 co1 0 and co1 5 electrodes the removal efficiency of 4 np in the pms system is 1 2 the removal efficiencies of 4 np on the co0 2 co0 5 co1 0 and co1 5 electrodes are 3 55 4 05 3 12 and 2 43 after 60 min respectively the co0 5 has a higher removal efficiency for 4 np because it has a larger surface area of co0 5 127 86 m2 g than that of co0 2 123 28 m2 g co1 0 110 56 m2 g and co1 5 106 39 m2 g as a comparison 92 of 4 np was degraded within 60 min in the pms co0 5 system whereas 87 7 83 7 and 71 of 4 np were removed within 60 min in the pms co0 2 pms co1 0 and pms co1 5 systems respectively fig 1 a the above results suggest that the co3o4 anodes were essential for activating pms and that co0 5 shows much better catalytic performance than co0 2 co1 0 and co1 5 meanwhile the kinetic degradation data of 4 np follows the pseudo first order kinetic fig s8 in si the details are provided in the supporting information text s3 the results indicate that the active sites on the co0 5 surface are more reactive than other co3o4 anodes with different urea weights 3 3 effects of pms loading and different ions on the degradation of 4 np to investigate the effect of the pms concentration on the degradation of 4 np different pms concentrations were used as shown in fig s7b with the increase in pms concentrations 4 np degradation increases with an increase in the concentration of pms but it becomes worse when the concentration is higher than 1 g l the pms concentration is known to be directly related to the number of radicals that are generated i e so4 and oh leading to 4 np degradation thus when the pms concentration is higher than 1 g l scavenging of so4 radicals will occur as expressed by the following equations 1 3 1 hso5 so4 so5 h so4 2 2 oh so4 hso5 3 so4 so4 s2o8 2 according to some studies lin et al 2017 gong et al 2017 so5 is less reactive than so4 hence an increased concentration of pms would result in a decrease in the degradation efficiency of 4 np indicating the existence of an optimum oxidant concentration in the oxidation process to investigate the anionic effects of hco3 cl and so4 2 coupled with pms on 4 np degradation 0 1 m na2so4 0 1 m nacl and 0 1 m nahco3 were used as analytes as shown in fig s7c cl is favorable for the catalytic degradation of 4 np in the presence of pms because cl can be oxidized by so4 and oh to produce cl2 radicals that are inclined to attack electron rich groups leading to the decomposition of 4 np hu et al 2017 however hco3 has an important effect on degradation of 4 np in the co0 5 pms system the reason that so4 could react with oh and h2o in the alkaline environment to convert it to oh is shown in the following equations 4 and 5 4 so4 oh so4 2 oh 5 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h based on previous work the rate constants for eqs 4 and 5 are k oh 6 5 1 0 10 3 l mol s and k h2o 2 10 3 s 1 respectively based on this so4 begins to decompose and to transform into oh rapidly at the solution ph value 8 5 and oh will become the dominator when the ph value is alkaline for the system containing hco3 2 the ph value of the solution is higher than 8 0 where oh plays a major role in the degradation process and the degradation efficiency of 4 np is slower than co0 5 pms in the na2so4 solution yang et al 2010 the effect of different voltages on the degradation of 4 np was further investigated as shown in fig 1a only 18 37 26 57 and 37 36 of 4 np were degraded using the co0 5 electrode at bias voltages of 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v respectively fig 1b indicates nearly 100 of 4 np was degraded by the co0 5 pms system at different bias potentials after 60 min this result was much better than the results for the co0 5 electrode alone at the bias voltages and the results for the co0 5 pms system in addition the 3d hexagonal arrays of co3o4 in the new electrocatalytic system have better performance than those reported in the literature the results show that electrocatalytic oxidation coupled with aops has much more efficiency for 4 np degradation than electrocatalytic oxidation indicating that there is an obvious synergistic effect between electrocatalytic oxidation and aops because the as prepared anode of co3o4 can directly electrocatalytic oxidize 4 np and activate pms to generate oh and so4 radicals that quickly oxidize 4 np control experiments of 4 np degradation by the electrode of fluorine doped tin oxide fto and the fto pms system at different voltages were investigated as shown in fig 1c the degradation efficiency of 4 np increases with the increase in the bias potential 12 9 17 9 and 22 1 of 4 np were removed at various bias potentials of 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v respectively which could be due to electrostatic adsorption of 4 np on the fto electrode or direct electro oxidation of 4 np by the fto electrode compared to the removal efficiency of 4 np on the fto electrode at different bias voltages the removal efficiency of 4 np was evidently improved on the co0 5 electrode at different bias voltages indicating that electrocatalytic oxidation of 4 np occurred on the co0 5 electrode furthermore the degradation efficiency of 4 np was markedly increased in the presence of pms compared to the fto system at various bias potentials only 46 6 of 4 np was removed in the fto pms system at a bias potential of 0 8 v within 60 min as shown in fig 1b the bdd electrode had a much worse effect on 4 np degradation compared to the as prepared co3o4 electrode moreover as shown in table s1 in the si we also compare the two systems in terms of energy consumption electron efficiency reaction time and stability the results suggest that the co3o4 electrode is more efficient for electrochemical activation of pms than the bdd electrode leading to a much better degradation effect for 4 np and less energy consumption furthermore it should be noted that the price of the bdd is approximately 1000 times that of the co3o4 electrode although the stability of co3o4 is slightly worse than that of the bdd electrode it is meaningful to choose co3o4 to activate pms which is more beneficial to the full utilization of pms therefore the above results confirm that the as prepared co3o4 exhibits much better performance and lower cost than the bdd 3 4 effect of ph in chemical oxidation processes ph plays a key role in the generation of free radicals the impact of 4 np degradation was examined in the co0 5 pms and co0 5 pms systems at 0 8 v at ph values ranging from 3 5 to 7 fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the degradation efficiency decreases considerably as the ph decrease from 6 to 3 5 in the co0 5 pms system and the co0 5 pms at 0 8 v system at low ph ph 6 h scavenges sulfate and hydroxyl radicals according to eqs 6 and 7 respectively resulting in a marked decline in the degradation efficiency of 4 np fang et al 2012 huang et al 2009 6 oh h e h2o 7 so4 h e hso4 when 6 ph 7 the degradation efficiency of 4 np shows a small decrease as ph increases which is due to the formation of a hydroxo complex containing co2 with less reactivity for pms activation than co2 in addition the solution in the anodic compartment is always acidic in the co0 5 pms system at 0 8 v because a large quantity of h formed at the anode during the reaction therefore we did not consider the case of alkaline conditions 3 5 electrochemical reduction of co2 to estimate the electrochemical behavior of the catalyst for co2 reduction lsv curves of the as prepared cuo in n2 saturated and co2 saturated electrolyte with 0 1 m khco3 were tested as shown in fig s9a the as prepared cuo electrode has favorable reduction potential because the current density is high for the co2 reduction reaction co2rr compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction her accordingly there will be a smaller barrier to the initial electron transfer to form an active reduction product of co2 on the cuo electrode as shown in fig 1d the formation yields of ch3oh and c2h5oh reach 125 8 and 22 22 μmol l respectively for 0 1 m khco3 at 0 8 v and 120 min of reaction time from 0 8 v to 1 0 v the yields of ch3oh and c2h5oh decrease with the increase in potential the phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the reaction is co2rr at the potential of 0 8 v rather than her and her becomes the dominant reaction peng et al 2015 in addition the main products of ch3oh and c2h5oh are also demonstrated by an nmr test fig s9b 3 6 catalytic degradation of 4 np coupled with the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 as shown in fig 3 a as the potential changed from 0 8 to 1 0 v the yields of ch3oh and c2h5oh decreased and the maximum yields of methanol and ethanol were 98 29 μmol l and 40 95 μmol l at 0 8 v after 120 min respectively representing a conversion of 41 8 of 4 np into liquid fuels the electron efficiency was 73 1 accordingly as shown in fig s10 the total organic carbon toc decreased rapidly from 7 39 mg l to 0 52 mg l in 120 min confirming that 93 of 4 np can be mineralized to co2 and water the catalytic stability of cuo was also studied using the potentiostatic technique as shown in fig s11a the current density of the cuo electrode becomes stable at different applied potentials during the electrocatalytic reaction uv vis absorption spectra fig s11b in si confirm that 4 np was completely mineralized to co2 over the co0 5 electrode in the process of degradation of 4 np coupled with electrocatalytic co2 reduction furthermore the cobalt leaching concentration of the co0 5 electrode is 0 503 mg l after the 120 min catalytic reaction which is far below the environmental quality standards for surface water of l mg l gb 3838 2002 in china as shown in fig 3b there was only 4 7 removal efficiency of 4 np after four cycles this could be mainly attributed to a slight decrease in the co2 co3 ratio on the co0 5 electrode the results show that the as prepared co3o4 electrode is stable in the process of catalytic degradation of 4 np coupled with electrocatalytic co2 reduction 3 7 formation mechanism of the co3o4 anode with 3d hexagonal arrays for the first time we propose the formation mechanism of the 3d hexagonal co3o4 arrays as shown in fig 4 we propose the formation of the intermediate co oh f by a solvothermal method using urea as an alkaline reagent in the presence of nh4f at 120 c which differs from previous reports jing et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 the formation of the co oh f intermediate was confirmed by xrd patterns as shown in fig s12a it is important to note that the composition of solvent is essential to obtain the co oh f intermediate when the volume ratio of ethylene glycol eg and water is 1 3 co oh f can form on fto substrates whereas co oh f cannot grow directly on fto substrates when the volume ratios of eg and water are 1 1 and 3 1 normally co oh f was formed via the hydrothermal method using hexamethylenetetramine as an alkaline reagent whereas cobalt hydroxide carbonate was obtained using urea as the alkaline reagent under the same reaction condition jing et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the formation of a co oh f intermediate obtained using urea as the alkaline reagent which was combined with a solvent mixture of eg and water in the during the solvothermal reaction process the hydrolysis of urea occurred at approximately 70 c and co2 and nh3 were formed gradually it is worth noting that co2 played a role as pressure increased but it did not form co3 2 in the presence of eg which inhibited the formation of cobalt hydroxide carbonate this is why co oh f arrays can be prepared using urea as the alkaline reagent in the present work after calcination the intermediate of co oh f arrays were transformed into co3o4 the chemical reactions that are involved in preparation process can be expressed with the following formulas 8 co2 f cof 9 co nh2 2 h2o 2nh3 co2 10 nh3 h2o nh4 oh 11 cof oh co oh f 12 6co oh f o2 2co3o4 6hf furthermore the addition of different amounts of urea has a significant influence on the morphology of the product of co3o4 many researchers have reported that the addition of surfactants such as sodium dodecylsulfonate sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide xu et al 2016 has a significant influence on the morphologies of products different from the above methods 3d hexagonal arrays of co3o4 with different morphologies can be obtained by adding different amounts of urea in this study 3 8 synergetic mechanism of 4 np degradation coupled with co2 reduction we identified the major active radicals generated in these systems i fto pms with a 0 8 v bias potential ii co0 5 with a 0 8 v bias potential iii co0 5 pms and iv co0 5 pms with a 0 8 v bias potential various radical scavengers namely tertbutyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were used tba was used as the radical scavenger for oh but not for so4 radicals because of its much higher reactivity with oh k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 compared to so4 kso4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 luo et al 2017 meoh is typically used to scavenge both oh k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 kso4 1 6 7 8 107 m 1 s 1 due to its high reactivity interestingly for the fto pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential the 4 np removal efficiency decreases from 46 61 to 29 36 and 29 43 fig 5 a after adding 5 mm meoh and 6 mm tba respectively indicating that oh plays role in the degradation of 4 np furthermore the removal efficiencies of 4 np after adding meoh and tba 29 36 and 29 43 respectively are both higher than those of the fto electrode with a 0 8 v bias potential 12 9 the results suggest that both oh and nonradicals are attributed with 4 np degradation in the fto pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential in accordance with previous studies for the co0 5 system with a 0 8 v bias potential the removal efficiency of 4 np decreased from 18 37 to 7 99 when tba was added fig 5b this phenomenon suggests that oh can be formed via electrocatalysis because tba scavenges oh for the system of co0 5 pms the removal efficiency of 4 np decreases from 91 86 to 18 54 and 69 36 fig 5c after adding meoh and tba respectively for the co0 5 pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential the removal efficiency of 4 np decreases from 99 84 to 21 68 and 83 03 with the addition of meoh and tba respectively fig 5d furthermore as depicted in fig 4d the addition of meoh inhibited the oxidation reaction with only 21 68 of 4 np degraded during oxidation since the 4 np degradation efficiency decreases to 83 03 in the presence of tba so4 is considered the dominant radical species in this system at a neutral ph meanwhile we have quantified both scavengers i e meoh and tba contributions toward so4 and oh based on the calculations details were mentioned in text s4 in si meoh 5 mm was able to scavenge 98 of so4 and 99 8 of oh whereas tba 6 mm could only scavenge 48 of so4 in addition it still had a high scavenging impact on oh accounting for 95 6 based on the calculation results tba is mainly responsible for oh scavenging whereas meoh has a scavenging impact on both so4 and oh in other words by increasing so4 in the solution by 50 the 4 np degradation efficiency can increase to 70 which further confirms that so4 rather than oh plays an important role on 4 np degradation in this system finally the results of electron paramagnetic resonance fig s13 in si show that there are no signals tested in the pms solution and the mixed solution of pms and 4 np indicating that no radicals were produced for the co0 5 pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential a set of peaks assigned to dmpo oh and dmpo so4 can be detected but no signals of dmpo o2 are identified revealing that only oh and so4 act as the main reactive species in the system of co0 5 pms with a 0 8 v bias potential the above results reveal that both oh and so4 act as the main reactive species but so4 plays the dominant role in 4 np degradation in the above proposed systems except for the system that does not contain pms the co0 5 pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential was determined to be the most efficient system for 4 np degradation as shown in fig 6 a two peaks with binding energies at 779 4 and 794 5 ev in the as prepared co3o4 are attributed to the co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 of co3 respectively whereas the two peaks at 780 6 and 795 9 ev are ascribed to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 of co2 respectively qiu et al 2014 it is important to note that the co2 co3 ratio is the largest for co0 5 among the four as prepared co3o4 anodes table s3 this reveals that co0 5 possesses more surface adsorbed oxygen and surface oxygen vacancies than the other co3o4 electrodes leading to better catalytic performance than other co3o4 electrodes si et al 2014 fig 6b shows the xps spectra of co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 of co0 5 before and after 120 min catalytic reactions in different systems including i co0 5 with 0 8 v bias potential ii co0 5 pms and iii co0 5 pms with 0 8 v bias potential the relative co2 co3 ratio on the co0 5 surface only decreases slightly from 1 85 to 1 74 in the co0 5 at 0 8 v system this result implies that the process of electrochemical oxidation involves a little transformation of co2 co3 leading to oh formation for the co0 5 pms and co0 5 pms systems with a 0 8 v bias potential the co2 co3 ratio decreases to 1 68 for the co0 5 pms system and decreases to 1 58 for the co0 5 pms with a 0 8 v bias potential the results indicate that the transformation of co2 co3 plays an important role in the aops and that electrochemical oxidation coupled with co0 5 pms can largely accelerate the degradation of 4 np the mechanisms of pms activation including i electrochemical activation and ii chemical activation by co0 5 were evaluated in this study the detailed processes of pms activation by co0 5 are shown in eqs 13 19 deng et al 2017b 13 co2 h2o cooh 14 cooh hso5 coo so4 h2o 15 so4 oh so4 2 oh 16 so4 h2o hso4 oh 17 so4 oh 4 np many steps co2 h2o 18 co3 hso5 co2 so5 h 19 so5 o2 so4 o2 first co2 can serve as lewis base sites and couple with dissociative adsorption of h2o to produce cooh on the co3o4 surface eq 13 for co0 5 many cooh sites were generated on the surface due to its large specific surface area high pore volume high co2 content and high density of active sites on the surface after the addition of pms the formed cooh can easily combine with pms through h bonding subsequently co2 loses electrons and is oxidized to co3 and the o h and o o bonds simultaneously cleave after accepting electrons to generate so4 eq 14 partial so4 can further react with oh or h2o to produce oh eqs 15 and 16 the 4 np in solution can be enriched on the surface of the co0 5 electrode and can be decomposed or even mineralized by the interaction with so4 and oh eq 17 meanwhile the surface lattice oxygen o2 will be oxidized to o2 accompanying the reduction of co3 to co2 eqs 18 and 19 second pms can be activated by electrolysis to generate both oh and nonradicals that are attributed for 4 np degradation according to the results in figs 1c and 5a therefore a synergistic effect between the electrochemical and chemical processes for pms activation can be formed in the system of co0 5 pms at different bias potentials this generates so4 and oh which improves 4 np degradation finally 4 np degradation can also result from direct electro oxidation by the co0 5 electrode according to the results in figs 1a and 5b for the mechanism of electrocatalytic co2 reduction shown in fig s12b h and o2 will be formed at the anode according to the following reaction 20 h2o 2h 1 2o2 the generated h can be transferred from the anode compartment to cathode compartment through nafion 117 to participate in the co2 reduction reaction the generated co2 from the co3o4 anode accepts an electron from the cuo electrode to form a co2 free radical and further reacts with an electron to form the carboxyl cooh intermediate the generated cooh can be reduced to co and then the co reacts with another proton electron pair to form hydroxymethylidyne coh or a formyl cho radical the coh and cho are further reduced to methanol on the other hand co would further participate in the reaction by obtaining electrons and protons from the anode to form ethanol to better understand the mechanism of the co2 electrochemical reduction on the cuo electrode an in situ ft ir spectroelectrochemical technique was used to detect the adsorbed species that formed on the electrode surface fig s14 shows the electrolysis time dependent infrared spectrum recorded at the region between 500 and 4000 cm 1 at 0 8 v vs ag agcl where the signal of the cuo electrode in 0 1 m khco3 solution was used as the background the peak at 2341 cm 1 corresponds to dissolved co2 in aqueous solutions which comes from the mineralization of 4 np the absorption bands at 1345 and 1589 cm 1 are ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of formate ions hcoo and the band at 3300 cm 1 is associated with the o h stretching of alcohol the intensity of these peaks increases with reaction time suggesting the formation of alcohol products the bands at 2916 cm 1 can be assigned to the c h stretching vibration of ch2 whereas the band at 1447 cm 1 was attributed to the deformation vibration of ch3 these results indicate that formic acid intermediate product methanol and ethanol were generated in the cathodic compartment therefore the synergetic mechanism of 4 np degradation coupled with electrocatalytic co2 reduction is proposed in scheme 1 in the anode 4 np was mineralized to co2 by pms aops coupled with electrocatalytic oxidation based on so4 and oh over the co3o4 electrode meanwhile water can also be oxidized by the co3o4 electrode to produce h and o2 then the generated h and co2 are transferred from the anode compartment to the cathode compartment via nafion 117 and the gas pipe respectively finally co2 adsorbs on the cuo electrode and then reacts with h to produce ch3oh and c2h5oh when it obtains electrons from the cuo electrode the overall reaction processes is shown by eqs 21 23 21 co2 2h 2e hcooh 22 co2 6h 6e ch3oh h2o 23 co2 12h 12e c2h5oh h2o the mechanism explains why the system of co0 5 pms with a 0 8 v bias potential has the highest degradation efficiency of 4 np among the various systems that we tested in addition it illustrates the good synergetic effect between aops electrocatalytic oxidation and direct electro oxidation for 4 np degradation on the co3o4 anode in addition the one pot efficient conversion of 4 np into liquid fuels was achieved with the coupling of 4 np degradation with electrocatalytic co2 reduction furthermore the degradation route and the decomposition mechanism of 4 np in the co0 5 pms system at 0 8 v were thoroughly investigated the concentration and composition of the reaction solution at different reaction times were tested by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms possible pathways for 4 np degradation are shown in text s5 in the si in accordance with previous studies of pathways for 4 np degradation in aops li et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 as shown in fig s15 so4 and oh act as active species to attack chemical bonds and then mineralize 4 np to co2 and h2o finally a possible 4 np degradation mineralization roadmap was proposed 3 9 degradation of complex organic pollutants coupled with electrocatalytic reduction of co2 in the co0 5 pms system at 0 8 v the co0 5 pms at 0 8 v system was also used to degrade complex organic pollutants that only consisted of 10 mg l 4 np 10 mg l sulfamethoxazole and 10 mg l tetracycline as shown in fig 7 a sulfamethoxazole 4 np and tetracycline can be degraded well by the co0 5 pms system at 0 8 v according to the uv vis absorption spectra results furthermore the total organic carbon toc results also confirm that 84 of complex organic pollutants can be mineralized to co2 and water over the co0 5 pms at 0 8 v system after 120 min of reaction in fig 7b in addition the yield efficiencies of ch3oh and c2h5oh are 64 94 μmol l and 13 32 μmol l respectively the results indicate that the co3o4 pms system at bias voltage is a potential candidate for complex organic pollutant treatments 4 conclusion in summary we developed a novel electrocatalytic system to create a one pot conversion of organic pollutants to liquid fuels by combining the degradation of 4 np with simultaneous electrocatalytic reduction of co2 using a co3o4 anode and a cuo cathode in this catalytic system the electrocatalytic technology was first coupled with aops based on so4 for the degradation of 4 np over the co3o4 anode with novel morphology of 3d hexagonal arrays experimental results demonstrate that co0 5 has the best catalytic activity for 4 np degradation in addition the formation mechanism of the novel 3d hexagonal co3o4 arrays was investigated for the first time a mechanism was proposed to explain the electrocatalytic steps involved in the conversion of 4 np to ch3oh and c2h5oh as well as the synergetic effects between aops and electrocatalysis overall this work opens a new avenue to efficiently mineralize organic pollutants by coupling electrocatalytic oxidation with aops it also allows us to combine electro oxidation and

19117,a novel electrocatalytic system was developed to realize one pot conversion of organic pollutants into liquid fuels such as methanol ch3oh and ethanol c2h5oh the process combines the catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants with electrocatalytic reduction of co2 we first coupled the electrocatalytic process with so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops for the degradation of 4 nitrophenol 4 np using a 3d hexagonal co3o4 anode in this step 4 np was mineralized to co2 and then the co2 was converted to ch3oh and c2h5oh by electrocatalytic reduction using a flower like cuo cathode the experimental results show the destruction of 4 np 60 ml 10 mg l can be as high as 99 in addition the yields of ch3oh and c2h5oh were 98 29 μmol l and 40 95 μmol l respectively which represents a conversion of 41 8 of 4 np into liquid fuels the electron efficiency was 73 1 in addition we found that 3d hexagonal arrays of co3o4 with different morphologies can be obtained by adding different amounts of urea we also investigated the formation mechanism of novel 3d hexagonal co3o4 arrays for the first time a mechanism was proposed to explain the electrocatalytic steps involved in the conversion of 4 np to ch3oh and c2h5oh and the synergetic effects between aops and electrocatalysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes co2 reduction electrooxidation electroreduction organic pollutants sulfate radical 1 introduction with rapid economic development in the past few decades the discharge of wastewater and the emission of greenhouse gases have become the two most serious environmental problems that humans are facing choi et al 2010 centi et al 2013 accordingly extensive studies have focused on the oxidation of organic compounds in wastewaters into co2 and the reduction of co2 into liquid fuels zou et al 2016 dong et al 2017 cao et al 2015 advanced oxidation processes aops are promising technologies to degrade organic compounds in aqueous media because they can generate highly reactive species such as oh and so4 radicals that quickly oxidize a broad range of organic pollutants ghanbari and moradi 2017 there have been many reports about the destruction of organic pollutants by so4 that have been produced by peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxodisulfate pds huang et al 2017a hu et al 2017a pms and pds generate so4 using a high energy input e g heating uv irradiation or ultrasound govindan et al 2014 yang et al 2010 in addition some transition metal ions such as co2 mn2 fe2 and cu2 can generate so4 or and oh by using pds or pms which leads to the efficient degradation of organic pollutants in water zeng et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 deng et al 2017a electrochemical oxidation eo is an excellent technology for degrading organic pollutants in wastewater jiang et al 2017 zhao and zhu 2006 the simplest and most popular eo is anodic oxidation ao where organics can be oxidized directly at the anode surface by electron transfer active anodes and or indirectly oxidized by radicals that are generated at the anode inactive anodes i e oh and so4 moreira et al 2017 some materials such as ruo2 iro2 pbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd chai et al 2017 have been studied and confirmed to be good candidates for organic pollutant degradation by eo it is well known that boron doped diamond bdd electrodes have attracted much interest because of their high electrocatalytic activity for the activation of pms or pds that quickly oxidize a broad range of organic pollutants song et al 2018 matzek et al 2018 farhat et al 2015 however the price of bdd is very high causing the application of bdd to be severely limited in real wastewater treatment therefore it is urgent to develop cheap efficient and stable materials for the activation of pms or pds to generate highly reactive species of oh and so4 radicals furthermore until now there have been no reports on the combination of electrocatalytic oxidation with aops based on so4 from the activation of transition metal oxides for the degradation of organic pollutants in theory if an electrode had good electrocatalytic properties for the degradation of organic pollutants and could simultaneously activate pms or pds to generate so4 it would be highly efficient in degrading organic pollutants cobalt oxides have been used for the activation of pms especially co3o4 this has been extensively reported and cobalt oxides are effective because they have valence states that can provide electrons for the reduction of pms or pds to generate sulfate radicals hu et al 2017b shao et al 2017 in addition cobalt oxides are good electrocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants studies have been conducted using co3o4 as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation and dye destruction yadav and purkait 2015a b 2016 furthermore co3o4 has been extensively investigated in electrochemical oxidation reactions such as oxygen evolution reactions bergmann et al 2015 and water oxidation xue et al 2017 to date co3o4 with different morphologies including nanocubes nanowires nanospheres and nanotubes have been extensively investigated jing et al 2012 however these powdered forms of co3o4 used as electrodes have limited electrocatalytic performance and they are difficult to cycle therefore it is urgent to prepare co3o4 with novel array morphologies on electrodes to improve their overall performance electrochemical co2 reduction to liquid fuels is considered to be one of the most efficient mechanisms for the reduction of co2 which generates various reduced products including hcooh ch3oh c2h5oh ch4 and so on the electrocatalysts for co2 reduction can be divided into three groups metallic nonmetallic and molecular catalysts among all of the metallic catalysts cu based catalysts exhibit good catalytic ability to produce a wide range of co2 reduction products including hcooh hoffman et al 2017 c2h5oh chi et al 2014 and c2h4 reller et al 2017 despite many reports on the electroreduction of co2 and the degradation of organic pollutants by aops or electrocatalysis there are no reports on the coupling of organic pollutant degradation with electrocatalytic co2 reduction in a catalytic system to achieve highly efficient one pot conversion of organic pollutants to liquid fuels i e hcooh ch3oh and c2h5oh based on this discussion we prepared co3o4 arrays as an anode for the electrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and flower like cuo as a cathode for electrocatalytic co2 reduction we first coupled electrocatalytic oxidation with aops based on so4 from the activation of transition metal oxides for the degradation of organic pollutants in order to improve the removal efficiency of organic pollutants in addition we proposed a mechanism to explain the electrocatalytic steps involved in the conversion of 4 np to ch3oh and c2h5oh and the synergetic effects between aops and electrocatalysis as well as electrocatalytic oxidation and electrocatalytic reduction 2 experimental methods 2 1 characterizations and analytical methods analytical grade reagents and chemicals were used without further purification detailed information for the chemicals and characterizations is provided in the supporting information text s1 in addition the detailed preparation processes for the 3d hexagram co3o4 anode and the flower like cuo cathode are available in the supporting information text s1 2 2 degradation of 4 np and electrocatalytic reduction of co2 2 2 1 degradation of 4 np by electrocatalysis and aops detailed information for the degradation of 4 np by aops is discussed in the supporting information text s2 degradation of 4 np by electrocatalysis and aops was performed using a potentiostat chi 630e electrochemical workstation shanghai chenhua china at room temperature 25 c in an h type cell in which a piece of nafion 117 membrane was used as a separator ag agcl was the reference electrode while a pt foil and the as prepared co3o4 area 6 cm2 actual area insert solution 3 75 cm2 were respectively used as the cathode and anode the electrolyte used in the anodic and cathodic compartments was 0 1 m na2so4 60 ml with 10 mg l 4 np and 0 1 m khco3 60 ml respectively an appropriate amount of pms was added to the reactor of anodic compartments before the catalytic reaction the electrocatalytic system was continuously stirred throughout the process the potential was set at 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v vs ag agcl between the anode and reference electrode the solution was sampled from the anodic compartment at prescribed intervals and was filtered by a cellulose acetate membrane 0 45 μm after which methanol was added to quench the radicals the degradation rate of 4 np was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer mapada v 1100d in this situation 4 np was degraded by both electrocatalysis and the aops were performed according to the same process as used for the 4 np degradation by electrocatalysis we also conducted control experiments using the electrocatalytic process in which no pms was added the only difference was the absence of pms during the catalytic reaction 2 2 2 electrocatalytic reduction of co2 cuo area 6 cm2 actual area insert solution 3 75 cm2 was used as cathode for co2 electroreduction we used a three electrode electrochemical h type cell system ag agcl was the reference electrode while pt foil and cuo were respectively used as the anode and cathode the electrolytes used in the anodic and cathodic compartments were 0 1 m na2so4 60 ml and 0 1 m khco3 60 ml respectively prior to electrocatalysis the cathodic electrolyte was purged with co2 for 30 min to become saturated with co2 the potential was set as 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v vs ag agcl between the cathode and reference electrode during electrocatalysis a given amount of solution was collected from the cathodic reaction cell at given time intervals and was filtered by a cellulose acetate membrane 0 45 μm subsequently ch3oh and c2h5oh concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph gc 7890a fid db wax agilent america 2 2 3 catalytic degradation of 4 np coupled with electrocatalytic reduction of co2 the experimental process of the 4 np degradation by electrocatalytic oxidation and aops coupled with simultaneous electrocatalytic reduction of co2 is similar to that of degradation of 4 np by electrocatalysis and aops the differences are that cuo was used as a cathode for co2 electroreduction and that co2 originated from 4 np mineralization was transported from the anode to the cathode by nitrogen gas as a carrier gas the electrolyte used in the anodic and cathodic compartments was 0 1 m na2so4 60 ml with 10 mg l 4 np and 0 1 m khco3 60 ml respectively the potentials were set at 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v vs ag agcl between the cathode and reference electrode the analyses of products from the anode and cathode are the same as those used for degradation by electrocatalytic oxidation and aops and the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrode characterizations the crystalline properties of the as prepared co3o4 and cuo were analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd as shown in figs s1a and s1b in the supporting information si the as prepared co3o4 and cuo have a good crystallinity in addition there were no impurity peaks observed in the as prepared co3o4 and cuo the as prepared co3o4 that was prepared using 0 2 g 0 5 g 1 0 g and 1 5 g urea is hereafter called co0 2 co0 5 co1 0 and co1 5 respectively furthermore compared to the xrd of co0 5 before the electrocatalytic reaction there was nearly no change for co0 5 after 2 h of reaction time indicating that co0 5 shows good stability as a comparison there is an obvious peak of cu in the xrd patterns of cuo after 2 h of catalytic reaction time indicating that cuo was partially reduced to cu during the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 this is consistent with previous studies li and kanan 2012 huang et al 2017b the results of the raman spectra and ft ir spectra further confirm the formation of co3o4 figs s1c and s1d in si details are provided in the supporting information text s3 the morphologies of the as prepared co0 2 co0 5 co1 0 co1 5 and cuo electrodes were examined using sem and tem as shown in fig s2a the co0 2 shows a rose like morphology with a diameter of approximately 6 7 μm whereas the co0 5 exhibits a novel hexagonal morphology with a rough surface consisting of nanoparticles which is different than that of co3o4 reported in the literature fig s2b shen et al 2015 li et al 2011 hong et al 2017 with the increase in urea weight the surface of the hexagonal co3o4 becomes smooth figs s2c and s2d in si the results confirm that the amount of urea plays an important role in the morphology of the co3o4 meanwhile tem images of co0 5 figs s3a b reveal that the hexagon of co3o4 consists of many nanoparticles the lattice spacing of 0 286 nm corresponds to the 2 2 0 facet of co3o4 fig s3c in si edx analysis demonstrates the existence of co and o in the co0 5 catalyst fig s3d in si as shown in fig s4 the as prepared cuo material shows a flower like microstructure composed of numerous nanosheets the tem image shows that the width of a single nanosheet is approximately 110 nm fig s4c the hrtem image shows a lattice spacing of 0 24 nm corresponding to the 1 1 1 facet of cuo fig s4d the edx analysis of the cuo indicates that only cu and o are present in the flower like cuo fig s5 the results of the electrochemical impedance spectra eis show that the co0 5 electrode exhibited relatively lower charge transfer resistance which was beneficial for enhanced electronic interactions fig s6a in si as shown in fig s6b the cuo catalyst exhibited a lower charge transfer resistance which was beneficial during the electroreduction of co2 3 2 catalytic degradation of 4 np fig s7a displays the degradation of 4 np in the systems of only the pms solution and only the as prepared co0 2 co0 5 co1 0 and co1 5 electrodes the removal efficiency of 4 np in the pms system is 1 2 the removal efficiencies of 4 np on the co0 2 co0 5 co1 0 and co1 5 electrodes are 3 55 4 05 3 12 and 2 43 after 60 min respectively the co0 5 has a higher removal efficiency for 4 np because it has a larger surface area of co0 5 127 86 m2 g than that of co0 2 123 28 m2 g co1 0 110 56 m2 g and co1 5 106 39 m2 g as a comparison 92 of 4 np was degraded within 60 min in the pms co0 5 system whereas 87 7 83 7 and 71 of 4 np were removed within 60 min in the pms co0 2 pms co1 0 and pms co1 5 systems respectively fig 1 a the above results suggest that the co3o4 anodes were essential for activating pms and that co0 5 shows much better catalytic performance than co0 2 co1 0 and co1 5 meanwhile the kinetic degradation data of 4 np follows the pseudo first order kinetic fig s8 in si the details are provided in the supporting information text s3 the results indicate that the active sites on the co0 5 surface are more reactive than other co3o4 anodes with different urea weights 3 3 effects of pms loading and different ions on the degradation of 4 np to investigate the effect of the pms concentration on the degradation of 4 np different pms concentrations were used as shown in fig s7b with the increase in pms concentrations 4 np degradation increases with an increase in the concentration of pms but it becomes worse when the concentration is higher than 1 g l the pms concentration is known to be directly related to the number of radicals that are generated i e so4 and oh leading to 4 np degradation thus when the pms concentration is higher than 1 g l scavenging of so4 radicals will occur as expressed by the following equations 1 3 1 hso5 so4 so5 h so4 2 2 oh so4 hso5 3 so4 so4 s2o8 2 according to some studies lin et al 2017 gong et al 2017 so5 is less reactive than so4 hence an increased concentration of pms would result in a decrease in the degradation efficiency of 4 np indicating the existence of an optimum oxidant concentration in the oxidation process to investigate the anionic effects of hco3 cl and so4 2 coupled with pms on 4 np degradation 0 1 m na2so4 0 1 m nacl and 0 1 m nahco3 were used as analytes as shown in fig s7c cl is favorable for the catalytic degradation of 4 np in the presence of pms because cl can be oxidized by so4 and oh to produce cl2 radicals that are inclined to attack electron rich groups leading to the decomposition of 4 np hu et al 2017 however hco3 has an important effect on degradation of 4 np in the co0 5 pms system the reason that so4 could react with oh and h2o in the alkaline environment to convert it to oh is shown in the following equations 4 and 5 4 so4 oh so4 2 oh 5 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h based on previous work the rate constants for eqs 4 and 5 are k oh 6 5 1 0 10 3 l mol s and k h2o 2 10 3 s 1 respectively based on this so4 begins to decompose and to transform into oh rapidly at the solution ph value 8 5 and oh will become the dominator when the ph value is alkaline for the system containing hco3 2 the ph value of the solution is higher than 8 0 where oh plays a major role in the degradation process and the degradation efficiency of 4 np is slower than co0 5 pms in the na2so4 solution yang et al 2010 the effect of different voltages on the degradation of 4 np was further investigated as shown in fig 1a only 18 37 26 57 and 37 36 of 4 np were degraded using the co0 5 electrode at bias voltages of 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v respectively fig 1b indicates nearly 100 of 4 np was degraded by the co0 5 pms system at different bias potentials after 60 min this result was much better than the results for the co0 5 electrode alone at the bias voltages and the results for the co0 5 pms system in addition the 3d hexagonal arrays of co3o4 in the new electrocatalytic system have better performance than those reported in the literature the results show that electrocatalytic oxidation coupled with aops has much more efficiency for 4 np degradation than electrocatalytic oxidation indicating that there is an obvious synergistic effect between electrocatalytic oxidation and aops because the as prepared anode of co3o4 can directly electrocatalytic oxidize 4 np and activate pms to generate oh and so4 radicals that quickly oxidize 4 np control experiments of 4 np degradation by the electrode of fluorine doped tin oxide fto and the fto pms system at different voltages were investigated as shown in fig 1c the degradation efficiency of 4 np increases with the increase in the bias potential 12 9 17 9 and 22 1 of 4 np were removed at various bias potentials of 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 v respectively which could be due to electrostatic adsorption of 4 np on the fto electrode or direct electro oxidation of 4 np by the fto electrode compared to the removal efficiency of 4 np on the fto electrode at different bias voltages the removal efficiency of 4 np was evidently improved on the co0 5 electrode at different bias voltages indicating that electrocatalytic oxidation of 4 np occurred on the co0 5 electrode furthermore the degradation efficiency of 4 np was markedly increased in the presence of pms compared to the fto system at various bias potentials only 46 6 of 4 np was removed in the fto pms system at a bias potential of 0 8 v within 60 min as shown in fig 1b the bdd electrode had a much worse effect on 4 np degradation compared to the as prepared co3o4 electrode moreover as shown in table s1 in the si we also compare the two systems in terms of energy consumption electron efficiency reaction time and stability the results suggest that the co3o4 electrode is more efficient for electrochemical activation of pms than the bdd electrode leading to a much better degradation effect for 4 np and less energy consumption furthermore it should be noted that the price of the bdd is approximately 1000 times that of the co3o4 electrode although the stability of co3o4 is slightly worse than that of the bdd electrode it is meaningful to choose co3o4 to activate pms which is more beneficial to the full utilization of pms therefore the above results confirm that the as prepared co3o4 exhibits much better performance and lower cost than the bdd 3 4 effect of ph in chemical oxidation processes ph plays a key role in the generation of free radicals the impact of 4 np degradation was examined in the co0 5 pms and co0 5 pms systems at 0 8 v at ph values ranging from 3 5 to 7 fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the degradation efficiency decreases considerably as the ph decrease from 6 to 3 5 in the co0 5 pms system and the co0 5 pms at 0 8 v system at low ph ph 6 h scavenges sulfate and hydroxyl radicals according to eqs 6 and 7 respectively resulting in a marked decline in the degradation efficiency of 4 np fang et al 2012 huang et al 2009 6 oh h e h2o 7 so4 h e hso4 when 6 ph 7 the degradation efficiency of 4 np shows a small decrease as ph increases which is due to the formation of a hydroxo complex containing co2 with less reactivity for pms activation than co2 in addition the solution in the anodic compartment is always acidic in the co0 5 pms system at 0 8 v because a large quantity of h formed at the anode during the reaction therefore we did not consider the case of alkaline conditions 3 5 electrochemical reduction of co2 to estimate the electrochemical behavior of the catalyst for co2 reduction lsv curves of the as prepared cuo in n2 saturated and co2 saturated electrolyte with 0 1 m khco3 were tested as shown in fig s9a the as prepared cuo electrode has favorable reduction potential because the current density is high for the co2 reduction reaction co2rr compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction her accordingly there will be a smaller barrier to the initial electron transfer to form an active reduction product of co2 on the cuo electrode as shown in fig 1d the formation yields of ch3oh and c2h5oh reach 125 8 and 22 22 μmol l respectively for 0 1 m khco3 at 0 8 v and 120 min of reaction time from 0 8 v to 1 0 v the yields of ch3oh and c2h5oh decrease with the increase in potential the phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the reaction is co2rr at the potential of 0 8 v rather than her and her becomes the dominant reaction peng et al 2015 in addition the main products of ch3oh and c2h5oh are also demonstrated by an nmr test fig s9b 3 6 catalytic degradation of 4 np coupled with the electrocatalytic reduction of co2 as shown in fig 3 a as the potential changed from 0 8 to 1 0 v the yields of ch3oh and c2h5oh decreased and the maximum yields of methanol and ethanol were 98 29 μmol l and 40 95 μmol l at 0 8 v after 120 min respectively representing a conversion of 41 8 of 4 np into liquid fuels the electron efficiency was 73 1 accordingly as shown in fig s10 the total organic carbon toc decreased rapidly from 7 39 mg l to 0 52 mg l in 120 min confirming that 93 of 4 np can be mineralized to co2 and water the catalytic stability of cuo was also studied using the potentiostatic technique as shown in fig s11a the current density of the cuo electrode becomes stable at different applied potentials during the electrocatalytic reaction uv vis absorption spectra fig s11b in si confirm that 4 np was completely mineralized to co2 over the co0 5 electrode in the process of degradation of 4 np coupled with electrocatalytic co2 reduction furthermore the cobalt leaching concentration of the co0 5 electrode is 0 503 mg l after the 120 min catalytic reaction which is far below the environmental quality standards for surface water of l mg l gb 3838 2002 in china as shown in fig 3b there was only 4 7 removal efficiency of 4 np after four cycles this could be mainly attributed to a slight decrease in the co2 co3 ratio on the co0 5 electrode the results show that the as prepared co3o4 electrode is stable in the process of catalytic degradation of 4 np coupled with electrocatalytic co2 reduction 3 7 formation mechanism of the co3o4 anode with 3d hexagonal arrays for the first time we propose the formation mechanism of the 3d hexagonal co3o4 arrays as shown in fig 4 we propose the formation of the intermediate co oh f by a solvothermal method using urea as an alkaline reagent in the presence of nh4f at 120 c which differs from previous reports jing et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 the formation of the co oh f intermediate was confirmed by xrd patterns as shown in fig s12a it is important to note that the composition of solvent is essential to obtain the co oh f intermediate when the volume ratio of ethylene glycol eg and water is 1 3 co oh f can form on fto substrates whereas co oh f cannot grow directly on fto substrates when the volume ratios of eg and water are 1 1 and 3 1 normally co oh f was formed via the hydrothermal method using hexamethylenetetramine as an alkaline reagent whereas cobalt hydroxide carbonate was obtained using urea as the alkaline reagent under the same reaction condition jing et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the formation of a co oh f intermediate obtained using urea as the alkaline reagent which was combined with a solvent mixture of eg and water in the during the solvothermal reaction process the hydrolysis of urea occurred at approximately 70 c and co2 and nh3 were formed gradually it is worth noting that co2 played a role as pressure increased but it did not form co3 2 in the presence of eg which inhibited the formation of cobalt hydroxide carbonate this is why co oh f arrays can be prepared using urea as the alkaline reagent in the present work after calcination the intermediate of co oh f arrays were transformed into co3o4 the chemical reactions that are involved in preparation process can be expressed with the following formulas 8 co2 f cof 9 co nh2 2 h2o 2nh3 co2 10 nh3 h2o nh4 oh 11 cof oh co oh f 12 6co oh f o2 2co3o4 6hf furthermore the addition of different amounts of urea has a significant influence on the morphology of the product of co3o4 many researchers have reported that the addition of surfactants such as sodium dodecylsulfonate sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide xu et al 2016 has a significant influence on the morphologies of products different from the above methods 3d hexagonal arrays of co3o4 with different morphologies can be obtained by adding different amounts of urea in this study 3 8 synergetic mechanism of 4 np degradation coupled with co2 reduction we identified the major active radicals generated in these systems i fto pms with a 0 8 v bias potential ii co0 5 with a 0 8 v bias potential iii co0 5 pms and iv co0 5 pms with a 0 8 v bias potential various radical scavengers namely tertbutyl alcohol tba and methanol meoh were used tba was used as the radical scavenger for oh but not for so4 radicals because of its much higher reactivity with oh k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 compared to so4 kso4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 luo et al 2017 meoh is typically used to scavenge both oh k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 kso4 1 6 7 8 107 m 1 s 1 due to its high reactivity interestingly for the fto pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential the 4 np removal efficiency decreases from 46 61 to 29 36 and 29 43 fig 5 a after adding 5 mm meoh and 6 mm tba respectively indicating that oh plays role in the degradation of 4 np furthermore the removal efficiencies of 4 np after adding meoh and tba 29 36 and 29 43 respectively are both higher than those of the fto electrode with a 0 8 v bias potential 12 9 the results suggest that both oh and nonradicals are attributed with 4 np degradation in the fto pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential in accordance with previous studies for the co0 5 system with a 0 8 v bias potential the removal efficiency of 4 np decreased from 18 37 to 7 99 when tba was added fig 5b this phenomenon suggests that oh can be formed via electrocatalysis because tba scavenges oh for the system of co0 5 pms the removal efficiency of 4 np decreases from 91 86 to 18 54 and 69 36 fig 5c after adding meoh and tba respectively for the co0 5 pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential the removal efficiency of 4 np decreases from 99 84 to 21 68 and 83 03 with the addition of meoh and tba respectively fig 5d furthermore as depicted in fig 4d the addition of meoh inhibited the oxidation reaction with only 21 68 of 4 np degraded during oxidation since the 4 np degradation efficiency decreases to 83 03 in the presence of tba so4 is considered the dominant radical species in this system at a neutral ph meanwhile we have quantified both scavengers i e meoh and tba contributions toward so4 and oh based on the calculations details were mentioned in text s4 in si meoh 5 mm was able to scavenge 98 of so4 and 99 8 of oh whereas tba 6 mm could only scavenge 48 of so4 in addition it still had a high scavenging impact on oh accounting for 95 6 based on the calculation results tba is mainly responsible for oh scavenging whereas meoh has a scavenging impact on both so4 and oh in other words by increasing so4 in the solution by 50 the 4 np degradation efficiency can increase to 70 which further confirms that so4 rather than oh plays an important role on 4 np degradation in this system finally the results of electron paramagnetic resonance fig s13 in si show that there are no signals tested in the pms solution and the mixed solution of pms and 4 np indicating that no radicals were produced for the co0 5 pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential a set of peaks assigned to dmpo oh and dmpo so4 can be detected but no signals of dmpo o2 are identified revealing that only oh and so4 act as the main reactive species in the system of co0 5 pms with a 0 8 v bias potential the above results reveal that both oh and so4 act as the main reactive species but so4 plays the dominant role in 4 np degradation in the above proposed systems except for the system that does not contain pms the co0 5 pms system with a 0 8 v bias potential was determined to be the most efficient system for 4 np degradation as shown in fig 6 a two peaks with binding energies at 779 4 and 794 5 ev in the as prepared co3o4 are attributed to the co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 of co3 respectively whereas the two peaks at 780 6 and 795 9 ev are ascribed to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 of co2 respectively qiu et al 2014 it is important to note that the co2 co3 ratio is the largest for co0 5 among the four as prepared co3o4 anodes table s3 this reveals that co0 5 possesses more surface adsorbed oxygen and surface oxygen vacancies than the other co3o4 electrodes leading to better catalytic performance than other co3o4 electrodes si et al 2014 fig 6b shows the xps spectra of co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 of co0 5 before and after 120 min catalytic reactions in different systems including i co0 5 with 0 8 v bias potential ii co0 5 pms and iii co0 5 pms with 0 8 v bias potential the relative co2 co3 ratio on the co0 5 surface only decreases slightly from 1 85 to 1 74 in the co0 5 at 0 8 v system this result implies that the process of electrochemical oxidation involves a little transformation of co2 co3 leading to oh formation for the co0 5 pms and co0 5 pms systems with a 0 8 v bias potential the co2 co3 ratio decreases to 1 68 for the co0 5 pms system and decreases to 1 58 for the co0 5 pms with a 0 8 v bias potential the results indicate that the transformation of co2 co3 plays an important role in the aops and that electrochemical oxidation coupled with co0 5 pms can largely accelerate the degradation of 4 np the mechanisms of pms activation including i electrochemical activation and ii chemical activation by co0 5 were evaluated in this study the detailed processes of pms activation by co0 5 are shown in eqs 13 19 deng et al 2017b 13 co2 h2o cooh 14 cooh hso5 coo so4 h2o 15 so4 oh so4 2 oh 16 so4 h2o hso4 oh 17 so4 oh 4 np many steps co2 h2o 18 co3 hso5 co2 so5 h 19 so5 o2 so4 o2 first co2 can serve as lewis base sites and couple with dissociative adsorption of h2o to produce cooh on the co3o4 surface eq 13 for co0 5 many cooh sites were generated on the surface due to its large specific surface area high pore volume high co2 content and high density of active sites on the surface after the addition of pms the formed cooh can easily combine with pms through h bonding subsequently co2 loses electrons and is oxidized to co3 and the o h and o o bonds simultaneously cleave after accepting electrons to generate so4 eq 14 partial so4 can further react with oh or h2o to produce oh eqs 15 and 16 the 4 np in solution can be enriched on the surface of the co0 5 electrode and can be decomposed or even mineralized by the interaction with so4 and oh eq 17 meanwhile the surface lattice oxygen o2 will be oxidized to o2 accompanying the reduction of co3 to co2 eqs 18 and 19 second pms can be activated by electrolysis to generate both oh and nonradicals that are attributed for 4 np degradation according to the results in figs 1c and 5a therefore a synergistic effect between the electrochemical and chemical processes for pms activation can be formed in the system of co0 5 pms at different bias potentials this generates so4 and oh which improves 4 np degradation finally 4 np degradation can also result from direct electro oxidation by the co0 5 electrode according to the results in figs 1a and 5b for the mechanism of electrocatalytic co2 reduction shown in fig s12b h and o2 will be formed at the anode according to the following reaction 20 h2o 2h 1 2o2 the generated h can be transferred from the anode compartment to cathode compartment through nafion 117 to participate in the co2 reduction reaction the generated co2 from the co3o4 anode accepts an electron from the cuo electrode to form a co2 free radical and further reacts with an electron to form the carboxyl cooh intermediate the generated cooh can be reduced to co and then the co reacts with another proton electron pair to form hydroxymethylidyne coh or a formyl cho radical the coh and cho are further reduced to methanol on the other hand co would further participate in the reaction by obtaining electrons and protons from the anode to form ethanol to better understand the mechanism of the co2 electrochemical reduction on the cuo electrode an in situ ft ir spectroelectrochemical technique was used to detect the adsorbed species that formed on the electrode surface fig s14 shows the electrolysis time dependent infrared spectrum recorded at the region between 500 and 4000 cm 1 at 0 8 v vs ag agcl where the signal of the cuo electrode in 0 1 m khco3 solution was used as the background the peak at 2341 cm 1 corresponds to dissolved co2 in aqueous solutions which comes from the mineralization of 4 np the absorption bands at 1345 and 1589 cm 1 are ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of formate ions hcoo and the band at 3300 cm 1 is associated with the o h stretching of alcohol the intensity of these peaks increases with reaction time suggesting the formation of alcohol products the bands at 2916 cm 1 can be assigned to the c h stretching vibration of ch2 whereas the band at 1447 cm 1 was attributed to the deformation vibration of ch3 these results indicate that formic acid intermediate product methanol and ethanol were generated in the cathodic compartment therefore the synergetic mechanism of 4 np degradation coupled with electrocatalytic co2 reduction is proposed in scheme 1 in the anode 4 np was mineralized to co2 by pms aops coupled with electrocatalytic oxidation based on so4 and oh over the co3o4 electrode meanwhile water can also be oxidized by the co3o4 electrode to produce h and o2 then the generated h and co2 are transferred from the anode compartment to the cathode compartment via nafion 117 and the gas pipe respectively finally co2 adsorbs on the cuo electrode and then reacts with h to produce ch3oh and c2h5oh when it obtains electrons from the cuo electrode the overall reaction processes is shown by eqs 21 23 21 co2 2h 2e hcooh 22 co2 6h 6e ch3oh h2o 23 co2 12h 12e c2h5oh h2o the mechanism explains why the system of co0 5 pms with a 0 8 v bias potential has the highest degradation efficiency of 4 np among the various systems that we tested in addition it illustrates the good synergetic effect between aops electrocatalytic oxidation and direct electro oxidation for 4 np degradation on the co3o4 anode in addition the one pot efficient conversion of 4 np into liquid fuels was achieved with the coupling of 4 np degradation with electrocatalytic co2 reduction furthermore the degradation route and the decomposition mechanism of 4 np in the co0 5 pms system at 0 8 v were thoroughly investigated the concentration and composition of the reaction solution at different reaction times were tested by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms possible pathways for 4 np degradation are shown in text s5 in the si in accordance with previous studies of pathways for 4 np degradation in aops li et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 as shown in fig s15 so4 and oh act as active species to attack chemical bonds and then mineralize 4 np to co2 and h2o finally a possible 4 np degradation mineralization roadmap was proposed 3 9 degradation of complex organic pollutants coupled with electrocatalytic reduction of co2 in the co0 5 pms system at 0 8 v the co0 5 pms at 0 8 v system was also used to degrade complex organic pollutants that only consisted of 10 mg l 4 np 10 mg l sulfamethoxazole and 10 mg l tetracycline as shown in fig 7 a sulfamethoxazole 4 np and tetracycline can be degraded well by the co0 5 pms system at 0 8 v according to the uv vis absorption spectra results furthermore the total organic carbon toc results also confirm that 84 of complex organic pollutants can be mineralized to co2 and water over the co0 5 pms at 0 8 v system after 120 min of reaction in fig 7b in addition the yield efficiencies of ch3oh and c2h5oh are 64 94 μmol l and 13 32 μmol l respectively the results indicate that the co3o4 pms system at bias voltage is a potential candidate for complex organic pollutant treatments 4 conclusion in summary we developed a novel electrocatalytic system to create a one pot conversion of organic pollutants to liquid fuels by combining the degradation of 4 np with simultaneous electrocatalytic reduction of co2 using a co3o4 anode and a cuo cathode in this catalytic system the electrocatalytic technology was first coupled with aops based on so4 for the degradation of 4 np over the co3o4 anode with novel morphology of 3d hexagonal arrays experimental results demonstrate that co0 5 has the best catalytic activity for 4 np degradation in addition the formation mechanism of the novel 3d hexagonal co3o4 arrays was investigated for the first time a mechanism was proposed to explain the electrocatalytic steps involved in the conversion of 4 np to ch3oh and c2h5oh as well as the synergetic effects between aops and electrocatalysis overall this work opens a new avenue to efficiently mineralize organic pollutants by coupling electrocatalytic oxidation with aops it also allows us to combine electro oxidation and electroreduction to fulfil one pot conversion of organic pollutants to liquid fuels declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

19118,the frequent occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in aquatic environments is of great concern because of their teratogenicity toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity to plants animals and human beings in this study the bioelectricity generation biodegradation phytoextraction and substrate adsorption of phenanthrene and anthracene in a constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc were investigated with an anode electrode amended with or without biochar nzvi during a 182 day operation period the average removal efficiency for phenanthrene and anthracene ranged from 88 5 to 96 4 the concentration of phenanthrene in roots stems and laminas of t orientalis was 14 9 3 9 and 2 3 ng g 1 respectively while that of anthracene was 22 2 3 1 and 1 3 ng g 1 respectively in addition the application of nzvi was conducive to bioelectricity generation and organic compound degradation in the cw mfc reactor the distribution of the bacterial community indicated that the relative abundance of bacillus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus with a degradation capability for refractory organics was significantly increased especially the genus bacillus for excreting catalase became more abundant the results of our study indicate how to promote bioelectricity generation and biodegradation of refractory organic compounds in a cw mfc by improving the culture conditions for bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bioelectricity generation phytoextraction and phytotransformation nitrogen removal bacterial community distribution 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs occur frequently in aquatic environments such as surface and ground water and even in effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps hamdan et al 2017 although the concentrations of these compounds are at trace level ng l 1 to μg l 1 qi et al 2013 they are considered to pose a serious threat on plants animals and humans goldman et al 2001 pašková et al 2006 hence pahs are of increasing concern because of their teratogenicity toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity haritash and kaushik 2009 yu et al 2017 owing to their persistence and stability the process of volatilization chemical oxidation and photo oxidation usually do not meet the requirements of environmental protection under natural conditions haritash and kaushik 2009 wild and jones 1995 in addition different congeners of the same group pahs can interact with each other consequently reduce their removal efficiency lei et al 2007 therefore developing efficient methods to control pah pollution in aquatic environments is an important issue for environmental protection a constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc which utilizes natural processes to generate bioelectricity and promotes the removal efficiency of contaminants within a controlled environment has been considered to be a low cost easily to maintain and environmentally friendly technology for wastewater treatment wang et al 2016 yadav et al 2012 there are many successful tests using a cw mfc for the biodegradation of azo dye products and swine slurry remains doherty et al 2015a fang et al 2015 although these work have demonstrated that the use of a cw mfc can significantly enhance the removal efficiency of contaminants by oxidation coupled with electron transfer to the anode by an adapted microbial population doherty et al 2015b the effect of these factors on the removal performance of pahs by a cw mfc has never been reported in addition most of the reported work on cws for pah treatment is related to the removal efficiency of these contaminants since cws comprise of water plants substrate and microorganisms it is essential to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involving phytoextraction phytotransformation substrate adsorption and biodegradation in cws during wastewater treatment in a cw mfc the metabolic functions of microorganisms play an important role in contaminant removal and electron transfer it has been shown that the increase of the abundance of electrochemically active bacteria eab like pseudomonas dechloromonas rhodopseudomonas or desulfuromonas may result in an enhancement of bioelectricity generation in a cw mfc corbella et al 2015 wang et al 2016 in addition many studies demonstrated that the bioenergy output from mfcs with mixed microbial cultures is higher than the one with pure cultures nevin et al 2008 rabaey and verstraete 2005 one possible cause may be that synergistic interactions promote the electron flow among the microbial community causing an increased bioelectricity generation corbella et al 2015 in addition it was observed that the use of zero valent iron zvi in a mfc system can increase electricity generation and biodegradation of organic compounds because of its function as electron donor causing a reduction of the of organic compounds cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 these results suggest that an anode amended with nano zvi nzvi might improve the degradation of organic compounds as well as electricity production in this study phenanthrene and anthracene were selected as target pahs the control group and the cw mfc with an anode amended with nzvi were used to investigate their performance in biodegradation phytoextraction and substrate adsorption of phenanthrene and anthracene we hypothesize that i nzvi affects the biodegradation and phytoextraction of phenanthrene and anthracene during wastewater treatment ii an increased bioelectricity generation of a cw mfc anode amended with nzvi will promote the nitrogen removal of the wastewater iii the microbial community will adapt to the nzvi located anode in a cw mfc and change its composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of biochar mt nzvi montmorillonite nzvi mt nzvi was prepared by reducing feso4 7h2o to zero valent iron using sodium borohydride nabh4

0 5 h afterwards nabh4 solution 50 ml was added to the mt nzvi under continuous stirring at a mol ratio of 1 fe2 3 bh4 finally the mixture was stirred for another 0 5 h under the protection of n2 mt nzvi was washed with deionized water for several times and dried at 40 c for 24 h in a lyophilizer meanwhile biochar was added into 50 ml anoxic deionized water and heated in a water bath 50 c then it was placed for 1 h to discharge the bubble finally the mt nzvi and an anoxic cacl2 solution 4 were added to the above solution and stirred for about 1 h the next step in the preparation of biochar mt

biofilm samples of the anodes were collected at the end of the experiment all samples were placed in a conical bottle and then centrifuged at 200 rpm for about 12 min after that the omega soil dna kit

2016 the pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing analysis was done by personal biotechnology co ltd with an illumina miseq platform shanghai china to ensure high quality sequence reads the data were denoised and eliminated if homopolymers exceeded 150 base pairs bp or were shorter than 8 bp containing ambiguous bases and chimera sequences all similar high quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a similarity threshold value of 97 2 6 statistical analysis the characteristics of bioelectricity generation power density current density and coulombic efficiency of each cw mfc reactor was evaluated according to previous studies logan 2008 the analysis of variance anova with the lsd test spss 22 0 was used to evaluate the difference of water

show the effluent temperature cod removal performance and voltage output of the cw mfc reactors with fn fn nzvi cff or cff nzvi as anodes in general the temperature of the effluent ranged from 29 4 summer to 9 5 winter c the cod concentration of the effluents collected from the four reactors was 77 9 16 4 68 4 12 7 59 6 10 6 and 50 7 8 8 mg l 1 respectively the corresponding removal efficiency values were 63 3 7 2 67 8 5 7 71 9 4 7 and 76 1 3 9 an apparent difference in cod removal efficiency was obtained among the four reactors p 0 05 the average voltage output of fn fn nzvi cff and cff nzvi reactor during the 182 day operation period was 313 28 330 36 376 34 and 425 37 mv respectively the increase in bioelectricity generation could be concluded into i the addition of nzvi in the cw mfc enhanced the average voltage output by 6 0 up to 13 0 p 0 05 ii the bioenergy production in the cw mfcs with cff as anode was nearly 20 0 higher than that of the cw mfc with fn as anode material p 0 05 iii the average voltage of the cw mfc was temperature dependent in summer june sep average temperature 26 3 1 7 c 12 3 16 9 higher than in winter oct dec average temperature 18 5 4 5 c p 0 05 these results indicate that the temperature and the modification of the anode material are critical factors for the performance with regard to pollutant removal and bioelectricity generation the decline of the temperature from summer to winter had a direct effect on the production of bioenergy and on the contaminant removal which is in agreement with our previous studies wang et al 2017b the enzyme activity of microbial population in the summer season was higher than in the winter season because average temperature decreased from 26 3 to 18 5 c in addition the use of nzvi had an influence on environmental conditions such as ph and orp which regulate the metabolic activity of the eab and of the anaerobic digestion cai et al 2018 it has been reported that nzvi is conducive to the activity of enzymes producing acetic acid the introduction of nzvi into the reactor resulted in enhancement of an easy to use metabolic substrate production around the anode liu et al 2012 yang et al 2017 due to the enhancement of acetic acid production and enzyme activity the bioelectricity generation in cw mfcs with nzvi amended anodes showed a significant increase a similar study with a mfc also demonstrated that the application of nzvi anode promotes pollutant removal and enhances bioenergy production cai et al 2018 although the bacterial community on the anode fn and cff was a slightly different in composition after 182 day operation section 3 4 the effect of nzvi on the improvement of environmental conditions ph and orp enzymes activity and electron transfer was similar harada et al 2016 the power density current density and polarization curves obtained for the four reactors in the summer or winter seasons are presented in fig 3 in summer the maximum power and current densities of the four cw mfc reactors follow the order fn fn nzvi cff cff nzvi the highest power density of 26 0 mw m 2 was measured for the cw mfc with cff nzvi as anode the peak current densities of the four reactors were 76 4 81 5 84 1 and 94 3 ma m 2 respectively however during the winter season the maximum power and current densities decreased concomitant with the reduced temperature similar to previous studies villasenor et al 2013 wang et al 2017b the peak power density of the four reactors were 10 2 10 9 16 2 and 20 6 mw m 2 respectively the current density of the four systems had the following order fn fn nzvi cff cff nzvi the highest power density of a cw mfc was in the summer season in general between 21 6 and 29 8 higher than in the winter season the nzvi embedded in the anode material significantly promoted the power density of the cw mfc system in addition the coulombic efficiencies were 0 3 0 3 0 4 and 0 4 for the four reactors respectively comparing the power density current density and coulombic efficiency of the classic mfcs these parameters of cw mfc presented in a relatively lower level because of the lower efficiency of mass transfer under fed batch mode cheng et al 2006 and electron acceptors nitrate contained in the influent wang et al 2017b it has been reported that nitrate and ammonia could produce nitrous oxide under the chemical denitrification effect of fe2 fanning 2000 therefore nitrate contained in influent inhibited a higher bioelectricity generation of the cw mfc reactor in addition the volume ratio of electrode biofilm to the anode in the cw mfc was significantly lower than the one in a classic mfcs liu et al 2014 oon et al 2017 another cause may be the competition between eab and other microorganisms for oxidizable organic matter in a cw mfc system logan et al 2006 during the metabolism of organic matter the syntrophic interactions between eab dechloromonas and hydrogenotrophic methanogens are well known lu et al 2015 however our previous study had indicated that the acetpclasic and the hydrogenotrophic methanogens played an critical role in the formation of anaerobic sludge under low and high organic loading rates yang et al 2017 therefore the reduced concentration of organic matter in the influent may have caused that syntrophic interactions between eab and hydrogenotrophic methanogens became inefficient and consequently the voltage output and coulombic efficiency in the cw mfc decreased 3 2 degradation pathway for phenanthrene and anthracene the biodegradation phytoextraction and substrate adsorption of phenanthrene and anthracene in a cw mfc are displayed in fig 4 with a concentration of 0 17 mg l 1 in the influent the removal efficiency for phenanthrene in the four reactors was 88 4 2 9 93 6 1 6 93 6 1 6 and 95 3 0 9 respectively the removal rates for anthracene were 92 5 1 2 95 2 1 0 95 8 1 5 and 96 5 1 5 respectively after 182 day operation the concentrations of phenanthrene in roots stems and laminas of t orientalis were 14 9 3 9 and 2 3 ng g 1 respectively and that of anthracene were 22 2 3 1 and 1 3 ng g 1 respectively in the substrate of the cw mfc the concentration for phenanthrene and anthracene were 8 7 and 8 0 ng in 100 0 g quartz sand in our previous study we assessed the distribution and metabolic function of the bacterial community around roots of t orientalis wang et al 2017a here we focus on the effect of nzvi on the biodegradation and phytoextraction of phenanthrene and anthracene at the anode in cw mfcs in the fn nzvi and the cff nzvi reactor the relative abundance of bacillus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus increased significantly during operation section 3 4 among these microorganisms bacillus belonging to the phylum firmicutes produce the enzyme catalase under aerobic conditions baron 1996 this enzyme also is considered to be involved in the biodegradation of aromatic compounds baran et al 2004 kocabas et al 2008 the co enriched paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus are known to have a high capacity to remove refractory organic compounds under anaerobic conditions baxter plant et al 2004 rijnen et al 1999 yun et al 2017 it has been reported that bacteria of the genus desulfovibrio can be used to remove aromatic compounds from wastewater since they use h2 as electron donor rijnen et al 1999 bacillus and desulfovibrio may contribute to the oxidation and reduction of nzvi volbeda et al 1995 bacteria of the genus pseudomonas possess the capability to degrade phenanthrene and anthracene although the relative abundance of the latter in cw mfcs with cff nzvi as anode material increased by 6 0 compared with a cff reactor no abundance variation was observed in the fn and fn nzvi reactors one possible reason may be a different effect of nzvi in fn and cff system on the adaption of the microflora clear is however that the use of nzvi to amend the anode is conducive to the biodegradation of phenanthrene and anthracene plants in wetland play a positive role in the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from wastewater li et al 2016 the potential of phenanthrene and anthracene to be taken up by the roots and their phytotransformation by t orientalis were assessed by the contaminant concentrations in the roots stems and laminas apparently the plants root possessed the main uptake capacity for phenanthrene and anthracene similar results has been obtained previously for ibuprofen remove li et al 2016 however compared with the biodegradation ability of microorganisms these compounds removed by plants became an inefficient process which may be caused by the main process of organic compounds removal by t orientalis was carried out in an indirect effect such as promoting the abundance of plant growth promoting bacteria gregoire et al 2009 lv et al 2016 although an uptake of refractory organic matter by the plant roots was limited some phytotransformation was observed in the stems and laminas of t orientalis pilon smits 2005 for the latter activities endophytic microorganisms are probably responsible li et al 2016 however the fast biodegradation by microorganisms and defense mechanisms of plants against microbial pathogens protected t orientalis robert and friml 2009 a significant low adsorption capacity for the contaminant was obtained for quartz sand in a cw mfc it clearly indicates that the biodegradation ability of microorganisms was possible for the quick removal of phenanthrene and anthracene in addition an important metabolic intermediate 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis 2 methylpropyl ester fig s2 of the degradation process was detected in the root and stem samples of t orientalis such finding indicates most probably that t orientalis is able to do phytoextraction and phytotransformation of organic matter in wastewater treatment however the metabolism of these compounds in the tissues of the plant requires further research 3 3 nitrogen removal data for nh3 n and nitrate concentrations in influents and effluents are given in fig 5 in general a stable removal performance for nh3 n and nitrate was obtained in the cw mfcs the average concentrations of nh3 n in the effluents of the four reactors were 7 5 1 9 6 1 1 8 7 2 2 0 and 5 1 1 3 mg l 1 respectively obviously the nh3 n removal efficiency for the cw mfc with an anode amended with nzvi was significantly higher than that for the corresponding cw mfc system p 0 05 notably with the decrease of the temperature in the winter season the nh3 n concentration of the effluents in the four cw mfc reactors ranged from 3 0 to 4 4 mg l 1 results of the linear regression analysis indicate that the nh3 n removal efficiency increased if the do concentration of effluents ranged from 0 3 to 1 2 mg l 1 i y 45 02x 21 98 r2 0 93 fn ii y 44 68x 31 51 r2 0 90 fn nzvi iii y 39 78x 26 60 r2 0 88 cff and iv y 19 42x 53 61 r2 0 95 cff nzvi where x and y mean the do concentration of effluent samples and nh3 n removal efficiency respectively as shown in fig 5 b the nitrate concentration in the effluent samples of the four reactors were 3 2 1 2 2 9 1 2 5 9 2 0 and 4 4 1 6 mg l 1 respectively obviously like in a previous study the nitrate removal in the cw mfc with fn as anode and cathode material was significantly higher than that of the cw mfc with cff as electrode p 0 05 wang et al 2017b the data for nh3 n and nitrate concentrations in the effluent samples of the four cw mfc reactors indicate that nzvi increased the nitrogen removal it has been generally accepted that nitrification and denitrification are the main pathways for the removal of nh3 n in wastewater treatment vymazal 2007 wallace et al 2016 in this study the removal efficiency for nh3 n had a relatively low level this may have resulted from the low concentration of do in the wastewater limiting the nitrification although bacterial activities decreased with the reduced temperatures in winter the removal of nh3 n in the winter season was slightly higher than in the summer season one possible reason may be that the do concentration of the wastewater in the winter season was about 0 7 mg l 1 higher than in the summer season in addition the removal of nitrate in cw mfc remained in the range of 85 0 92 5 this suggests that the cw mfc reactor possesses an advantage for nitrate removal from wastewater by simultaneous biological and chemical denitrification clauwaert et al 2007 vymazal 2007 compared with the bacterial communities in cw systems the relative abundance of eab was shown to be predominantly at the anode lu et al 2015 wang et al 2017a eab are known to be able to desulphurize and to denitrify also the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria such as desulfovibrio and dechloromonas in a cw mfc with an anode amended with nzvi higher than in the corresponding cw mfc section 3 4 this may be the reasons why the removal efficiency of nitrate in the fn nzvi and cff nzvi reactors was slightly higher than in the fn and cff systems 3 4 bacterial diversity and community distribution to gain insight in the bacterial distribution responsible for the removal of nitrogen phenanthrene and anthracene in the anode sphere of the cw mfcs high throughput sequencing analysis was used as shown in table s2 from the four samples were 17111 21703 high quality sequences collected at the end of the experiment the number of otus ranged from 1675 to 2858 ace and chao indexes were used to evaluate the richness of the bacterial community ebrahimi et al 2010 the use of nzvi is enhancing the microbial richness of the cw mfc with fn as anode material while the richness of the bacterial community in the cw mfc with a cff anode amended with nzvi was lower than that of the cw mfc with cff shannon and simpson estimators contain information about the richness and evenness of bacterial communities lu et al 2015 the bacterial diversity evaluated by the shannon estimator indicated a similar trend like the ace and chao indexes obviously the response of the bacterial communities to nzvi on fn or cff anode material is significantly different at the phylum level fig 6 a the main groups are proteobacteria average 39 7 firmicutes average 15 2 bacteroidetes average 14 9 actinobacteria average 9 9 and spirochaetes average 6 5 specifically the relative abundance of the phylum proteobacteria was in the cw mfc with an anode without nzvi about 7 5 higher than in an cw mfc with fn nzvi or cff nzvi however the relative abundance of the phylum firmicutes in the cw mfc with fn or cff as anode material was 4 0 20 0 lower than in the cw mfc with nzvi in addition the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and actinobacteria in the fn nzvi reactor was 5 3 and 22 6 higher than in fn system respectively the relative abundance of spirochaetes in the four reactors were 10 9 5 9 5 0 and 4 0 respectively the bacterial community distribution at class level indicates the occurrence average relative abundance 1 of betaproteobacteria bacteroidia bacilli gammaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria spirochaetes clostridia erysipelotrichi flavobacteriia holophagae planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria and thermoleophilia as shown in fig 6 b for the fn and cff reactors the relative abundance of bacteroidia bacilli actinobacteria and deltaproteobacteria anodes amended with nzvi an increase of abundance is noted however the relative abundance of some classes like betaproteobacteria spirochaetes and flavobacteriia became apparently reduced if anodes amended with nzvi were used the bacterial community distribution at genus level is presented in fig 7 a high abundance average relative abundance 1 0 of bacillus treponema propionicimonas paludibacter zoogloea pseudomonas desulfovibrio geobacter dechloromonas geothrix lactococcus uliginosibacterium and cloacibacterium was found according to the distance matrix analysis the bacteria at the anode in the fn and fn nzvi reactors show a quite high similarity however the relative abundance of the genus bacillus clostridium paenibacillus and ptopionivibtio in the sample for cff nzvi was higher than for the cff reactor in addition the cw mfc of the anode with nzvi showed a higher relative abundance of the genus bacillus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus as compared with the corresponding cw mfc system it has been demonstrated that the biodiversity of the bacterial community around a cff anode in a cw mfc is higher than in a fn reactor wang et al 2017b in addition it is interesting that the application of nzvi to the anode causes a reduction of biodiversity in the cff reactor and an enhancement in the fn system this result is caused by the increased abundance of firmicutes in fn reactor wang et al 2017b finally the richness of biodiversity in the cff nzvi system is lower than in the cff reactor it has been reported that the eab community is mainly consisting of the phyla proteobacteria and firmicutes lu et al 2015 in this study the relative abundance of the proteobacteria and firmicutes respectively in fn nzvi or cff nzvi is higher than in the corresponding cw mfc system the genus bacillus is known to be electrogenic and able to degrade aromatic compounds and to excrete enzyme catalase baran et al 2004 kocabas et al 2008 for the biodegradation of phenanthrene and anthracene fe3 may be used as the catalyst to strengthen the activities of enzyme catalase spuhler et al 2010 in addition the enzyme dioxygenase contains an iron sulfur centers fe2s3 ochiai 1997 is also considered as an important enzyme to breakdown complex organic compounds therefore the use of nzvi may have a positive effect on the metabolic activity and relative abundance of bacillus species a similar trend has also described for the genus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus according to the distance matrix analysis the bacterial distribution in the four reactors was slightly different this may have been an effect of the fn which could have delivered trace elements conducive for the growth of some bacteria this have a positive effect for adaptation of eab and promote bioelectricity generation and biodegradation pathway of contaminant 4 conclusion in the present study we investigated the degradation pathway of phenanthrene and anthracene as model compounds for recalcitrant pollutants by cw mfc is with anodes amended with or anodes without nzvi the removal efficiency for phenanthrene and anthracene ranged from 88 5 to 96 4 the results indicate that eab microorganisms play an important role in the removal of these compounds measurements of phenanthrene and anthracene concentrations in the roots stems and laminas of t orientalis reveal that also phytoextraction and phytotransformation participate in the removal furthermore bioelectricity generation and nitrogen removal were also promoted in cw mfcs by the application of nzvi the analysis of the bacterial community distribution indicates an enhancement of the abundance of bacillus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus species who have a high degradation capability for recalcitrant pollutants acknowledgements this research is finished under the support of the national nature science

19118,the frequent occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in aquatic environments is of great concern because of their teratogenicity toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity to plants animals and human beings in this study the bioelectricity generation biodegradation phytoextraction and substrate adsorption of phenanthrene and anthracene in a constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc were investigated with an anode electrode amended with or without biochar nzvi during a 182 day operation period the average removal efficiency for phenanthrene and anthracene ranged from 88 5 to 96 4 the concentration of phenanthrene in roots stems and laminas of t orientalis was 14 9 3 9 and 2 3 ng g 1 respectively while that of anthracene was 22 2 3 1 and 1 3 ng g 1 respectively in addition the application of nzvi was conducive to bioelectricity generation and organic compound degradation in the cw mfc reactor the distribution of the bacterial community indicated that the relative abundance of bacillus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus with a degradation capability for refractory organics was significantly increased especially the genus bacillus for excreting catalase became more abundant the results of our study indicate how to promote bioelectricity generation and biodegradation of refractory organic compounds in a cw mfc by improving the culture conditions for bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bioelectricity generation phytoextraction and phytotransformation nitrogen removal bacterial community distribution 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs occur frequently in aquatic environments such as surface and ground water and even in effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps hamdan et al 2017 although the concentrations of these compounds are at trace level ng l 1 to μg l 1 qi et al 2013 they are considered to pose a serious threat on plants animals and humans goldman et al 2001 pašková et al 2006 hence pahs are of increasing concern because of their teratogenicity toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity haritash and kaushik 2009 yu et al 2017 owing to their persistence and stability the process of volatilization chemical oxidation and photo oxidation usually do not meet the requirements of environmental protection under natural conditions haritash and kaushik 2009 wild and jones 1995 in addition different congeners of the same group pahs can interact with each other consequently reduce their removal efficiency lei et al 2007 therefore developing efficient methods to control pah pollution in aquatic environments is an important issue for environmental protection a constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc which utilizes natural processes to generate bioelectricity and promotes the removal efficiency of contaminants within a controlled environment has been considered to be a low cost easily to maintain and environmentally friendly technology for wastewater treatment wang et al 2016 yadav et al 2012 there are many successful tests using a cw mfc for the biodegradation of azo dye products and swine slurry remains doherty et al 2015a fang et al 2015 although these work have demonstrated that the use of a cw mfc can significantly enhance the removal efficiency of contaminants by oxidation coupled with electron transfer to the anode by an adapted microbial population doherty et al 2015b the effect of these factors on the removal performance of pahs by a cw mfc has never been reported in addition most of the reported work on cws for pah treatment is related to the removal efficiency of these contaminants since cws comprise of water plants substrate and microorganisms it is essential to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involving phytoextraction phytotransformation substrate adsorption and biodegradation in cws during wastewater treatment in a cw mfc the metabolic functions of microorganisms play an important role in contaminant removal and electron transfer it has been shown that the increase of the abundance of electrochemically active bacteria eab like pseudomonas dechloromonas rhodopseudomonas or desulfuromonas may result in an enhancement of bioelectricity generation in a cw mfc corbella et al 2015 wang et al 2016 in addition many studies demonstrated that the bioenergy output from mfcs with mixed microbial cultures is higher than the one with pure cultures nevin et al 2008 rabaey and verstraete 2005 one possible cause may be that synergistic interactions promote the electron flow among the microbial community causing an increased bioelectricity generation corbella et al 2015 in addition it was observed that the use of zero valent iron zvi in a mfc system can increase electricity generation and biodegradation of organic compounds because of its function as electron donor causing a reduction of the of organic compounds cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 these results suggest that an anode amended with nano zvi nzvi might improve the degradation of organic compounds as well as electricity production in this study phenanthrene and anthracene were selected as target pahs the control group and the cw mfc with an anode amended with nzvi were used to investigate their performance in biodegradation phytoextraction and substrate adsorption of phenanthrene and anthracene we hypothesize that i nzvi affects the biodegradation and phytoextraction of phenanthrene and anthracene during wastewater treatment ii an increased bioelectricity generation of a cw mfc anode amended with nzvi will promote the nitrogen removal of the wastewater iii the microbial community will adapt to the nzvi located anode in a cw mfc and change its composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of biochar mt nzvi montmorillonite nzvi mt nzvi was prepared by reducing feso4 7h2o to zero valent iron using sodium borohydride nabh4 reduction huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 firstly 24 88 g of feso4 7h2o were dissolved in an ethanolic solution 200 ml at a volume ratio of 1 water 4 ethanol then 20 g mt were added and stirred for 0 5 h afterwards nabh4 solution 50 ml was added to the mt nzvi under continuous stirring at a mol ratio of 1 fe2 3 bh4 finally the mixture was stirred for another 0 5 h under the protection of n2 mt nzvi was washed with deionized water for several times and dried at 40 c for 24 h in a lyophilizer meanwhile biochar was added into 50 ml anoxic deionized water and heated in a water bath 50 c then it was placed for 1 h to discharge the bubble finally the mt nzvi and an anoxic cacl2 solution 4 were added to the above solution and stirred for about 1 h the next step in the preparation of biochar mt nzvi was repeated according to the above mentioned processes the final products were used as the amendment material to embed in the space between of anode electrode the surface area sem and xrd parameters are presented in table s1 and fig s1 2 2 reactor construction inoculation and operation the schematic diagram of a cw mfc reactor height 52 cm internal diameter 16 cm material polyvinyl

porosity of 29 2 after macro nutrients and hoagland s trace elements had been added for one month typha orientalis t orientalis was respectively planted into the cw mfcs with an initial density of 6 plants per unit the cw mfc were inoculated with a volume of 2 0 l active sludge collected from a wastewater treatment plant in shanghai songjiang area which has been diluted with tap water synthetic municipal wastewater was used to adapt the microorganisms and wetland plants for about one month during inoculation and operational periods synthetic wastewater was fed into the cw mfcs at the top and collected from a perforated collection pipe placed 7 cm above the bottom of reactor all cw mfcs were operated in a fed batch mode with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 d 2 3 preparation of synthetic wastewater the composition of synthetic wastewater is as follows c6h12o6 h2o kh2po4 na2hpo4 12h2o nh4cl nano3 ch3coona mgcl2 6h2o zncl2 cacl2 cuso4 5h2o fecl3 and h3bo3 during the operational period 1 ml phenanthrene 5 g l 1 and anthracene 5 g l 1 acetone solution was added to 30 l synthetic wastewater the chemical oxygen demand cod nh3 n nitrate phenanthrene and anthracene concentrations in the influent were 211 9 15 0 38 9 0 17 and 0 17 mg l 1 respectively the average conductivity and ph of influent water were 670 1 50 0 μs cm 1 and 7 50 0 12 respectively 2 4 sampling and analytical methods influent and effluent samples were collected at the feeding time 9 00 a m in each hrt s cycle dissolved oxygen do concentration ph and temperature were determined using a multi parameter water quality monitor hq40d hach the conductivity of influent and effluent was measured using a digital portable meter ap 2 hm south korea the concentration of nh3 n and cod was measured with the hi 93733 ammonia ism hanna italy and dr 900 hach usa with the corresponding reagents according to their special cautious the nitrate concentration was determined with an uv vis spectrophotometer the fluctuating voltage across the external electrical resistor of each reactor was recorded using a digital multimeter hangzhou bright technology co ltd china each 2 min at the middle and at the end of the operational periods the polarization curve of each system was determined by the variation of the external electrical resistor from 50 to 80000 ω phenanthrene and anthracene concentrations of influent and effluent samples were determined according to the standard method gb t 26411 2010 china for the determination of 16 pahs in seawater by gc ms shimadzu japan during the operational period 100 ml effluent samples were collected in each hrt cycle each ten samples were pooled and the resulting mixed solution to analyze the concentrations of phenanthrene and anthracene in addition to analyze the function of phytoextraction and substrate adsorption phenanthrene and anthracene concentrations of root stem and lamina dry weight of each part 1 g of the wetland plants and in quartz sand 50 g of each reactor were analyzed at the end of experiment extraction by ultrasound at 25 c 100 w power extractant n hexane 2 5 high throughput sequencing analysis the biofilm samples of the anodes were collected at the end of the experiment all samples were placed in a conical bottle and then centrifuged at 200 rpm for about 12 min after that the omega soil dna kit was used to extract dna the hypervariable regions of v4 v5 were amplified with the universal primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 3 according to previous report wang et al 2016 the pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing analysis was done by personal biotechnology co ltd with an illumina miseq platform shanghai china to ensure high quality sequence reads the data were denoised and eliminated if homopolymers exceeded 150 base pairs bp or were shorter than 8 bp containing ambiguous bases and chimera sequences all similar high quality reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a similarity threshold value of 97 2 6 statistical analysis the characteristics of bioelectricity generation power density current density and coulombic efficiency of each cw mfc reactor was evaluated according to previous studies logan 2008 the analysis of variance anova with the lsd test spss 22 0 was used to evaluate the difference of water parameters in effluents collected from the cw mfc reactors with p 0 05 as the significance level a heat map of the microbial community at the genus level was generated using the r software version 3 3 2 to visualize the differences and the similarities in the community composition based on the distance matrix 3 results and discussion 3 1 pollutant removal and bioelectricity generation data in fig 2 show the effluent temperature cod removal performance and voltage output of the cw mfc reactors with fn fn nzvi cff or cff nzvi as anodes in general the temperature of the effluent ranged from 29 4 summer to 9 5 winter c the cod concentration of the effluents collected from the four reactors was 77 9 16 4 68 4 12 7 59 6 10 6 and 50 7 8 8 mg l 1 respectively the corresponding removal efficiency values were 63 3 7 2 67 8 5 7 71 9 4 7 and 76 1 3 9 an apparent difference in cod removal efficiency was obtained among the four reactors p 0 05 the average voltage output of fn fn nzvi cff and cff nzvi reactor during the 182 day operation period was 313 28 330 36 376 34 and 425 37 mv respectively the increase in bioelectricity generation could be concluded into i the addition of nzvi in the cw mfc enhanced the average voltage output by 6 0 up to 13 0 p 0 05 ii the bioenergy production in the cw mfcs with cff as anode was nearly 20 0 higher than that of the cw mfc with fn as anode material p 0 05 iii the average voltage of the cw mfc was temperature dependent in summer june sep average temperature 26 3 1 7 c 12 3 16 9 higher than in winter oct dec average temperature 18 5 4 5 c p 0 05 these results indicate that the temperature and the modification of the anode material are critical factors for the performance with regard to pollutant removal and bioelectricity generation the decline of the temperature from summer to winter had a direct effect on the production of bioenergy and on the contaminant removal which is in agreement with our previous studies wang et al 2017b the enzyme activity of microbial population in the summer season was higher than in the winter season because average temperature decreased from 26 3 to 18 5 c in addition the use of nzvi had an influence on environmental conditions such as ph and orp which regulate the metabolic activity of the eab and of the anaerobic digestion cai et al 2018 it has been reported that nzvi is conducive to the activity of enzymes producing acetic acid the introduction of nzvi into the reactor resulted in enhancement of an easy to use metabolic substrate production around the anode liu et al 2012 yang et al 2017 due to the enhancement of acetic acid production and enzyme activity the bioelectricity generation in cw mfcs with nzvi amended anodes showed a significant increase a similar study with a mfc also demonstrated that the application of nzvi anode promotes pollutant removal and enhances bioenergy production cai et al 2018 although the bacterial community on the anode fn and cff was a slightly different in composition after 182 day operation section 3 4 the effect of nzvi on the improvement of environmental conditions ph and orp enzymes activity and electron transfer was similar harada et al 2016 the power density current density and polarization curves obtained for the four reactors in the summer or winter seasons are presented in fig 3 in summer the maximum power and current densities of the four cw mfc reactors follow the order fn fn nzvi cff cff nzvi the highest power density of 26 0 mw m 2 was measured for the cw mfc with cff nzvi as anode the peak current densities of the four reactors were 76 4 81 5 84 1 and 94 3 ma m 2 respectively however during the winter season the maximum power and current densities decreased concomitant with the reduced temperature similar to previous studies villasenor et al 2013 wang et al 2017b the peak power density of the four reactors were 10 2 10 9 16 2 and 20 6 mw m 2 respectively the current density of the four systems had the following order fn fn nzvi cff cff nzvi the highest power density of a cw mfc was in the summer season in general between 21 6 and 29 8 higher than in the winter season the nzvi embedded in the anode material significantly promoted the power density of the cw mfc system in addition the coulombic efficiencies were 0 3 0 3 0 4 and 0 4 for the four reactors respectively comparing the power density current density and coulombic efficiency of the classic mfcs these parameters of cw mfc presented in a relatively lower level because of the lower efficiency of mass transfer under fed batch mode cheng et al 2006 and electron acceptors nitrate contained in the influent wang et al 2017b it has been reported that nitrate and ammonia could produce nitrous oxide under the chemical denitrification effect of fe2 fanning 2000 therefore nitrate contained in influent inhibited a higher bioelectricity generation of the cw mfc reactor in addition the volume ratio of electrode biofilm to the anode in the cw mfc was significantly lower than the one in a classic mfcs liu et al 2014 oon et al 2017 another cause may be the competition between eab and other microorganisms for oxidizable organic matter in a cw mfc system logan et al 2006 during the metabolism of organic matter the syntrophic interactions between eab dechloromonas and hydrogenotrophic methanogens are well known lu et al 2015 however our previous study had indicated that the acetpclasic and the hydrogenotrophic methanogens played an critical role in the formation of anaerobic sludge under low and high organic loading rates yang et al 2017 therefore the reduced concentration of organic matter in the influent may have caused that syntrophic interactions between eab and hydrogenotrophic methanogens became inefficient and consequently the voltage output and coulombic efficiency in the cw mfc decreased 3 2 degradation pathway for phenanthrene and anthracene the biodegradation phytoextraction and substrate adsorption of phenanthrene and anthracene in a cw mfc are displayed in fig 4 with a concentration of 0 17 mg l 1 in the influent the removal efficiency for phenanthrene in the four reactors was 88 4 2 9 93 6 1 6 93 6 1 6 and 95 3 0 9 respectively the removal rates for anthracene were 92 5 1 2 95 2 1 0 95 8 1 5 and 96 5 1 5 respectively after 182 day operation the concentrations of phenanthrene in roots stems and laminas of t orientalis were 14 9 3 9 and 2 3 ng g 1 respectively and that of anthracene were 22 2 3 1 and 1 3 ng g 1 respectively in the substrate of the cw mfc the concentration for phenanthrene and anthracene were 8 7 and 8 0 ng in 100 0 g quartz sand in our previous study we assessed the distribution and metabolic function of the bacterial community around roots of t orientalis wang et al 2017a here we focus on the effect of nzvi on the biodegradation and phytoextraction of phenanthrene and anthracene at the anode in cw mfcs in the fn nzvi and the cff nzvi reactor the relative abundance of bacillus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus increased significantly during operation section 3 4 among these microorganisms bacillus belonging to the phylum firmicutes produce the enzyme catalase under aerobic conditions baron 1996 this enzyme also is considered to be involved in the biodegradation of aromatic compounds baran et al 2004 kocabas et al 2008 the co enriched paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus are known to have a high capacity to remove refractory organic compounds under anaerobic conditions baxter plant et al 2004 rijnen et al 1999 yun et al 2017 it has been reported that bacteria of the genus desulfovibrio can be used to remove aromatic compounds from wastewater since they use h2 as electron donor rijnen et al 1999 bacillus and desulfovibrio may contribute to the oxidation and reduction of nzvi volbeda et al 1995 bacteria of the genus pseudomonas possess the capability to degrade phenanthrene and anthracene although the relative abundance of the latter in cw mfcs with cff nzvi as anode material increased by 6 0 compared with a cff reactor no abundance variation was observed in the fn and fn nzvi reactors one possible reason may be a different effect of nzvi in fn and cff system on the adaption of the microflora clear is however that the use of nzvi to amend the anode is conducive to the biodegradation of phenanthrene and anthracene plants in wetland play a positive role in the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from wastewater li et al 2016 the potential of phenanthrene and anthracene to be taken up by the roots and their phytotransformation by t orientalis were assessed by the contaminant concentrations in the roots stems and laminas apparently the plants root possessed the main uptake capacity for phenanthrene and anthracene similar results has been obtained previously for ibuprofen remove li et al 2016 however compared with the biodegradation ability of microorganisms these compounds removed by plants became an inefficient process which may be caused by the main process of organic compounds removal by t orientalis was carried out in an indirect effect such as promoting the abundance of plant growth promoting bacteria gregoire et al 2009 lv et al 2016 although an uptake of refractory organic matter by the plant roots was limited some phytotransformation was observed in the stems and laminas of t orientalis pilon smits 2005 for the latter activities endophytic microorganisms are probably responsible li et al 2016 however the fast biodegradation by microorganisms and defense mechanisms of plants against microbial pathogens protected t orientalis robert and friml 2009 a significant low adsorption capacity for the contaminant was obtained for quartz sand in a cw mfc it clearly indicates that the biodegradation ability of microorganisms was possible for the quick removal of phenanthrene and anthracene in addition an important metabolic intermediate 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis 2 methylpropyl ester fig s2 of the degradation process was detected in the root and stem samples of t orientalis such finding indicates most probably that t orientalis is able to do phytoextraction and phytotransformation of organic matter in wastewater treatment however the metabolism of these compounds in the tissues of the plant requires further research 3 3 nitrogen removal data for nh3 n and nitrate concentrations in influents and effluents are given in fig 5 in general a stable removal performance for nh3 n and nitrate was obtained in the cw mfcs the average concentrations of nh3 n in the effluents of the four reactors were 7 5 1 9 6 1 1 8 7 2 2 0 and 5 1 1 3 mg l 1 respectively obviously the nh3 n removal efficiency for the cw mfc with an anode amended with nzvi was significantly higher than that for the corresponding cw mfc system p 0 05 notably with the decrease of the temperature in the winter season the nh3 n concentration of the effluents in the four cw mfc reactors ranged from 3 0 to 4 4 mg l 1 results of the linear regression analysis indicate that the nh3 n removal efficiency increased if the do concentration of effluents ranged from 0 3 to 1 2 mg l 1 i y 45 02x 21 98 r2 0 93 fn ii y 44 68x 31 51 r2 0 90 fn nzvi iii y 39 78x 26 60 r2 0 88 cff and iv y 19 42x 53 61 r2 0 95 cff nzvi where x and y mean the do concentration of effluent samples and nh3 n removal efficiency respectively as shown in fig 5 b the nitrate concentration in the effluent samples of the four reactors were 3 2 1 2 2 9 1 2 5 9 2 0 and 4 4 1 6 mg l 1 respectively obviously like in a previous study the nitrate removal in the cw mfc with fn as anode and cathode material was significantly higher than that of the cw mfc with cff as electrode p 0 05 wang et al 2017b the data for nh3 n and nitrate concentrations in the effluent samples of the four cw mfc reactors indicate that nzvi increased the nitrogen removal it has been generally accepted that nitrification and denitrification are the main pathways for the removal of nh3 n in wastewater treatment vymazal 2007 wallace et al 2016 in this study the removal efficiency for nh3 n had a relatively low level this may have resulted from the low concentration of do in the wastewater limiting the nitrification although bacterial activities decreased with the reduced temperatures in winter the removal of nh3 n in the winter season was slightly higher than in the summer season one possible reason may be that the do concentration of the wastewater in the winter season was about 0 7 mg l 1 higher than in the summer season in addition the removal of nitrate in cw mfc remained in the range of 85 0 92 5 this suggests that the cw mfc reactor possesses an advantage for nitrate removal from wastewater by simultaneous biological and chemical denitrification clauwaert et al 2007 vymazal 2007 compared with the bacterial communities in cw systems the relative abundance of eab was shown to be predominantly at the anode lu et al 2015 wang et al 2017a eab are known to be able to desulphurize and to denitrify also the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria such as desulfovibrio and dechloromonas in a cw mfc with an anode amended with nzvi higher than in the corresponding cw mfc section 3 4 this may be the reasons why the removal efficiency of nitrate in the fn nzvi and cff nzvi reactors was slightly higher than in the fn and cff systems 3 4 bacterial diversity and community distribution to gain insight in the bacterial distribution responsible for the removal of nitrogen phenanthrene and anthracene in the anode sphere of the cw mfcs high throughput sequencing analysis was used as shown in table s2 from the four samples were 17111 21703 high quality sequences collected at the end of the experiment the number of otus ranged from 1675 to 2858 ace and chao indexes were used to evaluate the richness of the bacterial community ebrahimi et al 2010 the use of nzvi is enhancing the microbial richness of the cw mfc with fn as anode material while the richness of the bacterial community in the cw mfc with a cff anode amended with nzvi was lower than that of the cw mfc with cff shannon and simpson estimators contain information about the richness and evenness of bacterial communities lu et al 2015 the bacterial diversity evaluated by the shannon estimator indicated a similar trend like the ace and chao indexes obviously the response of the bacterial communities to nzvi on fn or cff anode material is significantly different at the phylum level fig 6 a the main groups are proteobacteria average 39 7 firmicutes average 15 2 bacteroidetes average 14 9 actinobacteria average 9 9 and spirochaetes average 6 5 specifically the relative abundance of the phylum proteobacteria was in the cw mfc with an anode without nzvi about 7 5 higher than in an cw mfc with fn nzvi or cff nzvi however the relative abundance of the phylum firmicutes in the cw mfc with fn or cff as anode material was 4 0 20 0 lower than in the cw mfc with nzvi in addition the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and actinobacteria in the fn nzvi reactor was 5 3 and 22 6 higher than in fn system respectively the relative abundance of spirochaetes in the four reactors were 10 9 5 9 5 0 and 4 0 respectively the bacterial community distribution at class level indicates the occurrence average relative abundance 1 of betaproteobacteria bacteroidia bacilli gammaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria spirochaetes clostridia erysipelotrichi flavobacteriia holophagae planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria and thermoleophilia as shown in fig 6 b for the fn and cff reactors the relative abundance of bacteroidia bacilli actinobacteria and deltaproteobacteria anodes amended with nzvi an increase of abundance is noted however the relative abundance of some classes like betaproteobacteria spirochaetes and flavobacteriia became apparently reduced if anodes amended with nzvi were used the bacterial community distribution at genus level is presented in fig 7 a high abundance average relative abundance 1 0 of bacillus treponema propionicimonas paludibacter zoogloea pseudomonas desulfovibrio geobacter dechloromonas geothrix lactococcus uliginosibacterium and cloacibacterium was found according to the distance matrix analysis the bacteria at the anode in the fn and fn nzvi reactors show a quite high similarity however the relative abundance of the genus bacillus clostridium paenibacillus and ptopionivibtio in the sample for cff nzvi was higher than for the cff reactor in addition the cw mfc of the anode with nzvi showed a higher relative abundance of the genus bacillus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus as compared with the corresponding cw mfc system it has been demonstrated that the biodiversity of the bacterial community around a cff anode in a cw mfc is higher than in a fn reactor wang et al 2017b in addition it is interesting that the application of nzvi to the anode causes a reduction of biodiversity in the cff reactor and an enhancement in the fn system this result is caused by the increased abundance of firmicutes in fn reactor wang et al 2017b finally the richness of biodiversity in the cff nzvi system is lower than in the cff reactor it has been reported that the eab community is mainly consisting of the phyla proteobacteria and firmicutes lu et al 2015 in this study the relative abundance of the proteobacteria and firmicutes respectively in fn nzvi or cff nzvi is higher than in the corresponding cw mfc system the genus bacillus is known to be electrogenic and able to degrade aromatic compounds and to excrete enzyme catalase baran et al 2004 kocabas et al 2008 for the biodegradation of phenanthrene and anthracene fe3 may be used as the catalyst to strengthen the activities of enzyme catalase spuhler et al 2010 in addition the enzyme dioxygenase contains an iron sulfur centers fe2s3 ochiai 1997 is also considered as an important enzyme to breakdown complex organic compounds therefore the use of nzvi may have a positive effect on the metabolic activity and relative abundance of bacillus species a similar trend has also described for the genus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus according to the distance matrix analysis the bacterial distribution in the four reactors was slightly different this may have been an effect of the fn which could have delivered trace elements conducive for the growth of some bacteria this have a positive effect for adaptation of eab and promote bioelectricity generation and biodegradation pathway of contaminant 4 conclusion in the present study we investigated the degradation pathway of phenanthrene and anthracene as model compounds for recalcitrant pollutants by cw mfc is with anodes amended with or anodes without nzvi the removal efficiency for phenanthrene and anthracene ranged from 88 5 to 96 4 the results indicate that eab microorganisms play an important role in the removal of these compounds measurements of phenanthrene and anthracene concentrations in the roots stems and laminas of t orientalis reveal that also phytoextraction and phytotransformation participate in the removal furthermore bioelectricity generation and nitrogen removal were also promoted in cw mfcs by the application of nzvi the analysis of the bacterial community distribution indicates an enhancement of the abundance of bacillus paludibacter desulfovibrio and lactococcus species who have a high degradation capability for recalcitrant pollutants acknowledgements this research is finished under the support of the national nature science

19119,silica scaling of reverse osmosis membranes in brackish water desalination is less understood than hardness scaling due to the complex silica behaviors at the membrane water interface in this study cooh so3h nh2 and oh functional groups were introduced onto polyamide membranes to create distinct surface physicochemical properties the resulting membranes were further studied under similar scaling conditions to yield temporal flux loss data that were empirically interpreted by a logistic growth model the scaled membranes were also characterized by complementary analytical techniques it was found that permeate flux loss was strongly correlated to the initial silica layer formed by direct interaction between reactive silanol si oh and reciprocal groups on the membrane surface rather than the entire scaling layer importantly membrane surface properties dictated the initial silica layer formation through three possible mechanisms i e electrostatic repulsion competitive adsorption and interfacial energy change of these electrostatic repulsion was identified as the primary one therefore by modifying the membrane surface properties the three aforementioned mechanisms may be enhanced to favor the formation of a loose disordered initial silica scaling layer accordingly membrane flux loss may be mitigated this finding provided important insights into the design heuristics of scaling resistant reverse osmosis membrane for brackish water desalination graphical abstract image 1 keywords brackish water membrane surface properties reverse osmosis silica scaling 1 introduction aromatic polyamide pa composite reverse osmosis ro membranes have been widely used for brackish water desalination profiting from the superior quality of the product water istirokhatun et al 2018 however the challenge of mineral scaling is widely encountered in ro desalination process due to the ubiquitous existence of hardness ca2 mg2 and silica ranging from 12 to 60 mg l in the source waters thompson et al 2017 once in excess of their solubility limits or catalyzed by other co existing ions in the source waters these scale forming precursors are deposited on ro membrane surfaces in the form of homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation even at moderate water recovery levels antony et al 2011 the resulting flux decline necessitates a periodic downtime cleaning which is responsible for the limited product efficiency deteriorated performance and shortened lifespan of membrane modules werber et al 2016 with respect to hardness scaling control mature strategies have been commercially developed milne et al 2014 regarding silica scaling one of the mitigation strategies is to reduce silica concentration by feed water pretreatment for example bremere et al demonstrated that the silicic acid was removed by 30 with the aid of silica gel seeds bremere et al 2000 cob et al found that amongst the studied chemicals al iii was proved to be the most effective for silica precipitation with a highest removal efficiency of 99 cob et al 2014 however feed water pretreatment alone seems to be insufficient for the mitigation of silica scaling indeed in spite of various feed water pretreatment silica scaling was still found by the autopsy of ro membranes from full scale brackish water desalination plants tran et al 2007 karime et al 2008 ruiz garcía et al 2018 it appears that the troublesome issue of silica scaling in membrane systems may be attributed to the complexity of silica chemistry milne et al 2014 xie et al demonstrated that silica monomers adsorption and subsequent polymerization on the surface were mainly responsible for silica scaling of polyamide composite membrane xie and gray 2017 braun et al showed that silica scaling was mainly attributed to the deposition of polysilicic acid on the membrane surface braun et al 2010 ning demonstrated that the severe flux decline was a result of the adhesion of silica colloids and silicates on the membrane surface ning 2003 sheikholeslami et al found that a higher mg ca ratio at a given hardness and or a greater silica supersaturation degree accelerated homogeneous nucleation of silica which formed a more porous scaling layer and thus reduced the flux decline sheikholeslami and tan 1999 sahachaiyunta et al showed that iron iii acted effectively as a catalyst to facilitate the formation of silica scale with a fissured structure sahachaiyunta et al 2002 as a rule high ph increases the solubility of silica but promotes the formation of ionic species and these species could react with aluminum and hardness in bulk solution to form the sparingly soluble aluminosilicate and silicate minerals precipitation milne et al 2014 furthermore the traditionally formulated antiscalants are based upon crystallization theory and as such silica specific antiscalants are not available due to amorphous state of silica scaling neofofistou and demadis 2004 milne et al 2014 and a possible strategy for the mitigation of silica scaling is to prevent silica species from polymerization or agglomeration by the development of novel antiscalants neofofistou and demadis 2004 incidentally it has been shown that the common polyacrylate and polyphosphonate based antiscalants may enhance membrane organic and biological fouling by directly adsorbing on the membrane surface and providing additional nutrients for microbial population respectively sweity et al 2015 in addition several studies reported that the permeability of silica scaled membrane was slightly restored after chemical cleaning but declined in a faster rate in the subsequent cycles which manifested the recalcitrant nature of silica scaling badruzzaman et al 2011 li et al 2012 recently membrane surface properties were found to play an important role in silica scaling of ro membranes for example tong et al demonstrated that the propensity of silica scaling was strongly correlated to membrane surface charge with more negatively charged surface resulting in lesser extent of scaling tong et al 2017 also a forward osmosis study found that a cellulose triacetate cta membrane with hydroxyl rich surfaces preferred to induce the polymerization of silica species in the bulk solution compared to a pa membrane with carboxyl rich surfaces xie and gray 2017 however despite the above efforts an in depth study was still warranted this paper presents a study on how surface modifications to pa membranes may result in reduced silica fouling for this purpose the authors used radical grafting self assembly and co deposition approaches to modify a pa membrane surface the primary origin of permeate flux loss was traced to the initial silica scaling layer the outcome of the study is of importance in regard to the design heuristics for the mitigation of silica scaling 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane and chemicals a commercially available ro membrane module tw30 dow filmtec usa was

chloride nacl 99 5 were purchased from aladdin industrial corporation shanghai china guangfu technology development co ltd tianjin china and xilong chemical industry co ltd guangdong china respectively unless otherwise specified aqueous solutions of the chemicals were prepared by spiking the respective chemicals in ultrapure water produced by a milli q system millipore usa if necessary the solution ph was adjusted by adding concentrated naoh and hcl solution to the appropriate value 2 2 membrane surface modification membrane coupons of 100 mm length 40 mm width were carefully cut from the aforementioned ro membrane module and immersed in 25 v v isopropanol solutions for 30 min after which the membrane coupons were thoroughly rinsed with the ultrapure water and stored at 4 c until use prior to surface modification the permeate side of each membrane coupon was carefully covered with parafilm a sequence of functional groups including cooh nh2 and oh which are prevailing in ro membranes as well as so3h were considered in this study and the corresponding monomers or polymers table s1 were introduced onto the membrane surfaces by using three methods detailed as follows redox initiation method was employed for grafting aa with cooh or amps with so3h on the membrane surfaces during the grafting process the free radicals induced by the redox reaction of a pair of initiators attacked the native amino and carboxyl groups in the pa backbone to create activated grafting sites then the monomers were covalently bond to membrane surfaces freger et al 2002 cheng et al 2013 specifically a mixed solution was prepared by sequentially adding monomers 0 5 m na2s2o5 0 005 m and k2s2o8 0 005 m to the ultrapure water shortly after which the membrane coupons were immersed in the mixed solution over 1 h and then thoroughly rinsed with pure water and stored at 4 c for further study a self assembly method was used to prepare pah modified membranes inspired by the layer by layer self assembly lbl sa method the positively charged pah molecules with nh2 pk a 8 9 were attached to negatively charged membrane surface via electrostatically attraction ilyas et al 2017 in brief a 0 1 g l 1 pah solution was prepared by dissolving pah powder into a background electrolyte solution that contained 4 25 g l 1 nano3 and then adjusted to the assembly ph of 7 5 membrane coupons were dipped into the pah solution for 15 min after being taken out of the solution the modified membrane coupons were rinsed for 10 min using the background electrolyte solution of ph 7 5 given the weak stability of the pah grafting as discussed in section 3 1 the modified membranes prepared above were further immersed in 1 5 wt ga solution for 5 min to crosslink pah with ga duong et al 2013 the resulting membrane was then thoroughly rinsed with the ultrapure water and stored at 4 c for further use da assisted pva with oh co deposition was performed to create a composite coating on the membrane surfaces in this approach pva was stably entrapped within the self polymerized dopamine pda matrix by multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the polar hydroxyl groups of pva and the phenol hydroxyl or amino groups of pda without necessitating the special chemical groups such as amine or thiol group for secondary reaction zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2018 specifically da 1 mg ml 1 was separately dissolved in a tris 10 mm ph 8 5 buffer solution and a mixture solution consisting of both pva 2 mg ml dissolved at 95 c and tris to prepare pda and pda pva solution respectively membrane coupons were then immersed in the resulting coating solution with a gentle shaking for 12 h and then thoroughly rinsed with pure water and stored at 4 c for further use 2 3 bench scale ro filtration setup and protocol all the membranes were tested by using a dual channel bench scale ro system consisting of two cross flow membrane cells with identical flow channel dimensions of 85 mm length 30 mm width 2 5 mm height two booster pumps a shared feed water vessel and accessary tubings and valves fig 1 the system was operated in a total recycle mode with permeate and retentate streams being continuously returned back to the feed vessel the feed water temperature was controlled at 23 1 c by using a refrigerated water bath dhh 5 10 jiangsu ronghua instrument manufacturing co ltd china for each paralleled filtration run 10 l of feed water containing 5 94 g na2sio3 5h2o 7 77 g cacl2 10 g nacl and 0 84 g nahco3 ph buffer were prepared to simulate concentrated brackish groundwater after 70 80 recovery tong et al 2017 prior to the scaling tests two membrane coupons installed separately in the paralleled cross flow cells were compacted with ultrapure water for 10 h and then conditioned after adding the prescribed amounts of nacl to the ultrapure water for another 10 h under an applied pressure of 8 3 bar and an average cross flow velocity cfv of 4 44 cm s 1 during which the steady pure water flux and apparent salt rejection were obtained respectively as shown in fig s1 supporting information the modified membranes exhibited similar salt rejection values compared with the virgin membrane inferring that modification occurred only on the membrane surfaces after that na2sio3 5h2o cacl2 and nahco3 were added to the feed water and then the ph of the feed water was immediately adjusted to 6 3 0 1 to maintain identical silica scaling conditions all the scaling tests were conducted at a fixed initial permeate flux of approximately 29 41 l m 2 h 1 and a fixed cfv of 4 44 cm s 1 correspondingly the applied pressure for different membranes varied from 6 to 8 bar depending upon the initial pure water permeability of the studied membrane fig s1 supporting information the small variations in the applied pressures should have a negligible impact on silica scaling behavior according to the above experimental conditions concentration polarization modulus cpm the solute concentration ratio of membrane surface to bulk solution were estimated to be 2 3 with cacl2 as its sole indicator for simplicity based on the classical film model rahardianto et al 2006 and thus the initial saturation index si the ratio of activity to solubility constant near the membrane surface was estimated to be 3 4 by using the visual minteq software version 3 1 kth sweden the experimental duration was 3000 min when the permeate flux losses approached their plateaus over the timeframe of each scaling test run ph conductivity and temperature 23 1 c of the feed water were kept constant and monitored using a ph meter hq40d hach usa and a conductivity meter equipped with a temperature electrode dds 307a leici china respectively turbidity and silica monomer concentration of the feed water were monitored by employing a turbidimeter 2100n hach usa and spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa respectively as shown in fig s2 supporting information the consistently low turbidity and positive absorbance values inferred that silica monomers with negligibly small amounts of silica particles existed in the feed solution during the course of silica scaling tests permeate flux was measured gravimetrically at specific time intervals and the corresponding flux loss was calculated as 1 j t j 0 where j 0 and j t refer to the permeate flux at time 0 and t respectively at the terminal of the filtration run the membranes were carefully removed from the cells and gently rinsed with ultrapure water to remove residual feed water and then dried in ambient air for further characterization 2 4 membrane characterization the water contact angles of the studied membranes were measured in at least six replicates with a contact angle analyzer powereach jc2000d2 shanghai zhongchen digital technology apparatus co ltd china by using a sessile drop method at 23 c and the results were used to evaluate the membrane surface hydrophilicity also zeta potentials of the membrane surfaces at the ph range of concern were measured by using an electrokinetic analyzer anton paar surpass austria with 1 mm kcl solution air dried membrane specimens were sputter coated with gold and then imaged using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds horiba emax 350 japan surface functionality of the membranes were determined by using a fourier transformed infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet is50 thermo fisher usa with 64 scans at 4 cm 1 resolution the elemental compositions of membrane surfaces were measured by employing an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermo escalab 250xi usa and the adventitious c 1s line at 284 8 ev was used to calibrate initially the electron binding energy after baseline background subtraction and smoothing by using the savistsky golay approach component peaks were deconvoluted by assuming a gaussian peak type sari and chellam 2017 for the characterization of silica scales on the membranes the effects of membrane sampling location were considered according to the following formula jankhah 2017 1 l d 0 05 re d h where re is the average reynolds number of flow channel d h is the hydraulic diameter and l d is the desired channel length access to relatively steady state hydrodynamic conditions accordingly specimens were harvested from the scaled membranes between 6 and 8 cm along the flow direction where the regions adjacent to channel wall were also omitted considering the complex flow regime fig s3 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface properties of virgin and modified membranes the main surface properties of cleaned virgin and modified membranes were analyzed in this study by employing different techniques membrane surface morphology was captured by sem fig 2 shows that most modified membranes possessed similar surface structures characterized by ridges and valleys due to the ultrathin coating formed on the membrane surfaces comparable to the virgin membrane in contrast the pda pva modified membrane was thickly coated by polymers which differentiated from other studied membranes the information on membrane surface functionality was collected from the ft ir spectra fig 3 shows that it seems to be difficult to exactly distinguish the subtle changes in the spectra after membrane modification due to masking or overlapping of related absorption bands from the substrate pa membrane compared with ft ir analysis depth 400 500 nm xps is capable of examining the elemental composition of the top surface as deep as 2 10 nm the changes in the c o ratio table s2 supporting information and o 1s binding energy fig s4 supporting information indicated the success in surface modification with the virgin pa membrane as a control it is noteworthy that the exclusive existence of the o 1s peak at 532 49 ev fig s4f supporting information combined with the sem image fig 2f unanimously mirrored that the pda pva modified membrane primarily exhibited the physicochemical properties of polymer coating rather than native membrane surface in particular a new peak at 401 19 ev which is assigned to n element associated with nh2 groups in pah polyelectrolytes duong et al 2013 was observed clearly from high resolution xps scans of n 1s regions fig s5 supporting information in addition the modified membranes exhibited different hydrophilicities and surface charge properties due to the grafting of different compounds comparatively the virgin pa membrane had the most hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 76 6 while all the modified membranes became relative hydrophilic with smaller contact angles fig 4 a amongst the modified membranes the pda pva modified membrane had the most hydrophilic surface with a water contact angle of 33 2 probably because pva polymer had a higher density of polar groups hydroxyl in accordance with its molecular formula table s1 supporting information overall the contact angles of the virgin and the modified membranes followed the order of virgin pah amps pda aa pda pva surface charge can be induced by the protonation or deprotonation of functional groups on the membrane surface fig 4b shows that all membranes were more negatively charged with increasing ph as their zeta potentials decreased monotonously at a ph of 6 3 i e that of the synthetic brackish water used in this study the aa modified membrane showed the lowest zeta potential of 58 mv because the grafted aa monomers rendered membrane surfaces more carboxyl groups in contrast the amps modified membrane had a slightly higher zeta potential of 52 mv than the aa modified membrane table s1 supporting information shows that amps has larger molecular weight and more complex molecular structure than aa accordingly the difference in their modified membranes may be ascribed to the higher steric hindrance of the grafted amps molecular to subsequent monomers which resulted in lower grafting degree than aa unlike amps and aa the introduction of other surface modifiers made the substrate pa membrane less negatively charged in particular the ga crosslinked pah modified membrane showed a zeta potential of 17 mv the highest among the studied membranes fig 4b the importance of ga crosslinking to the pah modified membrane was assessed with an additional stability test conducted under controlled experimental conditions fig s6 supporting information the results clearly demonstrated that in the absence of ga linkage the electrostatic attraction between pah and the pa membrane was insufficient to overcome the shear force induced by the feed stream as the zeta potential of the modified membrane decreased from 22 mv to 12 mv after the stability test in contrast ga crosslinking of the pah modified membrane resulted in a constant zeta potential of 17 mv before and after the test the low and negative zeta potential of the crosslinked pah membrane was a result of the decreased free amine groups due to the cross linking reaction between the aldehyde group of ga and the amine group of pah duong et al 2013 furthermore the pda pva modified membrane exhibited a relatively high zeta potential of 25 mv because the abundant electroneutral hydroxyl groups grafted onto the membrane shielded the native negative surface charges 3 2 permeate flux loss caused by silica scaling as a whole the temporal profiles of permeate flux loss for all the membranes consistently experienced three stages fig 5 at the initial stage the permeate flux loss slowly increased due to the time required for silica species to approach the stable critical size of nucleation shmulevsky et al 2017 after that the flux loss progressed in faster rates due to the formation of sufficient silica nuclei on the membrane surface during the final stage the flux loss for different membranes slowed down and gradually approached plateaus as the effective membrane areas available for silica scaling diminished over time xie and gray 2016 fig 5 also demonstrates that the temporal flux loss profiles exhibited distinct patterns as silica scaling progressed the aa modified membrane had the best resistance to flux decline with a minimum flux loss of 42 3 while the pah modified membrane suffered the most serious flux loss of 64 2 at the conclusion of the experiment the relatively high permeate flux loss of the pah modified membrane is presumably because the hybrid carboxyl amine surface favored heterogeneous silica nucleation as a result of the synergistic effects of adjacent oppositely charged moieties wallace et al 2009 all other modified membranes showed smaller flux losses than the virgin membrane in order to identify the influencing factors for permeate flux loss the experimentally measured flux loss was plotted as functions of water contact angle and surface zeta potential respectively fig 6 a shows that there was not clear correlation between permeate flux loss and contact angle for example the virgin pa membrane and the pda modified membrane had different water contact angles of 76 6 and 51 1 but experienced similar flux losses of 57 3 and 55 6 respectively suggesting that membrane hydrophilicity is not a good predictor for permeate flux loss associated with silica scaling this finding is in line with that reported by tong et al which indicated that silica species could penetrate the bound hydration layer to be adsorbed on the membrane surface tong et al 2017 likewise there was not any explicit correlation between membrane surface charge and flux loss fig 6b for example pda pva and amps modified membranes had different zeta potential of 25 and 53 mv at ph 6 3 respectively but exhibited similar total flux losses of 52 7 and 52 4 respectively however when the pda pva modified membrane was excluded a reasonable correlation was discovered for the remaining membranes adj r 2 0 82 and p 0 02 not shown in fig 4b it appeared that the effectiveness of surface charge in the mitigation of flux loss was specifically limited to similar substrates considering that the pda pva modified membrane intensively exhibited physicochemical properties of the polymer coating as described in section 3 1 additional evidence could be provided by a test for a type of commercially available pa membrane with proprietary coating under similar silica scaling conditions as other membranes modified in this study fig s7 supporting information shows that the membrane had the high zeta potential of 17 mv at ph 6 3 but encountered the lowest flux loss of 35 2 overall although membrane surface charge was identified as an important factor controlling the extent of permeate flux loss the specific relationship between zeta potential and flux loss showed by the pda pva modified membrane inferred that other factors may influence silica scaling as discussed later 3 3 membrane surface properties and silica scaling kinetics resembling sigmoidal growth process of microbes the competition of silica species for active sites on the membrane surface was analogous to the scramble of microbes for limited nutrition it is reasonably assumed that the permeate flux declined with the reduced amounts of active sites due to the formation of the initial scaling layer then the temporal flux loss data could be empirically interpreted by invoking a logistic growth model tsoularis and wallace 2002 uchymiak et al 2008 as follows 2 j l t j l m a x j 0 1 j 0 e r t j 0 where j l t is the fractional flux loss at time t j 0 and j l max are the initial and maximum values for j l and r is an intrinsic model parameter the obtained fitting curves are plotted in fig 5 and the extracted characteristic parameters are summarized in table 1 the goodness and statistically significance of the correlation adj r 2 0 99 p 0 001 implied that the above assumption is reasonable i e the local flux declined as silica species directly bound to the active surface sites on the membranes as illustrated in fig 5 different fitting curves reflected distinct scaling kinetics for the studied membranes which can be attributed to the specific interaction regime between reactive silanol si oh and reciprocal groups on the membrane surface wallace et al found that carboxyl groups had more energetically favorable hydrogen bonding interaction with silica than hydroxyl groups which accelerated the nucleation of amorphous silica wallace et al 2009 however in this work the aa modified membrane consistently kept lower flux losses than the pda pva modified membrane fig 5 suggesting that the surface charge played a more important role in silica scaling than hydrogen bonding besides most of the parameter values quantified in this study table 1 were in agreement with the total flux loss for example the pah and the aa modified membrane took the least and the most time t to reach their maximum flux loss rates r max and eventually resulted in the highest and the lowest total flux losses respectively however this was not always the case due to the complexity of silica scaling process as an example the virgin pa membrane had a moderate t value of 1472 min but suffered the second highest total flux loss of 57 3 indeed silica scaling behavior changed dynamically over the duration of experimentation fig 5 3 4 morphology of silica scaling on different membrane surfaces the morphology of scalant formed on the membranes was visualized by sem eds in this study fig 7 shows that silica scalant spanned the entire surfaces of the studied membranes in a spatially non uniform manner as the original characteristic structures observed on the unused membranes fig 2 disappeared generally speaking the scalant exhibited either a gel like patch pattern e g fig 7a or a particle like pattern e g fig 7c the colored sem eds images further demonstrated that the distribution of silicon highly matched the distribution of scalant on the membranes suggesting that silica was a major component of the scalant on the other hand it is surprising that high silicon content i e silica scaling extent did not necessarily result in severe permeate flux loss as expected for instance the aa modified membrane was slightly colored in response to the minimum flux loss fig 7b inset comparatively the amps modified membrane suffered only moderate flux loss in spite of the higher silica scaling extent fig 7c inset as did the pda pva modified membrane fig 7f inset therefore the scaling layer architecture should have played a role in determining the permeate flux loss it is anticipated that a loose and porous scaling layer would lead to a relatively small hydraulic resistance for water permeation which may be analogous to the coating of polyelectrolytes on ro membranes in the latter case ilyas and coworkers found that coating density exerted greater impacts than thickness on membrane permeability during the assembly process of weak polyelectrolyte multilayers ilyas et al 2017 as such a small but appreciable effect of the add on silica scaling layer on flux loss was probably responsible for the non strict linear correlation between zeta potential and permeate flux loss fig 6b and further explained why permeate flux loss was not positively related to silica scaling extent fig 5 versus fig 7 further scalant characterization was conducted for each membrane by ft ir fig 3 shows that the bands specific to the substrate pa membrane including the characteristic peaks of polysulfone support layer at 1245 1170 and 1151 cm 1 and polyamide active layer 1664 1586 and 1544 cm 1 were noticeably obscured by silica scalants with the appearance of new and prominent peaks at around 1100 1070 cm 1 si o si asymmetric stretching 1014 cm 1 si o stretching and 476 cm 1 o si o deformation neofofistou and demadis 2004 sari and chellam 2017 additional information on the scaling layer was also obtained by xps analysis compared with the unused membranes table s2 supporting information the scaled membranes possessed lower atomic percentages of c and n and a higher percentage of o due to the masking effect of silica scalants table 2 consistent with the eds results fig 7 inset the xps results confirmed that silicon was a major component of the scaling layer moreover the subtle shifts in the binding energy peak near 102 72 ev observed with the membranes were indicative of stable chemical state of si o bond shin et al 2011 from high resolution xps scans of si 2p regions fig s8 supporting information besides ca2 in the scaling layer table 2 is known to form bridges between silica species which probably results in the difficulty in membrane cleaning data not shown as a comparison the information obtained from ft ir analysis did not completely match that from xps for example the intensity of the ir peak near 1014 cm 1 decreased in the order of pda pda pva amps pah virgin aa fig 3 whereas the atomic percentages of silicon decreased in the order of pah amps pda pva pda aa virgin table 2 such discrepancy was attributed to the differences in the analysis depth of the employed techniques and the randomness of silica scaling on the membrane surface similar to the silicon content maps obtained by eds both ft ir and xps results were not competent indicators for the corresponding flux loss in the present study 3 5 silica scaling mechanism theoretically specific types of silica species can only deposit on the relevant surface active sites milne et al 2014 silica species are specifically adsorbed and covalently bond to the membrane surface by subsequent condensation reaction between silanol si oh and reciprocal groups which results in the formation of an initial silica layer and thus the conditioned membrane surface subsequently the silica scaling at the membrane water interface would progress to form an add on silica scaling layer that does not directly interact with membrane surfaces through two routes on the one hand the growing of existing silica species on the membrane surface formed polymers that extend out into the solution phase on the other hand silica species in the bulk solution directly deposited on the initial silica scaling layer both processes involved the interactions between silica species at the membrane water interface and the existing silica species on the initial silica scaling layer experimentally the initial scaling layer formed by direct binding of silica species to the active sites on membrane surfaces was hypothesized as a major contributor to the permeate flux loss this hypothesis was partially supported by the goodness and statistically significance of the correlation obtained by fitting the logistic growth function to the temporal flux loss data fig 5 and table 1 while different analytical techniques figs 3 and 7 and table 2 indirectly demonstrated the extent of flux loss strongly depended on the formation of the initial scaling layer as illustrated in fig 8 ionized silicic acid is formed by the deprotonation of silicic acid polysilicic acid which refers to dimers trimers as well as other oligomers having high acidity and reactivity can be formed by the intermolecular dehydration reaction of silicic acid milne et al 2014 only trimers as a typical example of polysilicic acid are shown and their structures refer to xie and gray 2017 subsequently membrane surface properties dictate the formation of the initial silica scaling layer through three different pathways in the first pathway during their convective transport to membrane surfaces ionized silicic acid or polysilicic acid may be electrostatically repelled by the more negatively charged membranes such as aa modified membrane and carried away by the cross flow of the concentrate stream which reduces silica concentration near the membrane surface and thus silica nucleation kinetics on the contrary the less negatively charged membranes such as pah modified membrane may increase the probability of their deposition on the surface and thus the formation of initial scaling layer in the second pathway due to the high reactivity the existing polysilicic acid may compete with active sites depending on their properties for subsequent silica species in the feed stream thus helping establish a disorder and defective initial silica layer with lowered permeate flux loss finally the third pathway is related to the enhanced homogeneous polymerization of silica species the hydroxyl rich surface such as pda pva modified membrane had a higher liquid solid interfacial energy than the carboxyl rich surface such as aa modified membrane and thus promoted the formation of more polysilicic acid with different structures in the bulk solution xie and gray 2017 subsequently these polysilicic acid clusters may be adsorbed on the membrane surface with their arms or tentacles suspending in the bulk solution thereby forming a scaffold like scaling layer to protect the underneath active sites from being attacked by subsequent silica species it is noteworthy that silica scaling behaviors were attributed to the coupling of various factors rather than a specific mechanism alone and it can be expected that the relative contribution of these mechanisms changes with membrane surface properties as well as temporal and spatial variation of scaling process incidentally as the scaling proceeds the add on silica scaling layer may provide favorable habitats without strong hydrodynamic vortex to physically entrap subsequent silica species regardless of their charge properties which partly avoid the direct contact of them with membrane surface it is puzzled in this study that the scaled membranes exhibited different surface morphologies under similar scaling conditions which appears to be contrary to the diffusion controlled growth model thompson et al 2017 one possible explanation is that the distinct architectures of the scaling layers resulted in different local hydraulics thus causing different mass transfer conditions from the bulk solution to the membrane surface for subsequent silica species when the deposition rates of the incoming silica species were greater than the gel forming rates of existing silica the final scale morphology would exhibit particle like structure and otherwise gel like patch structure as observed by sem fig 7 3 6 implications this study experimentally demonstrated that the surface properties of ro membranes played a predominated role in the silica scaling process during brackish water desalination as manifested by distinct scaling kinetics and morphological diversity of these physicochemical properties membrane surface charge was identified as the dominant factor controlling the formation of initial silica scaling layer which was a primary origin of permeate flux loss however potential side effects caused by high density of negative surface charge should not be discounted for example specific interactions between ca2 and carboxylic groups could aggravate organic fouling and gypsum scaling by establishing intermolecular bridges among organic foulants and inducing the donnan s effect respectively wang et al 2016 tong et al 2017 which may be a challenge for ro membranes with such surface properties to desalinate realistic brackish water in field applications encouragingly the above challenge may be potentially overcome when the membrane surface is thoroughly and delicately designed in this work the pda pva modified membrane despite its possession of less negative surface charge exhibited a low flux loss comparable with the more negatively charged amps modified membrane fig 5 which means that other physicochemical properties such as interfacial energy could take over the dominant role of surface charge in governing silica scaling behavior and dictate the formation of the initial scaling layer that controls the extent of permeate flux loss this finding provided further insights into the design of scaling resistant ro membrane for brackish water desalination however as an important consideration hydraulic conditions could also have a strong influence on mass transfer of silica species and further study is warranted to better understand the relationship between hydraulics and silica scaling behavior on brackish water ro membranes 4 conclusions during ro based brackish water desalination the initial scaling layer formed by direct binding of silica species to the active sites on membrane surfaces was found to be primarily responsible for permeate flux loss membrane surface properties dictated the formation of the initial silica scaling layer possibly through the synthesis of three mechanisms i e electrostatic repulsion competitive adsorption and interfacial energy change the adverse effect of negative surface charge on silica scaling control may be reduced by altering membrane interfacial energy with the introduction of appropriate functional groups considering the dominant effect of the initial silica scale on permeate flux loss the conventional silica scaling extent parameter is not a good indicator for the scaling evaluation as it fails to measure the formation of the initial scaling layer declaration of interests none acknowledgement we would like to thank the three anonymous

19119,silica scaling of reverse osmosis membranes in brackish water desalination is less understood than hardness scaling due to the complex silica behaviors at the membrane water interface in this study cooh so3h nh2 and oh functional groups were introduced onto polyamide membranes to create distinct surface physicochemical properties the resulting membranes were further studied under similar scaling conditions to yield temporal flux loss data that were empirically interpreted by a logistic growth model the scaled membranes were also characterized by complementary analytical techniques it was found that permeate flux loss was strongly correlated to the initial silica layer formed by direct interaction between reactive silanol si oh and reciprocal groups on the membrane surface rather than the entire scaling layer importantly membrane surface properties dictated the initial silica layer formation through three possible mechanisms i e electrostatic repulsion competitive adsorption and interfacial energy change of these electrostatic repulsion was identified as the primary one therefore by modifying the membrane surface properties the three aforementioned mechanisms may be enhanced to favor the formation of a loose disordered initial silica scaling layer accordingly membrane flux loss may be mitigated this finding provided important insights into the design heuristics of scaling resistant reverse osmosis membrane for brackish water desalination graphical abstract image 1 keywords brackish water membrane surface properties reverse osmosis silica scaling 1 introduction aromatic polyamide pa composite reverse osmosis ro membranes have been widely used for brackish water desalination profiting from the superior quality of the product water istirokhatun et al 2018 however the challenge of mineral scaling is widely encountered in ro desalination process due to the ubiquitous existence of hardness ca2 mg2 and silica ranging from 12 to 60 mg l in the source waters thompson et al 2017 once in excess of their solubility limits or catalyzed by other co existing ions in the source waters these scale forming precursors are deposited on ro membrane surfaces in the form of homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation even at moderate water recovery levels antony et al 2011 the resulting flux decline necessitates a periodic downtime cleaning which is responsible for the limited product efficiency deteriorated performance and shortened lifespan of membrane modules werber et al 2016 with respect to hardness scaling control mature strategies have been commercially developed milne et al 2014 regarding silica scaling one of the mitigation strategies is to reduce silica concentration by feed water pretreatment for example bremere et al demonstrated that the silicic acid was removed by 30 with the aid of silica gel seeds bremere et al 2000 cob et al found that amongst the studied chemicals al iii was proved to be the most effective for silica precipitation with a highest removal efficiency of 99 cob et al 2014 however feed water pretreatment alone seems to be insufficient for the mitigation of silica scaling indeed in spite of various feed water pretreatment silica scaling was still found by the autopsy of ro membranes from full scale brackish water desalination plants tran et al 2007 karime et al 2008 ruiz garcía et al 2018 it appears that the troublesome issue of silica scaling in membrane systems may be attributed to the complexity of silica chemistry milne et al 2014 xie et al demonstrated that silica monomers adsorption and subsequent polymerization on the surface were mainly responsible for silica scaling of polyamide composite membrane xie and gray 2017 braun et al showed that silica scaling was mainly attributed to the deposition of polysilicic acid on the membrane surface braun et al 2010 ning demonstrated that the severe flux decline was a result of the adhesion of silica colloids and silicates on the membrane surface ning 2003 sheikholeslami et al found that a higher mg ca ratio at a given hardness and or a greater silica supersaturation degree accelerated homogeneous nucleation of silica which formed a more porous scaling layer and thus reduced the flux decline sheikholeslami and tan 1999 sahachaiyunta et al showed that iron iii acted effectively as a catalyst to facilitate the formation of silica scale with a fissured structure sahachaiyunta et al 2002 as a rule high ph increases the solubility of silica but promotes the formation of ionic species and these species could react with aluminum and hardness in bulk solution to form the sparingly soluble aluminosilicate and silicate minerals precipitation milne et al 2014 furthermore the traditionally formulated antiscalants are based upon crystallization theory and as such silica specific antiscalants are not available due to amorphous state of silica scaling neofofistou and demadis 2004 milne et al 2014 and a possible strategy for the mitigation of silica scaling is to prevent silica species from polymerization or agglomeration by the development of novel antiscalants neofofistou and demadis 2004 incidentally it has been shown that the common polyacrylate and polyphosphonate based antiscalants may enhance membrane organic and biological fouling by directly adsorbing on the membrane surface and providing additional nutrients for microbial population respectively sweity et al 2015 in addition several studies reported that the permeability of silica scaled membrane was slightly restored after chemical cleaning but declined in a faster rate in the subsequent cycles which manifested the recalcitrant nature of silica scaling badruzzaman et al 2011 li et al 2012 recently membrane surface properties were found to play an important role in silica scaling of ro membranes for example tong et al demonstrated that the propensity of silica scaling was strongly correlated to membrane surface charge with more negatively charged surface resulting in lesser extent of scaling tong et al 2017 also a forward osmosis study found that a cellulose triacetate cta membrane with hydroxyl rich surfaces preferred to induce the polymerization of silica species in the bulk solution compared to a pa membrane with carboxyl rich surfaces xie and gray 2017 however despite the above efforts an in depth study was still warranted this paper presents a study on how surface modifications to pa membranes may result in reduced silica fouling for this purpose the authors used radical grafting self assembly and co deposition approaches to modify a pa membrane surface the primary origin of permeate flux loss was traced to the initial silica scaling layer the outcome of the study is of importance in regard to the design heuristics for the mitigation of silica scaling 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane and chemicals a commercially available ro membrane module tw30 dow filmtec usa was

respectively unless otherwise specified aqueous solutions of the chemicals were prepared by spiking the respective chemicals in ultrapure water produced by a milli q system millipore usa if necessary the solution ph was adjusted by adding concentrated naoh and hcl solution to the appropriate value 2 2 membrane surface modification membrane coupons of 100 mm length 40 mm width were carefully cut from the aforementioned ro membrane module and immersed in 25 v v isopropanol solutions for 30 min after which the membrane coupons were thoroughly rinsed with the ultrapure water and stored at 4 c until use prior to surface modification the permeate side of each membrane coupon was carefully covered with parafilm a sequence of functional groups including cooh nh2 and oh which are prevailing in ro membranes as well as so3h were considered in this study and the corresponding monomers or polymers table s1 were introduced onto the membrane surfaces by using three methods detailed as follows redox initiation method was employed for grafting aa with cooh or amps with so3h on the membrane surfaces during the grafting process the free radicals induced by the redox reaction of a pair of initiators attacked the native amino and carboxyl groups in the pa backbone to create activated grafting sites then the monomers were covalently bond to membrane surfaces freger et al 2002 cheng et al 2013 specifically a mixed solution was prepared by sequentially adding monomers 0 5 m na2s2o5 0 005 m and k2s2o8 0 005 m to the ultrapure water shortly after which the membrane coupons were immersed in the mixed solution over 1 h and then thoroughly rinsed with pure water and stored at 4 c for further study a self assembly method was used to prepare pah modified membranes inspired by the layer by layer self assembly lbl sa method the positively charged pah molecules with nh2 pk a 8 9 were attached to negatively charged membrane surface via electrostatically attraction ilyas et al 2017 in brief a 0 1 g l 1 pah solution was prepared by dissolving pah powder into a background electrolyte solution that contained 4 25 g l 1 nano3 and then adjusted to the assembly ph of 7 5 membrane coupons were dipped into the pah solution for 15 min after being taken out of the solution the modified membrane coupons were rinsed for 10 min using the background electrolyte solution of ph 7 5 given the weak stability of the pah grafting as discussed in section 3 1 the modified membranes prepared above were further immersed in 1 5 wt ga solution for 5 min to crosslink pah with ga duong et al 2013 the resulting membrane was then thoroughly rinsed with the ultrapure water and stored at 4 c for further use da assisted pva with oh co deposition was performed to create a composite coating on the membrane surfaces in this approach pva was stably entrapped within the self polymerized dopamine pda matrix by multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the polar hydroxyl groups of pva and the phenol hydroxyl or amino groups of pda without necessitating the special chemical groups such as amine or thiol group for secondary reaction zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2018 specifically da 1 mg ml 1 was separately dissolved in a tris 10 mm ph 8 5 buffer solution and a mixture solution consisting of both pva 2 mg ml dissolved at 95 c and tris to prepare pda and pda pva solution respectively membrane coupons were then immersed in the resulting coating solution with a gentle shaking for 12 h and then thoroughly rinsed with pure water and stored at 4 c for further use 2 3 bench scale ro filtration setup and protocol all the membranes were tested by using a dual channel bench scale ro system consisting of two cross flow membrane cells with identical flow channel dimensions of 85 mm length 30 mm width 2 5 mm height two booster pumps a shared feed water vessel and accessary tubings and valves fig 1 the system was operated in a total recycle mode with permeate and retentate streams being continuously returned back to the feed vessel the feed water temperature was controlled at 23 1 c by using a refrigerated water bath dhh 5 10 jiangsu ronghua instrument manufacturing co ltd china for each paralleled filtration run 10 l of feed water containing 5 94 g na2sio3 5h2o 7 77 g cacl2 10 g nacl and 0 84 g nahco3 ph buffer were prepared to simulate concentrated brackish groundwater after 70 80 recovery tong et al 2017 prior to the scaling tests two membrane coupons installed separately in the paralleled cross flow cells were compacted with ultrapure water for 10 h and then conditioned after adding the prescribed amounts of nacl to the ultrapure water for another 10 h under an applied pressure of 8 3 bar and an average cross flow velocity cfv of 4 44 cm s 1 during which the steady pure water flux and apparent salt rejection were obtained respectively as shown in fig s1 supporting information the modified membranes exhibited similar salt rejection values compared with the virgin membrane inferring that modification occurred only on the membrane surfaces after that na2sio3 5h2o cacl2 and nahco3 were added to the feed water and then the ph of the feed water was immediately adjusted to 6 3 0 1 to maintain identical silica scaling conditions all the scaling tests were conducted at a fixed initial permeate flux of approximately 29 41 l m 2 h 1 and a fixed cfv of 4 44 cm s 1 correspondingly the applied pressure for different membranes varied from 6 to 8 bar depending upon the initial pure water permeability of the studied membrane fig s1 supporting information the small variations in the applied pressures should have a negligible impact on silica scaling behavior according to the above experimental conditions concentration polarization modulus cpm the solute concentration ratio of membrane surface to bulk solution were estimated to be 2 3 with cacl2 as its sole indicator for simplicity based on the classical film model rahardianto et al 2006 and thus the initial saturation index si the ratio of activity to solubility constant near the membrane surface was estimated to be 3 4 by using the visual minteq software version 3 1 kth sweden the experimental duration was 3000 min when the permeate flux losses approached their plateaus over the timeframe of each scaling test run ph conductivity and temperature 23 1 c of the feed water were kept constant and monitored using a ph meter hq40d hach usa and a conductivity meter equipped with a temperature electrode dds 307a leici china respectively turbidity and silica monomer concentration of the feed water were monitored by employing a turbidimeter 2100n hach usa and spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa respectively as shown in fig s2 supporting information the consistently low turbidity and positive absorbance values inferred that silica monomers with negligibly small amounts of silica particles existed in the feed solution during the course of silica scaling tests permeate flux was measured gravimetrically at specific time intervals and the corresponding flux loss was calculated as 1 j t j 0 where j 0 and j t refer to the permeate flux at time 0 and t respectively at the terminal of the filtration run the membranes were carefully removed from the cells and gently rinsed with ultrapure water to remove residual feed water and then dried in ambient air for further characterization 2 4 membrane characterization the water contact angles of the studied membranes were measured in at least six replicates with a contact angle analyzer powereach jc2000d2 shanghai zhongchen digital technology apparatus co ltd china by using a sessile drop method at 23 c and the results were used to evaluate the membrane surface hydrophilicity also zeta potentials of the membrane surfaces at the ph range of concern were measured by using an electrokinetic analyzer anton paar surpass austria with 1 mm kcl solution air dried membrane specimens were sputter coated with gold and then imaged using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds horiba emax 350 japan surface functionality of the membranes were determined by using a fourier transformed infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet is50 thermo fisher usa with 64 scans at 4 cm 1 resolution the elemental compositions of membrane surfaces were measured by employing an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermo escalab 250xi usa and the adventitious c 1s line at 284 8 ev was used to calibrate initially the electron binding energy after baseline background subtraction and smoothing by using the savistsky golay approach component peaks were deconvoluted by assuming a gaussian peak type sari and chellam 2017 for the characterization of silica scales on the membranes the effects of membrane sampling location were considered according to the following formula jankhah 2017 1 l d 0 05 re d h where re is the average reynolds number of flow channel d h is the hydraulic diameter and l d is the desired channel length access to relatively steady state hydrodynamic conditions accordingly specimens were harvested from the scaled membranes between 6 and 8 cm along the flow direction where the regions adjacent to channel wall were also omitted considering the complex flow regime fig s3 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface properties of virgin and modified membranes the main surface properties of cleaned virgin and modified membranes were analyzed in this study by employing different techniques membrane surface morphology was captured by sem fig 2 shows that most modified membranes possessed similar surface structures characterized by ridges and valleys due to the ultrathin coating formed on the membrane surfaces comparable to the virgin membrane in contrast the pda pva modified membrane was thickly coated by polymers which differentiated from other studied membranes the information on membrane surface functionality was collected from the ft ir spectra fig 3 shows that it seems to be difficult to exactly distinguish the subtle changes in the spectra after membrane modification due to masking or overlapping of related absorption bands from the substrate pa membrane compared with ft ir analysis depth 400 500 nm xps is capable of examining the elemental composition of the top surface as deep as 2 10 nm the changes in the c o ratio table s2 supporting information and o 1s binding energy fig s4 supporting information indicated the success in surface modification with the virgin pa membrane as a control it is noteworthy that the exclusive existence of the o 1s peak at 532 49 ev fig s4f supporting information combined with the sem image fig 2f unanimously mirrored that the pda pva modified membrane primarily exhibited the physicochemical properties of polymer coating rather than native membrane surface in particular a new peak at 401 19 ev which is assigned to n element associated with nh2 groups in pah polyelectrolytes duong et al 2013 was observed clearly from high resolution xps scans of n 1s regions fig s5 supporting information in addition the modified membranes exhibited different hydrophilicities and surface charge properties due to the grafting of different compounds comparatively the virgin pa membrane had the most hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 76 6 while all the modified membranes became relative hydrophilic with smaller contact angles fig 4 a amongst the modified membranes the pda pva modified membrane had the most hydrophilic surface with a water contact angle of 33 2 probably because pva polymer had a higher density of polar groups hydroxyl in accordance with its molecular formula table s1 supporting information overall the contact angles of the virgin and the modified membranes followed the order of virgin pah amps pda aa pda pva surface charge can be induced by the protonation or deprotonation of functional groups on the membrane surface fig 4b shows that all membranes were more negatively charged with increasing ph as their zeta potentials decreased monotonously at a ph of 6 3 i e that of the synthetic brackish water used in this study the aa modified membrane showed the lowest zeta potential of 58 mv because the grafted aa monomers rendered membrane surfaces more carboxyl groups in contrast the amps modified membrane had a slightly higher zeta potential of 52 mv than the aa modified membrane table s1 supporting information shows that amps has larger molecular weight and more complex molecular structure than aa accordingly the difference in their modified membranes may be ascribed to the higher steric hindrance of the grafted amps molecular to subsequent monomers which resulted in lower grafting degree than aa unlike amps and aa the introduction of other surface modifiers made the substrate pa membrane less negatively charged in particular the ga crosslinked pah modified membrane showed a zeta potential of 17 mv the highest among the studied membranes fig 4b the importance of ga crosslinking to the pah modified membrane was assessed with an additional stability test conducted under controlled experimental conditions fig s6 supporting information the results clearly demonstrated that in the absence of ga linkage the electrostatic attraction between pah and the pa membrane was insufficient to overcome the shear force induced by the feed stream as the zeta potential of the modified membrane decreased from 22 mv to 12 mv after the stability test in contrast ga crosslinking of the pah modified membrane resulted in a constant zeta potential of 17 mv before and after the test the low and negative zeta potential of the crosslinked pah membrane was a result of the decreased free amine groups due to the cross linking reaction between the aldehyde group of ga and the amine group of pah duong et al 2013 furthermore the pda pva modified membrane exhibited a relatively high zeta potential of 25 mv because the abundant electroneutral hydroxyl groups grafted onto the membrane shielded the native negative surface charges 3 2 permeate flux loss caused by silica scaling as a whole the temporal profiles of permeate flux loss for all the membranes consistently experienced three stages fig 5 at the initial stage the permeate flux loss slowly increased due to the time required for silica species to approach the stable critical size of nucleation shmulevsky et al 2017 after that the flux loss progressed in faster rates due to the formation of sufficient silica nuclei on the membrane surface during the final stage the flux loss for different membranes slowed down and gradually approached plateaus as the effective membrane areas available for silica scaling diminished over time xie and gray 2016 fig 5 also demonstrates that the temporal flux loss profiles exhibited distinct patterns as silica scaling progressed the aa modified membrane had the best resistance to flux decline with a minimum flux loss of 42 3 while the pah modified membrane suffered the most serious flux loss of 64 2 at the conclusion of the experiment the relatively high permeate flux loss of the pah modified membrane is presumably because the hybrid carboxyl amine surface favored heterogeneous silica nucleation as a result of the synergistic effects of adjacent oppositely charged moieties wallace et al 2009 all other modified membranes showed smaller flux losses than the virgin membrane in order to identify the influencing factors for permeate flux loss the experimentally measured flux loss was plotted as functions of water contact angle and surface zeta potential respectively fig 6 a shows that there was not clear correlation between permeate flux loss and contact angle for example the virgin pa membrane and the pda modified membrane had different water contact angles of 76 6 and 51 1 but experienced similar flux losses of 57 3 and 55 6 respectively suggesting that membrane hydrophilicity is not a good predictor for permeate flux loss associated with silica scaling this finding is in line with that reported by tong et al which indicated that silica species could penetrate the bound hydration layer to be adsorbed on the membrane surface tong et al 2017 likewise there was not any explicit correlation between membrane surface charge and flux loss fig 6b for example pda pva and amps modified membranes had different zeta potential of 25 and 53 mv at ph 6 3 respectively but exhibited similar total flux losses of 52 7 and 52 4 respectively however when the pda pva modified membrane was excluded a reasonable correlation was discovered for the remaining membranes adj r 2 0 82 and p 0 02 not shown in fig 4b it appeared that the effectiveness of surface charge in the mitigation of flux loss was specifically limited to similar substrates considering that the pda pva modified membrane intensively exhibited physicochemical properties of the polymer coating as described in section 3 1 additional evidence could be provided by a test for a type of commercially available pa membrane with proprietary coating under similar silica scaling conditions as other membranes modified in this study fig s7 supporting information shows that the membrane had the high zeta potential of 17 mv at ph 6 3 but encountered the lowest flux loss of 35 2 overall although membrane surface charge was identified as an important factor controlling the extent of permeate flux loss the specific relationship between zeta potential and flux loss showed by the pda pva modified membrane inferred that other factors may influence silica scaling as discussed later 3 3 membrane surface properties and silica scaling kinetics resembling sigmoidal growth process of microbes the competition of silica species for active sites on the membrane surface was analogous to the scramble of microbes for limited nutrition it is reasonably assumed that the permeate flux declined with the reduced amounts of active sites due to the formation of the initial scaling layer then the temporal flux loss data could be empirically interpreted by invoking a logistic growth model tsoularis and wallace 2002 uchymiak et al 2008 as follows 2 j l t j l m a x j 0 1 j 0 e r t j 0 where j l t is the fractional flux loss at time t j 0 and j l max are the initial and maximum values for j l and r is an intrinsic model parameter the obtained fitting curves are plotted in fig 5 and the extracted characteristic parameters are summarized in table 1 the goodness and statistically significance of the correlation adj r 2 0 99 p 0 001 implied that the above assumption is reasonable i e the local flux declined as silica species directly bound to the active surface sites on the membranes as illustrated in fig 5 different fitting curves reflected distinct scaling kinetics for the studied membranes which can be attributed to the specific interaction regime between reactive silanol si oh and reciprocal groups on the membrane surface wallace et al found that carboxyl groups had more energetically favorable hydrogen bonding interaction with silica than hydroxyl groups which accelerated the nucleation of amorphous silica wallace et al 2009 however in this work the aa modified membrane consistently kept lower flux losses than the pda pva modified membrane fig 5 suggesting that the surface charge played a more important role in silica scaling than hydrogen bonding besides most of the parameter values quantified in this study table 1 were in agreement with the total flux loss for example the pah and the aa modified membrane took the least and the most time t to reach their maximum flux loss rates r max and eventually resulted in the highest and the lowest total flux losses respectively however this was not always the case due to the complexity of silica scaling process as an example the virgin pa membrane had a moderate t value of 1472 min but suffered the second highest total flux loss of 57 3 indeed silica scaling behavior changed dynamically over the duration of experimentation fig 5 3 4 morphology of silica scaling on different membrane surfaces the morphology of scalant formed on the membranes was visualized by sem eds in this study fig 7 shows that silica scalant spanned the entire surfaces of the studied membranes in a spatially non uniform manner as the original characteristic structures observed on the unused membranes fig 2 disappeared generally speaking the scalant exhibited either a gel like patch pattern e g fig 7a or a particle like pattern e g fig 7c the colored sem eds images further demonstrated that the distribution of silicon highly matched the distribution of scalant on the membranes suggesting that silica was a major component of the scalant on the other hand it is surprising that high silicon content i e silica scaling extent did not necessarily result in severe permeate flux loss as expected for instance the aa modified membrane was slightly colored in response to the minimum flux loss fig 7b inset comparatively the amps modified membrane suffered only moderate flux loss in spite of the higher silica scaling extent fig 7c inset as did the pda pva modified membrane fig 7f inset therefore the scaling layer architecture should have played a role in determining the permeate flux loss it is anticipated that a loose and porous scaling layer would lead to a relatively small hydraulic resistance for water permeation which may be analogous to the coating of polyelectrolytes on ro membranes in the latter case ilyas and coworkers found that coating density exerted greater impacts than thickness on membrane permeability during the assembly process of weak polyelectrolyte multilayers ilyas et al 2017 as such a small but appreciable effect of the add on silica scaling layer on flux loss was probably responsible for the non strict linear correlation between zeta potential and permeate flux loss fig 6b and further explained why permeate flux loss was not positively related to silica scaling extent fig 5 versus fig 7 further scalant characterization was conducted for each membrane by ft ir fig 3 shows that the bands specific to the substrate pa membrane including the characteristic peaks of polysulfone support layer at 1245 1170 and 1151 cm 1 and polyamide active layer 1664 1586 and 1544 cm 1 were noticeably obscured by silica scalants with the appearance of new and prominent peaks at around 1100 1070 cm 1 si o si asymmetric stretching 1014 cm 1 si o stretching and 476 cm 1 o si o deformation neofofistou and demadis 2004 sari and chellam 2017 additional information on the scaling layer was also obtained by xps analysis compared with the unused membranes table s2 supporting information the scaled membranes possessed lower atomic percentages of c and n and a higher percentage of o due to the masking effect of silica scalants table 2 consistent with the eds results fig 7 inset the xps results confirmed that silicon was a major component of the scaling layer moreover the subtle shifts in the binding energy peak near 102 72 ev observed with the membranes were indicative of stable chemical state of si o bond shin et al 2011 from high resolution xps scans of si 2p regions fig s8 supporting information besides ca2 in the scaling layer table 2 is known to form bridges between silica species which probably results in the difficulty in membrane cleaning data not shown as a comparison the information obtained from ft ir analysis did not completely match that from xps for example the intensity of the ir peak near 1014 cm 1 decreased in the order of pda pda pva amps pah virgin aa fig 3 whereas the atomic percentages of silicon decreased in the order of pah amps pda pva pda aa virgin table 2 such discrepancy was attributed to the differences in the analysis depth of the employed techniques and the randomness of silica scaling on the membrane surface similar to the silicon content maps obtained by eds both ft ir and xps results were not competent indicators for the corresponding flux loss in the present study 3 5 silica scaling mechanism theoretically specific types of silica species can only deposit on the relevant surface active sites milne et al 2014 silica species are specifically adsorbed and covalently bond to the membrane surface by subsequent condensation reaction between silanol si oh and reciprocal groups which results in the formation of an initial silica layer and thus the conditioned membrane surface subsequently the silica scaling at the membrane water interface would progress to form an add on silica scaling layer that does not directly interact with membrane surfaces through two routes on the one hand the growing of existing silica species on the membrane surface formed polymers that extend out into the solution phase on the other hand silica species in the bulk solution directly deposited on the initial silica scaling layer both processes involved the interactions between silica species at the membrane water interface and the existing silica species on the initial silica scaling layer experimentally the initial scaling layer formed by direct binding of silica species to the active sites on membrane surfaces was hypothesized as a major contributor to the permeate flux loss this hypothesis was partially supported by the goodness and statistically significance of the correlation obtained by fitting the logistic growth function to the temporal flux loss data fig 5 and table 1 while different analytical techniques figs 3 and 7 and table 2 indirectly demonstrated the extent of flux loss strongly depended on the formation of the initial scaling layer as illustrated in fig 8 ionized silicic acid is formed by the deprotonation of silicic acid polysilicic acid which refers to dimers trimers as well as other oligomers having high acidity and reactivity can be formed by the intermolecular dehydration reaction of silicic acid milne et al 2014 only trimers as a typical example of polysilicic acid are shown and their structures refer to xie and gray 2017 subsequently membrane surface properties dictate the formation of the initial silica scaling layer through three different pathways in the first pathway during their convective transport to membrane surfaces ionized silicic acid or polysilicic acid may be electrostatically repelled by the more negatively charged membranes such as aa modified membrane and carried away by the cross flow of the concentrate stream which reduces silica concentration near the membrane surface and thus silica nucleation kinetics on the contrary the less negatively charged membranes such as pah modified membrane may increase the probability of their deposition on the surface and thus the formation of initial scaling layer in the second pathway due to the high reactivity the existing polysilicic acid may compete with active sites depending on their properties for subsequent silica species in the feed stream thus helping establish a disorder and defective initial silica layer with lowered permeate flux loss finally the third pathway is related to the enhanced homogeneous polymerization of silica species the hydroxyl rich surface such as pda pva modified membrane had a higher liquid solid interfacial energy than the carboxyl rich surface such as aa modified membrane and thus promoted the formation of more polysilicic acid with different structures in the bulk solution xie and gray 2017 subsequently these polysilicic acid clusters may be adsorbed on the membrane surface with their arms or tentacles suspending in the bulk solution thereby forming a scaffold like scaling layer to protect the underneath active sites from being attacked by subsequent silica species it is noteworthy that silica scaling behaviors were attributed to the coupling of various factors rather than a specific mechanism alone and it can be expected that the relative contribution of these mechanisms changes with membrane surface properties as well as temporal and spatial variation of scaling process incidentally as the scaling proceeds the add on silica scaling layer may provide favorable habitats without strong hydrodynamic vortex to physically entrap subsequent silica species regardless of their charge properties which partly avoid the direct contact of them with membrane surface it is puzzled in this study that the scaled membranes exhibited different surface morphologies under similar scaling conditions which appears to be contrary to the diffusion controlled growth model thompson et al 2017 one possible explanation is that the distinct architectures of the scaling layers resulted in different local hydraulics thus causing different mass transfer conditions from the bulk solution to the membrane surface for subsequent silica species when the deposition rates of the incoming silica species were greater than the gel forming rates of existing silica the final scale morphology would exhibit particle like structure and otherwise gel like patch structure as observed by sem fig 7 3 6 implications this study experimentally demonstrated that the surface properties of ro membranes played a predominated role in the silica scaling process during brackish water desalination as manifested by distinct scaling kinetics and morphological diversity of these physicochemical properties membrane surface charge was identified as the dominant factor controlling the formation of initial silica scaling layer which was a primary origin of permeate flux loss however potential side effects caused by high density of negative surface charge should not be discounted for example specific interactions between ca2 and carboxylic groups could aggravate organic fouling and gypsum scaling by establishing intermolecular bridges among organic foulants and inducing the donnan s effect respectively wang et al 2016 tong et al 2017 which may be a challenge for ro membranes with such surface properties to desalinate realistic brackish water in field applications encouragingly the above challenge may be potentially overcome when the membrane surface is thoroughly and delicately designed in this work the pda pva modified membrane despite its possession of less negative surface charge exhibited a low flux loss comparable with the more negatively charged amps modified membrane fig 5 which means that other physicochemical properties such as interfacial energy could take over the dominant role of surface charge in governing silica scaling behavior and dictate the formation of the initial scaling layer that controls the extent of permeate flux loss this finding provided further insights into the design of scaling resistant ro membrane for brackish water desalination however as an important consideration hydraulic conditions could also have a strong influence on mass transfer of silica species and further study is warranted to better understand the relationship between hydraulics and silica scaling behavior on brackish water ro membranes 4 conclusions during ro based brackish water desalination the initial scaling layer formed by direct binding of silica species to the active sites on membrane surfaces was found to be primarily responsible for permeate flux loss membrane surface properties dictated the formation of the initial silica scaling layer possibly through the synthesis of three mechanisms i e electrostatic repulsion competitive adsorption and interfacial energy change the adverse effect of negative surface charge on silica scaling control may be reduced by altering membrane interfacial energy with the introduction of appropriate functional groups considering the dominant effect of the initial silica scale on permeate flux loss the conventional silica scaling extent parameter is not a good indicator for the scaling evaluation as it fails to measure the formation of the initial scaling layer declaration of interests none acknowledgement we would like to thank the three anonymous
