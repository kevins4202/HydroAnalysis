19720,vacuum ultraviolet vuv an efficient and green method to produce hydroxyl radical oh is effective in degrading numerous organic contaminants in aqueous solution here we proposed an effective and simple kinetic model to describe the degradation of organic pollutants in vuv system by taking the oh scavenging effects of formed organic intermediates as co existing organic matter in whole using benzoic acid ba as a oh probe oh was regarded vital for pollutant degradation in vuv system and the thus developed model successfully predicted its degradation kinetics under different conditions effects of typical influencing factors such as ba concentrations and uv intensity were investigated quantitatively by the model temperature was found to be an important influencing factor in the vuv system and the quantum yield of oh showed a positive linear dependence on temperature impacts of humic acid ha alkalinity chloride and water matrices realistic waters on the oxidation efficiency were also examined ba degradation was significantly inhibited by ha due to its scavenging of oh but was influenced much less by the alkalinity and chloride high oxidation efficiency was still obtained in the realistic water the degradation kinetics of three other typical micropollutants including bisphenol a bpa nitrobenzene nb and dimethyl phthalate dmp and the mixture of co existing ba bpa and dmp were further studied and the developed model predicted the experimental data well especially in realistic water it is expected that this study will provide an effective approach to predict the degradation of organic micropollutants by the promising vuv system and broaden the application of vuv system in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords vacuum ultraviolet vuv hydroxyl radical micropollutants kinetic model quantum yield 1 introduction ultraviolet uv photolysis and uv based advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 and uv o3 have been regarded as efficient methods to eliminate organic micropollutants for improving water quality crittenden et al 1999 guan et al 2011 xie et al 2015 zoschke et al 2012 2014 however these uv based aops always require oxidants to achieve a high efficiency in degrading organic pollutants leading to additional treatment of the added chemicals fang et al 2014 he et al 2014 xie et al 2015 vacuum ultraviolet vuv which can produce plenty of reactive species through activation of water molecules may be a promising alternative for this aspect gonzalez et al 2004 the vuv radiation with wavelength ranging from 100 to 200 nm is photo chemically active oppenländer 2003 the vuv photons are strongly absorbed by water molecules causing the homolysis and ionization of water molecules to produce powerfully oxidizing hydroxyl radicals oh through eqs 1 and 2 gonzalez et al 2004 zoschke et al 2012 2014 the vuv process has been used to produce highly reactive species offer sterile air and eliminate organic contaminant such as chlorinated compounds pesticides algal toxins and pharmaceuticals afzal et al 2010 gonzalez et al 2004 jakob et al 1993 kutschera et al 2009 oppenländer 2003 zoschke et al 2012 2014 it has also been considered as an efficient and green method for mineralization of natural organic matter nom and removal of some inorganic ions such as nitrate and arsenic buchanan et al 2005 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 zoschke et al 2014 yoon et al 2008 thus vuv may be a promising method in degrading aquatic micropollutants to utilize the vuv process efficiently and reasonably it is important to propose an effective kinetic model to describe the removal efficiency of pollutants an effective model that involves almost all the important reactions and the degradation of numerous pollutants can help optimize the vuv process several models trying to consider all the possible reactions and radicals have been proposed to fit the process in vuv photo chemical system and to describe the removal of organic pollutants in the system bagheri and mohseni 2014 2017 crapulli et al 2014 imoberdorf and mohseni 2012 however these models did not comprehensively evaluate the impacts of formed intermediates which is not in accordance with the actual situation as the formed intermediates consume reactive radicals in vuv system reactive species such as oh h and e are produced via eqs 1 and 2 and then numerous reactions involving those reactive species will occur in the presence of oxygen and other substrates crapulli et al 2014 gonzalez et al 2004 oppenländer 2003 zoschke et al 2014 furthermore scavengers of reactive species in natural water can also introduce lots of possible reactions which makes the kinetics of pollutant degradation in the vuv system much more complicated fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 actually the degradation of organic pollutants in the vuv system is mainly induced by the formed oh which suggests that lots of reactions would have little influence on the degradation of pollutants oppenländer 2003 consequently it is meaningful to develop a simple and well predicted kinetic model of vuv system to evaluate the removal of organic contaminants in realistic waters by excluding some not relevant reactions but including the scavenging effects of the formed intermediates additionally the effective quantum yields of reactive radicals in some photo induced processes were found to be affected by temperature which would affect the degradation of target pollutants herrmann 2007 li et al 2014 thus it is important to evaluate the influence of temperature in vuv system and set up an effective model which will be also evaluated in this study 1 h 2 o h v 190 nm oh h φ 1 185 nm 0 33 mol einstein 1 2 h 2 o h v 190 nm oh e h φ 2

shown in table s1 supplementary data 2 2 experimental procedures all the photochemical experiments were conducted in a sealed cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor v 600 ml equipped with a 10 w low pressure mercury uv lamp vuv 254 nm 185 nm gph 212t5vh 4 heraeus noblelight and the schematic diagram has been illustrated in our previous studies li et al 2012 2014 xie et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the inner diameter of the cylindrical photoreactor and the outer diameter of quartz tube are 6 5 cm and 2 5 cm respectively unless otherwise noted the photon intensity i 0 entering the solution from the vuv source at 185 nm was calculated to be about 0 153 μeinstein s 1 using a method described in a previous research sun and bolton 1996 details are shown in text s1 and fig s1 the photon intensity was changed by covering copper mesh on the surface of vuv lamp another low pressure mercury uv lamp 10 w gph 212t5l 4 heraeus noblelight only emitting at 254 nm which was expected to have almost the same photon flux at 254 nm 3 difference with the aforementioned vuv lamp was used as a reference the photon intensity i 0 254 nm entering the solution was determined to be around 2 98 μeinstein s 1 using the ki kio3 method li et al 2012 2014 yu et al 2018 the uv intensity at 254 nm in the vuv system was calculated after determining the vuv intensity at 185 nm through assuming the close efficiency on blocking the light transmittance for wavelength at 185 and 254 nm by copper mesh average effective path length l of the uv photon 254 nm transferring into the experimental solution was determined to be about 3 02 cm from the photolysis kinetics of dilute h2o2 temperature was controlled using a thermostat the solution was completely mixed using a magnetic stirrer and phosphate buffer 2 mm was used to adjust ph except for realistic water the uv lamp was ignited at least 20 min to reach the stable output prior to the photolysis experiments each experiment was started timing when the target pollutant ba bpa nb and dmp was added in solution at predetermined time intervals samples were withdrawn for further analysis in the experiments of degradation of co existing pollutants three target pollutants ba bpa and dmp were introduced into the realistic water b together and their respective degradation kinetics in the system were studied all experiments were repeated independently at least twice and the error bars in figures represent the standard deviation among replicates 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of ba bpa nb dmp 2 hba 3 hba and 4 hba were determined by a hplc using a

degradation pathway fig 1 shows ba degradation in uv254 and vuv systems at ph 7 0 compared with degradation rate of about 8 2 within 14 5 min by irradiation at 254 nm about 94 8 of ba was removed in vuv system the results suggest the dominant contributions of vuv and the resulting reactive species to the ba degradation it is noted that some organic pollutants undergo efficient direct photolysis under uv irradiation at 254 nm fang et al 2013 pereira et al 2007 so the direct photolysis of micropollutants should be taken into consideration in modeling the degradation kinetics of pollutants in the vuv system as for the vuv photons at 185 nm the molar absorption coefficient of water is 0 032 m 1 cm 1 zoschke et al 2012 2014 the concentration of water molecules is about 55 m and its absorbance at 185 nm is about 1 75 cm 1 thus it is expected that those vuv photons are almost completely absorbed by water and that direct photolysis of pollutants excited by vuv light should be negligible although dissociation of water forms h and eaq which react with oxygen to form ho2 and o2 through eqs 3 and 4 respectively the contributions of these reactive species to the degradation of organic pollutants would be negligible owing to their low reactivity or fast scavenging by oxygen gonzalez et al 2004 zoschke et al 2014 kutschera et al 2009 negligible influence of oxygen on the ba degradation as shown in fig s2 suggests that the contributions of reactive species including h eaq ho2 and o2 to ba degradation can be ignored in the vuv system furthermore tba a common oh scavenger markedly inhibited the removal of ba as shown in fig s3 supporting that oh was responsible for the ba degradation in the vuv system eq 5 the ba degradation in the presence of tba was still a bit faster than the direct photolysis via eq 6 fig s4 and text s4 this may be caused by the low oh concentration remaining in the system even if a quite high concentration of tba is present some oh would be detected and react with target pollutants xie et al 2015 consequently oh was regarded as the vital radical accounting for the degradation of organic pollutants in the vuv system 3 h o 2 ho 2 k 3 1

steady state assumption fig s5 the kinetic model is established by assuming that the degradation of target compounds proceeds via the direct photolysis and oxidation by oh in the vuv system taking into account the scavenging of oh by organic intermediates eq 7 and 8 and inorganic ions e g phosphate in eqs 9 and 10 the rate of oh production r oh m s 1 the rate of oh consumption r oh m s 1 the rate of direct photolysis of target compound r m s 1 and the degradation kinetics of target compounds in the vuv system can be expressed by eq 11 14 11 r oh φ i 0 v 12 r oh k c c oh ss k s i s i oh ss 13 r ϕ i 0 ε l 1 10 a a v c 14 d c d t k c oh ss c r where i 0 einstein s 1 and i 0 einstein s 1 are the photons intensity at 185 nm and 254 nm respectively v l is the solution volume t s is the reaction time φ around 0 33 mol einstein 1 at 25 c is the quantum yield of oh via eq 1 gonzalez et al 2004 ϕ is the quantum yield of direct photolysis of target compound oh ss m is the steady state concentration of oh c and si m are the real time concentrations of target compounds and scavengers respectively k c m 1 s 1 and k si are the reaction rate constants for oh reacting with target compounds and scavengers respectively ε m 1 cm 1 is the extinction coefficient of target compound l cm is the effective path length and a is the absorption of solution at 254 nm the degradation rate of target compound can be further illustrated in eq 15 by combining eqs 13 and 14 15 d c d t k c oh ss ϕ i 0 ε l 1 10 a a v c k obs c where k obs s 1 is the observed first order rate constant although self recombination of oh to formed h2o2 might have occurred in the vuv system bagheri and mohseni 2014 this reaction would be ignored in the presence of organic compounds text s5 furthermore φ for eq 1 in the vuv system is not influenced by solution ph gonzalez et al 2004 thus the degradation of organic compounds in the vuv system should be little affected by reaction ph as shown in fig s6 so reaction ph 11 was not concerned in the proposed kinetic model here along with the oxidation of target compounds some primary products would be subsequently oxidized to numerous intermediates by oh via eq 5 7 as electrophilic substitution is always the primary reaction when oh reacts with ba klein et al 1975 three hydroxybenzoic acids hba including 2 hba 3 hba and 4 hba were detected during the oxidation of ba in the vuv system fig s7 all the three kinds of hbas were accumulated within the first 7 min but the sum of the three hbas was much less than the removed ba this indicated that the formed primary products are quickly oxidized to other intermediates which consume oh and act as oh scavengers thus it is necessary to take into consideration the influence of these intermediates in the kinetic model of organic pollutants degradation by the vuv system however the kinetic model would become very complex or even unprocurable with containing all the reactions between oh and the intermediates due to the fact that there are numerous intermediates whose reaction rate constants for reacting with oh are currently unknown to solve this problem we divided all the possible intermediates and final products into organic and final inorganic groups based on the fact that oh can unselectively mineralize organic compounds with the reaction rate constants ranging from 1 21 108 to 9 37 108 mcarbon 1 s 1 in terms of organic carbon mckay et al 2011 then the reactions between oh and the intermediates can be approximately expressed as eq 8 assuming steady state then the steady state concentration of oh can be expressed as eq 16 by incorporating eqs 11 and 12 16 oh ss φ i 0 v k c c σ k pi p i σ k si s i φ i 0 v k c c k 8 toc in σ k si s i where pi and k pi are the concentrations of intermediates and the corresponding reaction rate constant with oh k 8 is the reaction rate constant between organic intermediates and oh and tocin is the concentration of organic intermediates in terms of toc as shown in fig s8 the concentration of toc decreased by 7 2 and 26 7 within 15 min and 30 min respectively during the ba degradation in the vuv system suggesting that the mineralization efficiency was much lower than that of ba degradation fig 1 due to the quite low depletion of toc during the treatment of ba within the first 15 min the concentration of toc was supposed to be stable in the proposed kinetic model so the observed rate constant can be expressed as eq 17 through the integration of eqs 15 and 16 17 k obs k c φ i 0 v k c n k 8 c n k 8 c 0 σ k si si ϕ i 0 ε l 1 10 a a v where n is the number of carbon atoms contained in the molecular structure of target compound and c 0 is the initial concentration of target compound assuming k cφi 0 v a ϕi 0 εl 1 10 a av b k c nk 8 e and nk 8 c 0 k si si f the degradation of target compounds as a function of time can be further expressed as eq 18 18 a a b f b ln a b f b e c 0 a b f b e c f a b f ln c 0 c t for compounds which undergo very slow direct photolysis compared with the fast oh initiated oxidation the contribution of direct photolysis to the overall degradation can be ignored when proposing the kinetic model this strongly depends on the compounds involved then the observed rate constant and the degradation of these target compounds as a function of time can be further expressed as eqs 19 and 20 respectively it is noted that φ of oh production during the photolysis of water molecules is affected by temperature in the vuv system thus the temperature dependency should be taken into account in the model more discussion in the following section 19 k obs k c φ i 0 v k c n k 8 c n k 8 c 0 σ k si si 20 v k c n k 8 k c φ i 0 c 0 c v n k 8 c 0 σ k si si k c φ i 0 ln c 0 c t 3 2 effects of typical factors 3 2 1 degradation kinetics of ba with different initial concentration fig 1 shows the ba degradation with different initial concentration and the model prediction the ba degradation decreases with increasing the initial ba concentration as shown in eq 16 the production rate of oh is constant but the consumption rate increases with increasing concentration of ba and the formed intermediates thus steady state concentration of oh decreases with increasing ba concentration leading to decreased ba degradation no other scavengers were introduced into the vuv system and thus only h2po4 and hpo4 2 pk a1 2 1 pk a2 7 2 and pk a3 12 3 via eqs 9 and 10 were analyzed as scavengers of oh in the kinetic model the reaction rate constant between oh and the organic intermediates was estimated to be about 4 0 108 mcarbon 1 s 1 fig s9 the thus developed model in eq 18 can overall fit the experimental data with different initial ba concentrations the small overprediction of ba degradation may be due to the dependence of the reaction rate constant k 8 between oh and the organic intermediates on their sources and compositions mckay et al 2011 additionally the estimation of the observed rate constant was also conducted as shown in inset of the fig 1 good fit between the experimental data and the modeling prediction using eq 17 was also achieved further supporting the validity of the proposed model 3 2 2 effects of photons intensity fig 2 shows the effect of vuv intensity on the degradation of ba in the vuv system when vuv intensity 185 nm increased from 0 072 μeinstein s 1 to 0 153 μeinstein s 1 the removal of ba increased from 68 7 to 94 8 the model in eq 18 also predicts ba degradation well under different photons intensity 3 2 3 effects of temperature an obvious acceleration of ba degradation was observed by elevating the reaction temperature from 12 c to 35 c in the vuv system but little influence of temperature on the direct photolysis of ba was observed fig s10 so the acceleration of ba degradation by increasing temperature should result from the enhanced attack by oh in the vuv system it is noted that the solution did not contact with lamp directly in this study the temperature of the lamp almost kept stable 2 c with solution temperature ranging from 12 c to 35 c and thus the output of lamp should not be affected generally the effective quantum yield of reactive radical is determined by the prompt quantum yield of these reactive radicals and the fraction that can escape from the solvent cage herrmann 2007 li et al 2014 due to the reduction of water viscosity and the improvement of diffusion controlled dissociation of the photo fragments at higher temperature a positive correlation between the quantum yield of reactive radicals and temperature would be reasonably proposed herrmann 2007 li et al 2014 thus the promotion of ba degradation by boosting temperature was probably due to the increased quantum yield of oh through the photolysis of water by vuv eq 1 to gain more insight into the temperature dependence of the rate constants arrhenius equation was used to fit the calculated k obs fig 3 a shows plots of ln k obs versus 1 t indicating a good fit to the arrhenius equation with the apparent activation energy e a of about 32 5 kj mol 1 as discussed above the quantum yield of oh varies with temperature based on the steady state assumption k obs is a function of φ as shown in eq 17 in order to minimize variation of k obs arising from the low concentration of target compound the concentrations of ba at 0 0 5 min and 1 0 min fig s10 were chosen to calculate the quantum yield of oh through eq 17 the relationship between quantum yield of oh and temperature is shown in fig 3b a positive linear dependency of quantum yield on temperature was observed with the slope of about 1 27 10 2 k 1 the linear relationship can be described in eq 21 such a similar positive linear dependence of the quantum yield on temperature was also reported in the photolysis of oh 3 10 3 k 1 i 1 5 10 2 k 1 and so3 2 3 68 10 3 k 1 crowell et al 2004 li et al 2014 rahn 1997 the quantum yield of oh was calculated to be about 0 32 mol einstein 1 at 25 c agreeing with the previous reported value of 0 33 mol einstein 1 gonzalez et al 2004 thus eq 21 is incorporated into eqs 18 and 20 and a better applicability of the model will be achieved especially for the cases at different temperature 21 φ 3 469 0 01271 t 3 2 4 effects of alkalinity bicarbonate carbonate can compete for numerous reactive radicals and should be considered in kinetic models of aops crittenden et al 1999 2005 fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 although hco3 and co3 2 react with oh to produce carbonate radical co3 through eqs 22 and 23 the oxidation of organic micropollutants by the formed co3 would not be included in the proposed kinetic model due to the weak oxidizing reactivity of co3 crittenden et al 1999 fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 22 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o k 22 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 23 co 3 2 oh co 3 oh k 23 4 10 8 m 1 s 1 different concentrations of bicarbonate carbonate were used to study the effect of alkalinity on the degradation of ba in vuv system and the ba degradation is expressed using eq 18 by including bicarbonate and phosphate as scavengers as shown in fig 4 the degradation of ba only decreased a little with the dosage of bicarbonate increasing from 0 to 2 mm although the predicted value of ba degradation rate achieved from the proposed model was a little higher than the experimental data the modeling prediction was in accordance with the overall trend of the experimental data although bicarbonate is always considered as an efficient scavenger of reactive radicals in aops fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 chen et al 2017 the small inhibition of ba degradation might be due to the fact that the value of k 5 ba 0 2 36 105 s 1 was much higher than that of k 22 hco3 0 1 7 104 s 1 with 2 mm bicarbonate it should be noted that numerous organic pollutants are usually detected as low as μg l which is much lower than the concentration of bicarbonate in natural waters crittenden et al 2005 thus alkalinity should be regarded as an important scavenging factor in the application of vuv systems to degrade aqueous organic pollutants 3 2 5 effects of nom the ubiquitous nom always inhibits the degradation of organic pollutants in uv based aops through the filtering effect on photons and the scavenging effect on reactive radicals fang et al 2014 li et al 2014 xie et al 2015 ha was selected as the reference nom in this study to investigate its impact on ba degradation in vuv systems fig 5 shows that the degradation of ba was significantly influenced by the presence of ha in the vuv system when the concentration of ha increased from 0 to 5 mg l measured as toc the degradation rate of ba slowed down significantly previous reports offered various reaction rate constants between oh and nom with a widely used value of 3 108 mcarbon 1 s 1 mckay et al 2011 hoigné 1998 then a kinetic model expressed as eq 18 by including ha and phosphate as scavengers can be used to predict ba degradation although some reactive species such as singlet oxygen might be produced through the activation of nom and then contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants the formed reactive species was not considered in this study due to the rather low quantum yields of those species latch and mcneill 2006 zhang and hsu kim 2010 as aforementioned discussion almost all the photons at 185 nm would be absorbed by water and thus the filtering effect of nom on the photons at 185 nm was not integrated in the kinetic model a molar absorption coefficient of 0 042 mg c l 1 cm 1 measured as toc at 254 nm was obtained for ha used here so ha will also act as an inner filter to slow down the direct photolysis rate of ba eq 13 there is a good accordance between the model prediction and experimental data fig 5 validating the important role of nom as screener and scavenger in the vuv system 3 3 ba degradation in realistic water degradation of ba in realistic water sample a table s1 was investigated to quantitatively elucidate the influence of water matrix on efficiency fig 6 a shows that ba in realistic water was efficiently degraded by the vuv system but the degradation rate decreased compared with that in pure water fig 1 this is mainly attributed to the scavenging of oh by nom carbonate bicarbonate etc based on the aforementioned discussions nom and carbonate bicarbonate can consume oh and thus their scavenging effects should be included in the kinetic model the fast reactions between oh and chloride produce a sequence of chlorine containing radicals which may also degrade organic pollutants fang et al 2014 offering a complicated oxidation system to degrade organic pollutants in fact a negligible impact of chloride 0 3 mm on ba degradation was observed fig s11 in vuv system as the concentration in the real water sample a was about 0 24 mm table s1 the effect of chloride was ignored in the kinetic model thus a kinetic model expressed as eq 18 by including nom and bicarbonate carbonate species as scavengers was constructed to predict ba degradation the model well fitted the experimental data fig 6a compared with the results shown in figs 1 and 6a the predicting efficacy of the proposed model in eq 18 is even better in realistic water than that in pure water validating the applicability of the kinetic model under realistic water matrices in the vuv system 3 4 model prediction for degradation of typical organic micropollutants bpa nb and dmp were selected as target compounds to further evaluate the applicability of the constructed kinetic model in vuv system the three organic micropollutants were expected to be efficiently degraded by vuv system due to their fast reactions with oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 and 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 respectively and direct photolysis via eq 24 29 bandy et al 2009 buxton et al 1988 hizal et al 1993 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 xu et al 2009 fig 6b 6d show the degradation and model prediction of bpa dmp and nb in pure water and realistic water a by vuv system high degradation efficiencies were achieved for all the three organic pollutants in either phosphate buffered solution or realistic water the degradation of bpa dmp and nb was about 98 9 96 3 and 93 6 respectively within 4 min in pure water while much lower efficiencies of about 97 5 86 9 and 79 3 respectively within 10 min were observed in the realistic water it may be caused by the co existed oh scavengers such as nom in the realistic water it is noted that bpa dmp and nb undergoes very slow direct photolysis with degradation rate of about 4 5 1 7 and 7 3 respectively within 15 min fig s4 24 bpa oh products 1 k 24 1 02 10 10 m 1 s 1 25 bpa h v 254 nm products 1 φ bpa 8 5 10 3 mol einsteim 1 26 nb oh products 1

in eq 18 predicts the degradation of bpa and dmp in pure water and realistic water well fig 6b and c while there is a significant discrepancy between the predicted results and the experimental data for nb degradation in pure water a better prediction in realistic water fig 6d it should be noted that only organic intermediates were considered as the scavengers in the constructed kinetic models the inorganic products were treated as final products without further reacting with oh however the detachment of nitro groups a vital pathway for the degradation of nitro compounds in aops generally produces nitrite ions which can compete for oh fiercely and possibly slow down the degradation rate of nb zhao et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 additionally the characteristics and components of organic matter can affect the reaction rate constant between organic matter and oh mckay et al 2011 a number of nitro containing intermediates would be produced during the degradation of nb subsequently might offer a different reaction rate constant between oh and the organic intermediates vione et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 thus an obvious discrepancy between the model prediction and experimental results in pure water was observed the results suggest that the constructed model should be modified by including the scavenging effects of both organic and inorganic intermediates e g nitrite and nitro containing intermediates which are formed significantly and compete fast for oh when treating nitrogen containing compounds from fig 6d much better model prediction of nb degradation in realistic water was obtained compared to that in the pure water this may be attributed to the much smaller oh scavenging effects of the nitrite ions which are formed during the degradation of nb nb 0 5 μm in vuv system than that of nom and carbonate bicarbonate ions in the realistic water 3 5 model prediction for the degradation of co existing organic pollutants as the co existence of several organic micropollutants is common in realistic waters the kinetic model was further studied to predict the degradation of the co existing organic micropollutants when evaluating one selected target compound the other co existing organic pollutants and their derived organic intermediates were treated as scavengers of oh in the kinetic model we also divided the other co existing organic pollutants and their derived intermediates into organic and final inorganic groups using a mineralization rate constant of 3 108 mcarbon 1 s 1 hoigné 1998 fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 three co existing organic micropollutants including ba bpa and dmp were selected to evaluate the applicability of the constructed model as shown in fig 7 a and b all the three co existing organic pollutants are efficiently degraded in pure water and realistic water b kinetic model in eq 18 was used to evaluate the degradation of ba bpa and dmp although a little discrepancy was observed the degradation of all the three organic pollutants could be still well predicted by the constructed model in both pure water and realistic water suggesting the reliability of the constructed model in the vuv system 4 conclusions a kinetic model was proposed to predict the degradation of organic pollutants in the vuv system by treating the scavenging effects of intermediate products as co existing organic matter surrogate selecting ba as the model compound the applicability of the kinetic model was tested under different conditions the model developed predicted ba degradation well in pure water and realistic waters by vuv system it was concluded that oh played the most important role in the removal of organic micropollutants in the vuv system effects of initial ba concentration photons intensity temperature bicarbonate carbonate ha and realistic water matrices were examined quantitatively by the model efficiency of vuv system increased significantly with elevating temperature and a positive linear dependence of quantum yield of oh on temperature was found nom was the most important inhibiting factor in the vuv system while carbonate bicarbonate and chloride showed much smaller influence the developed kinetic model was feasible in predicting the degradation of bpa nb and dmp in realistic water furthermore the model also well predicted the degradation of co existing organic micropollutants ba bpa and dmp supporting the applicability of the constructed kinetic model in the vuv system this study develops an effective kinetic model to help predict the degradation of a wide variety of organic pollutants in the vuv system and thus will broaden the scope of the study on vuv system the applicability of the vuv process for water treatment is limited due to the low penetration depth and the efficiency is also dependent on the efficient diffusion of radicals generated and reactor design further study on the effects of operational conditions such as hydraulics vuv fluence distribution and reactor configurations on the efficiency is needed to optimize the vuv system acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grants 51608215 and

19720,vacuum ultraviolet vuv an efficient and green method to produce hydroxyl radical oh is effective in degrading numerous organic contaminants in aqueous solution here we proposed an effective and simple kinetic model to describe the degradation of organic pollutants in vuv system by taking the oh scavenging effects of formed organic intermediates as co existing organic matter in whole using benzoic acid ba as a oh probe oh was regarded vital for pollutant degradation in vuv system and the thus developed model successfully predicted its degradation kinetics under different conditions effects of typical influencing factors such as ba concentrations and uv intensity were investigated quantitatively by the model temperature was found to be an important influencing factor in the vuv system and the quantum yield of oh showed a positive linear dependence on temperature impacts of humic acid ha alkalinity chloride and water matrices realistic waters on the oxidation efficiency were also examined ba degradation was significantly inhibited by ha due to its scavenging of oh but was influenced much less by the alkalinity and chloride high oxidation efficiency was still obtained in the realistic water the degradation kinetics of three other typical micropollutants including bisphenol a bpa nitrobenzene nb and dimethyl phthalate dmp and the mixture of co existing ba bpa and dmp were further studied and the developed model predicted the experimental data well especially in realistic water it is expected that this study will provide an effective approach to predict the degradation of organic micropollutants by the promising vuv system and broaden the application of vuv system in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords vacuum ultraviolet vuv hydroxyl radical micropollutants kinetic model quantum yield 1 introduction ultraviolet uv photolysis and uv based advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv h2o2 uv s2o8 2 and uv o3 have been regarded as efficient methods to eliminate organic micropollutants for improving water quality crittenden et al 1999 guan et al 2011 xie et al 2015 zoschke et al 2012 2014 however these uv based aops always require oxidants to achieve a high efficiency in degrading organic pollutants leading to additional treatment of the added chemicals fang et al 2014 he et al 2014 xie et al 2015 vacuum ultraviolet vuv which can produce plenty of reactive species through activation of water molecules may be a promising alternative for this aspect gonzalez et al 2004 the vuv radiation with wavelength ranging from 100 to 200 nm is photo chemically active oppenländer 2003 the vuv photons are strongly absorbed by water molecules causing the homolysis and ionization of water molecules to produce powerfully oxidizing hydroxyl radicals oh through eqs 1 and 2 gonzalez et al 2004 zoschke et al 2012 2014 the vuv process has been used to produce highly reactive species offer sterile air and eliminate organic contaminant such as chlorinated compounds pesticides algal toxins and pharmaceuticals afzal et al 2010 gonzalez et al 2004 jakob et al 1993 kutschera et al 2009 oppenländer 2003 zoschke et al 2012 2014 it has also been considered as an efficient and green method for mineralization of natural organic matter nom and removal of some inorganic ions such as nitrate and arsenic buchanan et al 2005 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 zoschke et al 2014 yoon et al 2008 thus vuv may be a promising method in degrading aquatic micropollutants to utilize the vuv process efficiently and reasonably it is important to propose an effective kinetic model to describe the removal efficiency of pollutants an effective model that involves almost all the important reactions and the degradation of numerous pollutants can help optimize the vuv process several models trying to consider all the possible reactions and radicals have been proposed to fit the process in vuv photo chemical system and to describe the removal of organic pollutants in the system bagheri and mohseni 2014 2017 crapulli et al 2014 imoberdorf and mohseni 2012 however these models did not comprehensively evaluate the impacts of formed intermediates which is not in accordance with the actual situation as the formed intermediates consume reactive radicals in vuv system reactive species such as oh h and e are produced via eqs 1 and 2 and then numerous reactions involving those reactive species will occur in the presence of oxygen and other substrates crapulli et al 2014 gonzalez et al 2004 oppenländer 2003 zoschke et al 2014 furthermore scavengers of reactive species in natural water can also introduce lots of possible reactions which makes the kinetics of pollutant degradation in the vuv system much more complicated fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 actually the degradation of organic pollutants in the vuv system is mainly induced by the formed oh which suggests that lots of reactions would have little influence on the degradation of pollutants oppenländer 2003 consequently it is meaningful to develop a simple and well predicted kinetic model of vuv system to evaluate the removal of organic contaminants in realistic waters by excluding some not relevant reactions but including the scavenging effects of the formed intermediates additionally the effective quantum yields of reactive radicals in some photo induced processes were found to be affected by temperature which would affect the degradation of target pollutants herrmann 2007 li et al 2014 thus it is important to evaluate the influence of temperature in vuv system and set up an effective model which will be also evaluated in this study 1 h 2 o h v 190 nm oh h φ 1 185 nm 0 33 mol einstein 1 2 h 2 o h v 190 nm oh e h φ 2

shown in table s1 supplementary data 2 2 experimental procedures all the photochemical experiments were conducted in a sealed cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor v 600 ml equipped with a 10 w low pressure mercury uv lamp vuv 254 nm 185 nm gph 212t5vh 4 heraeus noblelight and the schematic diagram has been illustrated in our previous studies li et al 2012 2014 xie et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the inner diameter of the cylindrical photoreactor and the outer diameter of quartz tube are 6 5 cm and 2 5 cm respectively unless otherwise noted the photon intensity i 0 entering the solution from the vuv source at 185 nm was calculated to be about 0 153 μeinstein s 1 using a method described in a previous research sun and bolton 1996 details are shown in text s1 and fig s1 the photon intensity was changed by covering copper mesh on the surface of vuv lamp another low pressure mercury uv lamp 10 w gph 212t5l 4 heraeus noblelight only emitting at 254 nm which was expected to have almost the same photon flux at 254 nm 3 difference with the aforementioned vuv lamp was used as a reference the photon intensity i 0 254 nm entering the solution was determined to be around 2 98 μeinstein s 1 using the ki kio3 method li et al 2012 2014 yu et al 2018 the uv intensity at 254 nm in the vuv system was calculated after determining the vuv intensity at 185 nm through assuming the close efficiency on blocking the light transmittance for wavelength at 185 and 254 nm by copper mesh average effective path length l of the uv photon 254 nm transferring into the experimental solution was determined to be about 3 02 cm from the photolysis kinetics of dilute h2o2 temperature was controlled using a thermostat the solution was completely mixed using a magnetic stirrer and phosphate buffer 2 mm was used to adjust ph except for realistic water the uv lamp was ignited at least 20 min to reach the stable output prior to the photolysis experiments each experiment was started timing when the target pollutant ba bpa nb and dmp was added in solution at predetermined time intervals samples were withdrawn for further analysis in the experiments of degradation of co existing pollutants three target pollutants ba bpa and dmp were introduced into the realistic water b together and their respective degradation kinetics in the system were studied all experiments were repeated independently at least twice and the error bars in figures represent the standard deviation among replicates 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of ba bpa nb dmp 2 hba 3 hba and 4 hba were determined by a hplc using a

degradation pathway fig 1 shows ba degradation in uv254 and vuv systems at ph 7 0 compared with degradation rate of about 8 2 within 14 5 min by irradiation at 254 nm about 94 8 of ba was removed in vuv system the results suggest the dominant contributions of vuv and the resulting reactive species to the ba degradation it is noted that some organic pollutants undergo efficient direct photolysis under uv irradiation at 254 nm fang et al 2013 pereira et al 2007 so the direct photolysis of micropollutants should be taken into consideration in modeling the degradation kinetics of pollutants in the vuv system as for the vuv photons at 185 nm the molar absorption coefficient of water is 0 032 m 1 cm 1 zoschke et al 2012 2014 the concentration of water molecules is about 55 m and its absorbance at 185 nm is about 1 75 cm 1 thus it is expected that those vuv photons are almost completely absorbed by water and that direct photolysis of pollutants excited by vuv light should be negligible although dissociation of water forms h and eaq which react with oxygen to form ho2 and o2 through eqs 3 and 4 respectively the contributions of these reactive species to the degradation of organic pollutants would be negligible owing to their low reactivity or fast scavenging by oxygen gonzalez et al 2004 zoschke et al 2014 kutschera et al 2009 negligible influence of oxygen on the ba degradation as shown in fig s2 suggests that the contributions of reactive species including h eaq ho2 and o2 to ba degradation can be ignored in the vuv system furthermore tba a common oh scavenger markedly inhibited the removal of ba as shown in fig s3 supporting that oh was responsible for the ba degradation in the vuv system eq 5 the ba degradation in the presence of tba was still a bit faster than the direct photolysis via eq 6 fig s4 and text s4 this may be caused by the low oh concentration remaining in the system even if a quite high concentration of tba is present some oh would be detected and react with target pollutants xie et al 2015 consequently oh was regarded as the vital radical accounting for the degradation of organic pollutants in the vuv system 3 h o 2 ho 2 k 3 1

steady state assumption fig s5 the kinetic model is established by assuming that the degradation of target compounds proceeds via the direct photolysis and oxidation by oh in the vuv system taking into account the scavenging of oh by organic intermediates eq 7 and 8 and inorganic ions e g phosphate in eqs 9 and 10 the rate of oh production r oh m s 1 the rate of oh consumption r oh m s 1 the rate of direct photolysis of target compound r m s 1 and the degradation kinetics of target compounds in the vuv system can be expressed by eq 11 14 11 r oh φ i 0 v 12 r oh k c c oh ss k s i s i oh ss 13 r ϕ i 0 ε l 1 10 a a v c 14 d c d t k c oh ss c r where i 0 einstein s 1 and i 0 einstein s 1 are the photons intensity at 185 nm and 254 nm respectively v l is the solution volume t s is the reaction time φ around 0 33 mol einstein 1 at 25 c is the quantum yield of oh via eq 1 gonzalez et al 2004 ϕ is the quantum yield of direct photolysis of target compound oh ss m is the steady state concentration of oh c and si m are the real time concentrations of target compounds and scavengers respectively k c m 1 s 1 and k si are the reaction rate constants for oh reacting with target compounds and scavengers respectively ε m 1 cm 1 is the extinction coefficient of target compound l cm is the effective path length and a is the absorption of solution at 254 nm the degradation rate of target compound can be further illustrated in eq 15 by combining eqs 13 and 14 15 d c d t k c oh ss ϕ i 0 ε l 1 10 a a v c k obs c where k obs s 1 is the observed first order rate constant although self recombination of oh to formed h2o2 might have occurred in the vuv system bagheri and mohseni 2014 this reaction would be ignored in the presence of organic compounds text s5 furthermore φ for eq 1 in the vuv system is not influenced by solution ph gonzalez et al 2004 thus the degradation of organic compounds in the vuv system should be little affected by reaction ph as shown in fig s6 so reaction ph 11 was not concerned in the proposed kinetic model here along with the oxidation of target compounds some primary products would be subsequently oxidized to numerous intermediates by oh via eq 5 7 as electrophilic substitution is always the primary reaction when oh reacts with ba klein et al 1975 three hydroxybenzoic acids hba including 2 hba 3 hba and 4 hba were detected during the oxidation of ba in the vuv system fig s7 all the three kinds of hbas were accumulated within the first 7 min but the sum of the three hbas was much less than the removed ba this indicated that the formed primary products are quickly oxidized to other intermediates which consume oh and act as oh scavengers thus it is necessary to take into consideration the influence of these intermediates in the kinetic model of organic pollutants degradation by the vuv system however the kinetic model would become very complex or even unprocurable with containing all the reactions between oh and the intermediates due to the fact that there are numerous intermediates whose reaction rate constants for reacting with oh are currently unknown to solve this problem we divided all the possible intermediates and final products into organic and final inorganic groups based on the fact that oh can unselectively mineralize organic compounds with the reaction rate constants ranging from 1 21 108 to 9 37 108 mcarbon 1 s 1 in terms of organic carbon mckay et al 2011 then the reactions between oh and the intermediates can be approximately expressed as eq 8 assuming steady state then the steady state concentration of oh can be expressed as eq 16 by incorporating eqs 11 and 12 16 oh ss φ i 0 v k c c σ k pi p i σ k si s i φ i 0 v k c c k 8 toc in σ k si s i where pi and k pi are the concentrations of intermediates and the corresponding reaction rate constant with oh k 8 is the reaction rate constant between organic intermediates and oh and tocin is the concentration of organic intermediates in terms of toc as shown in fig s8 the concentration of toc decreased by 7 2 and 26 7 within 15 min and 30 min respectively during the ba degradation in the vuv system suggesting that the mineralization efficiency was much lower than that of ba degradation fig 1 due to the quite low depletion of toc during the treatment of ba within the first 15 min the concentration of toc was supposed to be stable in the proposed kinetic model so the observed rate constant can be expressed as eq 17 through the integration of eqs 15 and 16 17 k obs k c φ i 0 v k c n k 8 c n k 8 c 0 σ k si si ϕ i 0 ε l 1 10 a a v where n is the number of carbon atoms contained in the molecular structure of target compound and c 0 is the initial concentration of target compound assuming k cφi 0 v a ϕi 0 εl 1 10 a av b k c nk 8 e and nk 8 c 0 k si si f the degradation of target compounds as a function of time can be further expressed as eq 18 18 a a b f b ln a b f b e c 0 a b f b e c f a b f ln c 0 c t for compounds which undergo very slow direct photolysis compared with the fast oh initiated oxidation the contribution of direct photolysis to the overall degradation can be ignored when proposing the kinetic model this strongly depends on the compounds involved then the observed rate constant and the degradation of these target compounds as a function of time can be further expressed as eqs 19 and 20 respectively it is noted that φ of oh production during the photolysis of water molecules is affected by temperature in the vuv system thus the temperature dependency should be taken into account in the model more discussion in the following section 19 k obs k c φ i 0 v k c n k 8 c n k 8 c 0 σ k si si 20 v k c n k 8 k c φ i 0 c 0 c v n k 8 c 0 σ k si si k c φ i 0 ln c 0 c t 3 2 effects of typical factors 3 2 1 degradation kinetics of ba with different initial concentration fig 1 shows the ba degradation with different initial concentration and the model prediction the ba degradation decreases with increasing the initial ba concentration as shown in eq 16 the production rate of oh is constant but the consumption rate increases with increasing concentration of ba and the formed intermediates thus steady state concentration of oh decreases with increasing ba concentration leading to decreased ba degradation no other scavengers were introduced into the vuv system and thus only h2po4 and hpo4 2 pk a1 2 1 pk a2 7 2 and pk a3 12 3 via eqs 9 and 10 were analyzed as scavengers of oh in the kinetic model the reaction rate constant between oh and the organic intermediates was estimated to be about 4 0 108 mcarbon 1 s 1 fig s9 the thus developed model in eq 18 can overall fit the experimental data with different initial ba concentrations the small overprediction of ba degradation may be due to the dependence of the reaction rate constant k 8 between oh and the organic intermediates on their sources and compositions mckay et al 2011 additionally the estimation of the observed rate constant was also conducted as shown in inset of the fig 1 good fit between the experimental data and the modeling prediction using eq 17 was also achieved further supporting the validity of the proposed model 3 2 2 effects of photons intensity fig 2 shows the effect of vuv intensity on the degradation of ba in the vuv system when vuv intensity 185 nm increased from 0 072 μeinstein s 1 to 0 153 μeinstein s 1 the removal of ba increased from 68 7 to 94 8 the model in eq 18 also predicts ba degradation well under different photons intensity 3 2 3 effects of temperature an obvious acceleration of ba degradation was observed by elevating the reaction temperature from 12 c to 35 c in the vuv system but little influence of temperature on the direct photolysis of ba was observed fig s10 so the acceleration of ba degradation by increasing temperature should result from the enhanced attack by oh in the vuv system it is noted that the solution did not contact with lamp directly in this study the temperature of the lamp almost kept stable 2 c with solution temperature ranging from 12 c to 35 c and thus the output of lamp should not be affected generally the effective quantum yield of reactive radical is determined by the prompt quantum yield of these reactive radicals and the fraction that can escape from the solvent cage herrmann 2007 li et al 2014 due to the reduction of water viscosity and the improvement of diffusion controlled dissociation of the photo fragments at higher temperature a positive correlation between the quantum yield of reactive radicals and temperature would be reasonably proposed herrmann 2007 li et al 2014 thus the promotion of ba degradation by boosting temperature was probably due to the increased quantum yield of oh through the photolysis of water by vuv eq 1 to gain more insight into the temperature dependence of the rate constants arrhenius equation was used to fit the calculated k obs fig 3 a shows plots of ln k obs versus 1 t indicating a good fit to the arrhenius equation with the apparent activation energy e a of about 32 5 kj mol 1 as discussed above the quantum yield of oh varies with temperature based on the steady state assumption k obs is a function of φ as shown in eq 17 in order to minimize variation of k obs arising from the low concentration of target compound the concentrations of ba at 0 0 5 min and 1 0 min fig s10 were chosen to calculate the quantum yield of oh through eq 17 the relationship between quantum yield of oh and temperature is shown in fig 3b a positive linear dependency of quantum yield on temperature was observed with the slope of about 1 27 10 2 k 1 the linear relationship can be described in eq 21 such a similar positive linear dependence of the quantum yield on temperature was also reported in the photolysis of oh 3 10 3 k 1 i 1 5 10 2 k 1 and so3 2 3 68 10 3 k 1 crowell et al 2004 li et al 2014 rahn 1997 the quantum yield of oh was calculated to be about 0 32 mol einstein 1 at 25 c agreeing with the previous reported value of 0 33 mol einstein 1 gonzalez et al 2004 thus eq 21 is incorporated into eqs 18 and 20 and a better applicability of the model will be achieved especially for the cases at different temperature 21 φ 3 469 0 01271 t 3 2 4 effects of alkalinity bicarbonate carbonate can compete for numerous reactive radicals and should be considered in kinetic models of aops crittenden et al 1999 2005 fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 although hco3 and co3 2 react with oh to produce carbonate radical co3 through eqs 22 and 23 the oxidation of organic micropollutants by the formed co3 would not be included in the proposed kinetic model due to the weak oxidizing reactivity of co3 crittenden et al 1999 fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 22 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o k 22 8 5 10 6 m 1 s 1 23 co 3 2 oh co 3 oh k 23 4 10 8 m 1 s 1 different concentrations of bicarbonate carbonate were used to study the effect of alkalinity on the degradation of ba in vuv system and the ba degradation is expressed using eq 18 by including bicarbonate and phosphate as scavengers as shown in fig 4 the degradation of ba only decreased a little with the dosage of bicarbonate increasing from 0 to 2 mm although the predicted value of ba degradation rate achieved from the proposed model was a little higher than the experimental data the modeling prediction was in accordance with the overall trend of the experimental data although bicarbonate is always considered as an efficient scavenger of reactive radicals in aops fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 chen et al 2017 the small inhibition of ba degradation might be due to the fact that the value of k 5 ba 0 2 36 105 s 1 was much higher than that of k 22 hco3 0 1 7 104 s 1 with 2 mm bicarbonate it should be noted that numerous organic pollutants are usually detected as low as μg l which is much lower than the concentration of bicarbonate in natural waters crittenden et al 2005 thus alkalinity should be regarded as an important scavenging factor in the application of vuv systems to degrade aqueous organic pollutants 3 2 5 effects of nom the ubiquitous nom always inhibits the degradation of organic pollutants in uv based aops through the filtering effect on photons and the scavenging effect on reactive radicals fang et al 2014 li et al 2014 xie et al 2015 ha was selected as the reference nom in this study to investigate its impact on ba degradation in vuv systems fig 5 shows that the degradation of ba was significantly influenced by the presence of ha in the vuv system when the concentration of ha increased from 0 to 5 mg l measured as toc the degradation rate of ba slowed down significantly previous reports offered various reaction rate constants between oh and nom with a widely used value of 3 108 mcarbon 1 s 1 mckay et al 2011 hoigné 1998 then a kinetic model expressed as eq 18 by including ha and phosphate as scavengers can be used to predict ba degradation although some reactive species such as singlet oxygen might be produced through the activation of nom and then contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants the formed reactive species was not considered in this study due to the rather low quantum yields of those species latch and mcneill 2006 zhang and hsu kim 2010 as aforementioned discussion almost all the photons at 185 nm would be absorbed by water and thus the filtering effect of nom on the photons at 185 nm was not integrated in the kinetic model a molar absorption coefficient of 0 042 mg c l 1 cm 1 measured as toc at 254 nm was obtained for ha used here so ha will also act as an inner filter to slow down the direct photolysis rate of ba eq 13 there is a good accordance between the model prediction and experimental data fig 5 validating the important role of nom as screener and scavenger in the vuv system 3 3 ba degradation in realistic water degradation of ba in realistic water sample a table s1 was investigated to quantitatively elucidate the influence of water matrix on efficiency fig 6 a shows that ba in realistic water was efficiently degraded by the vuv system but the degradation rate decreased compared with that in pure water fig 1 this is mainly attributed to the scavenging of oh by nom carbonate bicarbonate etc based on the aforementioned discussions nom and carbonate bicarbonate can consume oh and thus their scavenging effects should be included in the kinetic model the fast reactions between oh and chloride produce a sequence of chlorine containing radicals which may also degrade organic pollutants fang et al 2014 offering a complicated oxidation system to degrade organic pollutants in fact a negligible impact of chloride 0 3 mm on ba degradation was observed fig s11 in vuv system as the concentration in the real water sample a was about 0 24 mm table s1 the effect of chloride was ignored in the kinetic model thus a kinetic model expressed as eq 18 by including nom and bicarbonate carbonate species as scavengers was constructed to predict ba degradation the model well fitted the experimental data fig 6a compared with the results shown in figs 1 and 6a the predicting efficacy of the proposed model in eq 18 is even better in realistic water than that in pure water validating the applicability of the kinetic model under realistic water matrices in the vuv system 3 4 model prediction for degradation of typical organic micropollutants bpa nb and dmp were selected as target compounds to further evaluate the applicability of the constructed kinetic model in vuv system the three organic micropollutants were expected to be efficiently degraded by vuv system due to their fast reactions with oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 and 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 respectively and direct photolysis via eq 24 29 bandy et al 2009 buxton et al 1988 hizal et al 1993 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 xu et al 2009 fig 6b 6d show the degradation and model prediction of bpa dmp and nb in pure water and realistic water a by vuv system high degradation efficiencies were achieved for all the three organic pollutants in either phosphate buffered solution or realistic water the degradation of bpa dmp and nb was about 98 9 96 3 and 93 6 respectively within 4 min in pure water while much lower efficiencies of about 97 5 86 9 and 79 3 respectively within 10 min were observed in the realistic water it may be caused by the co existed oh scavengers such as nom in the realistic water it is noted that bpa dmp and nb undergoes very slow direct photolysis with degradation rate of about 4 5 1 7 and 7 3 respectively within 15 min fig s4 24 bpa oh products 1 k 24 1 02 10 10 m 1 s 1 25 bpa h v 254 nm products 1 φ bpa 8 5 10 3 mol einsteim 1 26 nb oh products 1 k 26 3 9 10 9 m 1 s 1 27 nb h v 245 nm products 1 φ nb 7 97 10 4 mol einsteim 1 28 dmp oh products 1 k 28 4 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 29 dmp h v 254 nm products 1 φ dmp 3 0 10 3 mol einsteim 1 the kinetic model in eq 18 predicts the degradation of bpa and dmp in pure water and realistic water well fig 6b and c while there is a significant discrepancy between the predicted results and the experimental data for nb degradation in pure water a better prediction in realistic water fig 6d it should be noted that only organic intermediates were considered as the scavengers in the constructed kinetic models the inorganic products were treated as final products without further reacting with oh however the detachment of nitro groups a vital pathway for the degradation of nitro compounds in aops generally produces nitrite ions which can compete for oh fiercely and possibly slow down the degradation rate of nb zhao et al 2008 zhou et al 2015 additionally the characteristics and components of organic matter can affect the reaction rate constant between organic matter and oh mckay et al 2011 a number of nitro containing intermediates would be produced during the degradation of nb subsequently might offer a different reaction rate constant between oh and the organic intermediates vione et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 thus an obvious discrepancy between the model prediction and experimental results in pure water was observed the results suggest that the constructed model should be modified by including the scavenging effects of both organic and inorganic intermediates e g nitrite and nitro containing intermediates which are formed significantly and compete fast for oh when treating nitrogen containing compounds from fig 6d much better model prediction of nb degradation in realistic water was obtained compared to that in the pure water this may be attributed to the much smaller oh scavenging effects of the nitrite ions which are formed during the degradation of nb nb 0 5 μm in vuv system than that of nom and carbonate bicarbonate ions in the realistic water 3 5 model prediction for the degradation of co existing organic pollutants as the co existence of several organic micropollutants is common in realistic waters the kinetic model was further studied to predict the degradation of the co existing organic micropollutants when evaluating one selected target compound the other co existing organic pollutants and their derived organic intermediates were treated as scavengers of oh in the kinetic model we also divided the other co existing organic pollutants and their derived intermediates into organic and final inorganic groups using a mineralization rate constant of 3 108 mcarbon 1 s 1 hoigné 1998 fang et al 2014 xie et al 2015 three co existing organic micropollutants including ba bpa and dmp were selected to evaluate the applicability of the constructed model as shown in fig 7 a and b all the three co existing organic pollutants are efficiently degraded in pure water and realistic water b kinetic model in eq 18 was used to evaluate the degradation of ba bpa and dmp although a little discrepancy was observed the degradation of all the three organic pollutants could be still well predicted by the constructed model in both pure water and realistic water suggesting the reliability of the constructed model in the vuv system 4 conclusions a kinetic model was proposed to predict the degradation of organic pollutants in the vuv system by treating the scavenging effects of intermediate products as co existing organic matter surrogate selecting ba as the model compound the applicability of the kinetic model was tested under different conditions the model developed predicted ba degradation well in pure water and realistic waters by vuv system it was concluded that oh played the most important role in the removal of organic micropollutants in the vuv system effects of initial ba concentration photons intensity temperature bicarbonate carbonate ha and realistic water matrices were examined quantitatively by the model efficiency of vuv system increased significantly with elevating temperature and a positive linear dependence of quantum yield of oh on temperature was found nom was the most important inhibiting factor in the vuv system while carbonate bicarbonate and chloride showed much smaller influence the developed kinetic model was feasible in predicting the degradation of bpa nb and dmp in realistic water furthermore the model also well predicted the degradation of co existing organic micropollutants ba bpa and dmp supporting the applicability of the constructed kinetic model in the vuv system this study develops an effective kinetic model to help predict the degradation of a wide variety of organic pollutants in the vuv system and thus will broaden the scope of the study on vuv system the applicability of the vuv process for water treatment is limited due to the low penetration depth and the efficiency is also dependent on the efficient diffusion of radicals generated and reactor design further study on the effects of operational conditions such as hydraulics vuv fluence distribution and reactor configurations on the efficiency is needed to optimize the vuv system acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grants 51608215 and

19721,pharmaceutical wastewaters containing antibiotics and high salinity can damage traditional biological treatment and result in the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes args bioelectrochemical system bes is a promising approach for treating pharmaceutical wastewater however the fate of args in bes and their correlations with microbial communities and horizontal genes transfer are unknown in this study we investigated the response of args to bio electrochemical treatment of chloramphenicol wastewater and their potential hosts under different salinities three args encoding efflux pump cmla flor and tetc one class 1 integron integrase encoding gene inti1 and sul1 gene associate with inti1 were analyzed correlation analysis between microbial community and args revealed that the abundances of potential hosts of args were strongly affected by salinity which further determined the alteration in args abundances under different salinities there were no significant correlations between args and inti1 indicating that horizontal gene transfer was not related to the important changes in args moreover the chloramphenicol removal efficiency was enhanced under a moderate salinity attributed to the altered microbial community driven by salinity therefore microbial community shift is the major factor for the changes of args and chloramphenicol removal efficiency in bes under different salinities this study provides new insights on the mechanisms underlying the alteration of args in bes treating high salinity pharmaceutical wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical system antibiotic resistance genes salinity microbial community horizontal gene transfer 1 introduction pharmaceutical wastewaters produced from manufacturing of antibiotics can have deleterious impacts on traditional biological treatment due to their high salt content and inhibitory compounds that cannot be easily degraded ng et al 2015 the residual antibiotics result in the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and the widespread of antibiotic resistance genes args which pose a threat to human health aydin et al 2015 guo et al 2017a rysz et al 2013 chloramphenicol cap is an effective broad spectrum antibiotic that has been widely used for several decades due to the toxicity of its nitro and chlorine substituents cap is resistant to conventional biological wastewater treatment processes liang et al 2013 bioelectrochemical system bes is a promising alternative for cap pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with the transformation of cap into less biotoxic products aulenta et al 2011 kong et al 2015 previous studies reported that electrical stimulation could improve microbial resistance to salinity by altering functional proteins feng et al 2015 meanwhile the high conductivity of saline wastewater may promote redox reactions between electrodes to accelerate the removal of pollutant which might in turn enhance the performance of bes zhang et al 2012 therefore bes can be a good choice for treating cap pharmaceutical wastewater with salinity nevertheless the specific mechanism underlying the influence of salinity in cap pharmaceutical wastewater on the fate of args in bes is still unclear which should be further evaluated previous studies reported that environmental stress including high salinity can decrease antibiotic susceptibility of arg hosts and associate with the development of antibiotic resistance mcmahon et al 2007 however how the shift of args hosts may contribute to the args variation in bes with salinity remains unknown in addition horizontal gene transfer via mobile gene elements for example integrons is another major factor that drives the change of arg abundance mao et al 2014 su et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to investigate the contribution of both shift of arg hosts and horizontal gene transfer to the variation of args during the treatment of high saline pharmaceutical wastewater in bes in this work a bes reactor was developed for cap removal from pharmaceutical wastewater the fate of args in bes was determined the potential hosts of args based on the correlation between microbial community determined by illumina hiseq sequencing technology and args were also investigated furthermore the fate of the class 1 integron integrase encoding gene inti1 recognized as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer was determined moreover the cap removal efficiency and degradation product were examined to evaluate cap removal capability as a function of salinity in bes in addition the effects of other environmental stresses including temperature and cathode potential on the fate of args and cap removal efficiency were discussed the present study aims to understand the mechanism of how environmental stresses influence the fate of args and cap removal performance in cap degrading process in bes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bess construction as shown in fig s1 two dual chambered bess were made by glass material and each chamber had a working volume of 100 ml the two compartments were separated by a cation exchange membrane cmx neospeta astom japan carbon graphite felt was used as anode and cathode an ag agcl 197 mv vs she electrode was used as the reference electrode in the cathode chamber the cathode and reference electrode were connected externally through a potentiostat chi 1030b chenhua china the biotoxicity of nitro and chlorine substituents of cap can be mitigated using anaerobic reduction thus using anaerobic sludge from a bioreactor treating cap wastewater as the inoculum can enhance the start up of bes liang et al 2013 the inoculum was taken from the anaerobic bioreactor when the bioreactor approached steady on cap removal about of 70 removal efficiency after 96 h the anaerobic sludge was taken from the bioreactor at the end of batch experiment to make sure that the inoculum dosed for each experiment was the same the same inoculum determined the same args concentration at the initiation of each experiment under different conditions as shown in fig s2 the relative abundances of args were measured in the inoculums a mixture of the medium and inoculum at a ratio of 5 1 v v was added into the cathode chamber the medium composition in cathode chamber was as follows in mg l 1 nh4cl 57 kh2po4 3h2o 22 mgso4 12 cacl2 11 5 trace element solution 10 ml l 1 the trace element solution was shown in the supporting information wang et al 2015 each bes was dosed with 50 mg l cap to simulate pharmaceutical wastewater guo et al 2017b 2 2 experimental design during the operation two bess were operated in batch mode the bes without nacl was used as the control during the operation three sets of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of salinity cathode potential and temperature on cap removal and the fate of args first pharmaceutical wastewaters may pose deleterious impacts on biological treatment due to the high salinity ng et al 2015 therefore the effect of different salinities 0 0 5 2 and 6 on cap degradation and the relative abundances of args were evaluated nacl was used as the source of salinity the solid nacl and other medium ingredients were dissolved together and nacl was added at concentrations of 0 5 g 20 g and 60 g per liter medium solution which were akin to the influent salinities of 0 0 5 2 and 6 respectively the rate of cap degradation was obtained and the intermediates of cap transformation were identified the microbial community and relative abundances of args were also determined during the first set of experiments the cathode potential was maintained at 1 5 v and the operational temperature was kept at 25 c in an incubator spx yiqi ningbo second cathode potential has an important influence on the removal of pollutant in bes mu et al 2009 and thus the system was carried out to investigate the effect of cathode potential 1 25 1 and 0 5 v on cap degradation and characteristics of args in the bes system in these experiments the salinity was kept at 2 and the operational temperature was maintained at 25 c incubator spx yiqi ningbo third temperature is another major factor affecting the activity of microorganisms in bes liang et al 2016 the effect of operational temperature 30 15 and 10 c using the incubator spx yiqi ningbo on cap degradation and fate of args in the bes were thus studied the cathode potential was maintained at 1 5 v and the salinity was kept at 2 three batch assays were carried out in each experiments under different conditions with each batch assay lasted for 3 days the hydraulic retention time was set to 3 days because removal efficiencies of cap were above 80 in 3 days under most of conditions between repetitive experiments under the same condition the cathode liquid content was discharged and the sludge was washed twice with phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 to remove the residual cap and salinity then cathode chamber with washed sludge was recharged with fresh medium the bess were seeded with inoculum from the anaerobic reactor when an experiment of new condition started the inoculum was acclimated for 3 batch cycles before each bes study started 2 3 dna extraction three replicates were conducted for dna isolation from the bes at the end of each experiment the cathode liquid content was discharged and the sludge samples were taken from the cathode chamber of bes variable volumes of sludge samples were centrifuged 8000 r min for 5min to obtain a final pellet of 50 mg the sludge pellets were washed twice using pbs and then transferred to the powersoil dna isolation kit sayess et al 2013 the genomic dna of each sample was extracted in accordance with the manufacture s protocol the concentration and quality of the extracted dna were analyzed with spectrophotometry using a nucleic acid analyzer allsheng china nano 200 the extracted dna were stored at 20 c until use 2 4 detection and quantification of args the main cap resistance mechanism has been identified as exportation of chloramphenicol by efflux pump coding genes cmla flor and other genes li et al 2013 tetc gene was selected because it is also an efflux pump gene chen et al 2015 the integrase of class 1 integrons inti1 was selected as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer hardwick et al 2008 sul1 gene was chosen because it is generally associated with inti1 as reported in previous study chen and zhang 2013 quantitative pcr qpcr lightcycler480 was conducted on target genes primers used in this study listed in table s1 were reported in previous studies or designed using the oligo 7 primer analysis software based on the available sequences of genes as shown in table s2 the specificities of designed primers were verified using the primer blast by ncbi http blast ncbi nlm nih gov and the blast result showed that the primers were specific to the target genes and no other targets were found which indicated the good specificities of primers purified pcr products containing target genes were ligated into a pmd 19 t vector cloning kit takara japan and cloned into escherichia coli dh5α takara japan then plasmid standards were isolated from positive clones using a plasmid mini kit omega china the concentrations of plasmid standards were determined using a nucleic acid analyzer nano 200 allsheng china the five to seven point standard curves were constructed using 10 fold serial dilutions of plasmid standards 109 104 copies μl 1 qpcr was conducted in a 48 well plate with a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl of sybr premix ex taq takara japan 0 4 μl of forward and reverse primers 2 μl of template dna and 7 2 μl of dna free water li et al 2017 all samples were run in triplicates in qpcr reactions to determine the effect of nacl on qpcr reactions dna samples were extracted from the same sludge with or without 6 salinity three replicates were conducted for dna isolation from the two sludge samples to avoid the effect of nacl on dna replication the dna samples were extracted as soon as the nacl was added the copies of 16s rrna genes in the dna samples were determined by qpcr as shown in fig s3 there was no significant difference between the copies of 16s rrna gene of the two sludge samples p 368 by independent samples t test indicating that nacl had no impacts on the qpcr results the absolute abundances of target genes were expressed as copies number per μl based on the qpcr results the total biomass was indicated by the absolute abundance of 16s rrna the relative abundance of target gene was calculated as absolute copy of target gene per copy of 16s rrna gene qian et al 2016 2 5 illumina sequencing and statistical analysis the bacterial v4 v5 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene were amplified for the pcr of the v4 v5 hypervariable regions each dna sample was amplified using 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcctttgagttt 3 primer set zhou et al 2011 in addition a unique 16 bp barcode was used to tag each sample the pcr protocol was conducted with the following conditions an initial 3 min denaturation at 94 c 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 c 40 s at 53 c 1 min at 72 c a final 5 min elongation at 72 c pcr products from different samples were mixed in equal concentrations and purified using qiagen gel extraction kit qiagen germany samples were sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform novogene institute beijing china and 250 bp paired reads were generated paired end reads were trimmed from barcode and primer using self written python scripts and assembled by flash http ccb jhu edu software flash quality filtering of data was performed using the qiime http qiime org index html operational taxonomic units otus were determined with 97 similarity by uparse software http drive5 com uparse for annotation of the 16s rrna gene the greengene database http greengenes lbl gov cgi bin nph index cgi was used based on rdp classifier http sourceforge net projects rdp classifier algorithmto annotate taxonomic information the analyses of similarity anosim were conducted using primer statistical software to determine the significance of differences among microbial community sample groups r values which were generated by anosim range from 0 to 1 an r value of 1 indicates that communities from different groups are completely dissimilar to determine the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the change of relative abundances of args the spearman correlations analysis between args and inti1 qpcr results under different conditions were conducted song et al 2017 to identify the potential hosts of args under different conditions the quantitative correlation between args and the bacterial genera illumina sequencing results based on the spearman analysis was also determined miao et al 2015 the spearman indices r and significant correlation p of the correlations among inti1 genera and args were calculated using the spss software ibm usa the significant difference p of args under different conditions was calculated with the independent samples t test from the spss software the p and p values less than 0 05 were considered as statistically significant 2 6 analytical methods samples taken from the cathode chamber were filtered with 0 22 μm filters before chemical analysis a hplc shimadzu lc 20at was used to measure the concentration of cap the hplc was performed with a c18 column dectection at 275 nm by uv detector runs were performed in mixed solvent 55 of solvent a as methanol and 45 solvent b as h2o at 0 8 ml min cap transformation products were identified by a hplc thermo ultimate 3000 ms ms thermo lcq fleet and the specific method is described in the supporting information cap removal efficiency er was calculated based on the cap concentration before and after the bes treatment 3 results 3 1 the variations of args under different conditions efflux pumps in synergy with the properties of the cell membrane are one of the major mechanisms of antibiotics resistance zhang et al 2015 therefore typical args encoding efflux pumps including cmla flor and tetc were investigated in this study the relative abundances of args under different salinities is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the relative abundances of cmla and flor under low salinity 0 5 were significantly higher than control p 05 fig 1 however the relative abundances of cmla and flor under higher salinity of 6 did not change too much as compared with the control indicating that higher salinity inhibited the spread of cmla and flor different from cmla and flor the relative abundance of tetc significantly increased as salinities increased p 05 fig 1 it should also be noted that the relative abundance of tetc at 6 salinity was higher than other args integrons such as inti1 are often associated with mobile genetic elements for example transpons and plasmids and act as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer of args hardwick et al 2008 the relative abundance of inti1 at lower salinity 0 5 and 2 was significantly higher than control indicating that lower salinity could enhance horizontal gene transfer of args furthermore the spearman correlations analysis was conducted to determine the correlations between args and inti1 table s3 which indicated that there were no significant correlations between args except sul1 and inti1 under different salinities as shown in fig 1 the relative abundance of sul1 which encodes alternative sulfonamide resistant dihydropteroate synthase and is usually found on the gene cassettes of inti1 was similar with inti1 chen and zhang 2013 to investigate the effect of cathode potentials on the fate of args in bes three cathode potentials 1 25 1 and 0 5 v were applied as shown in fig 2 cathode potential affected the abundances of args the relative abundances of cmla flor sul1 and inti1 genes under 1 25 v and 0 5 v were significantly higher than 1 v p 05 this result suggested that the spread of args could be controlled under 1 v spearman s correlation coefficients between args and inti1 were conducted indicating that there were no significant correlations between args except sul1 and inti1 table s3 temperature is a principal variable affecting the activity of microorganisms in bes liang et al 2016 to determine the effect of temperature on args two bess those with 2 salinity and without salinity were conducted under different temperatures 10 15 and 30 c fig s4a shows that the relative abundances of args and inti1 under 15 c and 10 c were similar both of which were higher than those at 30 c in the bes without salinity for the bes with 2 salinity the relative abundances of args and inti1 at 15 c kept stable comparing with 30 c fig s4b nevertheless the relative abundance at 10 c displayed a significant increase comparing with 30 c p 05 spearman s correlation coefficients between args and inti1 in bes without salinity showed that there were no significant correlations between most args except flor sul1 and inti1 however the relative abundances of args presented significant correlation with that of inti1 in bes with 2 salinity table s3 3 2 cap degradation under different conditions in bes under different salinities the removal efficiencies of cap at the end of reaction are presented in fig 3 the cap removal efficiency at salinity of 0 5 92 5 was higher than the control without salinity 88 3 the cap removal efficiency in salinity of 6 was 49 5 suggesting that high salinity inhibited cap removal efficiency the degradation pathway of cap in bes was revealed by hplc ms analysis amcl2 reduced amine product of cap amcl dechlorinated amcl2 fig s5 the effect of salinity on cap degradation products is shown in fig s6 under control and relatively low salinities 0 5 and 2 the content of amcl2 increased at initial stage and then decreased after reaching a peak in contrast the content of amcl2 increased continuously until 58 h under salinity of 6 in addition almost no amcl was accumulated under salinity of 6 indicating that the further dechlorination of amcl2 to amcl was inhibited under higher salinity in bes cathode potential has an important influence on removing compounds that are difficult to degrade aulenta et al 2009 mu et al 2009 shen et al 2013 as shown in fig s7 the cap degradation efficiency increased as cathode potentials became more negative moreover it is harder to further dechlorinate amcl2 under less negative cathode potential fig s8 cap removal efficiencies under different temperature were shown in fig s9 the cap removal efficiencies of both bess exhibited a similar trend at 30 c and 15 c fig s9 interestingly the bes without salinity at 10 c showed a dramatic decrease in cap removal as compared to 15 c whereas the bes with 2 salinity only experienced slightly reduced performance moreover as shown in fig s10 almost no amcl2 and amcl were generated in the bes without salinity at 10 c whereas the contents of cap degradation products in the bes with 2 salinity at 10 c maintained a high level similar to 15 c 3 3 changes of microbial community the genera level analysis allows us to understand the composition of the microbial community fig 4 the relative abundance of each genera were different under different operating conditions r 1 p 001 by anosim analysis table s4 and salinity affected microbial community structures r 0 95 p 002 by anosim analysis table s4 lysinibacillus and pseudomonas were dominant in the samples collected at 0 5 salinity cathode potential also altered the microbial community structure r 0 92 p 003 by anosim analysis table s4 alkaliphilus acinetobacter were the dominant in samples of 1 25 v however flavobacterium acholeplasma were the dominant in 1 v and halomonas methylophaga were the dominant in 0 5 v fig 4 it has been reported that temperature stress is an important factor for the microbial community structure wells et al 2011 our results showed that temperature also caused obvious changes in microbial community structure at the genera level r 0 86 p 002 by anosim analysis fig s11 and table s4 the dominant species of bes with 2 salinity were different from the bes without salinity fig s11 specially halomonas haliangium byssovorax and methylophaga were dominant in the bes with 2 salinity at 10 c but they were not found in the bes without salinity 3 4 the fate of potential hosts of args as shown in fig 5 20 genera of bacterial might be the potential hosts of the args based on the correlation between args and genera the potential hosts of args cmla flor sul1 under different salinities mainly belonged to pseudomonas byssovorax dechloromonas fig 5 the relative abundance of pseudomonas in salinity of 6 was obviously lower than that in salinity of 0 5 fig 4 it was worth noting that the range of potential hosts for tetc gene was much broader than other args fig 5 the relative abundances of potential hosts for tetc eubacterium candidatus methanogranum longilinea and ornatilinea enhanced as salinity increased fig 4 the main potential hosts of args in the bes under different cathode potentials were halomonas methylophaga fig s12 as shown in fig 4 the relative abundances of main potential hosts under 0 5 v were higher than that under 1 v whereas the relative abundances of main hosts of args were lower in sample of 1 25 v fig 4 for different temperatures the main potential hosts of args in the bes with 2 salinity were byssovorax halomonas methylophaga and erysipelothrix fig s13 the relative abundances of these potential hosts in bes of 10 c with 2 salinity were higher than other temperatures fig s11 however the main potential host bacteria of args in the bes without salinity were denitratisoma erysipelothrix eubacterium and nitrosomonadaceae fig s14 different from those in bes with 2 salinity the relative abundances of these potential hosts in bes without salinity were higher at both 15 c and 10 c than 30 c fig s11 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of variations of args under different conditions this study showed that salinity resulted in an evident variation in the relative abundances of args and inti1 fig 1 the changes in the relative abundances of args is likely due to the variations in the abundances of potential host bacteria and horizontal gene transfer of args among bacteria jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 the lack of correlations between args and inti1 indicated that horizontal gene transfer was not an important factor for the changes in the args except sul1 under different salinities table s3 the variations in the potential host bacteria were the main contributor for the changes in the args the higher relative abundance of main potential host pseudomonas in sample of 0 5 salinity relative to 6 salinity resulted in the reduced abundances of cmla flor and sul1 figs 4 and 5 particularly the relative abundances of main potential hosts eubacterium candidatus methanogranum longilinea and ornatilinea of tetc increased as salinity increased figs 4 and 5 which contributed to the increased relative abundance of tetc fig 1 specially the range of potential hosts of tetc gene was much broader than other args fig 5 resulting in the sufficient abundance of tetc relative to other args at 6 salinity fig 1 in general selection by residual cap is another key mechanism that could contribute to the fate of args in bes and higher cap concentration can result in a higher selection pressure to enhance the propagation of the antibiotic resistant bacteria guo et al 2017b however the higher residual cap in sample of 6 salinity didn t cause higher relative abundances of args except for tetc figs 1 and 3 it was likely due to that the selection pressure imposed by higher salinity was greater than that by residual cap lower salinity 0 5 and 2 enhanced the relative abundance of inti1 indicating the enhanced horizontal gene transfer of args fig 1 the relative abundance of sul1 was similar with inti1 which was consistent with previous study that sul1 is associated with inti1 chen and zhang 2013 cathode potential also affected the relative abundances of args fig 2 horizontal gene transfer was not an important factor for the variations in the args except sul1 under different cathode potentials based on the spearman s correlation results table s3 the variations of args mainly resulted from the shift of arg potential hosts the higher relative abundances of main potential hosts halomonas methylophaga under 0 5 v contributed to the higher relative abundances of args relative to 1 v fig 2 and s12 besides the selection of cathode potential at 0 5 v the residual cap was another contributor to the enhancement of potential hosts of args fig s7 the high relative abundances of args at 1 25 v was due to the increased cell membrane permeability at high cathode potential which enabled entrance of antibiotics and subsequently enhanced the growth of arb guo et al 2017b for different temperatures the main potential hosts of args in the bes with 2 salinity were different from the bes without salinity fig s13 and s14 the relative abundances of potential hosts of the args with 2 salinity byssovorax halomonas methylophaga and erysipelothrix were higher at 10 c relative to other temperatures while the relative abundances of arg potential hosts without salinity denitratisoma erysipelothrix eubacterium and nitrosomonadaceae were higher at both 15 c and 10 c than 30 c the higher relative abundances of potential hosts without salinity were likely due to the selection of low temperature and residual cap fig s9 while that with 2 salinity was only due to the selection of low temperature this different potential hosts of args could account for the difference in the relative abundances of args between the bes with 2 salinity and the bes without salinity at 15 c fig s4 besides the variation of potential hosts horizontal gene transfer was another contributor for the higher abundances of args in the bes at 10 c based on the spearman s correlation result it was consistent with the result above mentioned that the salinity of 2 enhanced horizontal gene transfer the relative abundance of inti1 relative to the bes without salinity this result indicated that the contributors potential hosts bacteria and horizontal gene transfer for the args variations in different temperatures conditions were different from salinities and cathode potential conditions while new insights were gained into the mechanisms underlying the alteration of args in bes several challenges still remain to be addressed the definitive bacteria carrying args should be determined in further studies for example the bacteria strains could be isolated from the bes sludge to identify the bacteria carrying args because the correlation analysis between genera and args only provided a possibility of the hosts of args which should be further confirmed 4 2 mechanisms of variations of cap removal under different conditions we found that cap removal efficiency under lower salinity 0 5 was higher than control fig 3 however cap removal efficiency and further dechlorination of amcl2 to amcl were inhibited under higher salinity fig s6 this result may be due to the altered microbial community driven by salinity fig 4 for example the dominance of 0 5 salinity was pseudomonas which has been reported to play an important role in the degradation of organic pollutants in bes by previous studies nancharaiah et al 2015 venkataraman et al 2010 however pseudomonas was not found in sample of 6 salinity in addition to the altered microbial community the decreased cell activity under higher salinity could also contribute to the difference in cap removal efficiency which has been reported in previous study zhuang et al 2010 cathode potential also affected the performance of bes treating cap wastewater the cap degradation efficiency increased as cathode potentials became more negative fig s7 more electrons for cap reduction partially contributed to the enhanced degradation of cap at 1 25 v liang et al 2009 moreover the dominant bacteria found in sample of 1 25 v alkaliphilus acinetobacter favored the removal of organic pollutants zhang et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 lower temperature 10 c apparently affected the cap removal efficiency in the bes without salinity while it didn t influence the cap removal efficiency in the bes with 2 salinity fig s9 the different dominant species between bes with salinity and bes without salinity partly contributed to the difference in cap removal efficiency fig s11 the dominant bacteria halomonas methylophaga and haliangium were moderately halotolerant microorganism fudou et al 2002 kaye and baross 2004 neufeld et al 2007 it has been reported that the extremophilic microorganism were resistant to many extreme conditions such as salinity condition and cold condition kaye and baross 2004 it was hypothesised that halomonas methylophaga and haliangium were psychrotolerant in addition halomonas methylophaga is able to degrade organic compounds garcia et al 2004 neufeld et al 2007 however they were not found in the bes without salinity fig s11 therefore the halotolerant microorganism might be the reason for the higher cap removal efficiency in the bes with 2 salinity relative to the bes without salinity at 10 c 5 conclusion this study investigated the characteristics of args including args associated with encoding efflux pump cmla flor and tetc and integron sul1 in bes treating cap pharmaceutical wastewater the shift of arg potential hosts resulted from the changed microbial community and horizontal gene transfer are two important factors that strongly affect the fate of args however the shift of args potential hosts rather than horizontal gene transfer was the major factor for the alteration of args except sul1 under different salinities in this study cathode potential and temperature also influenced the fate of args the spread of args could be inhibited under moderate cathode potential 1 v due to the shift of args potential hosts under different temperatures both shift of arg potential hosts and horizontal gene transfer contributed to the variation of args furthermore the degradation of cap varied under different conditions and the microbial community shift was an important factor for the alteration of cap removal the results in our study suggest that bes with a cathode potential 1 v can be a good choice to treat cap pharmaceutical wastewater under moderate salinity 2 salinity and mesophilic condition above 15 c which resulted in low relative abundances of args and high cap removal efficiency this result would provide theoretical reference for the further practical application of this technology to conclude this work presents a comprehensive assessment of shift of args potential hosts for the args alteration which provides valuable insights on the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in bes treating antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater acknowledgments the authors wish to thank the nsfc

19721,pharmaceutical wastewaters containing antibiotics and high salinity can damage traditional biological treatment and result in the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes args bioelectrochemical system bes is a promising approach for treating pharmaceutical wastewater however the fate of args in bes and their correlations with microbial communities and horizontal genes transfer are unknown in this study we investigated the response of args to bio electrochemical treatment of chloramphenicol wastewater and their potential hosts under different salinities three args encoding efflux pump cmla flor and tetc one class 1 integron integrase encoding gene inti1 and sul1 gene associate with inti1 were analyzed correlation analysis between microbial community and args revealed that the abundances of potential hosts of args were strongly affected by salinity which further determined the alteration in args abundances under different salinities there were no significant correlations between args and inti1 indicating that horizontal gene transfer was not related to the important changes in args moreover the chloramphenicol removal efficiency was enhanced under a moderate salinity attributed to the altered microbial community driven by salinity therefore microbial community shift is the major factor for the changes of args and chloramphenicol removal efficiency in bes under different salinities this study provides new insights on the mechanisms underlying the alteration of args in bes treating high salinity pharmaceutical wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical system antibiotic resistance genes salinity microbial community horizontal gene transfer 1 introduction pharmaceutical wastewaters produced from manufacturing of antibiotics can have deleterious impacts on traditional biological treatment due to their high salt content and inhibitory compounds that cannot be easily degraded ng et al 2015 the residual antibiotics result in the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and the widespread of antibiotic resistance genes args which pose a threat to human health aydin et al 2015 guo et al 2017a rysz et al 2013 chloramphenicol cap is an effective broad spectrum antibiotic that has been widely used for several decades due to the toxicity of its nitro and chlorine substituents cap is resistant to conventional biological wastewater treatment processes liang et al 2013 bioelectrochemical system bes is a promising alternative for cap pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with the transformation of cap into less biotoxic products aulenta et al 2011 kong et al 2015 previous studies reported that electrical stimulation could improve microbial resistance to salinity by altering functional proteins feng et al 2015 meanwhile the high conductivity of saline wastewater may promote redox reactions between electrodes to accelerate the removal of pollutant which might in turn enhance the performance of bes zhang et al 2012 therefore bes can be a good choice for treating cap pharmaceutical wastewater with salinity nevertheless the specific mechanism underlying the influence of salinity in cap pharmaceutical wastewater on the fate of args in bes is still unclear which should be further evaluated previous studies reported that environmental stress including high salinity can decrease antibiotic susceptibility of arg hosts and associate with the development of antibiotic resistance mcmahon et al 2007 however how the shift of args hosts may contribute to the args variation in bes with salinity remains unknown in addition horizontal gene transfer via mobile gene elements for example integrons is another major factor that drives the change of arg abundance mao et al 2014 su et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to investigate the contribution of both shift of arg hosts and horizontal gene transfer to the variation of args during the treatment of high saline pharmaceutical wastewater in bes in this work a bes reactor was developed for cap removal from pharmaceutical wastewater the fate of args in bes was determined the potential hosts of args based on the correlation between microbial community determined by illumina hiseq sequencing technology and args were also investigated furthermore the fate of the class 1 integron integrase encoding gene inti1 recognized as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer was determined moreover the cap removal efficiency and degradation product were examined to evaluate cap removal capability as a function of salinity in bes in addition the effects of other environmental stresses including temperature and cathode potential on the fate of args and cap removal efficiency were discussed the present study aims to understand the mechanism of how environmental stresses influence the fate of args and cap removal performance in cap degrading process in bes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bess construction as shown in fig s1 two dual chambered bess were made by glass material and each chamber had a working volume of 100 ml the two compartments were separated by a cation exchange membrane cmx neospeta astom japan carbon graphite felt was used as anode and cathode an ag agcl 197 mv vs she electrode was used as the reference electrode in the cathode chamber the cathode and reference electrode were connected externally through a potentiostat chi 1030b chenhua china the biotoxicity of nitro and chlorine substituents of cap can be mitigated using anaerobic reduction thus using anaerobic sludge from a bioreactor treating cap wastewater as the inoculum can enhance the start up of bes liang et al 2013 the inoculum was taken from the anaerobic bioreactor when the bioreactor approached steady on cap removal about of 70 removal efficiency after 96 h the anaerobic sludge was taken from the bioreactor at the end of batch experiment to make sure that the inoculum dosed for each experiment was the same the same inoculum determined the same args concentration at the initiation of each experiment under different conditions as shown in fig s2 the relative abundances of args were measured in the inoculums a mixture of the medium and inoculum at a ratio of 5 1 v v was added into the cathode chamber the medium composition in cathode chamber was as follows in mg l 1 nh4cl 57 kh2po4 3h2o 22 mgso4 12 cacl2 11 5 trace element solution 10 ml l 1 the trace element solution was shown in the supporting information wang et al 2015 each bes was dosed with 50 mg l cap to simulate pharmaceutical wastewater guo et al 2017b 2 2 experimental design during the operation two bess were operated in batch mode the bes without nacl was used as the control during the operation three sets of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of salinity cathode potential and temperature on cap removal and the fate of args first pharmaceutical wastewaters may pose deleterious impacts on biological treatment due to the high salinity ng et al 2015 therefore the effect of different salinities 0 0 5 2 and 6 on cap degradation and the relative abundances of args were evaluated nacl was used as the source of salinity the solid nacl and other medium ingredients were dissolved together and nacl was added at concentrations of 0 5 g 20 g and 60 g per liter medium solution which were akin to the influent salinities of 0 0 5 2 and 6 respectively the rate of cap degradation was obtained and the intermediates of cap transformation were identified the microbial community and relative abundances of args were also determined during the first set of experiments the cathode potential was maintained at 1 5 v and the operational temperature was kept at 25 c in an incubator spx yiqi ningbo second cathode potential has an important influence on the removal of pollutant in bes mu et al 2009 and thus the system was carried out to investigate the effect of cathode potential 1 25 1 and 0 5 v on cap degradation and characteristics of args in the bes system in these experiments the salinity was kept at 2 and the operational temperature was maintained at 25 c incubator spx yiqi ningbo third temperature is another major factor affecting the activity of microorganisms in bes liang et al 2016 the effect of operational temperature 30 15 and 10 c using the incubator spx yiqi ningbo on cap degradation and fate of args in the bes were thus studied the cathode potential was maintained at 1 5 v and the salinity was kept at 2 three batch assays were carried out in each experiments under different conditions with each batch assay lasted for 3 days the hydraulic retention time was set to 3 days because removal efficiencies of cap were above 80 in 3 days under most of conditions between repetitive experiments under the same condition the cathode liquid content was discharged and the sludge was washed twice with phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 to remove the residual cap and salinity then cathode chamber with washed sludge was recharged with fresh medium the bess were seeded with inoculum from the anaerobic reactor when an experiment of new condition started the inoculum was acclimated for 3 batch cycles before each bes study started 2 3 dna extraction three replicates were conducted for dna isolation from the bes at the end of each experiment the cathode liquid content was discharged and the sludge samples were taken from the cathode chamber of bes variable volumes of sludge samples were centrifuged 8000 r min for 5min to obtain a final pellet of 50 mg the sludge pellets were washed twice using pbs and then transferred to the powersoil dna isolation kit sayess et al 2013 the genomic dna of each sample was extracted in accordance with the manufacture s protocol the concentration and quality of the extracted dna were analyzed with spectrophotometry using a nucleic acid analyzer allsheng china nano 200 the extracted dna were stored at 20 c until use 2 4 detection and quantification of args the main cap resistance mechanism has been identified as exportation of chloramphenicol by efflux pump coding genes cmla flor and other genes li et al 2013 tetc gene was selected because it is also an efflux pump gene chen et al 2015 the integrase of class 1 integrons inti1 was selected as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer hardwick et al 2008 sul1 gene was chosen because it is generally associated with inti1 as reported in previous study chen and zhang 2013 quantitative pcr qpcr lightcycler480 was conducted on target genes primers used in this study listed in table s1 were reported in previous studies or designed using the oligo 7 primer analysis software based on the available sequences of genes as shown in table s2 the specificities of designed primers were verified using the primer blast by ncbi http blast ncbi nlm nih gov and the blast result showed that the primers were specific to the target genes and no other targets were found which indicated the good specificities of primers purified pcr products containing target genes were ligated into a pmd 19 t vector cloning kit takara japan and cloned into escherichia coli dh5α takara japan then plasmid standards were isolated from positive clones using a plasmid mini kit omega china the concentrations of plasmid standards were determined using a nucleic acid analyzer nano 200 allsheng china the five to seven point standard curves were constructed using 10 fold serial dilutions of plasmid standards 109 104 copies μl 1 qpcr was conducted in a 48 well plate with a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl of sybr premix ex taq takara japan 0 4 μl of forward and reverse primers 2 μl of template dna and 7 2 μl of dna free water li et al 2017 all samples were run in triplicates in qpcr reactions to determine the effect of nacl on qpcr reactions dna samples were extracted from the same sludge with or without 6 salinity three replicates were conducted for dna isolation from the two sludge samples to avoid the effect of nacl on dna replication the dna samples were extracted as soon as the nacl was added the copies of 16s rrna genes in the dna samples were determined by qpcr as shown in fig s3 there was no significant difference between the copies of 16s rrna gene of the two sludge samples p 368 by independent samples t test indicating that nacl had no impacts on the qpcr results the absolute abundances of target genes were expressed as copies number per μl based on the qpcr results the total biomass was indicated by the absolute abundance of 16s rrna the relative abundance of target gene was calculated as absolute copy of target gene per copy of 16s rrna gene qian et al 2016 2 5 illumina sequencing and statistical analysis the bacterial v4 v5 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene were amplified for the pcr of the v4 v5 hypervariable regions each dna sample was amplified using 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcctttgagttt 3 primer set zhou et al 2011 in addition a unique 16 bp barcode was used to tag each sample the pcr protocol was conducted with the following conditions an initial 3 min denaturation at 94 c 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 c 40 s at 53 c 1 min at 72 c a final 5 min elongation at 72 c pcr products from different samples were mixed in equal concentrations and purified using qiagen gel extraction kit qiagen germany samples were sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform novogene institute beijing china and 250 bp paired reads were generated paired end reads were trimmed from barcode and primer using self written python scripts and assembled by flash http ccb jhu edu software flash quality filtering of data was performed using the qiime http qiime org index html operational taxonomic units otus were determined with 97 similarity by uparse software http drive5 com uparse for annotation of the 16s rrna gene the greengene database http greengenes lbl gov cgi bin nph index cgi was used based on rdp classifier http sourceforge net projects rdp classifier algorithmto annotate taxonomic information the analyses of similarity anosim were conducted using primer statistical software to determine the significance of differences among microbial community sample groups r values which were generated by anosim range from 0 to 1 an r value of 1 indicates that communities from different groups are completely dissimilar to determine the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the change of relative abundances of args the spearman correlations analysis between args and inti1 qpcr results under different conditions were conducted song et al 2017 to identify the potential hosts of args under different conditions the quantitative correlation between args and the bacterial genera illumina sequencing results based on the spearman analysis was also determined miao et al 2015 the spearman indices r and significant correlation p of the correlations among inti1 genera and args were calculated using the spss software ibm usa the significant difference p of args under different conditions was calculated with the independent samples t test from the spss software the p and p values less than 0 05 were considered as statistically significant 2 6 analytical methods samples taken from the cathode chamber were filtered with 0 22 μm filters before chemical analysis a hplc shimadzu lc 20at was used to measure the concentration of cap the hplc was performed with a c18 column dectection at 275 nm by uv detector runs were performed in mixed solvent 55 of solvent a as methanol and 45 solvent b as h2o at 0 8 ml min cap transformation products were identified by a hplc thermo ultimate 3000 ms ms thermo lcq fleet and the specific method is described in the supporting information cap removal efficiency er was calculated based on the cap concentration before and after the bes treatment 3 results 3 1 the variations of args under different conditions efflux pumps in synergy with the properties of the cell membrane are one of the major mechanisms of antibiotics resistance zhang et al 2015 therefore typical args encoding efflux pumps including cmla flor and tetc were investigated in this study the relative abundances of args under different salinities is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the relative abundances of cmla and flor under low salinity 0 5 were significantly higher than control p 05 fig 1 however the relative abundances of cmla and flor under higher salinity of 6 did not change too much as compared with the control indicating that higher salinity inhibited the spread of cmla and flor different from cmla and flor the relative abundance of tetc significantly increased as salinities increased p 05 fig 1 it should also be noted that the relative abundance of tetc at 6 salinity was higher than other args integrons such as inti1 are often associated with mobile genetic elements for example transpons and plasmids and act as an indicator of horizontal gene transfer of args hardwick et al 2008 the relative abundance of inti1 at lower salinity 0 5 and 2 was significantly higher than control indicating that lower salinity could enhance horizontal gene transfer of args furthermore the spearman correlations analysis was conducted to determine the correlations between args and inti1 table s3 which indicated that there were no significant correlations between args except sul1 and inti1 under different salinities as shown in fig 1 the relative abundance of sul1 which encodes alternative sulfonamide resistant dihydropteroate synthase and is usually found on the gene cassettes of inti1 was similar with inti1 chen and zhang 2013 to investigate the effect of cathode potentials on the fate of args in bes three cathode potentials 1 25 1 and 0 5 v were applied as shown in fig 2 cathode potential affected the abundances of args the relative abundances of cmla flor sul1 and inti1 genes under 1 25 v and 0 5 v were significantly higher than 1 v p 05 this result suggested that the spread of args could be controlled under 1 v spearman s correlation coefficients between args and inti1 were conducted indicating that there were no significant correlations between args except sul1 and inti1 table s3 temperature is a principal variable affecting the activity of microorganisms in bes liang et al 2016 to determine the effect of temperature on args two bess those with 2 salinity and without salinity were conducted under different temperatures 10 15 and 30 c fig s4a shows that the relative abundances of args and inti1 under 15 c and 10 c were similar both of which were higher than those at 30 c in the bes without salinity for the bes with 2 salinity the relative abundances of args and inti1 at 15 c kept stable comparing with 30 c fig s4b nevertheless the relative abundance at 10 c displayed a significant increase comparing with 30 c p 05 spearman s correlation coefficients between args and inti1 in bes without salinity showed that there were no significant correlations between most args except flor sul1 and inti1 however the relative abundances of args presented significant correlation with that of inti1 in bes with 2 salinity table s3 3 2 cap degradation under different conditions in bes under different salinities the removal efficiencies of cap at the end of reaction are presented in fig 3 the cap removal efficiency at salinity of 0 5 92 5 was higher than the control without salinity 88 3 the cap removal efficiency in salinity of 6 was 49 5 suggesting that high salinity inhibited cap removal efficiency the degradation pathway of cap in bes was revealed by hplc ms analysis amcl2 reduced amine product of cap amcl dechlorinated amcl2 fig s5 the effect of salinity on cap degradation products is shown in fig s6 under control and relatively low salinities 0 5 and 2 the content of amcl2 increased at initial stage and then decreased after reaching a peak in contrast the content of amcl2 increased continuously until 58 h under salinity of 6 in addition almost no amcl was accumulated under salinity of 6 indicating that the further dechlorination of amcl2 to amcl was inhibited under higher salinity in bes cathode potential has an important influence on removing compounds that are difficult to degrade aulenta et al 2009 mu et al 2009 shen et al 2013 as shown in fig s7 the cap degradation efficiency increased as cathode potentials became more negative moreover it is harder to further dechlorinate amcl2 under less negative cathode potential fig s8 cap removal efficiencies under different temperature were shown in fig s9 the cap removal efficiencies of both bess exhibited a similar trend at 30 c and 15 c fig s9 interestingly the bes without salinity at 10 c showed a dramatic decrease in cap removal as compared to 15 c whereas the bes with 2 salinity only experienced slightly reduced performance moreover as shown in fig s10 almost no amcl2 and amcl were generated in the bes without salinity at 10 c whereas the contents of cap degradation products in the bes with 2 salinity at 10 c maintained a high level similar to 15 c 3 3 changes of microbial community the genera level analysis allows us to understand the composition of the microbial community fig 4 the relative abundance of each genera were different under different operating conditions r 1 p 001 by anosim analysis table s4 and salinity affected microbial community structures r 0 95 p 002 by anosim analysis table s4 lysinibacillus and pseudomonas were dominant in the samples collected at 0 5 salinity cathode potential also altered the microbial community structure r 0 92 p 003 by anosim analysis table s4 alkaliphilus acinetobacter were the dominant in samples of 1 25 v however flavobacterium acholeplasma were the dominant in 1 v and halomonas methylophaga were the dominant in 0 5 v fig 4 it has been reported that temperature stress is an important factor for the microbial community structure wells et al 2011 our results showed that temperature also caused obvious changes in microbial community structure at the genera level r 0 86 p 002 by anosim analysis fig s11 and table s4 the dominant species of bes with 2 salinity were different from the bes without salinity fig s11 specially halomonas haliangium byssovorax and methylophaga were dominant in the bes with 2 salinity at 10 c but they were not found in the bes without salinity 3 4 the fate of potential hosts of args as shown in fig 5 20 genera of bacterial might be the potential hosts of the args based on the correlation between args and genera the potential hosts of args cmla flor sul1 under different salinities mainly belonged to pseudomonas byssovorax dechloromonas fig 5 the relative abundance of pseudomonas in salinity of 6 was obviously lower than that in salinity of 0 5 fig 4 it was worth noting that the range of potential hosts for tetc gene was much broader than other args fig 5 the relative abundances of potential hosts for tetc eubacterium candidatus methanogranum longilinea and ornatilinea enhanced as salinity increased fig 4 the main potential hosts of args in the bes under different cathode potentials were halomonas methylophaga fig s12 as shown in fig 4 the relative abundances of main potential hosts under 0 5 v were higher than that under 1 v whereas the relative abundances of main hosts of args were lower in sample of 1 25 v fig 4 for different temperatures the main potential hosts of args in the bes with 2 salinity were byssovorax halomonas methylophaga and erysipelothrix fig s13 the relative abundances of these potential hosts in bes of 10 c with 2 salinity were higher than other temperatures fig s11 however the main potential host bacteria of args in the bes without salinity were denitratisoma erysipelothrix eubacterium and nitrosomonadaceae fig s14 different from those in bes with 2 salinity the relative abundances of these potential hosts in bes without salinity were higher at both 15 c and 10 c than 30 c fig s11 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of variations of args under different conditions this study showed that salinity resulted in an evident variation in the relative abundances of args and inti1 fig 1 the changes in the relative abundances of args is likely due to the variations in the abundances of potential host bacteria and horizontal gene transfer of args among bacteria jia et al 2015 su et al 2015 the lack of correlations between args and inti1 indicated that horizontal gene transfer was not an important factor for the changes in the args except sul1 under different salinities table s3 the variations in the potential host bacteria were the main contributor for the changes in the args the higher relative abundance of main potential host pseudomonas in sample of 0 5 salinity relative to 6 salinity resulted in the reduced abundances of cmla flor and sul1 figs 4 and 5 particularly the relative abundances of main potential hosts eubacterium candidatus methanogranum longilinea and ornatilinea of tetc increased as salinity increased figs 4 and 5 which contributed to the increased relative abundance of tetc fig 1 specially the range of potential hosts of tetc gene was much broader than other args fig 5 resulting in the sufficient abundance of tetc relative to other args at 6 salinity fig 1 in general selection by residual cap is another key mechanism that could contribute to the fate of args in bes and higher cap concentration can result in a higher selection pressure to enhance the propagation of the antibiotic resistant bacteria guo et al 2017b however the higher residual cap in sample of 6 salinity didn t cause higher relative abundances of args except for tetc figs 1 and 3 it was likely due to that the selection pressure imposed by higher salinity was greater than that by residual cap lower salinity 0 5 and 2 enhanced the relative abundance of inti1 indicating the enhanced horizontal gene transfer of args fig 1 the relative abundance of sul1 was similar with inti1 which was consistent with previous study that sul1 is associated with inti1 chen and zhang 2013 cathode potential also affected the relative abundances of args fig 2 horizontal gene transfer was not an important factor for the variations in the args except sul1 under different cathode potentials based on the spearman s correlation results table s3 the variations of args mainly resulted from the shift of arg potential hosts the higher relative abundances of main potential hosts halomonas methylophaga under 0 5 v contributed to the higher relative abundances of args relative to 1 v fig 2 and s12 besides the selection of cathode potential at 0 5 v the residual cap was another contributor to the enhancement of potential hosts of args fig s7 the high relative abundances of args at 1 25 v was due to the increased cell membrane permeability at high cathode potential which enabled entrance of antibiotics and subsequently enhanced the growth of arb guo et al 2017b for different temperatures the main potential hosts of args in the bes with 2 salinity were different from the bes without salinity fig s13 and s14 the relative abundances of potential hosts of the args with 2 salinity byssovorax halomonas methylophaga and erysipelothrix were higher at 10 c relative to other temperatures while the relative abundances of arg potential hosts without salinity denitratisoma erysipelothrix eubacterium and nitrosomonadaceae were higher at both 15 c and 10 c than 30 c the higher relative abundances of potential hosts without salinity were likely due to the selection of low temperature and residual cap fig s9 while that with 2 salinity was only due to the selection of low temperature this different potential hosts of args could account for the difference in the relative abundances of args between the bes with 2 salinity and the bes without salinity at 15 c fig s4 besides the variation of potential hosts horizontal gene transfer was another contributor for the higher abundances of args in the bes at 10 c based on the spearman s correlation result it was consistent with the result above mentioned that the salinity of 2 enhanced horizontal gene transfer the relative abundance of inti1 relative to the bes without salinity this result indicated that the contributors potential hosts bacteria and horizontal gene transfer for the args variations in different temperatures conditions were different from salinities and cathode potential conditions while new insights were gained into the mechanisms underlying the alteration of args in bes several challenges still remain to be addressed the definitive bacteria carrying args should be determined in further studies for example the bacteria strains could be isolated from the bes sludge to identify the bacteria carrying args because the correlation analysis between genera and args only provided a possibility of the hosts of args which should be further confirmed 4 2 mechanisms of variations of cap removal under different conditions we found that cap removal efficiency under lower salinity 0 5 was higher than control fig 3 however cap removal efficiency and further dechlorination of amcl2 to amcl were inhibited under higher salinity fig s6 this result may be due to the altered microbial community driven by salinity fig 4 for example the dominance of 0 5 salinity was pseudomonas which has been reported to play an important role in the degradation of organic pollutants in bes by previous studies nancharaiah et al 2015 venkataraman et al 2010 however pseudomonas was not found in sample of 6 salinity in addition to the altered microbial community the decreased cell activity under higher salinity could also contribute to the difference in cap removal efficiency which has been reported in previous study zhuang et al 2010 cathode potential also affected the performance of bes treating cap wastewater the cap degradation efficiency increased as cathode potentials became more negative fig s7 more electrons for cap reduction partially contributed to the enhanced degradation of cap at 1 25 v liang et al 2009 moreover the dominant bacteria found in sample of 1 25 v alkaliphilus acinetobacter favored the removal of organic pollutants zhang et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 lower temperature 10 c apparently affected the cap removal efficiency in the bes without salinity while it didn t influence the cap removal efficiency in the bes with 2 salinity fig s9 the different dominant species between bes with salinity and bes without salinity partly contributed to the difference in cap removal efficiency fig s11 the dominant bacteria halomonas methylophaga and haliangium were moderately halotolerant microorganism fudou et al 2002 kaye and baross 2004 neufeld et al 2007 it has been reported that the extremophilic microorganism were resistant to many extreme conditions such as salinity condition and cold condition kaye and baross 2004 it was hypothesised that halomonas methylophaga and haliangium were psychrotolerant in addition halomonas methylophaga is able to degrade organic compounds garcia et al 2004 neufeld et al 2007 however they were not found in the bes without salinity fig s11 therefore the halotolerant microorganism might be the reason for the higher cap removal efficiency in the bes with 2 salinity relative to the bes without salinity at 10 c 5 conclusion this study investigated the characteristics of args including args associated with encoding efflux pump cmla flor and tetc and integron sul1 in bes treating cap pharmaceutical wastewater the shift of arg potential hosts resulted from the changed microbial community and horizontal gene transfer are two important factors that strongly affect the fate of args however the shift of args potential hosts rather than horizontal gene transfer was the major factor for the alteration of args except sul1 under different salinities in this study cathode potential and temperature also influenced the fate of args the spread of args could be inhibited under moderate cathode potential 1 v due to the shift of args potential hosts under different temperatures both shift of arg potential hosts and horizontal gene transfer contributed to the variation of args furthermore the degradation of cap varied under different conditions and the microbial community shift was an important factor for the alteration of cap removal the results in our study suggest that bes with a cathode potential 1 v can be a good choice to treat cap pharmaceutical wastewater under moderate salinity 2 salinity and mesophilic condition above 15 c which resulted in low relative abundances of args and high cap removal efficiency this result would provide theoretical reference for the further practical application of this technology to conclude this work presents a comprehensive assessment of shift of args potential hosts for the args alteration which provides valuable insights on the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in bes treating antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater acknowledgments the authors wish to thank the nsfc

19722,recycling of acid from aqueous waste streams is highly important not only from the environmental point of view but also for developing the sustainable technology one of the effective ways to recover acid from aqueous waste streams is the anion exchange membrane based diffusion dialysis the work presents the synthesis and characterization of anion exchange pore filled membranes for the objective of recovery of high concentration of acid by diffusion dialysis the membranes were prepared by anchoring the guest organic inorganic anionic gel in the pores of the host poly propylene membrane by in situ uv initiator induced polymerization of the appropriate monomers along with cross linker the removal of nitric acid in the presence of different representative monovalent divalent and trivalent nitrates and the leakage of these ions through anion exchange membrane have been studied by dd technique for optimizing the chemical composition of the membrane the nitric acid permeation rate of the membrane with the optimized composition has been found to be considerably faster than the commercial selemion membrane without sacrificing salt leakage the performance of the optimized pore filled anion exchange membranes has been found to be independent of the acid concentration nature of the anion and substrate and has been observed to be solely dependent on the guest inorganic organic hybrid anionic gel component the membranes have been found to be stable and reusable for the acid recovery removal of nitric acid as high as 90 from the simulated high level nuclear waste with the optimized grafted pore filled membrane has been achieved with negligible salt transport graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitric acid removal anion exchange membrane pore filled

dimethylformamide etoh ethanol iec ion exchange capacity 1 introduction imbalance in nitrogen cycle due to increased levels of nitrate in the environment may lead to potential health threatening consequences such as methaemoglobinemia due to increased run off of nitrate to aqueous reservoirs such as ground water rivers and lakes duca and koper 2012 and its in vivo reduction to nitrite in cells manassaram et al 2006 mensinga et al 2003 the natural level of nitrate in the environment is maintained by denitrification process however human activities related to improper disposal of nitrate laden domestic sewage agricultural or industrial waste waters introduces excess nitrate in the environment the fuel reprocessing in the nuclear industry is also one of the major sources of high concentration of nitrate in high level waste due to the use of nitric acid in chemical transformations this waste if solidified will account for the significant volume and nitrate presence will affect the integrity of the waste fanning 2000 also if the waste is treated at a higher temperature the nitrates will lead to the possible generation of pollutant gases such as nox fanning 2000 therefore the removal of nitrate from high level nuclear waste needs to be addressed before proper disposal or storage this highly acidic waste also comprises of large number of radioactive fission and corrosion products such as mo zr sr cr ni mn y la ce pr nd sm etc the aim is to yield a high specific activity of these radioactive products in a small volume of acid and nitrate free solution which can be conveniently and safely stored until now the non nuclear industrial nitrate discharges have been dealt with by several artificial denitrification approaches steimke and boyd 2011 such as biological denitrification park and yoo 2009 soares 2000 saad et al 2016 mateju et al 1992 hiscock et al 1991 ghafari et al 2008 chemical fanning 2000 song et al 2017 jung et al 2014 xie et al 2011 garron and epron 2005 marchesini et al 2008 murphy 1991 and electrochemical destruction fanning 2000 rosca et al 2009 barrabes and sa 2011 shen et al 2015 su et al 2017 katsounaros et al 2009 photocatalytic reduction yang et al 2013 hydrothermal decomposition cox et al 1994 hutson and sen 1994 evaporation and crystallization and neutralization with alkalis biological denitrification is a technologically mature approach of reduction of nitrate to nitrogen but the process is slow and difficult to control and the bacterial growth is impaired by the presence of other metal ions in the discharges chemical reduction of nitrate discharges has been explored with several reducing agents fanning 2000 garron and epron 2005 marchesini et al 2008 murphy 1991 but generally these reactions have uncontrollable process conditions which is not desirable also most of the reductants work in the ph range and cannot be applied to highly acidic nuclear waste electrochemical reduction is a relatively controlled and safe mode of nitrate destruction but long term operational stability and maintenance of electrochemical reactors is a major challenge duca and koper 2012 similarly other methods also suffer from inherent shortcomings which still hinder their further developments and applications such as high capital investment massive consumption of energy and alkalis and environmental pollution physical removal of nitrate nitric acid from the waste solution has also been explored by exploiting membrane based processes such as reverse osmosis tepuš et al 2009 häyrynen et al 2009 ion exchange samatya et al 2006 and electrodialysis cherif et al 1988 lindheimer et al 1993 sistat et al 1997 however these processes require a secondary treatment process to decrease the high no3 concentration in their effluents also the reverse osmosis and electrodialysis processes are limited by high energy consumption and are thus not economically feasible diffusion dialysis dd is another ion exchange membrane based process which is well established recognized and demonstrates a significant superiority luo et al 2011 owing to low power consumption and installation and operating cost as the transport driven by the difference in chemical potential of species on either side of the ion exchange membrane the process is thermodynamically favorable also the process is environmentally benign and gives the unique possibility of recycling back the separated components into the production line therefore dd is an attractive technique for the separation and recovery of acid alkali in a cost effective and environmentally friendly manner this is also apparent from the increased number of publications on the development of dd based applications over the years as given by cheng et al 2014 recently a lot of work has been reported on the synthesis of cation exchange membrane with an optimum composition for alkali recovery for different applications liu et al 2014 mondal et al 2015 2016 pan et al 2014 till date dd has been explored for the recovery of inorganic and some organic acids from the discharges from steel production metal refining electroplating non ferrous metal smelting aluminum etching and tungsten ore smelting stancheva 2008 xu and yang 2004 palaty and zakova 2006 agrawal and sahu 2009 tongwen and weihua 2004 however the practical use of the commercial membranes for dd is still under scrutiny since the characteristics needed are very different than membrane characteristics required for other applications like electrodialysis here the membrane should have high proton permeability with ideally no leakage of other cations salts also the stability of commercially available anion exchange membranes at high acidity is in question therefore fabricating membranes with high proton permeability and selectivity over permeation of other cations with high acid stability remains the most challenging issue in acid recovery via dd process recently several authors stachera and childs 2001 cheng et al 2014 hao et al 2013 wang et al 2013 lin et al 2017 2015 have studied the diffusion dialysis of acid solutions containing salts using either poly 4 vinyl pyridine or poly vinylalcohol based membranes however till date dd has not been explored to recover acid from nuclear reprocessing aqueous waste which normally has high concentration 1 3 mol l 1 of hno3 in presence of large number of cations and cannot be discharged without recovering hno3 the recovery of high concentration 1 3 mol l 1 nitric acid from an aqueous waste stream normally encountered at nuclear reprocessing facilities requires an anion exchange membrane having a high anion exchange capacity for providing donnan barrier high water content for fast proton transport by the grotthuss mechanism and high acid transport rate in the present work the different organosiloxane based organic inorganic hybrid pore filled anion exchange membranes have been prepared for exploring the possibility of using the dd process for the recovery of nitric acid from the simulated high level nuclear waste the anion exchange sites have been introduced into the microporous poly propylene substrate by choosing 3 acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride apmac as the monomer the recovery of high concentration of hno3 from nuclear raffinate requires membrane with a dense barrier for preventing leakage of salts with a high permeation rate to achieve this objective the organosiloxane based organic inorganic hybrid anion exchange microgels have been anchored in the pores of host microporous poly propylene membranes by in situ uv initiator induced polymerization for this 3 acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane aptms has been used as the co monomer owing to its ability to form o si o networks in the membrane the co monomer along with the monomer will be covalently anchored in the membrane pores the effects of different cross linkers having multiple polymerizable double bonds 2 4 their content and aptms content on the membrane performance has been explored the optimized membrane has been tested for the recovery of nitric acid from simulated high level waste 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods the pore filled membranes were prepared using poly propylene pp membranes from membrana gmbh germany accurelr pp 1e pore size 0 1 μm and poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf from whatman westranr s pore size 0 2 μm as microporous host substrates the thickness and porosities of these membranes have been given in our earlier publication agarwal et al 2013 in the present study commercial membrane selemion asahi glass co ltd was also used the monomer 3 acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride apmac co monomer 3 acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane aptms uv initiator 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenyl acetophenone dmpa were obtained from sigma aldrich steinheim switzerland three different cross linkers namely ethylene glycol dimethacrylate egdma trimethylol propane trimethacrylate tmptma and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate peta were also obtained from sigma aldrich steinheim switzerland the chemical structures of the monomer co monomer and cross linkers used are shown in fig 1 a f respectively n n dimethylformamide dmf and ethanol etoh were obtained from merck mumbai india deionized water 18 m ω cm gradient a 10 model milli q usa were used in the present experiments 2 2 preparation of anion exchange pore filled membrane anion exchange pore filled membranes were prepared by uv initiator induced in situ polymerization using a procedure given in our earlier paper agarwal et al 2013 the method was chosen over other polymerization methods owing to uniform polymerization less stringent polymerization conditions and negligible polymer matrix damage achieved in this mode of polymerization the host membranes 6 6 cm2 size were presoaked in methanol for 2 h the polymerizing solution was prepared by dissolving the monomer 3 acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride apmac co monomer 3 acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane aptms and uv initiator 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenyl acetophenone dmpa in 1 2 ratio of dmf ethanol both monomer and co monomer will be covalently anchored in the pp membrane pores after polymerization the minimum amount of uv initiator required for initiating polymerization i e 1 wt was used along with these components one of the cross linkers egdma tmptma peta was also added to the monomer solution to achieve a cross linked network in the membrane the clear solution was further homogenized by ultrasonication for 15 min then the membranes were soaked for overnight in this polymerizing solution after soaking an excess of polymerizing solution adhering to the surface was removed these solution filled membranes were sandwiched between two transparent polyester sheets to prevent any possible loss of solution filled in the pores the sandwiched membranes were uv irradiated at 365 nm for 15 min in a multi lamps photoreactor heber scientific model no hml sw mw lw 888 having eight 8 w uv lamps arranged in a circle the un polymerized components were then removed by washing membranes thoroughly with dmf methanol mixture the samples were washed till a constant weight was obtained and were then vacuum dried at 40 c the amount of cross linked microgel anchored in the polymer matrix was obtained gravimetrically as 1 mass gain w f w i w i x 100 where w i and w f are the weights of the nascent and the grafted membranes respectively 2 3 characterization the feg sem images of the nascent and the grafted pp membranes were taken using feg sem model no jsm 7600f with a resolution of 1 0 nm 15 kv and 1 5 nm 1 kv the instrument had an accelerating voltage range from 0 1 to 30 kv with magnification from 25 to 1 000 000 the distribution of grafted chains across the thickness of iodide loaded grafted pp membrane was obtained by monitoring the distribution of si and i with an edx spectrometer attached to feg sem the water uptake capacity of the pore filled pp membranes was measured by converting the membrane to nitrate form the membrane was then oven dried at 50 c and weighed to get wf dry the membrane was then equilibrated in water for overnight and weighed to get wf wet after removal of surface water with tissue paper each measurement was repeated three times to get average wf dry and wf wet the water uptake capacity defined as the amount of water absorbed per unit dry weight of the membrane was determined from the difference between the weight wf wet of water equilibrated membrane sample and corresponding dry weight wf dry of membrane sample 2 water uptake capacity w f wet w f dry w f dry x 100 the volume fraction of water in the membrane matrix φ w can be determined by the following equation 3 ϕ w δ w d w δ w d w w d d p where δw difference of weight in the dry and wet state dp density of dry membrane wd weight of dry membrane d w density of water the ion exchange capacity iec of the pore filled membrane samples were measured using 131i radiotracer the membrane sample was equilibrated overnight in 20 ml well stirred ki solution 0 1 mol l 1 containing a known amount of 131i radioactivity filter paper standard was prepared by taking whatman 41 filter paper of the same dimensions 2 2 cm2 as the membrane samples spreading known volume 100 μl of radiolabeled 0 1 moll 1 ki stock solution on these substrates and gently drying under ir lamp ki stock solution used for preparing standard samples contained same 131i radioactive to 127i natural ratio as in solution used for equilibrating the membrane samples the standards and samples were prepared in duplicate the membrane samples and filter paper standard were counted in a well type nai tl detector having fixed counting geometry the ion exchange capacity was obtained by comparing counts of the gamma ray peak of 131i in the membrane and the filter paper samples as given below 4 ion exchange capacity a mem m fp a fp w

membrane sample respectively 2 4 diffusion dialysis experiments the diffusion dialysis experiments were performed using a two compartment cell with the membrane with an active area of 7 1 cm2 sandwiched in between the two compartments 15 ml volume each see fig s1 supporting information s i the cell temperature was maintained at 27 0 5 c both compartments were stirred at a constant rate 500 rpm throughout the experiment to minimize concentration polarization effects to start with the acid of known concentration was taken as feed solution and de ionized water as a receiver in the present work 1 and 3 mol l 1 hno3 and 1 mol l 1 hcl were used in the feed the leakage of different monovalent divalent and trivalent cations through pore filled anion exchange membrane were studied by adding representative nano3 6 5 g l ba no3 2 0 2 g l and fe no3 3 2 g l salts in the feed the concentration of these salts was taken as total salt concentrations of the respective valence expected in high level waste this was done since the leakage of ions takes place due to the breaking of donnan barrier which is a strong function of the valence of the cation the transport of acid was monitored by aliquoting 0 1 ml solution from each compartment at regular time intervals and titrating it with standardized naoh using phenolphthalein as an acid base indicator all the experiments were carried out for approximately 6 h after which aliquots were taken from both the compartments to check elemental distribution by icp aes spectro arcos germany with a charged coupled device ccd as a detector the detector system consisting of linear arrays of ccd detectors 3648 pixels array thermally stabilized together with an optical system provides the ability to choose the alternate analytical lines multi elemental standard solutions e merck darmstadt germany were used to obtain calibration curve in the desired concentration range for the elements under study the dialysis coefficient u of the membrane for each component is given by the amount of the component that is transported per unit active membrane area per unit time and per unit concentration difference of the component yang et al 2013 i e 5 u m a t δ c where m is the amount of component transported in moles a the active membrane area in square meters t is the time in hours and δc is the average concentration in the two chambers in moles per cubic meters given as 6 δ c c f o c f t c d t ln c f o c d t c f t where c f o and c f t are the feed concentrations at t 0 and t respectively and c d t is the concentration of the permeate solution at time t stachera and childs 2001 the preferential diffusion of one species over another is given by the corresponding selectivity given as the ratio of the overall dialysis coefficients of the reference species in this case hno3 to the overall dialysis coefficient of the species cations present in the solution the larger the selectivity the higher is the preference for the reference species with respect to the other cationic species present in the solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of pore filled membranes table 1 gives the compositions of the polymerizing solutions used for pore filling pp microporous substrates to vary the ion exchange concentration and degree of hydrophobicity of the membranes the polymerization was carried with varying proportions of quaternary ammonium bearing monomer apmac inorganic matrix forming silane monomer aptms and cross linker three different cross linkers having two three and four polymerizable double bonds were employed as shown in fig 1 the mass gain in the membranes after grafting and the corresponding uncertainties obtained by averaging the results for 3 4 samples are also given in table 1 for all the polymerizing solution compositions mass gain 100 wt was obtained showing a high degree of pore filling this is also evident from the feg sem images of the two surfaces of the nascent and grafted aem 3 membrane shown in fig 2 a d as seen from the images of the nascent and the grafted membranes the pore openings are uniformly filled by the polymer microgel the morphology of the polymer microgel inside the pores of the grafted membrane was studied from the cross sectional feg sem images of both the nascent and the grafted membrane aem 3 and are given in fig 2 e and f as seen from the images the membrane had dense nonporous layers at both the surfaces and had porous structure inside thus the effective dense layer for diffusion of acid appeared to be smaller than the thickness of the membrane to understand the spatial distribution of the polymer microgel inside the pores the aem 3 membrane was loaded with i ion and the spatial distributions of si and i was seen by eds mapping using feg sem as seen from fig 3 both si and i were uniformly distributed across the thickness of the membrane the grafted pore filled membranes were characterized for the mass gain thickness water uptake volume fraction of water molecules ion exchange capacity and average water molecules per ion exchange site the results of the measurements are summarized in table 1 as seen from the table the mass gain increased with increase in cross linker egdma from 5 to 10 the mass gain also increased with increase in the alkoxy silane aptms content irrespective of the cross linker and degree of cross linking also it was interesting to note from table 1 that the thickness of all the grafted membranes reduced relative to the pristine membrane this could be related to the highly cross linked network formed in the pores of the membrane due to the presence of cross linker and or alkoxy silane in the membrane which leads to the shrinking of the membrane with respect to the pristine membrane however as silane content increased for a particular composition of cross linker the thickness of the membrane increased this could be explained based on the increased mass gain of the membrane with increasing silane content thereby possibly resulting in stretching of the polymer matrix stachera et al 1998 had also reported the increased mass gain in the membrane that resulted in the stretching of the polymer matrix and increases in thickness of the membrane water uptake is considered as an important membrane parameter with a profound effect on its ion transport characteristics and it s dimensional as well as mechanical properties wang et al 2013 the presence of water molecules in the pores of the membrane facilitates the transport of ions and water molecules however it reduces the dimensional and mechanical stability of the membrane this parameter is mainly related to the ionic concentration in the membrane and its cross linking degree in the present study the grafted membranes exhibited considerable water uptake than the hydrophobic pristine poly propylene membrane owing to the hydrophilic nature of the hybrid inorganic organic microgels grafted in the pores of the membranes as can be seen from table 1 the water content in the pore filled membrane was found to be highly dependent on the extent of quaternary ammonium bearing monomer units apmac in the polymerized microgel and degree of cross linking the increase in hydrophobic alkoxy silane aptms content in the membrane and degree of cross linking lead to decrease in the water content of the membrane this was attributed to the increase in cross linking which restricts the swelling in the polymeric gel thereby reducing the free volume of the microporous gel present in the membrane as suggested by the free volume theory of polymers cohen and turnbull 1959 along with water uptake the physiochemical stability of the grafted pore filled membranes was also assessed by the change in volume fraction of the membrane in water and the swelling ratio table 1 the presence of large water volume fraction within the membrane matrix may significantly affect the ionic concentration dimensional as well as thermo mechanical stabilities of the membrane generally the degree of water swelling is decided by the balance between the absorbing ability of quaternary ammonium groups and the resisting ability of the hydrophobic components as seen from table 1 both the volume fraction and swelling ratio follows the same trend as water uptake attributed to the decrease of quaternary ammonium groups and the increased formation of o si o networks in the membrane the ion exchange capacity iec of a membrane is a measure of the density of dissociable ionic groups present in the membrane this is an important property which determines the ion conduction and salt leakage across the membrane the ion exchange capacity of the grafted membranes in the absence of aptms as co monomer aem1 aem4 aem7 and aem10 remained practically constant showing the same monomer content in all the membranes this is expected since the initial monomer content in the polymerizing solution in all these membranes was kept constant irrespective of the cross linkers the ion exchange capacity decreased with increasing aptms content in the membrane see table 1 this was expected as the membranes were prepared with a fixed mole proportion of monomer apmac and co monomer aptms therefore as the co monomer fraction increased the corresponding monomer fraction decreased this was also apparent from the decreased water content of the membranes with decreasing quaternary ammonium fraction 3 2 diffusion dialysis studies the performance of the synthesized grafted pore filled anion exchange membranes aem 1 aem 12 and commercial anion exchange membrane selemion for acid recovery application were evaluated by carrying out the diffusion dialysis experiments with the nitric acid and deionized water in the feed and receiver compartments respectively the dialysis experiments were performed at two initial acid concentrations 1 mol l 1 and 3 mol l 1 the representative monovalent divalent and trivalent nitrates nano3 ba no3 2 and fe no3 3 respectively were added to the feed solution to study the leakage of salts through the anion exchange membranes the acid concentrations in the feed c f and diffusate c d was studied as a function of time till the equilibrium reached or upto 6 h and the concentration of the cations in the two compartments were measured at the end of each experiment fig 4 shows a time profile of acid in the feed and diffusate for the grafted pore filled anion exchange membrane aem 1 it can be seen that the acid concentration in the feed decreased and diffusate increased with time till equilibrium was achieved the driving force for the acid transport to the diffusate is the concentration gradient across the anion exchange membrane which decreases with time similar transport profile of acid was observed for the commercial selemion membrane as shown in fig 4 this indicated the synthesized pore filled anion exchange membrane is effective to recover nitric acid by dd process however for the commercial membrane the time profile of acid transport was found to be very slow with the equilibrium not reaching even in 6 h which was also apparent from the dialysis coefficients calculated based on changes in concentration in both the compartments of a dialysis cell the results are shown in fig 5 a and are also compiled in table s1 s i the acid dialysis coefficients of the commercial membrane were observed to be much lower than for the synthesized pore filled anion exchange membrane aem 1 this was due to the lower water uptake and iec of the commercial membrane as compared to aem 1 also the selectivity of the membrane for the reference hno3 species with respect to the cations was calculated and the results are shown in fig 5 b and table s2 s i it is evident from fig 5 a and b that with the increase in cation valency while the salt dialysis coefficients decreased and the selectivity of the acid over the salts increased this could be attributed to the fact that as the charge on the cation increases more efficient exclusion of the cation by the membrane is expected owing to the increasing electrostatic repulsion by the membrane fixed positive charges also for a membrane to be successfully used for a dd process along with high acid dialysis coefficients the dialysis coefficients of the salts should be less but as can be seen from table s1 s i the dialysis coefficients of all the three salts nano3 ba no3 2 and fe no3 3 are quite high as compared to the commercial membrane thereby making the selectivity of the acid wrt the salts much lower than the commercial membrane see table s2 s i the comparison is more clearly shown in fig 5 the leakage of salts through an ion exchange membrane will depend on the water content and ion exchange capacity of the membranes as explained earlier in the text these parameters will in turn be a strong function of the type of cross linker degree of cross linking and silane content in the grafted pore filled membranes unlike commercial membranes these parameters can be easily tuned in grafted pore filled membranes to achieve desired results therefore the effect of these parameters on the transport of protons and the leakage of salts through all these membranes was systematically studied 3 3 effect of degree of cross linking and the type of cross linker on dialysis coefficient and selectivity cross linking can be used to vary the diffusion characteristics of ions molecules through a polymer geise et al 2014 generally the salt is believed to diffuse through the water swollen polymeric gel present in the membrane pores geise et al 2014 as cross linking is increased it is expected to restrict the swelling of the polymeric gel thereby reducing the acid as well as salt diffusion coefficients in the material due to the small size and different mechanism of transport through the membrane protons experience less hindrance compared to other cations this is also seen from the acid transport profile through membranes with different cross linking fig s2 s i the transport profiles were found to overlap with each other suggesting the proton transport was not affected due to change in cross linking as it occurs through water channels however the increase in cross linking was expected to affect the acid salt selectivity of the membrane it is seen from fig 6 a and b that the cross linking had affected the dialysis coefficient of acid and salts and the acid selectivity over salts significantly i e the acid dialysis coefficients increased with the increase in cross linking but the dialysis coefficients for the salts were decreased therefore the selectivity of the acid over salts increased as the degree of cross linking increased along with the increase in the degree of cross linking the density of the cross linked networks can also be increased by using the cross linker having multiple polymerizing double bonds tmptma and peta as shown in fig 1 the results of the dialysis coefficients of the acid and salts and the selectivity of the acid transport over salts are also given in fig 6 a and b it can be seen that relative to egdma aem 1 the dialysis coefficients of the acid increased and salts decreased as the number of double bonds per molecule increased the results were also reflected in the increase in selectivity of the acid transport relative to all the three salts fig 6 b however as seen from fig 6 b the selectivity of acid transport is higher in aem 4 relative to aem 7 and aem 10 showing more cross linked network in the former this could be due to the bunching of polymer chains with higher cross linking leading to low density region in the polymer matrix that would be less effective in the screening of salts this is also apparent from the lower water content of this membrane aem 4 relative to other three further increase in the degree of cross linking for tmptma and peta could not be achieved owing to shrinking of the membrane at higher cross linking therefore further studies were carried out with egdma as a cross linker 3 4 effect of alkoxy silane content on dialysis coefficient and selectivity the leakage of salts through ion exchange membrane can also be reduced by increasing the hydrophobic content of the membrane this will reduce the water content in the membrane thereby reducing the diffusivity of the salt in the membrane therefore acid dialysis experiments were carried out with membranes containing silane as comonomer aem 2 aem 3 aem 5 and aem 6 as given in table 1 these membranes have less water content relative to their counterparts with no silane also the presence of alkoxy silane moiety will introduce o si o network in the membrane thereby increasing the cross linked network in the membrane this is also expected to reduce the leakage of salts through grafted pore filled anion exchange membranes fig s2 s i shows the acid transport profile in receiver compartment for membranes with varying silane content aem 1 aem 3 nearly 50 transport of acid was observed in all the cases with the transport rate becoming slower with increasing silane content this was expected due to the formation of increased cross linked o si o networks in the membrane pores leading to decrease in the free volume and water content of the membrane fig 7 a and b shows the dialysis coefficient of acids and salts and selectivity of acid over salts for membranes with increasing silane content corresponding to two different degrees of cross linking of egdma 5 and 10 it is interesting to see from the figure that for membranes with 5 egdma aem 1 3 on introduction of silane in the membrane there is a increase in dialysis coefficient of acid by 17 but the dialysis coefficients of salts decreases by 62 85 this slight increase in the dialysis coefficient of acid show that the introduction of o si o networks although are capable enough to reduce leakage of salts proton being tiny is still passing comfortably this is possible since the migration of protons across the membrane can occur by both diffusion and by grotthus mechanism lorrain et al 1996 the dialysis coefficient of acid is however reduced on further increasing the silane content aem 3 it is also evident from the figure that for the 10 egdma content as the silane content increased while dialysis coefficients decreased for all the four species the selectivity of acid over salts increased it is to be noted here that for aem 3 and aem 6 the elemental concentration of iron in the receiver compartment was found to be lower than the detection limit of icp aes therefore for these two cases iron could not be determined and was assumed to be absent thereby leading to zero dialysis coefficients of iron salt as given in table s1 this leads to very high selectivity of h fe in case of aem 3 and aem 6 among all the synthesized pore filled membranes aem 3 and aem 6 have a higher selectivity for all the ions compared to the commercial membrane however aem 6 membrane was found to be brittle and difficult to handle owing to the higher degree of cross linking along with higher silane content also the transport rate of acid was 2 times higher with aem 3 in comparison with aem 6 therefore further studies were carried out with aem 3 membrane 3 5 effects of acid concentration on dd process the leakage of acid and salts may also be affected by the concentration of the acid which needs to be recovered therefore to check the acidity dependent transport the acid dialysis experiments were carried out at two acid concentrations 1 and 3 mol l 1 keeping all the other conditions same for all the synthesized pore filled membranes irrespective of the feed acidity the transport of acid was not affected as seen in fig s3 s i fig 8 shows the dialysis coefficients for acid and salts for two representative membranes aem 3 it can be seen that while the acid dialysis coefficient slightly decreased the salt dialysis practically remained same a slight decrease of acid dialysis coefficient may be due to the decrease in the membrane swelling followed by the dehydration of the membrane resulting in the increasing frictional resistance to ion transport at high concentrations hao et al 2013 3 6 effect of anion on the dd process since the transport of proton through the anion exchange membrane is always accompanied by the transport of the corresponding anion through the membrane to maintain electrical neutrality the diffusivity of the proton may be affected by the nature of the anion in the present studies the effect of anion on the dd of acid was investigated by replacing nitric acid with hydrochloric acid and monitoring the proton transport using a representative aem 3 membrane fig 9 shows the transport profile of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid through aem 3 membrane it can be seen that the transport profiles overlap with each other showing that the nature of anions does not significantly affect the dd process through the synthesized pore filled anion exchange membranes 3 7 effect of the microporous substrate on the dd process the diffusivity of acid through the membrane may also be governed by the nature of the membrane matrix with the diffusivity expected to be faster when the membrane matrix is more hydrophilic to study the microporous substrate effect dd of acid was studied using a grafted pore filled membrane with pvdf as microporous substrate and same composition as aem 3 as seen from fig 10 the substrate did not have any effect on the transport of acid so membrane prepared with the different substrate can be used for dd process thus the transport process of acid is only dependent on the composition of the guest inorganic organic micro gel and host membrane could be changed depending upon the suitability this is important for acid dialysis from nuclear waste where conveniently a radiation resistant microporous substrate can be chosen 3 8 stability and reusability for the pore filled membranes to be applied successfully for dd their response should be reproducible to check the stability and reusability of the synthesized membrane a representative aem 3 was subjected to a repeated number of dd cycles after each cycle the acid transport and metal ions distribution were checked as seen from fig 11 the acid transport profile remained same even after four runs and also element transport also remained same confirming the stability and reusability of the membrane 3 9 application for recovery of nitric acid from simulated high level waste based on the nitric acid recovery studies in the presence of representative monovalent divalent and trivalent salts the optimized pore filled membrane aem 3 was used for the acid recovery from simulated high level waste shlw the composition of the shlw is same as the high level waste composition of a pressurized heavy water reactor burn up 7000 mwd t this waste contains a large number of metal ions as given in table s3 s i in an acidity of 3 mol l 1 hno3 dd experiments were carried out with shlw as a feed and de ionized water as a receiver using aem 3 membrane the experiment was also repeated with the commercial selemion membrane for comparison acid transport and equilibrium metal ions distribution were monitored as expected for both the commercial and synthesized membranes acid profile from shlw overlapped with the 3 mol l 1 hno3 acid profiles representative matching is shown in fig 11 for aem 3 membrane fig 12 shows the metal ion concentrations initially present in the shlw and the receiver after dd process for both the commercial and synthesized anion exchange membranes it can be seen that compared to commercial membrane the performance of the synthesized pore filled aem was found to be much better in stopping the leakage of metal ions and nitric acid with very low metal concentration was recovered effectively this shows that the synthesized pore filled membrane can be used for recovery of acid from shlw 3 10 flow experiments in all the batch dialysis experiments carried out so far nearly 50 transport of acid to the diffusate was observed as equal volumes of the feed and diffusate were used in the experiments however this is not sufficient for successful application of dd for removal of nitric acid from high level nuclear waste therefore an attempt was carried out to increase the acid transport by increasing the volume of diffusate for this while the feed and diffusate compartment volumes were fixed as 15 ml fresh diffusate i e de ionized water was introduced in the diffusate at a flow rate of 45 ml h and removed at the same rate in this way a constant driving force for the transport of acid across the anion exchange membrane was maintained the dialysis experiment was continued for 6 h and the transport of proton in the feed and diffusate was monitored as a function of time the salt leakage was measured at the equilibrium in both the compartments the dd experiments were carried out with aem 3 and the results were compared with the commercial selemion membrane fig 13 a shows the acid transport time profiles in the feed and diffusate and fig 13 b shows the ionic composition of the receiver for both the membranes it can be seen from the two figures that while the leakage of ions was comparable for both the membranes the acid recovery was significantly more in the synthesized pore filled membranes after 6 h in case of the commercial membrane while only 20 40 of the acid was removed from the feed 90 of the acid was removed when synthesized pore filled anion exchange membrane aem 3 was used this shows successful application of the dd technique with the synthesized organic inorganic hybrid membranes for the removal of nitric acid from acidic high level waste 4 conclusion the work explores the possibility of recovery of acid from highly acidic aqueous waste streams encountered in high level waste from nuclear industry using diffusion dialysis a novel pore filled anion exchange membrane with hybrid organic inorganic gel framework in the microporous substrate has been developed for this purpose this class of membranes has a high water content required to transport protons by grotthus mechanism has high ion exchange capacity 0 85 meq g to transport counterions no3 cl and a dense barrier to prevent transport of metal cations the membranes are easy to synthesize are reusable and the response has been found to be reproducible also the response of the membranes has been found to be better than commercial membrane and is found to be independent of the microporous substrate and acid concentrations and depends only on the composition of the organic inorganic gel the membrane has been

19722,recycling of acid from aqueous waste streams is highly important not only from the environmental point of view but also for developing the sustainable technology one of the effective ways to recover acid from aqueous waste streams is the anion exchange membrane based diffusion dialysis the work presents the synthesis and characterization of anion exchange pore filled membranes for the objective of recovery of high concentration of acid by diffusion dialysis the membranes were prepared by anchoring the guest organic inorganic anionic gel in the pores of the host poly propylene membrane by in situ uv initiator induced polymerization of the appropriate monomers along with cross linker the removal of nitric acid in the presence of different representative monovalent divalent and trivalent nitrates and the leakage of these ions through anion exchange membrane have been studied by dd technique for optimizing the chemical composition of the membrane the nitric acid permeation rate of the membrane with the optimized composition has been found to be considerably faster than the commercial selemion membrane without sacrificing salt leakage the performance of the optimized pore filled anion exchange membranes has been found to be independent of the acid concentration nature of the anion and substrate and has been observed to be solely dependent on the guest inorganic organic hybrid anionic gel component the membranes have been found to be stable and reusable for the acid recovery removal of nitric acid as high as 90 from the simulated high level nuclear waste with the optimized grafted pore filled membrane has been achieved with negligible salt transport graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitric acid removal anion exchange membrane pore filled

dimethylformamide etoh ethanol iec ion exchange capacity 1 introduction imbalance in nitrogen cycle due to increased levels of nitrate in the environment may lead to potential health threatening consequences such as methaemoglobinemia due to increased run off of nitrate to aqueous reservoirs such as ground water rivers and lakes duca and koper 2012 and its in vivo reduction to nitrite in cells manassaram et al 2006 mensinga et al 2003 the natural level of nitrate in the environment is maintained by denitrification process however human activities related to improper disposal of nitrate laden domestic sewage agricultural or industrial waste waters introduces excess nitrate in the environment the fuel reprocessing in the nuclear industry is also one of the major sources of high concentration of nitrate in high level waste due to the use of nitric acid in chemical transformations this waste if solidified will account for the significant volume and nitrate presence will affect the integrity of the waste fanning 2000 also if the waste is treated at a higher temperature the nitrates will lead to the possible generation of pollutant gases such as nox fanning 2000 therefore the removal of nitrate from high level nuclear waste needs to be addressed before proper disposal or storage this highly acidic waste also comprises of large number of radioactive fission and corrosion products such as mo zr sr cr ni mn y la ce pr nd sm etc the aim is to yield a high specific activity of these radioactive products in a small volume of acid and nitrate free solution which can be conveniently and safely stored until now the non nuclear industrial nitrate discharges have been dealt with by several artificial denitrification approaches steimke and boyd 2011 such as biological denitrification park and yoo 2009 soares 2000 saad et al 2016 mateju et al 1992 hiscock et al 1991 ghafari et al 2008 chemical fanning 2000 song et al 2017 jung et al 2014 xie et al 2011 garron and epron 2005 marchesini et al 2008 murphy 1991 and electrochemical destruction fanning 2000 rosca et al 2009 barrabes and sa 2011 shen et al 2015 su et al 2017 katsounaros et al 2009 photocatalytic reduction yang et al 2013 hydrothermal decomposition cox et al 1994 hutson and sen 1994 evaporation and crystallization and neutralization with alkalis biological denitrification is a technologically mature approach of reduction of nitrate to nitrogen but the process is slow and difficult to control and the bacterial growth is impaired by the presence of other metal ions in the discharges chemical reduction of nitrate discharges has been explored with several reducing agents fanning 2000 garron and epron 2005 marchesini et al 2008 murphy 1991 but generally these reactions have uncontrollable process conditions which is not desirable also most of the reductants work in the ph range and cannot be applied to highly acidic nuclear waste electrochemical reduction is a relatively controlled and safe mode of nitrate destruction but long term operational stability and maintenance of electrochemical reactors is a major challenge duca and koper 2012 similarly other methods also suffer from inherent shortcomings which still hinder their further developments and applications such as high capital investment massive consumption of energy and alkalis and environmental pollution physical removal of nitrate nitric acid from the waste solution has also been explored by exploiting membrane based processes such as reverse osmosis tepuš et al 2009 häyrynen et al 2009 ion exchange samatya et al 2006 and electrodialysis cherif et al 1988 lindheimer et al 1993 sistat et al 1997 however these processes require a secondary treatment process to decrease the high no3 concentration in their effluents also the reverse osmosis and electrodialysis processes are limited by high energy consumption and are thus not economically feasible diffusion dialysis dd is another ion exchange membrane based process which is well established recognized and demonstrates a significant superiority luo et al 2011 owing to low power consumption and installation and operating cost as the transport driven by the difference in chemical potential of species on either side of the ion exchange membrane the process is thermodynamically favorable also the process is environmentally benign and gives the unique possibility of recycling back the separated components into the production line therefore dd is an attractive technique for the separation and recovery of acid alkali in a cost effective and environmentally friendly manner this is also apparent from the increased number of publications on the development of dd based applications over the years as given by cheng et al 2014 recently a lot of work has been reported on the synthesis of cation exchange membrane with an optimum composition for alkali recovery for different applications liu et al 2014 mondal et al 2015 2016 pan et al 2014 till date dd has been explored for the recovery of inorganic and some organic acids from the discharges from steel production metal refining electroplating non ferrous metal smelting aluminum etching and tungsten ore smelting stancheva 2008 xu and yang 2004 palaty and zakova 2006 agrawal and sahu 2009 tongwen and weihua 2004 however the practical use of the commercial membranes for dd is still under scrutiny since the characteristics needed are very different than membrane characteristics required for other applications like electrodialysis here the membrane should have high proton permeability with ideally no leakage of other cations salts also the stability of commercially available anion exchange membranes at high acidity is in question therefore fabricating membranes with high proton permeability and selectivity over permeation of other cations with high acid stability remains the most challenging issue in acid recovery via dd process recently several authors stachera and childs 2001 cheng et al 2014 hao et al 2013 wang et al 2013 lin et al 2017 2015 have studied the diffusion dialysis of acid solutions containing salts using either poly 4 vinyl pyridine or poly vinylalcohol based membranes however till date dd has not been explored to recover acid from nuclear reprocessing aqueous waste which normally has high concentration 1 3 mol l 1 of hno3 in presence of large number of cations and cannot be discharged without recovering hno3 the recovery of high concentration 1 3 mol l 1 nitric acid from an aqueous waste stream normally encountered at nuclear reprocessing facilities requires an anion exchange membrane having a high anion exchange capacity for providing donnan barrier high water content for fast proton transport by the grotthuss mechanism and high acid transport rate in the present work the different organosiloxane based organic inorganic hybrid pore filled anion exchange membranes have been prepared for exploring the possibility of using the dd process for the recovery of nitric acid from the simulated high level nuclear waste the anion exchange sites have been introduced into the microporous poly propylene substrate by choosing 3 acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride apmac as the monomer the recovery of high concentration of hno3 from nuclear raffinate requires membrane with a dense barrier for preventing leakage of salts with a high permeation rate to achieve this objective the organosiloxane based organic inorganic hybrid anion exchange microgels have been anchored in the pores of host microporous poly propylene membranes by in situ uv initiator induced polymerization for this 3 acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane aptms has been used as the co monomer owing to its ability to form o si o networks in the membrane the co monomer along with the monomer will be covalently anchored in the membrane pores the effects of different cross linkers having multiple polymerizable double bonds 2 4 their content and aptms content on the membrane performance has been explored the optimized membrane has been tested for the recovery of nitric acid from simulated high level waste 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods the pore filled membranes were prepared using poly propylene pp membranes from membrana gmbh germany accurelr pp 1e pore size 0 1 μm and poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf from whatman westranr s pore size 0 2 μm as microporous host substrates the thickness and porosities of these membranes have been given in our earlier publication agarwal et al 2013 in the present study commercial membrane selemion asahi glass co ltd was also used the monomer 3 acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride apmac co monomer 3 acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane aptms uv initiator 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenyl acetophenone dmpa were obtained from sigma aldrich steinheim switzerland three different cross linkers namely ethylene glycol dimethacrylate egdma trimethylol propane trimethacrylate tmptma and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate peta were also obtained from sigma aldrich steinheim switzerland the chemical structures of the monomer co monomer and cross linkers used are shown in fig 1 a f respectively n n dimethylformamide dmf and ethanol etoh were obtained from merck mumbai india deionized water 18 m ω cm gradient a 10 model milli q usa were used in the present experiments 2 2 preparation of anion exchange pore filled membrane anion exchange pore filled membranes were prepared by uv initiator induced in situ polymerization using a procedure given in our earlier paper agarwal et al 2013 the method was chosen over other polymerization methods owing to uniform polymerization less stringent polymerization conditions and negligible polymer matrix damage achieved in this mode of polymerization the host membranes 6 6 cm2 size were presoaked in methanol for 2 h the polymerizing solution was prepared by dissolving the monomer 3 acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride apmac co monomer 3 acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane aptms and uv initiator 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenyl acetophenone dmpa in 1 2 ratio of dmf ethanol both monomer and co monomer will be covalently anchored in the pp membrane pores after polymerization the minimum amount of uv initiator required for initiating polymerization i e 1 wt was used along with these components one of the cross linkers egdma tmptma peta was also added to the monomer solution to achieve a cross linked network in the membrane the clear solution was further homogenized by ultrasonication for 15 min then the membranes were soaked for overnight in this polymerizing solution after soaking an excess of polymerizing solution adhering to the surface was removed these solution filled membranes were sandwiched between two transparent polyester sheets to prevent any possible loss of solution filled in the pores the sandwiched membranes were uv irradiated at 365 nm for 15 min in a multi lamps photoreactor heber scientific model no hml sw mw lw 888 having eight 8 w uv lamps arranged in a circle the un polymerized components were then removed by washing membranes thoroughly with dmf methanol mixture the samples were washed till a constant weight was obtained and were then vacuum dried at 40 c the amount of cross linked microgel anchored in the polymer matrix was obtained gravimetrically as 1 mass gain w f w i w i x 100 where w i and w f are the weights of the nascent and the grafted membranes respectively 2 3 characterization the feg sem images of the nascent and the grafted pp membranes were taken using feg sem model no jsm 7600f with a resolution of 1 0 nm 15 kv and 1 5 nm 1 kv the instrument had an accelerating voltage range from 0 1 to 30 kv with magnification from 25 to 1 000 000 the distribution of grafted chains across the thickness of iodide loaded grafted pp membrane was obtained by monitoring the distribution of si and i with an edx spectrometer attached to feg sem the water uptake capacity of the pore filled pp membranes was measured by converting the membrane to nitrate form the membrane was then oven dried at 50 c and weighed to get wf dry the membrane was then equilibrated in water for overnight and weighed to get wf wet after removal of surface water with tissue paper each measurement was repeated three times to get average wf dry and wf wet the water uptake capacity defined as the amount of water absorbed per unit dry weight of the membrane was determined from the difference between the weight wf wet of water equilibrated membrane sample and corresponding dry weight wf dry of membrane sample 2 water uptake capacity w f wet w f dry w f dry x 100 the volume fraction of water in the membrane matrix φ w can be determined by the following equation 3 ϕ w δ w d w δ w d w w d d p where δw difference of weight in the dry and wet state dp density of dry membrane wd weight of dry membrane d w density of water the ion exchange capacity iec of the pore filled membrane samples were measured using 131i radiotracer the membrane sample was equilibrated overnight in 20 ml well stirred ki solution 0 1 mol l 1 containing a known amount of 131i radioactivity filter paper standard was prepared by taking whatman 41 filter paper of the same dimensions 2 2 cm2 as the membrane samples spreading known volume 100 μl of radiolabeled 0 1 moll 1 ki stock solution on these substrates and gently drying under ir lamp ki stock solution used for preparing standard samples contained same 131i radioactive to 127i natural ratio as in solution used for equilibrating the membrane samples the standards and samples were prepared in duplicate the membrane samples and filter paper standard were counted in a well type nai tl detector having fixed counting

membrane sample respectively 2 4 diffusion dialysis experiments the diffusion dialysis experiments were performed using a two compartment cell with the membrane with an active area of 7 1 cm2 sandwiched in between the two compartments 15 ml volume each see fig s1 supporting information s i the cell temperature was maintained at 27 0 5 c both compartments were stirred at a constant rate 500 rpm throughout the experiment to minimize concentration polarization effects to start with the acid of known concentration was taken as feed solution and de ionized water as a receiver in the present work 1 and 3 mol l 1 hno3 and 1 mol l 1 hcl were used in the feed the leakage of different monovalent divalent and trivalent cations through pore filled anion exchange membrane were studied by adding representative nano3 6 5 g l ba no3 2 0 2 g l and fe no3 3 2 g l salts in the feed the concentration of these salts was taken as total salt concentrations of the respective valence expected in high level waste this was done since the leakage of ions takes place due to the breaking of donnan barrier which is a strong function of the valence of the cation the transport of acid was monitored by aliquoting 0 1 ml solution from each compartment at regular time intervals and titrating it with standardized naoh using phenolphthalein as an acid base indicator all the experiments were carried out for approximately 6 h after which aliquots were taken from both the compartments to check elemental distribution by icp aes spectro arcos germany with a charged coupled device ccd as a detector the detector system consisting of linear arrays of ccd detectors 3648 pixels array thermally stabilized together with an optical system provides the ability to choose the alternate analytical lines multi elemental standard solutions e merck darmstadt germany were used to obtain calibration curve in the desired concentration range for the elements under study the dialysis coefficient u of the membrane for each component is given by the amount of the component that is transported per unit active membrane area per unit time and per unit concentration difference of the component yang et al 2013 i e 5 u m a t δ c where m is the amount of component transported in moles a the active membrane area in square meters t is the time in hours and δc is the average concentration in the two chambers in moles per cubic meters given as 6 δ c c f o c f t c d t ln c f o c d t c f t where c f o and c f t are the feed concentrations at t 0 and t respectively and c d t is the concentration of the permeate solution at time t stachera and childs 2001 the preferential diffusion of one species over another is given by the corresponding selectivity given as the ratio of the overall dialysis coefficients of the reference species in this case hno3 to the overall dialysis coefficient of the species cations present in the solution the larger the selectivity the higher is the preference for the reference species with respect to the other cationic species present in the solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of pore filled membranes table 1 gives the compositions of the polymerizing solutions used for pore filling pp microporous substrates to vary the ion exchange concentration and degree of hydrophobicity of the membranes the polymerization was carried with varying proportions of quaternary ammonium bearing monomer apmac inorganic matrix forming silane monomer aptms and cross linker three different cross linkers having two three and four polymerizable double bonds were employed as shown in fig 1 the mass gain in the membranes after grafting and the corresponding uncertainties obtained by averaging the results for 3 4 samples are also given in table 1 for all the polymerizing solution compositions mass gain 100 wt was obtained showing a high degree of pore filling this is also evident from the feg sem images of the two surfaces of the nascent and grafted aem 3 membrane shown in fig 2 a d as seen from the images of the nascent and the grafted membranes the pore openings are uniformly filled by the polymer microgel the morphology of the polymer microgel inside the pores of the grafted membrane was studied from the cross sectional feg sem images of both the nascent and the grafted membrane aem 3 and are given in fig 2 e and f as seen from the images the membrane had dense nonporous layers at both the surfaces and had porous structure inside thus the effective dense layer for diffusion of acid appeared to be smaller than the thickness of the membrane to understand the spatial distribution of the polymer microgel inside the pores the aem 3 membrane was loaded with i ion and the spatial distributions of si and i was seen by eds mapping using feg sem as seen from fig 3 both si and i were uniformly distributed across the thickness of the membrane the grafted pore filled membranes were characterized for the mass gain thickness water uptake volume fraction of water molecules ion exchange capacity and average water molecules per ion exchange site the results of the measurements are summarized in table 1 as seen from the table the mass gain increased with increase in cross linker egdma from 5 to 10 the mass gain also increased with increase in the alkoxy silane aptms content irrespective of the cross linker and degree of cross linking also it was interesting to note from table 1 that the thickness of all the grafted membranes reduced relative to the pristine membrane this could be related to the highly cross linked network formed in the pores of the membrane due to the presence of cross linker and or alkoxy silane in the membrane which leads to the shrinking of the membrane with respect to the pristine membrane however as silane content increased for a particular composition of cross linker the thickness of the membrane increased this could be explained based on the increased mass gain of the membrane with increasing silane content thereby possibly resulting in stretching of the polymer matrix stachera et al 1998 had also reported the increased mass gain in the membrane that resulted in the stretching of the polymer matrix and increases in thickness of the membrane water uptake is considered as an important membrane parameter with a profound effect on its ion transport characteristics and it s dimensional as well as mechanical properties wang et al 2013 the presence of water molecules in the pores of the membrane facilitates the transport of ions and water molecules however it reduces the dimensional and mechanical stability of the membrane this parameter is mainly related to the ionic concentration in the membrane and its cross linking degree in the present study the grafted membranes exhibited considerable water uptake than the hydrophobic pristine poly propylene membrane owing to the hydrophilic nature of the hybrid inorganic organic microgels grafted in the pores of the membranes as can be seen from table 1 the water content in the pore filled membrane was found to be highly dependent on the extent of quaternary ammonium bearing monomer units apmac in the polymerized microgel and degree of cross linking the increase in hydrophobic alkoxy silane aptms content in the membrane and degree of cross linking lead to decrease in the water content of the membrane this was attributed to the increase in cross linking which restricts the swelling in the polymeric gel thereby reducing the free volume of the microporous gel present in the membrane as suggested by the free volume theory of polymers cohen and turnbull 1959 along with water uptake the physiochemical stability of the grafted pore filled membranes was also assessed by the change in volume fraction of the membrane in water and the swelling ratio table 1 the presence of large water volume fraction within the membrane matrix may significantly affect the ionic concentration dimensional as well as thermo mechanical stabilities of the membrane generally the degree of water swelling is decided by the balance between the absorbing ability of quaternary ammonium groups and the resisting ability of the hydrophobic components as seen from table 1 both the volume fraction and swelling ratio follows the same trend as water uptake attributed to the decrease of quaternary ammonium groups and the increased formation of o si o networks in the membrane the ion exchange capacity iec of a membrane is a measure of the density of dissociable ionic groups present in the membrane this is an important property which determines the ion conduction and salt leakage across the membrane the ion exchange capacity of the grafted membranes in the absence of aptms as co monomer aem1 aem4 aem7 and aem10 remained practically constant showing the same monomer content in all the membranes this is expected since the initial monomer content in the polymerizing solution in all these membranes was kept constant irrespective of the cross linkers the ion exchange capacity decreased with increasing aptms content in the membrane see table 1 this was expected as the membranes were prepared with a fixed mole proportion of monomer apmac and co monomer aptms therefore as the co monomer fraction increased the corresponding monomer fraction decreased this was also apparent from the decreased water content of the membranes with decreasing quaternary ammonium fraction 3 2 diffusion dialysis studies the performance of the synthesized grafted pore filled anion exchange membranes aem 1 aem 12 and commercial anion exchange membrane selemion for acid recovery application were evaluated by carrying out the diffusion dialysis experiments with the nitric acid and deionized water in the feed and receiver compartments respectively the dialysis experiments were performed at two initial acid concentrations 1 mol l 1 and 3 mol l 1 the representative monovalent divalent and trivalent nitrates nano3 ba no3 2 and fe no3 3 respectively were added to the feed solution to study the leakage of salts through the anion exchange membranes the acid concentrations in the feed c f and diffusate c d was studied as a function of time till the equilibrium reached or upto 6 h and the concentration of the cations in the two compartments were measured at the end of each experiment fig 4 shows a time profile of acid in the feed and diffusate for the grafted pore filled anion exchange membrane aem 1 it can be seen that the acid concentration in the feed decreased and diffusate increased with time till equilibrium was achieved the driving force for the acid transport to the diffusate is the concentration gradient across the anion exchange membrane which decreases with time similar transport profile of acid was observed for the commercial selemion membrane as shown in fig 4 this indicated the synthesized pore filled anion exchange membrane is effective to recover nitric acid by dd process however for the commercial membrane the time profile of acid transport was found to be very slow with the equilibrium not reaching even in 6 h which was also apparent from the dialysis coefficients calculated based on changes in concentration in both the compartments of a dialysis cell the results are shown in fig 5 a and are also compiled in table s1 s i the acid dialysis coefficients of the commercial membrane were observed to be much lower than for the synthesized pore filled anion exchange membrane aem 1 this was due to the lower water uptake and iec of the commercial membrane as compared to aem 1 also the selectivity of the membrane for the reference hno3 species with respect to the cations was calculated and the results are shown in fig 5 b and table s2 s i it is evident from fig 5 a and b that with the increase in cation valency while the salt dialysis coefficients decreased and the selectivity of the acid over the salts increased this could be attributed to the fact that as the charge on the cation increases more efficient exclusion of the cation by the membrane is expected owing to the increasing electrostatic repulsion by the membrane fixed positive charges also for a membrane to be successfully used for a dd process along with high acid dialysis coefficients the dialysis coefficients of the salts should be less but as can be seen from table s1 s i the dialysis coefficients of all the three salts nano3 ba no3 2 and fe no3 3 are quite high as compared to the commercial membrane thereby making the selectivity of the acid wrt the salts much lower than the commercial membrane see table s2 s i the comparison is more clearly shown in fig 5 the leakage of salts through an ion exchange membrane will depend on the water content and ion exchange capacity of the membranes as explained earlier in the text these parameters will in turn be a strong function of the type of cross linker degree of cross linking and silane content in the grafted pore filled membranes unlike commercial membranes these parameters can be easily tuned in grafted pore filled membranes to achieve desired results therefore the effect of these parameters on the transport of protons and the leakage of salts through all these membranes was systematically studied 3 3 effect of degree of cross linking and the type of cross linker on dialysis coefficient and selectivity cross linking can be used to vary the diffusion characteristics of ions molecules through a polymer geise et al 2014 generally the salt is believed to diffuse through the water swollen polymeric gel present in the membrane pores geise et al 2014 as cross linking is increased it is expected to restrict the swelling of the polymeric gel thereby reducing the acid as well as salt diffusion coefficients in the material due to the small size and different mechanism of transport through the membrane protons experience less hindrance compared to other cations this is also seen from the acid transport profile through membranes with different cross linking fig s2 s i the transport profiles were found to overlap with each other suggesting the proton transport was not affected due to change in cross linking as it occurs through water channels however the increase in cross linking was expected to affect the acid salt selectivity of the membrane it is seen from fig 6 a and b that the cross linking had affected the dialysis coefficient of acid and salts and the acid selectivity over salts significantly i e the acid dialysis coefficients increased with the increase in cross linking but the dialysis coefficients for the salts were decreased therefore the selectivity of the acid over salts increased as the degree of cross linking increased along with the increase in the degree of cross linking the density of the cross linked networks can also be increased by using the cross linker having multiple polymerizing double bonds tmptma and peta as shown in fig 1 the results of the dialysis coefficients of the acid and salts and the selectivity of the acid transport over salts are also given in fig 6 a and b it can be seen that relative to egdma aem 1 the dialysis coefficients of the acid increased and salts decreased as the number of double bonds per molecule increased the results were also reflected in the increase in selectivity of the acid transport relative to all the three salts fig 6 b however as seen from fig 6 b the selectivity of acid transport is higher in aem 4 relative to aem 7 and aem 10 showing more cross linked network in the former this could be due to the bunching of polymer chains with higher cross linking leading to low density region in the polymer matrix that would be less effective in the screening of salts this is also apparent from the lower water content of this membrane aem 4 relative to other three further increase in the degree of cross linking for tmptma and peta could not be achieved owing to shrinking of the membrane at higher cross linking therefore further studies were carried out with egdma as a cross linker 3 4 effect of alkoxy silane content on dialysis coefficient and selectivity the leakage of salts through ion exchange membrane can also be reduced by increasing the hydrophobic content of the membrane this will reduce the water content in the membrane thereby reducing the diffusivity of the salt in the membrane therefore acid dialysis experiments were carried out with membranes containing silane as comonomer aem 2 aem 3 aem 5 and aem 6 as given in table 1 these membranes have less water content relative to their counterparts with no silane also the presence of alkoxy silane moiety will introduce o si o network in the membrane thereby increasing the cross linked network in the membrane this is also expected to reduce the leakage of salts through grafted pore filled anion exchange membranes fig s2 s i shows the acid transport profile in receiver compartment for membranes with varying silane content aem 1 aem 3 nearly 50 transport of acid was observed in all the cases with the transport rate becoming slower with increasing silane content this was expected due to the formation of increased cross linked o si o networks in the membrane pores leading to decrease in the free volume and water content of the membrane fig 7 a and b shows the dialysis coefficient of acids and salts and selectivity of acid over salts for membranes with increasing silane content corresponding to two different degrees of cross linking of egdma 5 and 10 it is interesting to see from the figure that for membranes with 5 egdma aem 1 3 on introduction of silane in the membrane there is a increase in dialysis coefficient of acid by 17 but the dialysis coefficients of salts decreases by 62 85 this slight increase in the dialysis coefficient of acid show that the introduction of o si o networks although are capable enough to reduce leakage of salts proton being tiny is still passing comfortably this is possible since the migration of protons across the membrane can occur by both diffusion and by grotthus mechanism lorrain et al 1996 the dialysis coefficient of acid is however reduced on further increasing the silane content aem 3 it is also evident from the figure that for the 10 egdma content as the silane content increased while dialysis coefficients decreased for all the four species the selectivity of acid over salts increased it is to be noted here that for aem 3 and aem 6 the elemental concentration of iron in the receiver compartment was found to be lower than the detection limit of icp aes therefore for these two cases iron could not be determined and was assumed to be absent thereby leading to zero dialysis coefficients of iron salt as given in table s1 this leads to very high selectivity of h fe in case of aem 3 and aem 6 among all the synthesized pore filled membranes aem 3 and aem 6 have a higher selectivity for all the ions compared to the commercial membrane however aem 6 membrane was found to be brittle and difficult to handle owing to the higher degree of cross linking along with higher silane content also the transport rate of acid was 2 times higher with aem 3 in comparison with aem 6 therefore further studies were carried out with aem 3 membrane 3 5 effects of acid concentration on dd process the leakage of acid and salts may also be affected by the concentration of the acid which needs to be recovered therefore to check the acidity dependent transport the acid dialysis experiments were carried out at two acid concentrations 1 and 3 mol l 1 keeping all the other conditions same for all the synthesized pore filled membranes irrespective of the feed acidity the transport of acid was not affected as seen in fig s3 s i fig 8 shows the dialysis coefficients for acid and salts for two representative membranes aem 3 it can be seen that while the acid dialysis coefficient slightly decreased the salt dialysis practically remained same a slight decrease of acid dialysis coefficient may be due to the decrease in the membrane swelling followed by the dehydration of the membrane resulting in the increasing frictional resistance to ion transport at high concentrations hao et al 2013 3 6 effect of anion on the dd process since the transport of proton through the anion exchange membrane is always accompanied by the transport of the corresponding anion through the membrane to maintain electrical neutrality the diffusivity of the proton may be affected by the nature of the anion in the present studies the effect of anion on the dd of acid was investigated by replacing nitric acid with hydrochloric acid and monitoring the proton transport using a representative aem 3 membrane fig 9 shows the transport profile of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid through aem 3 membrane it can be seen that the transport profiles overlap with each other showing that the nature of anions does not significantly affect the dd process through the synthesized pore filled anion exchange membranes 3 7 effect of the microporous substrate on the dd process the diffusivity of acid through the membrane may also be governed by the nature of the membrane matrix with the diffusivity expected to be faster when the membrane matrix is more hydrophilic to study the microporous substrate effect dd of acid was studied using a grafted pore filled membrane with pvdf as microporous substrate and same composition as aem 3 as seen from fig 10 the substrate did not have any effect on the transport of acid so membrane prepared with the different substrate can be used for dd process thus the transport process of acid is only dependent on the composition of the guest inorganic organic micro gel and host membrane could be changed depending upon the suitability this is important for acid dialysis from nuclear waste where conveniently a radiation resistant microporous substrate can be chosen 3 8 stability and reusability for the pore filled membranes to be applied successfully for dd their response should be reproducible to check the stability and reusability of the synthesized membrane a representative aem 3 was subjected to a repeated number of dd cycles after each cycle the acid transport and metal ions distribution were checked as seen from fig 11 the acid transport profile remained same even after four runs and also element transport also remained same confirming the stability and reusability of the membrane 3 9 application for recovery of nitric acid from simulated high level waste based on the nitric acid recovery studies in the presence of representative monovalent divalent and trivalent salts the optimized pore filled membrane aem 3 was used for the acid recovery from simulated high level waste shlw the composition of the shlw is same as the high level waste composition of a pressurized heavy water reactor burn up 7000 mwd t this waste contains a large number of metal ions as given in table s3 s i in an acidity of 3 mol l 1 hno3 dd experiments were carried out with shlw as a feed and de ionized water as a receiver using aem 3 membrane the experiment was also repeated with the commercial selemion membrane for comparison acid transport and equilibrium metal ions distribution were monitored as expected for both the commercial and synthesized membranes acid profile from shlw overlapped with the 3 mol l 1 hno3 acid profiles representative matching is shown in fig 11 for aem 3 membrane fig 12 shows the metal ion concentrations initially present in the shlw and the receiver after dd process for both the commercial and synthesized anion exchange membranes it can be seen that compared to commercial membrane the performance of the synthesized pore filled aem was found to be much better in stopping the leakage of metal ions and nitric acid with very low metal concentration was recovered effectively this shows that the synthesized pore filled membrane can be used for recovery of acid from shlw 3 10 flow experiments in all the batch dialysis experiments carried out so far nearly 50 transport of acid to the diffusate was observed as equal volumes of the feed and diffusate were used in the experiments however this is not sufficient for successful application of dd for removal of nitric acid from high level nuclear waste therefore an attempt was carried out to increase the acid transport by increasing the volume of diffusate for this while the feed and diffusate compartment volumes were fixed as 15 ml fresh diffusate i e de ionized water was introduced in the diffusate at a flow rate of 45 ml h and removed at the same rate in this way a constant driving force for the transport of acid across the anion exchange membrane was maintained the dialysis experiment was continued for 6 h and the transport of proton in the feed and diffusate was monitored as a function of time the salt leakage was measured at the equilibrium in both the compartments the dd experiments were carried out with aem 3 and the results were compared with the commercial selemion membrane fig 13 a shows the acid transport time profiles in the feed and diffusate and fig 13 b shows the ionic composition of the receiver for both the membranes it can be seen from the two figures that while the leakage of ions was comparable for both the membranes the acid recovery was significantly more in the synthesized pore filled membranes after 6 h in case of the commercial membrane while only 20 40 of the acid was removed from the feed 90 of the acid was removed when synthesized pore filled anion exchange membrane aem 3 was used this shows successful application of the dd technique with the synthesized organic inorganic hybrid membranes for the removal of nitric acid from acidic high level waste 4 conclusion the work explores the possibility of recovery of acid from highly acidic aqueous waste streams encountered in high level waste from nuclear industry using diffusion dialysis a novel pore filled anion exchange membrane with hybrid organic inorganic gel framework in the microporous substrate has been developed for this purpose this class of membranes has a high water content required to transport protons by grotthus mechanism has high ion exchange capacity 0 85 meq g to transport counterions no3 cl and a dense barrier to prevent transport of metal cations the membranes are easy to synthesize are reusable and the response has been found to be reproducible also the response of the membranes has been found to be better than commercial membrane and is found to be independent of the microporous substrate and acid concentrations and depends only on the composition of the organic inorganic gel the membrane has been successfully tested for the recovery of nitric acid from simulated high level waste solutions without significant transport of metal ions author contributions the manuscript was written through

19723,environmental gradient have strong effects on community assembly processes in order to reveal the effects of alkaline mine drainage alkmd on bacterial and denitrifying bacterial community compositions and diversity in tailings reservoir here we conducted an experiment to examine all and core bacterial taxa and denitrifying functional genes s nirs nirk nosz ι abundance along a chemical gradient in tailings water in shibahe copper tailings in zhongtiaoshan china differences in bacterial and denitrifying bacterial community compositions in different habitats and their relationships with environmental parameters were analyzed the results showed that the richness and diversity of bacterial community in downstream seeping water sdsw were the largest while that in upstream tailings water stw1 were the lowest the diversity and abundance of bacterial communities tended to increase from stw1 to sdsw the variation of bacterial community diversity was significantly related to electroconductibility ec nitrate no3 nitrite no2 total carbon tc inorganic carbon ic and sulfate so4 2 but was not correlated with geographic distance in local scale core taxa from class to genus were all significantly related to no3 and no2 core taxa rhodobacteraceae rhodobacter acinetobacter and hydrogenophaga were typical denitrifying bacteria the variation trends of these groups were consistent with the copy number of nirs nirk and nosz ι demonstrating their importance in the process of nitrogen reduction the copy number of nirk nosz ι and nirs 16s rdna nirk 16sr dna correlated strongly with no3 no2 and ic but nirs and nosz i 16srdna had no significant correlation with no3 and no2 the copy numbers of denitrifying functional genes nirs nirk and nosz ι were negatively correlated with heavy metal plumbum pb and zinc zn it showed that heavy metal contamination was an important factor affecting the structure of denitrifying bacterial community in alkmd in this study we have identified the distribution pattern of bacterial community along physiochemical gradients in alkaline tailings reservoir and displayed the driving force of shaping the structure of bacterial community the influence of no3 no2 ic and heavy metal pb and zn on bacterial community might via their influence on the functional groups involving nitrogen carbon and metal metabolisms graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial community core taxa nirs nirk nosz i qpcr 1 introduction microbial diversity abundance and community composition change along environmental gradients bier et al 2015 fan et al 2016 and these changes may help us identify a set of environmental characteristics to some groups of taxa the main purpose to determine the mechanisms of community adaptability is explaining the variation of ecosystem functioning ultimately predicting ecosystem responses to current and future environmental changes functional genes which contain the genes encoding key enzymes involved in biogeochemical cycling processes have been used to study microbial communities xu et al 2010 the abundance of microbial functional genes reflects the adaptability of functional groups in a specific ecological system so establishing the connection between community structure and function has been a main goal in microbial ecology berlemont et al 2014 at the same time establishing such a connection is especially critical for predicting how communities and functions will respond to environmental change trivedi et al 2013 shifts in the abundance and community composition contributing to a process represent another route by which an ecosystem can respond to environmental change allison et al 2013 bacterial diversity abundance and functional genes shift considerably along gradients of ph kuang et al 2016 available energy gülay et al 2016 guo et al 2015 trace metal concentration kumari et al 2015 sun et al 2016 salinity dini andreote et al 2014 and temperature zhou et al 2016 environmental change acts as a selective force against sensitive individuals resulting in species losses and possible cascading effects on ecosystem function carlisle and clements 2005 because the composition and functional genes abundance of microbial communities can be affected strongly by ph salinity metal concentrations and available energy we speculated that exposure to alkaline copper mine drainage alkmd would drive the shifts in microbial communities and specific functional groups composition nitrogen contamination in tailings reservoir is mainly caused by the blast of ammonium nitrate fuel oil explosives cyanide destruction flotation agent and the leaching or erosion of rainwater the excessive nitrogen is mainly removed by microbial denitrification in tailings water denitrification is an important microbial process that removes excessive nitrogen from contaminated water this dissimilatory process reduces nitrate no3 to nitrogen gas n2 through intermediates of nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o it is well known that the denitrification process exists in multiple environments wastewater gonzalez martinez et al 2015 xing et al 2017 grassland soil harter et al 2014 pan et al 2016 lakes agricultural fields ai et al 2017 ishii et al 2011 sediments baeseman et al 2006 however at present there is no report on the denitrifying bacteria in alkmd as bacteria play a central role in denitrification it is crucial to understand which factors control the abundance of denitrifying functional genes in alkmd zhongtiaoshan copper mine is the largest non coal underground mining mine in china with annual output of more than 4 million tons of ore liu et al 2017 it has a copper dominated ore body and is accompanied by some other metals such as fe pb zn cd mo et al he et al 2007 large amounts of waste water and waste residue containing a variety of heavy metals are produced in the process of mining massive accumulations of tailings cause serious pollution to the ecological environment so ecological restoration is particularly important in this region microorganisms play an important role in the process of ecological restoration which can reduce the toxicity of heavy metals and decompose excessive nutrient elements in tailings water the structure and diversity of microbial communities and the structure of functional microbial communities determine the resilience of the ecosystem this study aimed to address the following questions i how does alkmd affect microbial community structure ii how does alkmd affect core taxa iii how does alkmd affect microbial functional gene abundance our results indicated that microbial community composition and functional gene structure were distinct among sampling sites moreover such microbial functional patterns were highly correlated to environmental factors we speculate that the community structure in alkmd was shaped by environmental factors via influence on the functional microbial groups 2 materials and

results 3 1 the physicochemical gradient of drainage in tailings reservoir sampling locations spanned a gradient of alkmd contamination the highest values of ph no3 no2 were observed at stw1 which were significantly higher than that of stw3 sdsw and susw table 1 the ph ec no3 no2 and so4 2 showed a gradient along flow direction of drainage water that were stw1 stw2 stw3 as the tailings dam was built by the accretion of tailings sand just like a filter column part of the heavy metals and other contaminants were filtered out when the drainage permeates the tailings dam therefore seeping water in susw and sdsw had lower ph ec no3 no2 and so4 2 compared with stw water the higher levels of do tc toc and ic were measured at stw3 showing a trend of increase stw1 stw2 stw3 along the flow direction of drainage water table 1 ec so4 2 nh4 tc and toc had significant difference in susw and sdsw for these five heavy metals monitored only cd and zn gradually decreased along the flow direction but there was no significant difference among three drainage water sample points 3 2 overall bacterial community structure and taxa identification most of the filtered reads were within 400 500 bp in length averagely longer than 400 bp in total 27587 28168 23429 22330 and 21077 filtered sequences were obtained in five samples respectively according to sequence alignment at a sequence

indices were all minimal in stw1 compare to the other four samples and bacterial community richness showed an increasing trend along the direction of the flow table 2 pcoa based on bray curtis similarities showed that microbial community structures at different sampling locations were different microbial communities of five sampling points were divided into three groups with obvious differences in stw1 stw2 and susw stw3 and sdsw fig 2 the similarities of bacterial community structures were matched with the physochemical properties of drainage water samples table 1 approximately 99 9 of the sequences were classified into 26 different phyla across all the samples fig 3 the predominant phyla relative abundance was greater than 1 were proteobacteria the number of classified sequences in this phylum ranged from 41 20 to 89 49 in all the samples actinobacteria 0 41 24 44 thermi 2 30 22 81 firmicutes 3 79 13 99 bacteroidetes 2 50 7 72 cyanobacteria 0 11 4 70 chloroflexi 0

distributed across the alpha 21 44 76 15 beta 2 49 12 31 and gamma 1 03 38 81 subphyla however delta 0 005 0 35 subphyla were detected in four samples except stw1 sequencing data showed that the composition of taxa in five samples was different there were a large proportion of sequences 31 80 66 70 which were not assigned to any genera bacterial communities in stw1 were dominated 54 06 by sequences of an uncultured genus of the rhodobacteraceae the abundance of rhodobacteraceae gradually decreased along the direction of flow the most abundant bacteria was deinococcus class deinococci in stw2 13 92 and susw 22 81 acinetobacter class γ proteobacterial in stw3 37 76 and mycobacterium class actinobacteria in sdsw 15 86 fig 5 table s2 bacterial abundances expressed gene copies in per

different p 01 among five samples fig 4 and this difference was correlated positively with do tc toc and ic and negatively with ec no3 no2 nh4 so4 2 as and pb table 4 3 3 spatial patterns of core taxa the top ten taxa with relative abundance greater than 1 at the level of class order family and genus respectively were defined as core taxa top ten classes accounted for 90 6 97 9 of the total identified sequences fig 5a top ten orders accounted for 82 2 92 0 fig 5b top ten families accounted for 62 1 86 7 fig 5c and top ten genera represented 27 3 56 4 fig 5d there was considerable inconsistency among five samples the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria order rhodobacterales family rhodobacteraceae and genus rhodobacter and betaproteobacteria order burkholderiales family comamonadaceae and genus hydrogenophaga gradually decreased along flow direction of drainage water however gammaproteobacteria order pseudomonadales family moraxellaceae genus acinetobacter and legionella actinobacteria order actinomycetales family mycobacteriaceae and genus mycobacterium synechococcophycideae genus synechococcus acidimicrobiia caulobacterales family caulobacteraceae and rhizobiales family phyllobacteriaceae gradually increased along flow direction of drainage water fig 5 the highest relative abundance of deinococci order deinococcales family deinococcaceae and genus deinococcus bacilli order bacillales family bacillaceae and genus bacillus flavobacteriia order flavobacteriales sphingomonadales family sphingomonadaceae and genus novosphingobium sphingobacteriia and microbacteriaceae genus candidatus aquiluna were observed in the stw2 there were also differences of core taxa community structure in susw and sdsw fig 5 3 4 relationships of bacterial community composition and environmental parameters mantel test showed that total bacterial community composition all otus was strongly correlated with ec no3 no2 tc and so4 2 likewise the predominant bacterial community composition abundant otus was significantly correlated to ec no3 no2 and ic table 3 in addition mantel tests also showed that the total and predominant bacterial community composition were not significantly correlated with ph do heavy metal as cd cu pb zn and geographic distance table 3 rda analysis results showed environmental parameters had significant influence on core taxa at the level of class f 2 4 p 05 order f 2 6 p 05 family f 2 5 p 05 and genus f 7 1 p 05 the results showed that core taxa were closely related to the content of no3 and no2 also so4 2 showed a significant influence on the class order and family level and ph on the order and family level table s8 multiple correlation analysis results showed that no3 no2 tc ic so4 2 and heavy metal as cu pb zn had significant influence in several core taxa tables s3 s7 3 5 variations of nirs nirk and noszi along drainage flow direction key functional genes for denitrification comprising genes encoding nitrite reductase nirs and nirk and nitrous oxide reductase nosz i were detected in five samples the nirs nirk and nosz i gene copy numbers ranged from 2 12 103 to 3 23 104 4 73 100 to 3 84 104 and 4 14 104 to 2 33 105 copies per ml water respectively in the studied samples fig 6 the copy number of nirs in stw3 and stw2 were significantly higher than that in stw1 and the copy number of nirk did not have significant difference in three reservoir water sampling points the maximum copy number of nosz i was observed in stw2 and had significant difference in three reservoir water sampling points the copy number of three denitrification functional genes in susw was significantly lower than in sdsw fig 6 the ratio of nirs 16s rdna nirk 16s rdna and nosz i 16s rdna ranged from 0 12 to 1 46 2 58 to 1 38 and 1 81 6 03 in five sampling points respectively fig 7 the relative abundance of nirs nirk and nosz i gradual decreased along the direction flow in reservoir water although there was no statistical significance for nirs and nirk fig 7 the relative abundance of nirs nirk and nosz i had no significant difference in seeping water nirs 16s rdna and nirk 16s rdna in reservoir water was 3 71 and 3 49 103 times as much as in seeping water respectively while nosz i 16s rdna in seeping water was 1 22 times as much as in reservoir water 3 6 the effects of environmental parameters on nirs nirk and noszi denitrifying functional genes nirs and nirk have similar response strategies to environmental change except do while nosz i was different the abundance of nirs and nirk was positively correlated with ph no3 no2 and negatively correlated with ic and zn although the effects of nitrogen no3 no2 and ph were not statistically significant on nirs however nosz i had an opposite trend with nirs and nirk table 4 the abundance of nirs nirk and nosz i were positively correlated with cu and negatively correlated with pb table 4 the pattern of the relative abundance of three denitrifying genes were consistent across five samples and all had a negative correlation with sampling location fig 8 which were closely related to the availability of nutrients no3 no2 ic ph and heavy metal zn elements table 4 4 discussion 4 1 microbial communities in alkmd the distribution of different microbial groups in relation to biotic and abiotic characteristics of its environment can provide important clues to help us to understand the basis of the organism physiology and its function within an ecosystem some studies showed that microbial communities were sensitive to changes of local environmental conditions mykrä et al 2017 nie et al 2016 and our results were consistent with these previous studies our data showed that α diversity and β diversity of bacterial community changed along flow direction of drainage table 2 figs 2 and 4 and these compositional shifts were correlated with the concentration of no3 no2 so4 2 and tc table 3 table 4 there was limited evidence showed that such patterns of diversity may be structured by a species sorting process i e the selection by local environmental conditions crump et al 2012 this pattern of bacterial community composition was a manifestation of adaptation to environmental conditions such as responses to the availability of nitrate sulfate and carbon for energy metabolism rather the variation of bacterial abundance might be because of stressors that effecting cellular processes and signaling bier et al 2015 when an ecosystem exists extreme environmental alteration such as tailings wastewater discharge we expect organisms favored by the changes to flourish and sensitive taxa to fail this stress response could shift community composition across environmental gradients as well as increase taxa richness at lower pollution levels and increase diversity at intermediate pollution levels where sensitive and tolerant taxa overlap niyogi et al 2007 this was a possible explanation for microbial taxa richness and diversity responses to the alkmd gradient as and pb significantly inhibited the abundance of bacterial community table 4 microorganism community under the action of toxic heavy metals could reduce or even lose the metabolic capability of carbon nitrogen and sulfur li et al 2015 therefore high concentrations of heavy metals significantly inhibit the number of bacteria heavy metal mediated toxicity was usually due to inactivation of enzymes membrane impairment interaction with nucleic acids variation in nutrient transport and availability of the substrate the inhibition of enzymes cell membranes and nucleic acids by heavy metals was due to the binding of metals to enzyme proteins membrane proteins and nuclease thereby altering their structure yadav et al 2016 ultimately resulting in the loss of cytoactive in acid mine drainage amd systems ph strongly correlates with microbial community diversity richness and functional gene abundance huang et al 2016 kuang et al 2016 although ph had statistically distinct between reservoir water and seeping water table 1 ph was not an important factor correlate of composition or diversity metrics table 3 table 4 in this study consistent with prior study on alkmd bier et al 2015 this might be explained by the limited ph range in this study 8 01 9 38 only 1 orders of magnitude relative to prior studies in amd not less than 4 orders of magnitude the lack of significant correlation between ph and diversity in shibahe tailings reservoir suggested that other chemical constituents such as ec no3 no2 so4 2 and numerous trace elements were stronger determinants of bacterial community structure than ph geographical distance had a significant influence on the structure of bacterial community and the difference of community diversity was obvious with the increase of geographic distance lee et al 2013 roguet et al 2015 however there was no significant correlation between bacterial community structure and geographic distance in this study table 3 indicating that the main factor affecting the change of bacterial community structure was environmental selection rather than diffusion limitation the qpcr estimated all bacterial abundances fig 4 were somewhat higher than those estimated by amplicon sequencing table 2 but dissimilarity of bacterial abundance when using different primers table s1 in pcr based surveys was well documented gülay et al 2016 amplification efficiency of 101 1 for qpcr reactions was also an important factor in overestimation of bacterial abundance bacterial communities assemble because of functional adaptation in extreme habitat chan et al 2013 kuang et al 2016 high abundance of a member of the proteobacteria in five samples fig 3 consistent with others of alkmd bier et al 2015 suggesting their central role in the process of tailings water purification the largest decrease in abundance from stw1 to sdsw was noted for the proteobacteria due to the decrease of the typical denitrifying taxa rhodobacteraceae hydrogenophaga and rhodobacter table s2 resulted from the reduction of no3 and no2 table s6 table s7 the trend of actinobacteria abundance was opposite to proteobacteria and it gradually increased from stw1 to sdsw fig 3 this was mainly caused by the changes in so4 2 and toc concentrations table s3 which was consistent with bier s bier et al 2015 findings on water bacteria contrary to this study hou hou et al 2017 studied on soil bacteria pointed out that ec was positively related to actinobacteria whereas tc was negatively related to actinobacteria this was possibly due to the differences of subjects and study areas the abundances of firmicutes bacteroidetes and thermi were higher in stw2 and susw which was consistent with the moderate pollution hypothesis suggesting the three taxa showed similar or slightly different niches gülay et al 2016 cyanobacteria and chloroflexi were common aquatic autotrophic microorganisms the relative abundances of cyanobacteria and chloroflexi increased along the flow direction in the reservoir water fig 2 the gradually decrease of nh4 no2 no3 and increase of tc concentration table s3 were the most important factors affecting the distribution of cyanobacteria and chloroflexi cyanobacteria adapted contaminated habitats by releasing extracellular polymeric substances buffering against environmental stressors flemming et al 2010 members of the phylum verrucomicrobia were abundant in diverse habitats including soil water and sediments as well as extreme environments such as in the hot springs low ph 2 0 2 5 and soda lake habitats freitas et al 2012 hou et al 2008 shen et al 2017 the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia increased along the flow direction in reservoir water fig 3 and this could be explained by pb schneider et al 2017 and toc freitas et al 2012 concentration change od1 played an important ecological role in impacting hydrogen and sulfur cycles castelle et al 2017 wrighton et al 2012 whether od1 is associated with sulfur cycling in alkmd is pending further study 4 2 core taxa and their likely eco physiology role the dominant microflora plays a key role in the ecosystem so the dynamics of the dominant flora can indirectly reflect the adaptation process of the whole bacterial community to environmental change ten top core bacterial community composition from class to genus varied among the five samples but core genera were shared across the samples fig 5 table s2 indicating that environmental conditions in the alkmd had similar background and specific conditions of each sample point had secondary influence on the microbial community composition gülay et al 2016 core taxa rhodobacteraceae rhodobacter and hydrogenophaga in stw1 acinetobacter in stw3 deinococcus in susw and mycobacterium in sdsw were abundant fig 5c and d suggesting different ecological functioning roles it would indicate selection as a dominant force for community assembly via core taxa of functional microbes core taxa at different taxonomic levels had similar adaptive capabilities and this adaptation was best explained by no3 no2 tc and ic concentration changes table s4 s7 major aquatic bacteria rhodobacteraceae and alkaliphilic genera rhodobacter were all typical phototrophic purple non sulfur bacteria and no3 and no2 were used as an electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration glaring et al 2015 lu et al 2014 hydrogenophaga was a common bacterium flora in polluted environment and acquired their energy by denitrification muturi et al 2017 park et al 2005 therefore nitrate concentration was an important factor regulating community structure change phyllobacteriaceae has a remarkable adaptive capacity to the environment jurado et al 2005 liu et al 2012 in addition to its potential for denitrification it might also be produced in the carbon cycle mycobacterium was distributed in many habitats liu et al 2017 and closely related to carbon decomposition flavobacteriales and novosphingobium were also common taxa in contaminated habitats jiao et al 2016 salis et al 2017 and they could produce transparent exopolymer particles taylor et al 2014 xing et al 2015 to reduce the toxicity of heavy metals the highest relative abundance of legionella was in susw fig 4 and majority of legionella species were of aquatic origin and were considered as facultative pathogenic burstein et al 2016 lesnik et al 2016 in addition wullings wullings et al 2011 described that the abundance and diversity of legionella were influenced by the dissolved organic carbon in drinking water but whether they had same adaptability in alkmd is still not reported 4 3 change in copy number of denitrifying genes and availability of energy nitrate concentrations were an important factor affecting the change of denitrifying functional gene abundances following the nitrate gradient in the water column as previously observed in the colne estuary smith et al 2015 the boreal lakes saarenheimo et al 2015 and groundwater zhang et al 2016 available energy directly influences bacterial cellular metabolism and was related to chemical processes such as nutrient availability siles and margesin 2016 denitrification is driven by denitrifying microorganisms and is crucial in the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen our results showed that denitrifying bacterial abundance and relative abundance could change drastically in conjunction with environmental variation table 4 fig 8 the consistent increase of nirs from stw1 to sdsw fig 6 was mainly due to the inhibition effect of pb and zn gradually decreased along the flow direction of tailings water table 4 indicating that denitrifying bacteria were highly sensitive to heavy metal contamination dell anno et al 2003 the copy numbers of nirk and nosz ι were significantly correlated with the no3 and no2 but they showed an opposite trend table 4 it showed that they had different ecological adaptabilities coyotzi et al 2017 the relative abundances of the three denitrifying genes were significantly correlated with the nutrition gradient sampling position table 4 fig 8 which was consistent with other studies franklin et al 2017 saarenheimo et al 2015 the decrease of no3 and no2 concentration reduced the abundance of denitrifying bacteria the total nirs nirk nosz ι ratio was below 1 1 in this study indicating that the microbial community had a higher potential to reduce n2o than to produce it this implies that there won t be much greenhouse gas n2o emissions into the atmosphere during the denitrification process moreover we found that both abundance and relative abundance of nirs and nirk were minimal in susw and this might be due to the higher zn but lower cu concentration bioavailability of cu and fe could control the expression and activity of nitrite and nitrous oxide reductases while the production of nirs gene was an iron containing cd1 type reductase and that of nirk was a copper containing reductases possible cu and fe limitation might lead to decrease in abundance of nirs and nirk unfortunately data on fe concentrations were not available and we could not fully exclude fe limitation as a controlling factor in abundance of nirs decrease in susw the variation trend of abundance and relative abundance of nosz ι gene was different from that of nirs and nirk and the abundance of nosz ι was the lowest fig 6 but its relative abundance was the highest in stw1 fig 7 which closely related to the abundance of acinetobacter fig 4d acinetobacter was a main denitrifying bacterium that containing the nosz ι gene in order to adapt these harsh environments acinetobacter have developed compatible functions such as nitrogen metabolism coyotzi et al 2017 and heavy metals tolerance abdelhaleem et al 2006 5 conclusions in summary the results showed that compositional variation of bacteria was related to water chemistry variables in this study area further implying the influence of environment changes on community assembly bacterial community composition was strongly controlled by the availability of nutrients like carbon nitrogen sulfur and the toxic effects of heavy metals suggesting the importance of niche based processes in microbial community assembly may strongly depend on the local environmental context bacterial abundance and diversity were influenced by ec no3 no2 and so4 2 the abundances of core taxa including class order family and genus were significantly correlated with nitrogen no3 and no2 content moreover core taxa in class order and family level were shaped by the so4 2 and ph the changes of no3 and no2 influenced the abundances of nirk and nosz ι rather than nirs and the latter might be related to toc heavy metals as pb and zn significantly reduced the abundances of all bacteria and denitrifying bacteria while cu promoted the abundance of denitrifying bacteria our results thus highlighted that species sorting processes force drove community structure and functionally similar taxa in this highly polluted ecosystem a better understanding of the adaptation mechanisms of microbial communities in alkmd is needed to predict how environmental alteration is likely to affect microbial communities acknowledgments this study was supported by national science foundation of china 31772450 31600308 and the

19723,environmental gradient have strong effects on community assembly processes in order to reveal the effects of alkaline mine drainage alkmd on bacterial and denitrifying bacterial community compositions and diversity in tailings reservoir here we conducted an experiment to examine all and core bacterial taxa and denitrifying functional genes s nirs nirk nosz ι abundance along a chemical gradient in tailings water in shibahe copper tailings in zhongtiaoshan china differences in bacterial and denitrifying bacterial community compositions in different habitats and their relationships with environmental parameters were analyzed the results showed that the richness and diversity of bacterial community in downstream seeping water sdsw were the largest while that in upstream tailings water stw1 were the lowest the diversity and abundance of bacterial communities tended to increase from stw1 to sdsw the variation of bacterial community diversity was significantly related to electroconductibility ec nitrate no3 nitrite no2 total carbon tc inorganic carbon ic and sulfate so4 2 but was not correlated with geographic distance in local scale core taxa from class to genus were all significantly related to no3 and no2 core taxa rhodobacteraceae rhodobacter acinetobacter and hydrogenophaga were typical denitrifying bacteria the variation trends of these groups were consistent with the copy number of nirs nirk and nosz ι demonstrating their importance in the process of nitrogen reduction the copy number of nirk nosz ι and nirs 16s rdna nirk 16sr dna correlated strongly with no3 no2 and ic but nirs and nosz i 16srdna had no significant correlation with no3 and no2 the copy numbers of denitrifying functional genes nirs nirk and nosz ι were negatively correlated with heavy metal plumbum pb and zinc zn it showed that heavy metal contamination was an important factor affecting the structure of denitrifying bacterial community in alkmd in this study we have identified the distribution pattern of bacterial community along physiochemical gradients in alkaline tailings reservoir and displayed the driving force of shaping the structure of bacterial community the influence of no3 no2 ic and heavy metal pb and zn on bacterial community might via their influence on the functional groups involving nitrogen carbon and metal metabolisms graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial community core taxa nirs nirk nosz i qpcr 1 introduction microbial diversity abundance and community composition change along environmental gradients bier et al 2015 fan et al 2016 and these changes may help us identify a set of environmental characteristics to some groups of taxa the main purpose to determine the mechanisms of community adaptability is explaining the variation of ecosystem functioning ultimately predicting ecosystem responses to current and future environmental changes functional genes which contain the genes encoding key enzymes involved in biogeochemical cycling processes have been used to study microbial communities xu et al 2010 the abundance of microbial functional genes reflects the adaptability of functional groups in a specific ecological system so establishing the connection between community structure and function has been a main goal in microbial ecology berlemont et al 2014 at the same time establishing such a connection is especially critical for predicting how communities and functions will respond to environmental change trivedi et al 2013 shifts in the abundance and community composition contributing to a process represent another route by which an ecosystem can respond to environmental change allison et al 2013 bacterial diversity abundance and functional genes shift considerably along gradients of ph kuang et al 2016 available energy gülay et al 2016 guo et al 2015 trace metal concentration kumari et al 2015 sun et al 2016 salinity dini andreote et al 2014 and temperature zhou et al 2016 environmental change acts as a selective force against sensitive individuals resulting in species losses and possible cascading effects on ecosystem function carlisle and clements 2005 because the composition and functional genes abundance of microbial communities can be affected strongly by ph salinity metal concentrations and available energy we speculated that exposure to alkaline copper mine drainage alkmd would drive the shifts in microbial communities and specific functional groups composition nitrogen contamination in tailings reservoir is mainly caused by the blast of ammonium nitrate fuel oil explosives cyanide destruction flotation agent and the leaching or erosion of rainwater the excessive nitrogen is mainly removed by microbial denitrification in tailings water denitrification is an important microbial process that removes excessive nitrogen from contaminated water this dissimilatory process reduces nitrate no3 to nitrogen gas n2 through intermediates of nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o it is well known that the denitrification process exists in multiple environments wastewater gonzalez martinez et al 2015 xing et al 2017 grassland soil harter et al 2014 pan et al 2016 lakes agricultural fields ai et al 2017 ishii et al 2011 sediments baeseman et al 2006 however at present there is no report on the denitrifying bacteria in alkmd as bacteria play a central role in denitrification it is crucial to understand which factors control the abundance of denitrifying functional genes in alkmd zhongtiaoshan copper mine is the largest non coal underground mining mine in china with annual output of more than 4 million tons of ore liu et al 2017 it has a copper dominated ore body and is accompanied by some other metals such as fe pb zn cd mo et al he et al 2007 large amounts of waste water and waste residue containing a variety of heavy metals are produced in the process of mining massive accumulations of tailings cause serious pollution to the ecological environment so ecological restoration is particularly important in this region microorganisms play an important role in the process of ecological restoration which can reduce the toxicity of heavy metals and decompose excessive nutrient elements in tailings water the structure and diversity of microbial communities and the structure of functional microbial communities determine the resilience of the ecosystem this study aimed to address the following questions i how does alkmd affect microbial community structure ii how does alkmd affect core taxa iii how does alkmd affect microbial functional gene abundance our results indicated that microbial community composition and functional gene structure were distinct among sampling sites moreover such microbial functional patterns were highly correlated to environmental factors we speculate that the community structure in alkmd was shaped by environmental factors via influence on the functional microbial groups 2 materials and

results 3 1 the physicochemical gradient of drainage in tailings reservoir sampling locations spanned a gradient of alkmd contamination the highest values of ph no3 no2 were observed at stw1 which were significantly higher than that of stw3 sdsw and susw table 1 the ph ec no3 no2 and so4 2 showed a gradient along flow direction of drainage water that were stw1 stw2 stw3 as the tailings dam was built by the accretion of tailings sand just like a filter column part of the heavy metals and other contaminants were filtered out when the drainage permeates the tailings dam therefore seeping water in susw and sdsw had lower ph ec no3 no2 and so4 2 compared with stw water the higher levels of do tc toc and ic were measured at stw3 showing a trend of increase stw1 stw2 stw3 along the flow direction of drainage water table 1 ec so4 2 nh4 tc and toc had significant difference in susw and sdsw for these five heavy metals monitored only cd and zn gradually decreased along the flow direction but there was no significant difference among three drainage water sample points 3 2 overall bacterial community structure and taxa identification most of the filtered reads were within 400 500 bp in length averagely longer than 400 bp in total 27587 28168 23429 22330 and 21077 filtered sequences were obtained in five samples respectively according to sequence alignment at a sequence identity cut off value of 97 370 687 905 685 and 1010 otus were identified correspondingly table 2 according to the α diversity analysis the shannon values indicating the microbial diversity in five sample points were 3 16 5 79 5 65 5 39 and 6 37 respectively demonstrating a higher microbial diversity in four samples suvw stw2 stw3 sdvw compared with that in stw1 the otus ace chao1 and simpson indices were all minimal in stw1 compare to the other four samples and bacterial community richness showed an increasing trend along the direction of the flow table 2 pcoa based on bray curtis similarities showed that microbial community structures at different sampling locations were different microbial communities of five sampling points were divided into three groups with obvious differences in stw1 stw2 and susw stw3 and sdsw fig 2 the similarities of bacterial community structures were matched with the physochemical properties of drainage water samples table 1 approximately 99 9 of the sequences were classified into 26 different phyla across all the samples fig 3 the predominant phyla relative abundance was greater than 1 were proteobacteria the number of classified sequences in this phylum ranged from 41 20 to 89 49 in all the samples actinobacteria 0 41 24 44 thermi 2 30 22 81 firmicutes 3 79 13 99 bacteroidetes 2 50 7 72 cyanobacteria 0 11 4 70 chloroflexi 0 004 1 51 verrucomicrobia 0 01 2 19 and od1 0 007 1 30 there were seven predominant phyla which had significant correlation with environmental parameters table s3 proteobacteria in the five samples was distributed across the alpha 21 44 76 15 beta 2 49 12 31 and gamma 1 03 38 81 subphyla however delta 0 005 0 35 subphyla were detected in four samples except stw1 sequencing data showed that the composition of taxa in five samples was different there were a large proportion of sequences 31 80 66 70 which were not assigned to any genera bacterial communities in stw1 were dominated 54 06 by sequences of an uncultured genus of the rhodobacteraceae the abundance of rhodobacteraceae gradually decreased along the direction of flow the most abundant bacteria was deinococcus class deinococci in stw2 13 92 and susw 22 81 acinetobacter class γ proteobacterial in stw3 37 76 and mycobacterium class actinobacteria in sdsw 15 86 fig 5 table s2 bacterial abundances expressed gene copies in per ml water were based on broad 16s rdna targeted q pcr were ranging from 6 90 105 5 45 104 stw1 to 5 14 106 3 40 105 sdsw of total bacteria the bacterial 16s rdna gene copy number was significantly different p 01 among five samples fig 4 and this difference was correlated positively with do tc toc and ic and negatively with ec no3 no2 nh4 so4 2 as and pb table 4 3 3 spatial patterns of core taxa the top ten taxa with relative abundance greater than 1 at the level of class order family and genus respectively were defined as core taxa top ten classes accounted for 90 6 97 9 of the total identified sequences fig 5a top ten orders accounted for 82 2 92 0 fig 5b top ten families accounted for 62 1 86 7 fig 5c and top ten genera represented 27 3 56 4 fig 5d there was considerable inconsistency among five samples the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria order rhodobacterales family rhodobacteraceae and genus rhodobacter and betaproteobacteria order burkholderiales family comamonadaceae and genus hydrogenophaga gradually decreased along flow direction of drainage water however gammaproteobacteria order pseudomonadales family moraxellaceae genus acinetobacter and legionella actinobacteria order actinomycetales family mycobacteriaceae and genus mycobacterium synechococcophycideae genus synechococcus acidimicrobiia caulobacterales family caulobacteraceae and rhizobiales family phyllobacteriaceae gradually increased along flow direction of drainage water fig 5 the highest relative abundance of deinococci order deinococcales family deinococcaceae and genus deinococcus bacilli order bacillales family bacillaceae and genus bacillus flavobacteriia order flavobacteriales sphingomonadales family sphingomonadaceae and genus novosphingobium sphingobacteriia and microbacteriaceae genus candidatus aquiluna were observed in the stw2 there were also differences of core taxa community structure in susw and sdsw fig 5 3 4 relationships of bacterial community composition and environmental parameters mantel test showed that total bacterial community composition all otus was strongly correlated with ec no3 no2 tc and so4 2 likewise the predominant bacterial community composition abundant otus was significantly correlated to ec no3 no2 and ic table 3 in addition mantel tests also showed that the total and predominant bacterial community composition were not significantly correlated with ph do heavy metal as cd cu pb zn and geographic distance table 3 rda analysis results showed environmental parameters had significant influence on core taxa at the level of class f 2 4 p 05 order f 2 6 p 05 family f 2 5 p 05 and genus f 7 1 p 05 the results showed that core taxa were closely related to the content of no3 and no2 also so4 2 showed a significant influence on the class order and family level and ph on the order and family level table s8 multiple correlation analysis results showed that no3 no2 tc ic so4 2 and heavy metal as cu pb zn had significant influence in several core taxa tables s3 s7 3 5 variations of nirs nirk and noszi along drainage flow direction key functional genes for denitrification comprising genes encoding nitrite reductase nirs and nirk and nitrous oxide reductase nosz i were detected in five samples the nirs nirk and nosz i gene copy numbers ranged from 2 12 103 to 3 23 104 4 73 100 to 3 84 104 and 4 14 104 to 2 33 105 copies per ml water respectively in the studied samples fig 6 the copy number of nirs in stw3 and stw2 were significantly higher than that in stw1 and the copy number of nirk did not have significant difference in three reservoir water sampling points the maximum copy number of nosz i was observed in stw2 and had significant difference in three reservoir water sampling points the copy number of three denitrification functional genes in susw was significantly lower than in sdsw fig 6 the ratio of nirs 16s rdna nirk 16s rdna and nosz i 16s rdna ranged from 0 12 to 1 46 2 58 to 1 38 and 1 81 6 03 in five sampling points respectively fig 7 the relative abundance of nirs nirk and nosz i gradual decreased along the direction flow in reservoir water although there was no statistical significance for nirs and nirk fig 7 the relative abundance of nirs nirk and nosz i had no significant difference in seeping water nirs 16s rdna and nirk 16s rdna in reservoir water was 3 71 and 3 49 103 times as much as in seeping water respectively while nosz i 16s rdna in seeping water was 1 22 times as much as in reservoir water 3 6 the effects of environmental parameters on nirs nirk and noszi denitrifying functional genes nirs and nirk have similar response strategies to environmental change except do while nosz i was different the abundance of nirs and nirk was positively correlated with ph no3 no2 and negatively correlated with ic and zn although the effects of nitrogen no3 no2 and ph were not statistically significant on nirs however nosz i had an opposite trend with nirs and nirk table 4 the abundance of nirs nirk and nosz i were positively correlated with cu and negatively correlated with pb table 4 the pattern of the relative abundance of three denitrifying genes were consistent across five samples and all had a negative correlation with sampling location fig 8 which were closely related to the availability of nutrients no3 no2 ic ph and heavy metal zn elements table 4 4 discussion 4 1 microbial communities in alkmd the distribution of different microbial groups in relation to biotic and abiotic characteristics of its environment can provide important clues to help us to understand the basis of the organism physiology and its function within an ecosystem some studies showed that microbial communities were sensitive to changes of local environmental conditions mykrä et al 2017 nie et al 2016 and our results were consistent with these previous studies our data showed that α diversity and β diversity of bacterial community changed along flow direction of drainage table 2 figs 2 and 4 and these compositional shifts were correlated with the concentration of no3 no2 so4 2 and tc table 3 table 4 there was limited evidence showed that such patterns of diversity may be structured by a species sorting process i e the selection by local environmental conditions crump et al 2012 this pattern of bacterial community composition was a manifestation of adaptation to environmental conditions such as responses to the availability of nitrate sulfate and carbon for energy metabolism rather the variation of bacterial abundance might be because of stressors that effecting cellular processes and signaling bier et al 2015 when an ecosystem exists extreme environmental alteration such as tailings wastewater discharge we expect organisms favored by the changes to flourish and sensitive taxa to fail this stress response could shift community composition across environmental gradients as well as increase taxa richness at lower pollution levels and increase diversity at intermediate pollution levels where sensitive and tolerant taxa overlap niyogi et al 2007 this was a possible explanation for microbial taxa richness and diversity responses to the alkmd gradient as and pb significantly inhibited the abundance of bacterial community table 4 microorganism community under the action of toxic heavy metals could reduce or even lose the metabolic capability of carbon nitrogen and sulfur li et al 2015 therefore high concentrations of heavy metals significantly inhibit the number of bacteria heavy metal mediated toxicity was usually due to inactivation of enzymes membrane impairment interaction with nucleic acids variation in nutrient transport and availability of the substrate the inhibition of enzymes cell membranes and nucleic acids by heavy metals was due to the binding of metals to enzyme proteins membrane proteins and nuclease thereby altering their structure yadav et al 2016 ultimately resulting in the loss of cytoactive in acid mine drainage amd systems ph strongly correlates with microbial community diversity richness and functional gene abundance huang et al 2016 kuang et al 2016 although ph had statistically distinct between reservoir water and seeping water table 1 ph was not an important factor correlate of composition or diversity metrics table 3 table 4 in this study consistent with prior study on alkmd bier et al 2015 this might be explained by the limited ph range in this study 8 01 9 38 only 1 orders of magnitude relative to prior studies in amd not less than 4 orders of magnitude the lack of significant correlation between ph and diversity in shibahe tailings reservoir suggested that other chemical constituents such as ec no3 no2 so4 2 and numerous trace elements were stronger determinants of bacterial community structure than ph geographical distance had a significant influence on the structure of bacterial community and the difference of community diversity was obvious with the increase of geographic distance lee et al 2013 roguet et al 2015 however there was no significant correlation between bacterial community structure and geographic distance in this study table 3 indicating that the main factor affecting the change of bacterial community structure was environmental selection rather than diffusion limitation the qpcr estimated all bacterial abundances fig 4 were somewhat higher than those estimated by amplicon sequencing table 2 but dissimilarity of bacterial abundance when using different primers table s1 in pcr based surveys was well documented gülay et al 2016 amplification efficiency of 101 1 for qpcr reactions was also an important factor in overestimation of bacterial abundance bacterial communities assemble because of functional adaptation in extreme habitat chan et al 2013 kuang et al 2016 high abundance of a member of the proteobacteria in five samples fig 3 consistent with others of alkmd bier et al 2015 suggesting their central role in the process of tailings water purification the largest decrease in abundance from stw1 to sdsw was noted for the proteobacteria due to the decrease of the typical denitrifying taxa rhodobacteraceae hydrogenophaga and rhodobacter table s2 resulted from the reduction of no3 and no2 table s6 table s7 the trend of actinobacteria abundance was opposite to proteobacteria and it gradually increased from stw1 to sdsw fig 3 this was mainly caused by the changes in so4 2 and toc concentrations table s3 which was consistent with bier s bier et al 2015 findings on water bacteria contrary to this study hou hou et al 2017 studied on soil bacteria pointed out that ec was positively related to actinobacteria whereas tc was negatively related to actinobacteria this was possibly due to the differences of subjects and study areas the abundances of firmicutes bacteroidetes and thermi were higher in stw2 and susw which was consistent with the moderate pollution hypothesis suggesting the three taxa showed similar or slightly different niches gülay et al 2016 cyanobacteria and chloroflexi were common aquatic autotrophic microorganisms the relative abundances of cyanobacteria and chloroflexi increased along the flow direction in the reservoir water fig 2 the gradually decrease of nh4 no2 no3 and increase of tc concentration table s3 were the most important factors affecting the distribution of cyanobacteria and chloroflexi cyanobacteria adapted contaminated habitats by releasing extracellular polymeric substances buffering against environmental stressors flemming et al 2010 members of the phylum verrucomicrobia were abundant in diverse habitats including soil water and sediments as well as extreme environments such as in the hot springs low ph 2 0 2 5 and soda lake habitats freitas et al 2012 hou et al 2008 shen et al 2017 the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia increased along the flow direction in reservoir water fig 3 and this could be explained by pb schneider et al 2017 and toc freitas et al 2012 concentration change od1 played an important ecological role in impacting hydrogen and sulfur cycles castelle et al 2017 wrighton et al 2012 whether od1 is associated with sulfur cycling in alkmd is pending further study 4 2 core taxa and their likely eco physiology role the dominant microflora plays a key role in the ecosystem so the dynamics of the dominant flora can indirectly reflect the adaptation process of the whole bacterial community to environmental change ten top core bacterial community composition from class to genus varied among the five samples but core genera were shared across the samples fig 5 table s2 indicating that environmental conditions in the alkmd had similar background and specific conditions of each sample point had secondary influence on the microbial community composition gülay et al 2016 core taxa rhodobacteraceae rhodobacter and hydrogenophaga in stw1 acinetobacter in stw3 deinococcus in susw and mycobacterium in sdsw were abundant fig 5c and d suggesting different ecological functioning roles it would indicate selection as a dominant force for community assembly via core taxa of functional microbes core taxa at different taxonomic levels had similar adaptive capabilities and this adaptation was best explained by no3 no2 tc and ic concentration changes table s4 s7 major aquatic bacteria rhodobacteraceae and alkaliphilic genera rhodobacter were all typical phototrophic purple non sulfur bacteria and no3 and no2 were used as an electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration glaring et al 2015 lu et al 2014 hydrogenophaga was a common bacterium flora in polluted environment and acquired their energy by denitrification muturi et al 2017 park et al 2005 therefore nitrate concentration was an important factor regulating community structure change phyllobacteriaceae has a remarkable adaptive capacity to the environment jurado et al 2005 liu et al 2012 in addition to its potential for denitrification it might also be produced in the carbon cycle mycobacterium was distributed in many habitats liu et al 2017 and closely related to carbon decomposition flavobacteriales and novosphingobium were also common taxa in contaminated habitats jiao et al 2016 salis et al 2017 and they could produce transparent exopolymer particles taylor et al 2014 xing et al 2015 to reduce the toxicity of heavy metals the highest relative abundance of legionella was in susw fig 4 and majority of legionella species were of aquatic origin and were considered as facultative pathogenic burstein et al 2016 lesnik et al 2016 in addition wullings wullings et al 2011 described that the abundance and diversity of legionella were influenced by the dissolved organic carbon in drinking water but whether they had same adaptability in alkmd is still not reported 4 3 change in copy number of denitrifying genes and availability of energy nitrate concentrations were an important factor affecting the change of denitrifying functional gene abundances following the nitrate gradient in the water column as previously observed in the colne estuary smith et al 2015 the boreal lakes saarenheimo et al 2015 and groundwater zhang et al 2016 available energy directly influences bacterial cellular metabolism and was related to chemical processes such as nutrient availability siles and margesin 2016 denitrification is driven by denitrifying microorganisms and is crucial in the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen our results showed that denitrifying bacterial abundance and relative abundance could change drastically in conjunction with environmental variation table 4 fig 8 the consistent increase of nirs from stw1 to sdsw fig 6 was mainly due to the inhibition effect of pb and zn gradually decreased along the flow direction of tailings water table 4 indicating that denitrifying bacteria were highly sensitive to heavy metal contamination dell anno et al 2003 the copy numbers of nirk and nosz ι were significantly correlated with the no3 and no2 but they showed an opposite trend table 4 it showed that they had different ecological adaptabilities coyotzi et al 2017 the relative abundances of the three denitrifying genes were significantly correlated with the nutrition gradient sampling position table 4 fig 8 which was consistent with other studies franklin et al 2017 saarenheimo et al 2015 the decrease of no3 and no2 concentration reduced the abundance of denitrifying bacteria the total nirs nirk nosz ι ratio was below 1 1 in this study indicating that the microbial community had a higher potential to reduce n2o than to produce it this implies that there won t be much greenhouse gas n2o emissions into the atmosphere during the denitrification process moreover we found that both abundance and relative abundance of nirs and nirk were minimal in susw and this might be due to the higher zn but lower cu concentration bioavailability of cu and fe could control the expression and activity of nitrite and nitrous oxide reductases while the production of nirs gene was an iron containing cd1 type reductase and that of nirk was a copper containing reductases possible cu and fe limitation might lead to decrease in abundance of nirs and nirk unfortunately data on fe concentrations were not available and we could not fully exclude fe limitation as a controlling factor in abundance of nirs decrease in susw the variation trend of abundance and relative abundance of nosz ι gene was different from that of nirs and nirk and the abundance of nosz ι was the lowest fig 6 but its relative abundance was the highest in stw1 fig 7 which closely related to the abundance of acinetobacter fig 4d acinetobacter was a main denitrifying bacterium that containing the nosz ι gene in order to adapt these harsh environments acinetobacter have developed compatible functions such as nitrogen metabolism coyotzi et al 2017 and heavy metals tolerance abdelhaleem et al 2006 5 conclusions in summary the results showed that compositional variation of bacteria was related to water chemistry variables in this study area further implying the influence of environment changes on community assembly bacterial community composition was strongly controlled by the availability of nutrients like carbon nitrogen sulfur and the toxic effects of heavy metals suggesting the importance of niche based processes in microbial community assembly may strongly depend on the local environmental context bacterial abundance and diversity were influenced by ec no3 no2 and so4 2 the abundances of core taxa including class order family and genus were significantly correlated with nitrogen no3 and no2 content moreover core taxa in class order and family level were shaped by the so4 2 and ph the changes of no3 and no2 influenced the abundances of nirk and nosz ι rather than nirs and the latter might be related to toc heavy metals as pb and zn significantly reduced the abundances of all bacteria and denitrifying bacteria while cu promoted the abundance of denitrifying bacteria our results thus highlighted that species sorting processes force drove community structure and functionally similar taxa in this highly polluted ecosystem a better understanding of the adaptation mechanisms of microbial communities in alkmd is needed to predict how environmental alteration is likely to affect microbial communities acknowledgments this study was supported by national science foundation of china 31772450 31600308 and the

19724,by simulating decreasing inflow concentrations the extent of desorption of organic micropollutants omp from three activated carbons ac was examined in laboratory batch tests the tested ac showed strong differences in pore size distribution and could therefore be characterized as typical micro meso and macroporous ac respectively adsorption and desorption conditions were varied by using drinking water containing dissolved organic matter dom and dom free pure water as background solutions to examine the influence of dom on omp desorption for the different ac under ideal conditions adsorption and desorption in pure water adsorption of the tested omp was found to be highly up to completely reversible for all tested ac under real conditions adsorption and desorption in drinking water additional dom adsorption affects desorption in different ways depending on the ac pore structure for the micro and mesoporous ac an increased irreversibility of omp adsorption was found which shows that dom adsorption prevents omp desorption this could be referred to pore blockage effects that occur during the parallel adsorption of dom and omp for the macroporous ac dom adsorption led to an enhanced omp desorption which could be attributed to displacement processes these results show that smaller pores tend to be blocked by dom which hinders omp from desorption the overall larger pores of the macroporous ac do not get blocked which could allow i omp to desorb and ii dom to enter and displace omp graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated carbon organic micropollutants desorption adsorption drinking water dissolved organic matter 1 introduction despite their trace level concentrations organic micropollutants omp such as pharmaceuticals and household chemicals are suspected to be a potential risk for aquatic ecosystems as well as for human health a promising technique for the removal of omp in water treatment processes is the application of activated carbon ac adsorption in water treatment is generally supposed to be dominated by physical adsorption crittenden et al 2005 worch 2012 due to the comparatively low binding energies involved in physisorption adsorption processes are considered reversible it is therefore assumed that previously adsorbed compounds can desorb and reach the aqueous solution again thus desorption could lead to an undesired increase of omp concentrations in the effluent of ac stages during the regular treatment process essentially the occurrence of desorption requires i a loading of the adsorbent surface with adsorbates and ii a change in solute concentration and or composition in the inflow of the system thus desorption can occur in processes where the ac retention time is much higher than the hydraulic retention time this is especially the case when ac is applied as granular media in filters but desorption might also occur in systems where powdered ac is separated by sand filters and remains there until backwashing typically after several hours altmann et al 2015a or where powdered ac is recirculated within the treatment system meinel et al 2016 the mechanisms which can lead to desorption in water treatment are a a displacement of an adsorbate from an adsorption site by subsequent adsorption of a competitive adsorbate and b a reversion of the reaction pathway due to high omp loadings on the ac surface and low omp concentration in the bulk aqueous phase scenario a can be interpreted as competitive adsorption which is the object of a high number of studies pelekani and snoeyink 1999 quinlivan et al 2005 zietzschmann et al 2014b however competition effects in terms of omp adsorption are mainly examined concerning simultaneous adsorption of target and competitive compounds the effects of a subsequent occurrence or a subsequent increase of concentration of competitive substances on already adsorbed omp are only rarely studied scenario b can occur due to a sudden decrease of the inflow concentration e g after a stoppage of a long lasting contamination if the liquid phase concentration is below the equilibrium concentration that corresponds to the solid phase concentration on the ac a reversion of the sorption pathway and a transition of already adsorbed omp from the adsorbent into the liquid phase might be the result such gradient reversal induced desorption from ac has been rarely examined to date especially with respect to omp several authors studied the reversibility of adsorption of other compounds like phenol dyes tanthapanichakoon et al 2005 pentachlorophenol mollah and robinson 1996 toluene chatzopoulos et al 1993 or btex yakout and daifullah 2014 there are no consistent findings concerning the reversibility of adsorption onto ac in these studies whereas in some cases hysteresis was found other studies see completely reversible adsorption of the respective adsorbent onto ac desorption studies with respect to omp focused on the kinetics of desorption corwin and summers 2011 to et al 2008a b the results by to et al 2008a b indicate that dissolved organic matter dom of real waters can have different effects on the kinetics of atrazine desorption pore blocking compounds could decrease desorption kinetics whereas directly competing compounds could increase kinetics however no clear conclusions concerning the potential extent of omp desorption under equilibrium conditions could be drawn from these results with respect to omp adsorption it is known that dom affects not only the kinetics of adsorption but also the extent capacity of adsorption de ridder et al 2011 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 zietzschmann et al 2016a these competitive effects of dom are referred to two causes i direct competition of omp and dom on adsorption sites zietzschmann et al 2014b and ii pore blockage by dom adsorption and as a result decreased availability of adsorption sites quinlivan et al 2005 both effects have the same consequence a lower extent of omp adsorption under equilibrium conditions however the cause and extent of competition effects was shown to be influenced by the ac pore size distribution quinlivan et al 2005 with respect to desorption it can be assumed that pore blocking dom and directly competing dom do not have the same but opposite effects on the extent of desorption under equilibrium conditions direct competition on adsorption sites would potentially lead to enhanced desorption by displacement whereas pore blockages could lead to steric hindrance and decreased desorption these mechanisms were examined in the current study by elucidating the extent of omp desorption under ideal dom free conditions the extent of omp desorption under real conditions and the effects of dom on desorption the influence of ac pore characteristics on desorption under ideal as well as under real conditions 2 material methods 2 1 activated carbons three commercial granular activated carbons ac were used for experiments hydraffin cc raw material as given by the manufacturer coconut husk donau carbon germany epibon a raw material lignite donau carbon germany and hc hk 1200 raw material renewable material csc germany they were pulverized on a pulverisette mill fritsch germany and sieved retsch germany to obtain powdered ac with particle sizes below 63 μm before usage the ac materials were dried at 105 c overnight and stored in a desiccator until experimental usage 2 2 organic micropollutants five substances which can typically be found in ng l to μg l concentrations in waste water treatment plant effluents margot et al 2013 zietzschmann et al 2014a were used as representative omp for experiments carbamazepine diclofenac 4 formylaminoantipyrine sulfamethoxazole all sigma aldrich germany and iomeprol dr ehrenstorfer germany from initial single stock solutions with a concentration of 20 mg l a mixed stock solution with concentrations of 2 mg l of each omp was prepared from this mixed stock solution certain amounts were taken to spike the particular experimental solutions for the adsorption experiments 2 3 experimental procedure 2 3 1 standard batch experiments batch experiments were conducted with the three ac products in parallel the adsorbents were prepared as stock suspensions in ultra pure water with concentrations of 0 2 and 1 5 g l for adsorption in pure water and 0 8 and 5 g l respectively for adsorption in drinking water prior to the experiments the suspensions were degassed under partial vacuum in an ultrasonic sound bath for 10 min and subsequently homogenized with a magnetic stirrer the experimental procedure is shown in fig 1 it was adapted from multi stage adsorption tests carried out by zietzschmann et al 2015a all experiments consisted of an adsorption and a desorption phase respectively for the adsorption phase centrifuge flasks 175 ml falcon usa were filled with 100 ml of an adsorption solution this solution was previously spiked with omp to a concentration level of 50 μg l each per batch series seven different doses of the respective ac were added from stock suspensions using lab pipettes eppendorf germany added volumes were between 250 and 1000 μl so that dilution due to dosing is negligible after an equilibrium contact time of 48 h on a horizontal shaker certomat r braun biotech germany 220 rpm the ac and the aqueous phase were separated by centrifugation hettich rotanta germany 3000 rpm for 10 min 95 ml of the supernatant were removed using a modified bulb pipette with an electric pipetting aid easy pet eppendorf germany a residue of 5 ml remained in the centrifuge flask to assure that no ac was withdrawn the extracted 95 ml were filtered with 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose membrane filters chromafil xtra macherey nagel germany subsequently 100 ml of an unspiked desorption solution were added to the loaded ac in the centrifuge flask to initialize the desorption phase the suspension was put again on the horizontal shaker for thorough mixing for another 48 h before the ac was removed by membrane filtration as mentioned above 48 h were chosen based on previous tests with the ac epibon a where this time was identified as sufficient also for reaching the desorption equilibrium see figure s 8 and figure s 9 in the supporting information all samples were stored at 4 c prior to analyses the experiments were conducted under different background conditions by using different experimental solutions i ultra pure water provided by a maxima uf device elga labwater germany and ii berlin drinking water taken from laboratory tap after adequate flushing the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254nm and the specific uv254nm absorbance suva of the raw drinking water are presented in table 1 the omp concentrations of the raw drinking water can be found in table s 2 in the supporting information for the different experiments both waters were used as adsorption and desorption solution respectively in different combinations table 2 gives a summary of the conducted experiments and the corresponding applied adsorption and desorption solutions each experimental series of adsorption desorption combination included 7 interrelated batches which only varied in the applied ac doses meaning no replicates of identical batches were conducted for adsorption in pure water ac doses were between 0 5 and 15 mg l for adsorption in drinking water doses ranged from 2 to 50 mg l 2 3 2 sequential batch experiments additional experiments were conducted where the adsorption phase consisted of two separate parts see experiment 5 in table 2 firstly ac was added to100 ml unspiked drinking water after 48 h contact time the batches were spiked with omp by adding 2 5 ml of the omp stock solution to every flask leading again to an omp concentration of 50 μg l each subsequently flasks were shaken for another 48 h afterwards the batches were centrifuged 95 ml of the supernatant were removed and 100 ml unspiked drinking water were added as desorption solution the contact time for the desorption phase was 72 h in this case in parallel a reference experiment after standard procedure with spiked drinking water as adsorption solution was conducted with 96 h contact time for adsorption and 72 h contact time for desorption all other parameters were the same as in the standard batch experiments 2 4 analytics the concentrations of the examined omp were determined using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms based on a method established previously altmann et al 2015b zietzschmann et al 2016a 2015b 2016b for the chromatographic separation an xselect hss t3 column 2 1 50 mm waters usa with 2 5 μm particle size was used the mobile phases were ultra pure water with 0 1 vol formic acid hplc grade sigma aldrich germany and pure methanol hplc grade j t baker usa eluents were pumped at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min running a linear gradient from 97 aqueous mobile phase to 100 methanol a split valve was used to reduce the load to the electrospray ionization positive mode which was followed by ion fragmentation and analysis with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer tsq vantage thermo scientific usa for each omp two mass fragments were chosen according to the daios database provided by the zweckverband landesversorgung stuttgart germany and used for substance identification by the characteristic ratio of their peak areas substance quantification was performed using the more abundant fragment ion in combination with deuterated internal standards toronto research chemicals canada and data evaluation was conducted using xcalibur 2 1 software thermo scientific limits of quantification loqs see table s 1 in the supporting information were chosen as the calibration level at which the less abundant fragment ion qualifier had a signal to noise ratio of 3 calibration levels were 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 5 10 and

analysensysteme germany using high temperature catalytic combustion and non dispersive infrared detection of formed co2 a lambda 12 photospectrometer perkin elmer usa with 10 mm spurasil quartz cuvettes hellma germany was used to determine uv254nm for fractionation and further characterization of organic carbon composition selected samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography coupled with an online organic carbon detector lc ocd doc labor dr huber germany the pre filtered sample was fractionated in a size exclusion chromatographic column hw50s toyopearl japan doc of the fractionated sample was measured online with an infrared ultramat 6 detector siemens germany after previous oxidation of the dom in a gräntzel thin film reactor as mobile phase a pure water solution containing na2hpo4 8 4 mmol l and kh2po4 18 4 mmol l was used 2 5 activated carbon pore structure characterization bet specific surface area ssa and pore size distribution of the tested ac were determined with an autosorb 1 mp device quantachrome usa ac samples were degassed at 105 c gas physisorption isotherms were determined with n2 as well as co2 the non local density functional theory model was used to analyze the pore size distribution bet ssa was determined from n2 isotherms in the pressure region p p0 0 01 0 50 micropore analysis from n2 isotherms was conducted using the v t method 2 6 calculations the loading after adsorption qads is calculated using eq 1 1 q a d s c 0 a d s c a d s m where c0 ads is the initial concentration before adsorption cads is the concentration of the treated sample and m is the respective ac dose the loading after desorption qdes is calculated using eq 2 2 q d e s q a d s 1 05 c d e s 0 05 c a d s c 0 d e s m where c0 des is the initial concentration of the desorption solution and cdes is the concentration of the sample after desorption phase the factors consider the respective volumes of the different solution elements 5 ml adsorption solution remain in the flask after centrifugation which corresponds to 5 of the initial adsorption solution volume of 100 ml this leads to a total volume of 105 ml which corresponds to 105 of the initial adsorption solution volume in the desorption phase after adding 100 ml desorption solution a detailed derivation of these equations is given in the supporting information the freundlich coefficient kf and the freundlich exponent n were calculated after converting the freundlich equation into its linearized form eq 3 3 log q n log c log k f 2 7 data evaluation the experiments were evaluated by the use of adsorption and desorption isotherms the position of the desorption isotherm in comparison to the corresponding adsorption isotherm can give information about the extent of desorption by distinction between i non or partially reversible adsorption desorption isotherm left of above the adsorption isotherm ii completely reversible adsorption congruence of ad and desorption isotherm or iii enhanced desorption by additional displacement of adsorbates desorption isotherm right of below adsorption isotherm note that the entire adsorption desorption isotherm curves were evaluated not single data points in order to use all available interrelated batches to increase the robustness of the results as no replicates were conducted as can be seen in the previous section the calculation of qdes includes four different measured concentration values the error in qads and qdes calculation increase with decreasing differences of c0 ads cads and cdes thus the error in isotherm data rises to the right part of the isotherm with higher loadings and higher residual concentrations an exemplary error analysis can be found in the supporting information to reduce errors only those data pairs were considered for the depiction in isotherms where cads c0 ads of the respective omp was below 75 3 results discussion 3 1 activated carbon pore characteristics and dom adsorption the summarized results of the surface area and pore size distribution analyses of the tested activated carbons ac are shown in table 3 detailed pore size distributions of the three ac are shown in figure s 2 in the supporting information all ac have bet specific surface areas ssa 1000 m2 g and thus meet typical values for highly activated carbons concerning pore size distribution the tested ac cover a wide range for the hydraffin cc 95 of the total surface area is located in the micropores of this ac and associated therewith the average pore size of 16 8 å is comparatively low thus the hydraffin cc reflects a typical microporous ac the hk 1200 shows the lowest percentage of micropore surface area with 64 and has a comparatively high average pore size of around 33 å it therefore reflects a macroporous ac the epibon a has medium values for the percentage of micropore area and the average pore size it can therefore be characterized as a mesoporous ac the differences in pore structure affect the adsorption of dom this is exemplarily shown in fig 2 which contains the lc ocd chromatograms of drinking water before and after treatment with the three ac all chromatograms after treatment are below the raw water chromatogram showing dom adsorption onto all tested ac by subtracting the corresponding oc data points before after adsorption for every point of the chromatogram differences in dom adsorption characteristics can be visualized these differential chromatograms are also shown in fig 2 they reflect the removal of different dom fractions huber et al 2011 epibon a shows the highest removal for all dom fractions the strongest abatement can be seen for humic substances retention time 42 min which also goes along with the highest suva removal of all tested ac see figure s 3 in the supporting information but also smaller compounds like building blocks retention time 46 min and low molecular weight acids and neutrals retention time 49 min are removed this indicates a certain variability in the available adsorption sites and a good accessibility of these sites the differential chromatogram of the hk1200 shows generally lower dom attenuation but also removal of all dom fractions with a maximum for humic substances with respect to their pore size distribution both meso and macroporous ac allow relatively good dom removal due to sufficiently high pore widths in contrast the microporous hydraffin cc mainly removes low molecular weight organic compounds with a retention time 50 min and has the lowest doc removal of all tested ac despite representing the quantitatively largest fraction in raw water dom humic compounds only adsorb poorly onto the hydraffin cc this indicates that dom compounds of higher molecular weight cannot enter the micropores of this ac but only can adsorb in the comparatively small amount of meso and macropores 3 2 desorption under ideal conditions in experiment 1 adsorption as well as desorption took place in pure water as background matrix thereby desorption as a result of concentration gradient reversal under ideal conditions should be examined fig 3 shows the resulting ad and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine for all tested ac here and in the following sections results will be presented by means of carbamazepine as representative omp for reasons of clarity the analogous results of the other tested compounds can be found in the supporting information they generally confirm the findings presented in this and the following sections therefore the discussion of the presented results also includes the evaluation of isotherms of the other tested omp comparing the carbamazepine loading of all ac after adsorption the hk 1200 despite highest bet ssa shows significantly lower carbamazepine adsorption compared to hydraffin cc and epibon a this trend can generally be seen for all omp see figure s 12 in the supporting information this is in agreement with the results of zietzschmann et al 2014a which show that a higher bet ssa does not correlate with higher omp removal comparing the corresponding adsorption and desorption isotherms it can be seen that for the mesoporous epibon a and the macroporous hk 1200 both isotherms show generally high congruence this congruence indicates a completely reversible adsorption of omp onto these ac for the microporous hydraffin cc the desorption isotherm superimposes the adsorption isotherm for loadings below 30 μg mg for the data point with the highest loading of 35 μg mg a shift to the left after desorption can be seen this could indicate that adsorption of carbamazepine onto this microporous ac is partly irreversible for higher loadings however this observation is only based on one data point and thus not conclusive furthermore it cannot clearly be stated that in contrast to the two other ac after 48 h of desorption carbamazepine has completely reached equilibrium state for the hydraffin cc see figure s 8 in the supporting information thus no clear statements regarding the reversibility can be made nevertheless partly irreversible adsorption of compounds onto microporous ac was seen by tanthapanichakoon et al 2005 for the ad desorption of reactive dyes whereas mesoporous ac also showed completely reversible adsorption in this case abromaitis et al 2016 also showed hysteresis for the ad desorption of metoprolol using a microporous ac in organic free water 3 3 desorption in the presence of organic matter the desorption again after adsorption of omp in pure water in experiment 2 was conducted with unspiked drinking water which was free of omp concentrations below the limit of quantification see table s 2 thus the occurring concentration gradient between the loaded ac surface and the desorption solution for the initial desorption phase is expected to be the same as in experiment 1 thereby the potential effect of parallel adsorption of dom on omp desorption should be examined fig 4 shows the corresponding adsorption and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine from this experiment the adsorption isotherms in fig 4 are partly different from adsorption isotherms from experiment 1 fig 3 although the experimental conditions were similar in both cases adsorption in pure water the experiments were conducted on different days meaning that different ac stock suspensions were prepared and used it is known that activated carbon is a largely inhomogeneous material which leads to different adsorption behavior of different ac fractions that can be found even within one batch of activated carbon frank et al 2015 ruhl et al 2015 we assume that these inhomogeneities led to the differences in the isotherms however with respect to the discussion made in the following the adsorption desorption data points originate from the same experimental batch and thus the corresponding adsorption and desorption isotherms are directly comparable the desorption isotherms for the epibon a and the hk 1200 are below the corresponding adsorption isotherms this shift indicates that desorption of omp in this case is not only induced by the concentration gradient reversal but enhanced by the dom adsorption pelekani and snoeyink 1999 showed that omp which adsorbed onto ac with bigger pore sizes can be displaced by organic matter it is therefore likely that the enhanced desorption in the case of these ac is caused by omp displacement from the adsorption sites by organic matter for the hydraffin cc the desorption isotherm is left above of the adsorption isotherm this shift is slightly higher than after desorption in pure water fig 3 it indicates that dom adsorption in this case prevents omp desorption for microporous ac it is known that omp adsorb in pore regions that cannot be reached by dom pelekani and snoeyink 1999 furthermore it is expected that adsorbing dom blocks the pores of microporous ac to a greater extent hu et al 2016 this can explain the enhanced irreversibility of omp adsorption as the adsorbed omp molecules are prevented from desorption by steric hindrance as a result of pore blockage further kinetic experiments can underline these assumptions see figure s 11 in the supporting information for epibon a and hk 1200 the adsorption of dom and the desorption of omp are similarly fast in contrast the adsorption of dom onto the hydraffin cc is clearly faster than the corresponding desorption of omp this indicates that the adsorbing dom is able to block pores before omp would desorb and thereby prevent their desorption 3 4 desorption after parallel adsorption of micropollutants and organic matter in experiment 3 the adsorption solution was drinking water spiked with omp whereas the desorption solution was pure water during this experiment omp and dom adsorbed in parallel whereas the desorption could occur without any further adsorption of compounds in this case a concentration gradient reversal does not only occur for the omp but also for the dom in contrast to the desorption of omp lc ocd chromatograms show strongest dom desorption for the highest ac doses and thus lowest doc loadings for all tested ac see figure s 7 in the supporting information with decreasing dose and increasing loading also the concentration of desorbed doc decreases thus a steeper concentration gradient between ac and water does not lead to a stronger desorption in case of the dom as the dom is a complex mixture with differences in adsorbability it can be assumed that increasing ac doses also lead to an enhanced adsorption of less adsorbable dom compounds sontheimer et al 1988 it seems likely that these compounds have a higher tendency of desorption vice versa low ac doses lead to high loadings of well adsorbable dom with a lower tendency of desorption thus nearly no doc desorption can be seen for low ac doses a generally low desorption tendency of dom during desorption in pure water was also seen by newcombe 1994 fig 5 shows the ad and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine from this experiment for the microporous hydraffin cc high loadings are retained during desorption as the desorption isotherm is located left of the adsorption isotherm a similar tendency can be found for the mesoporous epibon a in these two cases partly irreversible adsorption of omp occurred which can be attributed to the parallel adsorption of dom due to the pore structures of these ac it can be assumed that the irreversible adsorption of dom can lead to pore blockages which remain also during the desorption phase such an irreversible pore blockage can then lead to a steric hindrance of desorption of omp which are adsorbed in the pore area behind adsorbed dom molecules leading to generally less omp desorption such an effect cannot be seen for the macroporous hk 1200 in contrast to the other tested ac adsorption and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine are congruent in this case which indicates completely reversible adsorption as already seen in fig 3 after adsorption in pure water thus the parallel adsorption of dom does not affect the desorption of omp in this case it can be assumed that due to the generally larger pore width of the hk 1200 dom adsorption does not lead to pore blockages thus omp desorption is not hindered by steric effects but can still occur without hindrance like under ideal conditions in experiment 1 kinetic experiments can support this assumption see figure s 10 in the supporting information for the hk 1200 adsorption of doc and carbamazepine are equally fast with rising microporosity the adsorption of omp is faster than that of the dom thus it is possible that carbamazepine adsorbs in deeper parts of the ac pores which then get blocked by subsequently adsorbing dom 3 5 desorption under real conditions by using drinking water as background matrix for adsorption and desorption a concentration decrease in a dom containing water and thus under realistic conditions should be simulated in experiment 4 in this case a parallel adsorption of omp and dom occurs during the adsorption phase as the adsorption solution is replaced by fresh drinking water the dom concentration at the start of the desorption phase is above the equilibrium dom concentration at the end of the adsorption phase this leads to an additional subsequent adsorption of dom during the desorption phase see figure s 5 in the supporting information fig 6 shows the ad and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine for this experiment for the microporous hydraffin cc the desorption isotherm is strongly shifted to the left in comparison to its corresponding adsorption isotherm and close to the y axis also for high ac loadings this indicates a strong irreversibility of omp adsorption onto microporous ac under real conditions it was shown that both the adsorption of dom parallel to the omp adsorption fig 5 as well as the subsequent dom adsorption during the desorption phase fig 4 leads to an enhanced irreversibility of omp adsorption both effects are also assumed to occur in this case and lead to a prevention of omp desorption for the epibon a the desorption isotherm of carbamazepine is congruent with the adsorption isotherm for lower ac loadings but shifts to the left with increasing loadings in the further course of the isotherm this indicates partly irreversible adsorption for higher ac loadings in the previous experiments it was shown that the parallel adsorption of omp and dom leads to irreversible adsorption whereas subsequent adsorption of dom can enhance desorption by displacement in this experiment both effects appear in comparison to fig 5 the desorption isotherm is shifted slightly in direction of the adsorption isotherm for lower loadings this indicates slightly enhanced omp desorption by dom displacement for higher loadings the desorption isotherm differs from the adsorption isotherm and shifts to the left it can be assumed that in this case subsequently adsorbing dom could not reach adsorption sites of omp as the pores of the highly loaded ac are blocked by dom previously adsorbed during the adsorption phase this effect also hinders adsorbed omp from desorption as shown in fig 5 as a result no enhanced but decreased desorption occurs for the highly loaded mesoporous ac in contrast for the macroporous hk 1200 the desorption isotherm is below the corresponding adsorption isotherm throughout its complete course which indicates enhanced desorption also for higher loadings it can be assumed that the larger pores of hk 1200 avoid pore blockage by dom as seen in fig 5 thus no hindrance of omp desorption resulting from the concentration gradient reversal occurs furthermore the absent pore blockages allows dom to enter the ac pores during desorption phase and additionally displace omp as seen in fig 4 which leads to enhanced omp desorption in this case 3 6 sequential adsorption of dom and omp with subsequent desorption for testing the assumed hypothesis of pore blockage effects sequential adsorption experiments were conducted where a dom adsorption phase preceded the omp adsorption phase fig 7 shows a comparison of adsorption isotherms for carbamazepine after simultaneous and sequential adsorption as these isotherms originate from parallel experiments potential ac inhomogeneities as they were discussed in the context of experiment 1 and 2 should not influence the isotherms in this case thus they are directly comparable for all tested ac the carbamazepine adsorption isotherm after simultaneous adsorption is above the one after sequential adsorption this shows pore blockage effects in all cases subsequently added omp partly cannot enter the ac pores after dom adsorption which leads to decreased adsorption however the differences between the corresponding isotherms differ for the different ac for a quantitative evaluation of these differences the resulting kf values between simultaneous and sequential adsorption were compared therefore for each isotherm kf and n were calculated by a best fit method after linearization subsequently n values of the corresponding adsorption isotherms were averaged and kf were calculated again with the averaged n the strongest decrease of kf due to subsequent adsorption was found for the microporous hydraffin cc kf seq kf sim 46 indicating strongest pore blocking effects with rising average pore size the kf seq kf sim ratio rises over the mesoporous epibon a 58 to the macroporous hk 1200 83 thus the dom induced pore blocking effects increase with decreasing pore size which was also found in other studies hu et al 2016 li et al 2003 as the dom adsorption and the resulting pore blockages prevent omp from entering the ac pores and reaching the adsorption sites behind it can be assumed that these pore blockages also prevent already adsorbed omp from leaving the pores and thus their desorption these results confirm the assumption that pore blockage is the cause for decreasing desorption with decreasing pore size the subsequent desorption in drinking water after sequential adsorption partly leads to differences in desorption isotherms shown in fig 8 compared to desorption after simultaneous adsorption fig 6 the desorption isotherm for the hydraffin cc is again left of the corresponding adsorption isotherm the previous experiments pointed out that dom adsorption simultaneous to omp adsorption fig 5 as well as dom adsorption simultaneous to omp desorption fig 4 lead to an irreversibility of omp adsorption whereas the former effect was prevented by the sequential adsorption in this experiment the latter effect is still likely to occur therefore the irreversible adsorption in this case can be explained by pore blockages due to dom adsorption during the desorption phase as already shown in experiment 2 comparing the omp desorption from the epibon a after simultaneous fig 6 and sequential fig 8 adsorption of omp and dom it can be seen that the latter case leads to less irreversible adsorption this is illustrated by a shift of the desorption isotherm to the right and a higher congruence of adsorption and desorption isotherm after sequential adsorption it can be assumed that due to the previous dom adsorption resulting in pore blockages omp cannot enter blocked pores and adsorb in outer spheres of the ac particles in these parts of the ac they can then desorb or get displaced by subsequently adsorbing dom more easily in comparison to desorbing from ac which was previously simultaneously loaded with dom and omp fig 6 for the hk 1200 no effect of the sequential adsorption on omp desorption in comparison to desorption after simultaneous adsorption fig 6 can be seen for this macroporous ac less pore blockage effects are likely thus it can further be assumed that on the one hand omp can still enter pores to a higher degree also after previous dom adsorption but on the other hand also get displaced and desorb from there to a high degree likewise without steric hindrances thus the subsequent secondary adsorption of dom leads to an enhanced desorption of dom as already seen in experiment 4 4 conclusion omp adsorption onto ac in dom free water is generally reversible especially meso and macroporous ac show completely reversible adsorption adsorption of dom can affect omp desorption in two ways on the one hand it can lead to a decrease of desorption due to ac pore blockages on the other hand it can lead to increased desorption by displacement of omp under real conditions the effect of dom on omp desorption is depending on the pore structure of the used ac micro and mesoporous ac show lower degrees of desorption it can be assumed that adsorbed dom blocks the ac pores so that previously adsorbed omp cannot leave the pores again for macroporous ac pore blockage effects are minor omp can not only desorb again but get further displaced by adsorbing dom which leads to enhanced desorption due to these results it can be recommended that in cases where inflow concentrations are expected to fluctuate and desorption is likely to occur micro or mesoporous ac should be used to avoid undesired desorption acknowledgements this study was part of the research training group urban water interfaces uwi grk

19724,by simulating decreasing inflow concentrations the extent of desorption of organic micropollutants omp from three activated carbons ac was examined in laboratory batch tests the tested ac showed strong differences in pore size distribution and could therefore be characterized as typical micro meso and macroporous ac respectively adsorption and desorption conditions were varied by using drinking water containing dissolved organic matter dom and dom free pure water as background solutions to examine the influence of dom on omp desorption for the different ac under ideal conditions adsorption and desorption in pure water adsorption of the tested omp was found to be highly up to completely reversible for all tested ac under real conditions adsorption and desorption in drinking water additional dom adsorption affects desorption in different ways depending on the ac pore structure for the micro and mesoporous ac an increased irreversibility of omp adsorption was found which shows that dom adsorption prevents omp desorption this could be referred to pore blockage effects that occur during the parallel adsorption of dom and omp for the macroporous ac dom adsorption led to an enhanced omp desorption which could be attributed to displacement processes these results show that smaller pores tend to be blocked by dom which hinders omp from desorption the overall larger pores of the macroporous ac do not get blocked which could allow i omp to desorb and ii dom to enter and displace omp graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated carbon organic micropollutants desorption adsorption drinking water dissolved organic matter 1 introduction despite their trace level concentrations organic micropollutants omp such as pharmaceuticals and household chemicals are suspected to be a potential risk for aquatic ecosystems as well as for human health a promising technique for the removal of omp in water treatment processes is the application of activated carbon ac adsorption in water treatment is generally supposed to be dominated by physical adsorption crittenden et al 2005 worch 2012 due to the comparatively low binding energies involved in physisorption adsorption processes are considered reversible it is therefore assumed that previously adsorbed compounds can desorb and reach the aqueous solution again thus desorption could lead to an undesired increase of omp concentrations in the effluent of ac stages during the regular treatment process essentially the occurrence of desorption requires i a loading of the adsorbent surface with adsorbates and ii a change in solute concentration and or composition in the inflow of the system thus desorption can occur in processes where the ac retention time is much higher than the hydraulic retention time this is especially the case when ac is applied as granular media in filters but desorption might also occur in systems where powdered ac is separated by sand filters and remains there until backwashing typically after several hours altmann et al 2015a or where powdered ac is recirculated within the treatment system meinel et al 2016 the mechanisms which can lead to desorption in water treatment are a a displacement of an adsorbate from an adsorption site by subsequent adsorption of a competitive adsorbate and b a reversion of the reaction pathway due to high omp loadings on the ac surface and low omp concentration in the bulk aqueous phase scenario a can be interpreted as competitive adsorption which is the object of a high number of studies pelekani and snoeyink 1999 quinlivan et al 2005 zietzschmann et al 2014b however competition effects in terms of omp adsorption are mainly examined concerning simultaneous adsorption of target and competitive compounds the effects of a subsequent occurrence or a subsequent increase of concentration of competitive substances on already adsorbed omp are only rarely studied scenario b can occur due to a sudden decrease of the inflow concentration e g after a stoppage of a long lasting contamination if the liquid phase concentration is below the equilibrium concentration that corresponds to the solid phase concentration on the ac a reversion of the sorption pathway and a transition of already adsorbed omp from the adsorbent into the liquid phase might be the result such gradient reversal induced desorption from ac has been rarely examined to date especially with respect to omp several authors studied the reversibility of adsorption of other compounds like phenol dyes tanthapanichakoon et al 2005 pentachlorophenol mollah and robinson 1996 toluene chatzopoulos et al 1993 or btex yakout and daifullah 2014 there are no consistent findings concerning the reversibility of adsorption onto ac in these studies whereas in some cases hysteresis was found other studies see completely reversible adsorption of the respective adsorbent onto ac desorption studies with respect to omp focused on the kinetics of desorption corwin and summers 2011 to et al 2008a b the results by to et al 2008a b indicate that dissolved organic matter dom of real waters can have different effects on the kinetics of atrazine desorption pore blocking compounds could decrease desorption kinetics whereas directly competing compounds could increase kinetics however no clear conclusions concerning the potential extent of omp desorption under equilibrium conditions could be drawn from these results with respect to omp adsorption it is known that dom affects not only the kinetics of adsorption but also the extent capacity of adsorption de ridder et al 2011 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 zietzschmann et al 2016a these competitive effects of dom are referred to two causes i direct competition of omp and dom on adsorption sites zietzschmann et al 2014b and ii pore blockage by dom adsorption and as a result decreased availability of adsorption sites quinlivan et al 2005 both effects have the same consequence a lower extent of omp adsorption under equilibrium conditions however the cause and extent of competition effects was shown to be influenced by the ac pore size distribution quinlivan et al 2005 with respect to desorption it can be assumed that pore blocking dom and directly competing dom do not have the same but opposite effects on the extent of desorption under equilibrium conditions direct competition on adsorption sites would potentially lead to enhanced desorption by displacement whereas pore blockages could lead to steric hindrance and decreased desorption these mechanisms were examined in the current study by elucidating the extent of omp desorption under ideal dom free conditions the extent of omp desorption under real conditions and the effects of dom on desorption the influence of ac pore characteristics on desorption under ideal as well as under real conditions 2 material methods 2 1 activated carbons three commercial granular activated carbons ac were used for experiments hydraffin cc raw material as given by the manufacturer coconut husk donau carbon germany epibon a raw material lignite donau carbon germany and hc hk 1200 raw material renewable material csc germany they were pulverized on a pulverisette mill fritsch germany and sieved retsch germany to obtain powdered ac with particle sizes below 63 μm before usage the ac materials were dried at 105 c overnight and stored in a desiccator until experimental usage 2 2 organic micropollutants five substances which can typically be found in ng l to μg l concentrations in waste water treatment plant effluents margot et al 2013 zietzschmann et al 2014a were used as representative omp for experiments carbamazepine diclofenac 4 formylaminoantipyrine sulfamethoxazole all sigma aldrich germany and iomeprol dr ehrenstorfer germany from initial single stock solutions with a concentration of 20 mg l a mixed stock solution with concentrations of 2 mg l of each omp was prepared from this mixed stock solution certain amounts were taken to spike the particular experimental solutions for the adsorption experiments 2 3 experimental procedure 2 3 1 standard batch experiments batch experiments were conducted with the three ac products in parallel the adsorbents were prepared as stock suspensions in ultra pure water with concentrations of 0 2 and 1 5 g l for adsorption in pure water and 0 8 and 5 g l respectively for adsorption in drinking water prior to the experiments the suspensions were degassed under partial vacuum in an ultrasonic sound bath for 10 min and subsequently homogenized with a magnetic stirrer the experimental procedure is shown in fig 1 it was adapted from multi stage adsorption tests carried out by zietzschmann et al 2015a all experiments consisted of an adsorption and a desorption phase respectively for the adsorption phase centrifuge flasks 175 ml falcon usa were filled with 100 ml of an adsorption solution this solution was previously spiked with omp to a concentration level of 50 μg l each per batch series seven different doses of the respective ac were added from stock suspensions using lab pipettes eppendorf germany added volumes were between 250 and 1000 μl so that dilution due to dosing is negligible after an equilibrium contact time of 48 h on a horizontal shaker certomat r braun biotech germany 220 rpm the ac and the aqueous phase were separated by centrifugation hettich rotanta germany 3000 rpm for 10 min 95 ml of the supernatant were removed using a modified bulb pipette with an electric pipetting aid easy pet eppendorf germany a residue of 5 ml remained in the centrifuge flask to assure that no ac was withdrawn the extracted 95 ml were filtered with 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose membrane filters chromafil xtra macherey nagel germany subsequently 100 ml of an unspiked desorption solution were added to the loaded ac in the centrifuge flask to initialize the desorption phase the suspension was put again on the horizontal shaker for thorough mixing for another 48 h before the ac was removed by membrane filtration as mentioned above 48 h were chosen based on previous tests with the ac epibon a where this time was identified as sufficient also for reaching the desorption equilibrium see figure s 8 and figure s 9 in the supporting information all samples were stored at 4 c prior to analyses the experiments were conducted under different

respectively in different combinations table 2 gives a summary of the conducted experiments and the corresponding applied adsorption and desorption solutions each experimental series of adsorption desorption combination included 7 interrelated batches which only varied in the applied ac doses meaning no replicates of identical batches were conducted for adsorption in pure water ac doses were between 0 5 and 15 mg l for adsorption in drinking water doses ranged from 2 to 50 mg l 2 3 2 sequential batch experiments additional experiments were conducted where the adsorption phase consisted of two separate parts see experiment 5 in table 2 firstly ac was added to100 ml unspiked drinking water after 48 h contact time the batches were spiked with omp by adding 2 5 ml of the omp stock solution to every flask leading again to an omp concentration of 50 μg l each subsequently flasks were shaken for another 48 h afterwards the batches were centrifuged 95 ml of the supernatant were removed and 100 ml unspiked drinking water were added as desorption solution the contact time for the desorption phase was 72 h in this case in parallel a reference experiment after standard procedure with spiked drinking water as adsorption solution was conducted with 96 h contact time for adsorption and 72 h contact time for desorption all other parameters were the same as in the standard batch experiments 2 4 analytics the concentrations of the examined omp were determined using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms based on a method established previously altmann et al 2015b zietzschmann et al 2016a 2015b 2016b for the chromatographic separation an xselect hss t3 column 2 1 50 mm waters usa with 2 5 μm particle size was used the mobile phases were ultra pure water with 0 1 vol formic acid hplc grade sigma aldrich germany and pure methanol hplc grade j t baker usa eluents were pumped at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min running a linear gradient from 97 aqueous mobile phase to 100 methanol a split valve was used to reduce the load to the electrospray ionization positive mode which was followed by ion fragmentation and analysis with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer tsq vantage thermo scientific usa for each omp two mass fragments were chosen according to the daios database provided by the zweckverband landesversorgung

of the treated sample and m is the respective ac dose the loading after desorption qdes is calculated using eq 2 2 q d e s q a d s 1 05 c d e s 0 05 c a d s c 0 d e s m where c0 des is the initial concentration of the desorption solution and cdes is the concentration of the sample after desorption phase the factors consider the respective volumes of the different solution elements 5 ml adsorption solution remain in the flask after centrifugation which corresponds to 5 of the initial adsorption solution volume of 100 ml this leads to a total volume of 105 ml which corresponds to 105 of the initial adsorption solution volume in the desorption phase after adding 100 ml desorption solution a detailed derivation of these equations is given in the supporting information the freundlich coefficient kf and the freundlich exponent n were calculated after converting the freundlich equation into its linearized form eq 3 3 log q n log c log k f 2 7 data evaluation the experiments were evaluated by the use of adsorption and desorption isotherms the position of the desorption isotherm in comparison to the corresponding adsorption isotherm can give information about the extent of desorption by distinction between i non or partially reversible adsorption desorption isotherm left of above the adsorption isotherm ii completely reversible adsorption congruence of ad and desorption isotherm or iii enhanced desorption by additional displacement of adsorbates desorption isotherm right of below adsorption isotherm note that the entire adsorption desorption isotherm curves were evaluated not single data points in order to use all available interrelated batches to increase the robustness of the results as no replicates were conducted as can be seen in the previous section the calculation of qdes includes four different measured concentration values the error in qads and qdes calculation increase with decreasing differences of c0 ads cads and cdes thus the error in isotherm data rises to the right part of the isotherm with higher loadings and higher residual concentrations an exemplary error analysis can be found in the supporting information to reduce errors only those data pairs were considered for the depiction in isotherms where cads c0 ads of the respective omp was below 75 3 results discussion 3 1 activated carbon pore characteristics and dom adsorption the summarized results of the surface area and pore size distribution analyses of the tested activated carbons ac are shown in table 3 detailed pore size distributions of the three ac are shown in figure s 2 in the supporting information all ac have bet specific surface areas ssa 1000 m2 g and thus meet typical values for highly activated carbons concerning pore size distribution the tested ac cover a wide range for the hydraffin cc 95 of the total surface area is located in the micropores of this ac and associated therewith the average pore size of 16 8 å is comparatively low thus the hydraffin cc reflects a typical microporous ac the hk 1200 shows the lowest percentage of micropore surface area with 64 and has a comparatively high average pore size of around 33 å it therefore reflects a macroporous ac the epibon a has medium values for the percentage of micropore area and the average pore size it can therefore be characterized as a mesoporous ac the differences in pore structure affect the adsorption of dom this is exemplarily shown in fig 2 which contains the lc ocd chromatograms of drinking water before and after treatment with the three ac all chromatograms after treatment are below the raw water chromatogram showing dom adsorption onto all tested ac by subtracting the corresponding oc data points before after adsorption for every point of the chromatogram differences in dom adsorption characteristics can be visualized these differential chromatograms are also shown in fig 2 they reflect the removal of different dom fractions huber et al 2011 epibon a shows the highest removal for all dom fractions the strongest abatement can be seen for humic substances retention time 42 min which also goes along with the highest suva removal of all tested ac see figure s 3 in the supporting information but also smaller compounds like building blocks retention time 46 min and low molecular weight acids and neutrals retention time 49 min are removed this indicates a certain variability in the available adsorption sites and a good accessibility of these sites the differential chromatogram of the hk1200 shows generally lower dom attenuation but also removal of all dom fractions with a maximum for humic substances with respect to their pore size distribution both meso and macroporous ac allow relatively good dom removal due to sufficiently high pore widths in contrast the microporous hydraffin cc mainly removes low molecular weight organic compounds with a retention time 50 min and has the lowest doc removal of all tested ac despite representing the quantitatively largest fraction in raw water dom humic compounds only adsorb poorly onto the hydraffin cc this indicates that dom compounds of higher molecular weight cannot enter the micropores of this ac but only can adsorb in the comparatively small amount of meso and macropores 3 2 desorption under ideal conditions in experiment 1 adsorption as well as desorption took place in pure water as background matrix thereby desorption as a result of concentration gradient reversal under ideal conditions should be examined fig 3 shows the resulting ad and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine for all tested ac here and in the following sections results will be presented by means of carbamazepine as representative omp for reasons of clarity the analogous results of the other tested compounds can be found in the supporting information they generally confirm the findings presented in this and the following sections therefore the discussion of the presented results also includes the evaluation of isotherms of the other tested omp comparing the carbamazepine loading of all ac after adsorption the hk 1200 despite highest bet ssa shows significantly lower carbamazepine adsorption compared to hydraffin cc and epibon a this trend can generally be seen for all omp see figure s 12 in the supporting information this is in agreement with the results of zietzschmann et al 2014a which show that a higher bet ssa does not correlate with higher omp removal comparing the corresponding adsorption and desorption isotherms it can be seen that for the mesoporous epibon a and the macroporous hk 1200 both isotherms show generally high congruence this congruence indicates a completely reversible adsorption of omp onto these ac for the microporous hydraffin cc the desorption isotherm superimposes the adsorption isotherm for loadings below 30 μg mg for the data point with the highest loading of 35 μg mg a shift to the left after desorption can be seen this could indicate that adsorption of carbamazepine onto this microporous ac is partly irreversible for higher loadings however this observation is only based on one data point and thus not conclusive furthermore it cannot clearly be stated that in contrast to the two other ac after 48 h of desorption carbamazepine has completely reached equilibrium state for the hydraffin cc see figure s 8 in the supporting information thus no clear statements regarding the reversibility can be made nevertheless partly irreversible adsorption of compounds onto microporous ac was seen by tanthapanichakoon et al 2005 for the ad desorption of reactive dyes whereas mesoporous ac also showed completely reversible adsorption in this case abromaitis et al 2016 also showed hysteresis for the ad desorption of metoprolol using a microporous ac in organic free water 3 3 desorption in the presence of organic matter the desorption again after adsorption of omp in pure water in experiment 2 was conducted with unspiked drinking water which was free of omp concentrations below the limit of quantification see table s 2 thus the occurring concentration gradient between the loaded ac surface and the desorption solution for the initial desorption phase is expected to be the same as in experiment 1 thereby the potential effect of parallel adsorption of dom on omp desorption should be examined fig 4 shows the corresponding adsorption and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine from this experiment the adsorption isotherms in fig 4 are partly different from adsorption isotherms from experiment 1 fig 3 although the experimental conditions were similar in both cases adsorption in pure water the experiments were conducted on different days meaning that different ac stock suspensions were prepared and used it is known that activated carbon is a largely inhomogeneous material which leads to different adsorption behavior of different ac fractions that can be found even within one batch of activated carbon frank et al 2015 ruhl et al 2015 we assume that these inhomogeneities led to the differences in the isotherms however with respect to the discussion made in the following the adsorption desorption data points originate from the same experimental batch and thus the corresponding adsorption and desorption isotherms are directly comparable the desorption isotherms for the epibon a and the hk 1200 are below the corresponding adsorption isotherms this shift indicates that desorption of omp in this case is not only induced by the concentration gradient reversal but enhanced by the dom adsorption pelekani and snoeyink 1999 showed that omp which adsorbed onto ac with bigger pore sizes can be displaced by organic matter it is therefore likely that the enhanced desorption in the case of these ac is caused by omp displacement from the adsorption sites by organic matter for the hydraffin cc the desorption isotherm is left above of the adsorption isotherm this shift is slightly higher than after desorption in pure water fig 3 it indicates that dom adsorption in this case prevents omp desorption for microporous ac it is known that omp adsorb in pore regions that cannot be reached by dom pelekani and snoeyink 1999 furthermore it is expected that adsorbing dom blocks the pores of microporous ac to a greater extent hu et al 2016 this can explain the enhanced irreversibility of omp adsorption as the adsorbed omp molecules are prevented from desorption by steric hindrance as a result of pore blockage further kinetic experiments can underline these assumptions see figure s 11 in the supporting information for epibon a and hk 1200 the adsorption of dom and the desorption of omp are similarly fast in contrast the adsorption of dom onto the hydraffin cc is clearly faster than the corresponding desorption of omp this indicates that the adsorbing dom is able to block pores before omp would desorb and thereby prevent their desorption 3 4 desorption after parallel adsorption of micropollutants and organic matter in experiment 3 the adsorption solution was drinking water spiked with omp whereas the desorption solution was pure water during this experiment omp and dom adsorbed in parallel whereas the desorption could occur without any further adsorption of compounds in this case a concentration gradient reversal does not only occur for the omp but also for the dom in contrast to the desorption of omp lc ocd chromatograms show strongest dom desorption for the highest ac doses and thus lowest doc loadings for all tested ac see figure s 7 in the supporting information with decreasing dose and increasing loading also the concentration of desorbed doc decreases thus a steeper concentration gradient between ac and water does not lead to a stronger desorption in case of the dom as the dom is a complex mixture with differences in adsorbability it can be assumed that increasing ac doses also lead to an enhanced adsorption of less adsorbable dom compounds sontheimer et al 1988 it seems likely that these compounds have a higher tendency of desorption vice versa low ac doses lead to high loadings of well adsorbable dom with a lower tendency of desorption thus nearly no doc desorption can be seen for low ac doses a generally low desorption tendency of dom during desorption in pure water was also seen by newcombe 1994 fig 5 shows the ad and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine from this experiment for the microporous hydraffin cc high loadings are retained during desorption as the desorption isotherm is located left of the adsorption isotherm a similar tendency can be found for the mesoporous epibon a in these two cases partly irreversible adsorption of omp occurred which can be attributed to the parallel adsorption of dom due to the pore structures of these ac it can be assumed that the irreversible adsorption of dom can lead to pore blockages which remain also during the desorption phase such an irreversible pore blockage can then lead to a steric hindrance of desorption of omp which are adsorbed in the pore area behind adsorbed dom molecules leading to generally less omp desorption such an effect cannot be seen for the macroporous hk 1200 in contrast to the other tested ac adsorption and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine are congruent in this case which indicates completely reversible adsorption as already seen in fig 3 after adsorption in pure water thus the parallel adsorption of dom does not affect the desorption of omp in this case it can be assumed that due to the generally larger pore width of the hk 1200 dom adsorption does not lead to pore blockages thus omp desorption is not hindered by steric effects but can still occur without hindrance like under ideal conditions in experiment 1 kinetic experiments can support this assumption see figure s 10 in the supporting information for the hk 1200 adsorption of doc and carbamazepine are equally fast with rising microporosity the adsorption of omp is faster than that of the dom thus it is possible that carbamazepine adsorbs in deeper parts of the ac pores which then get blocked by subsequently adsorbing dom 3 5 desorption under real conditions by using drinking water as background matrix for adsorption and desorption a concentration decrease in a dom containing water and thus under realistic conditions should be simulated in experiment 4 in this case a parallel adsorption of omp and dom occurs during the adsorption phase as the adsorption solution is replaced by fresh drinking water the dom concentration at the start of the desorption phase is above the equilibrium dom concentration at the end of the adsorption phase this leads to an additional subsequent adsorption of dom during the desorption phase see figure s 5 in the supporting information fig 6 shows the ad and desorption isotherms of carbamazepine for this experiment for the microporous hydraffin cc the desorption isotherm is strongly shifted to the left in comparison to its corresponding adsorption isotherm and close to the y axis also for high ac loadings this indicates a strong irreversibility of omp adsorption onto microporous ac under real conditions it was shown that both the adsorption of dom parallel to the omp adsorption fig 5 as well as the subsequent dom adsorption during the desorption phase fig 4 leads to an enhanced irreversibility of omp adsorption both effects are also assumed to occur in this case and lead to a prevention of omp desorption for the epibon a the desorption isotherm of carbamazepine is congruent with the adsorption isotherm for lower ac loadings but shifts to the left with increasing loadings in the further course of the isotherm this indicates partly irreversible adsorption for higher ac loadings in the previous experiments it was shown that the parallel adsorption of omp and dom leads to irreversible adsorption whereas subsequent adsorption of dom can enhance desorption by displacement in this experiment both effects appear in comparison to fig 5 the desorption isotherm is shifted slightly in direction of the adsorption isotherm for lower loadings this indicates slightly enhanced omp desorption by dom displacement for higher loadings the desorption isotherm differs from the adsorption isotherm and shifts to the left it can be assumed that in this case subsequently adsorbing dom could not reach adsorption sites of omp as the pores of the highly loaded ac are blocked by dom previously adsorbed during the adsorption phase this effect also hinders adsorbed omp from desorption as shown in fig 5 as a result no enhanced but decreased desorption occurs for the highly loaded mesoporous ac in contrast for the macroporous hk 1200 the desorption isotherm is below the corresponding adsorption isotherm throughout its complete course which indicates enhanced desorption also for higher loadings it can be assumed that the larger pores of hk 1200 avoid pore blockage by dom as seen in fig 5 thus no hindrance of omp desorption resulting from the concentration gradient reversal occurs furthermore the absent pore blockages allows dom to enter the ac pores during desorption phase and additionally displace omp as seen in fig 4 which leads to enhanced omp desorption in this case 3 6 sequential adsorption of dom and omp with subsequent desorption for testing the assumed hypothesis of pore blockage effects sequential adsorption experiments were conducted where a dom adsorption phase preceded the omp adsorption phase fig 7 shows a comparison of adsorption isotherms for carbamazepine after simultaneous and sequential adsorption as these isotherms originate from parallel experiments potential ac inhomogeneities as they were discussed in the context of experiment 1 and 2 should not influence the isotherms in this case thus they are directly comparable for all tested ac the carbamazepine adsorption isotherm after simultaneous adsorption is above the one after sequential adsorption this shows pore blockage effects in all cases subsequently added omp partly cannot enter the ac pores after dom adsorption which leads to decreased adsorption however the differences between the corresponding isotherms differ for the different ac for a quantitative evaluation of these differences the resulting kf values between simultaneous and sequential adsorption were compared therefore for each isotherm kf and n were calculated by a best fit method after linearization subsequently n values of the corresponding adsorption isotherms were averaged and kf were calculated again with the averaged n the strongest decrease of kf due to subsequent adsorption was found for the microporous hydraffin cc kf seq kf sim 46 indicating strongest pore blocking effects with rising average pore size the kf seq kf sim ratio rises over the mesoporous epibon a 58 to the macroporous hk 1200 83 thus the dom induced pore blocking effects increase with decreasing pore size which was also found in other studies hu et al 2016 li et al 2003 as the dom adsorption and the resulting pore blockages prevent omp from entering the ac pores and reaching the adsorption sites behind it can be assumed that these pore blockages also prevent already adsorbed omp from leaving the pores and thus their desorption these results confirm the assumption that pore blockage is the cause for decreasing desorption with decreasing pore size the subsequent desorption in drinking water after sequential adsorption partly leads to differences in desorption isotherms shown in fig 8 compared to desorption after simultaneous adsorption fig 6 the desorption isotherm for the hydraffin cc is again left of the corresponding adsorption isotherm the previous experiments pointed out that dom adsorption simultaneous to omp adsorption fig 5 as well as dom adsorption simultaneous to omp desorption fig 4 lead to an irreversibility of omp adsorption whereas the former effect was prevented by the sequential adsorption in this experiment the latter effect is still likely to occur therefore the irreversible adsorption in this case can be explained by pore blockages due to dom adsorption during the desorption phase as already shown in experiment 2 comparing the omp desorption from the epibon a after simultaneous fig 6 and sequential fig 8 adsorption of omp and dom it can be seen that the latter case leads to less irreversible adsorption this is illustrated by a shift of the desorption isotherm to the right and a higher congruence of adsorption and desorption isotherm after sequential adsorption it can be assumed that due to the previous dom adsorption resulting in pore blockages omp cannot enter blocked pores and adsorb in outer spheres of the ac particles in these parts of the ac they can then desorb or get displaced by subsequently adsorbing dom more easily in comparison to desorbing from ac which was previously simultaneously loaded with dom and omp fig 6 for the hk 1200 no effect of the sequential adsorption on omp desorption in comparison to desorption after simultaneous adsorption fig 6 can be seen for this macroporous ac less pore blockage effects are likely thus it can further be assumed that on the one hand omp can still enter pores to a higher degree also after previous dom adsorption but on the other hand also get displaced and desorb from there to a high degree likewise without steric hindrances thus the subsequent secondary adsorption of dom leads to an enhanced desorption of dom as already seen in experiment 4 4 conclusion omp adsorption onto ac in dom free water is generally reversible especially meso and macroporous ac show completely reversible adsorption adsorption of dom can affect omp desorption in two ways on the one hand it can lead to a decrease of desorption due to ac pore blockages on the other hand it can lead to increased desorption by displacement of omp under real conditions the effect of dom on omp desorption is depending on the pore structure of the used ac micro and mesoporous ac show lower degrees of desorption it can be assumed that adsorbed dom blocks the ac pores so that previously adsorbed omp cannot leave the pores again for macroporous ac pore blockage effects are minor omp can not only desorb again but get further displaced by adsorbing dom which leads to enhanced desorption due to these results it can be recommended that in cases where inflow concentrations are expected to fluctuate and desorption is likely to occur micro or mesoporous ac should be used to avoid undesired desorption acknowledgements this study was part of the research training group urban water interfaces uwi grk
