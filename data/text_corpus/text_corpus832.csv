4160,quantifying the contributions of runoff components crcs to streamflow is of significant importance for understanding the dynamics of water resources under changing climate in glacierized basins this article presents a meta analysis on different approaches for quantifying runoff components in glacierized basins including the tracer based end member mixing method and the hydrological modeling approach we collected estimated crcs from 312 glacierized basin cases as well as values of five characteristics in these basins including mean basin elevation mbe mean annual air temperature mat mean annual precipitation map winter precipitation fraction wpf and glacierized area ratio gar relations between crcs and the basin characteristics were assessed using a random forest rf algorithm the review showed that crcs were most often quantified by the hydrological modeling approach 73 of the basin cases compared to hydrological modeling the tracer based approach applied in 19 of the basin cases was more likely to be used in smaller basins 50 km2 rather at the seasonal than annual time scale and within shorter study periods of 5 years meta analysis results indicate that 1 at the annual time scale the most important influencing basin characteristics were gar and mbe for the ice melt contribution wpf and map for the snow melt contribution and gar and wpf for the rainfall contribution rf algorithm based on the five basin characteristics was able to explain 56 40 and 40 of the variability of the reported annual contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall respectively the variability of seasonal crcs and annual contribution of groundwater could be less well explained by the five basin characteristics 2 comparing different definitions of runoff components based on water input or flow pathway indicated that the ice melt contribution to total water input sum of rainfall and melt water based on the water input definition was close to the contribution of ice melt induced surface flow to total runoff based on the flow pathway definition in contrast based on the reviewed studies rainfall and snowmelt contributions based on the water input definition were around 9 14 higher than the contributions of rainfall and snowmelt induced surface flow to total runoff 3 the tracer based end member mixing method tended to estimate larger uncertainties of crcs than hydrological modeling but uncertainties of modeled crcs were likely underestimated as often only one or two of the three uncertainty sources of model parameter model input and model structure were considered in the modeling studies we propose that more efforts are required to cross validate crcs estimated by the tracer based and hydrological modeling methods and to reduce uncertainties of crcs by integrations of hydro meteorological data and water tracer data 1 introduction glacierized basins in mountainous areas are typically the head watersheds of downstream rivers providing important freshwater sources for downstream ecological habitats agriculture irrigation and potable water supply immerzeel et al 2013 dynamics of water resources in these basins are strongly controlled by changes of the multiple water sources for runoff generation including rainfall snowmelt and ice melt lutz et al 2014 strong seasonality of air temperature and precipitation play key roles in regulating the dominances of specific water sources on seasonal streamflow koboltschnig et al 2007 nepal et al 2014 meanwhile warming climate accelerates the retreating of ice thickness and glacier area in these basins mark et al 2010 huss 2011 burger et al 2019 resulting in larger proportion of meltwater feeding the river in the near term and smaller in the long term runoff in the glacierized basins is thus highly vulnerable to the current climate changes loukas et al 2002 huss et al 2013 duethmann et al 2016 mackay et al 2019 quantifying the contributions of different runoff components to streamflow is critical to understanding the dynamics of availability of water resources in these basins jost et al 2012 prasch et al 2013 mimeau et al 2019a lots of efforts have been put into quantifying the crcs to streamflow in glacierized basins especially in recent years e g finger et al 2015 mimeau et al 2019b crespo et al 2020a b fatima et al 2020 it was demonstrated that crcs show strong variations in basins where landscape conditions and climate systems are variable characteristics such as snowfall rainfall ratio annual precipitation and air temperature as well as the glacier area ratio gar to the total basin area have significant effects on crcs for example snowmelt contribution is large in mountains where they receive a large amount of solid precipitation and a tendency to shifting toward the rainfall dominated precipitation caused by temperature warming reduces the snowmelt contribution lutz et al 2016 jin et al 2019 glacier melt contribution increases in highly glaciated subbasins prasch et al 2013 and a nearly logarithmic relation between glacier melt contribution and gar in the austria glacierized basins was found by koboltschnig and schöner 2011 they attributed the smaller increase of glacier melt contribution with higher gar to the increased contribution of precipitation although the influences of land and climate characteristics on crcs were widely discussed their relative importance on the contributions of specific runoff components has not been comprehensively investigated relationship between basin characteristics and the contributions of multiple runoff components have rarely been examined in a quantitative way exceptions are koboltschnig and schöner 2011 and zhang et al 2016b who used gar to quantify the possible influence of glacier melt on river runoff in their study areas one of the reasons for the lack of comprehensive comparisons of crcs across different glacierized basins is the use of different concepts for the runoff components by existing studies the same terminology in varied studies may refer to different runoff components for instance in some cases glacier runoff represents the total runoff including meltwater and rainfall runoff from glacier area radić and hock 2014 yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2020 ayala et al 2020 while representing all meltwater from the glacier area nolin et al 2010 pelto 2011 koppes et al 2015 jiskoot and mueller 2012 hirose and marshall 2013 kogutenko et al 2019 or only ice melt zhang et al 2013 racoviteanu et al 2013 clark et al 2015 chen et al 2017a burger et al 2019 in other cases in general three different concepts were used to separate the runoff components weiler et al 2018 mimeau et al 2019a in definition 1 abbreviated as water input definition runoff components are quantified based on the sources of water inputs including ice melt snowmelt and rainfall costa et al 2018 crcs refer to shares of water sources in the total water input ignoring the subsequent moving and mixing processes of water sources in definition 2 abbreviated as flow pathway definition runoff components are estimated by runoff generation processes and flow pathways of groundwater subsurface flow and surface flow the total runoff is divided into surface and subsurface flow baseflow firstly e g loukas et al 2002 lutz et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b wang et al 2018 and surface flow is further divided into three direct runoff components induced by ice melt snowmelt and rainfall aizen et al 1995a naeem et al 2013 he et al 2019 fatima et al 2020 in definition 3 abbreviated as source area definition runoff components are identified by the source areas of runoff the most prevailing runoff components quantified by definition 3 are runoff from glacier and non glacier areas e g hirose and marshall 2013 zhou et al 2013 biskop et al 2016 gabet et al 2008 thayyen and gergan 2010 thayyen et al 2005 runoff from glacier area often includes runoff components induced by multiple sources of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall in the glacier covered area e g loukas et al 2002 nepal et al 2014 this definition is typically used along with the water input and flow pathway definitions in cases that runoff from specific areas are of interest such as zhang et al 2016a mimeau et al 2019a in contrast to the water input definition contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall in the flow pathway definition were calculated under the additional consideration of groundwater or baseflow such as naeem et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 gupta et al 2019 it is interesting to know how the contributions of ice melt surface runoff snowmelt surface runoff and rainfall surface runoff calculated by the flow pathway definition differ from the corresponding water source contributions i e ice meltwater snow meltwater and rainfall estimated by the water input definition another issue that hampers the comparisons of crcs in glacierized basins is the use of different methods for quantifying crcs methods that were applied to quantify crcs in glacierized basins mainly fall into three categories different from frenierre and mark 2014 who reviewed five methods to quantify the glacier melt contribution solely the first widely used method is the end member mixing method based on the usage of various water tracers such as water stable isotopes electrical conductivity and hydrochemistry tracers liu et al 2008 maurya et al 2011 blaen et al 2014 vaughn and fountain 2005 zhou et al 2015 guido et al 2016 wang et al 2016a yang et al 2016 chang et al 2018 crespo et al 2020a b conservative and constant assumptions of the water tracer signatures were commonly adopted to conduct this method klaus and mcdonnell 2013 kong and pang 2012 groundwater contribution was typically taken into account in cases where water samples from springs or wells were available penna et al 2014 baraer et al 2015 engel et al 2016 sun et al 2016a b saberi et al 2019 large uncertainties of crcs quantified by the tracer based method were found due to the strong spatio temporal variability of tracer signatures of water sources penna et al 2017 pu et al 2013 rai et al 2019 a gaussian error propagation method was often used along with the end member mixing method to quantify the uncertainties of crcs e g wu et al 2016 assuming uncertainties caused by the variability of tracer signatures of water sources are independent of each other genereux 1998 a bayesian end member mixing approach was also applied for the quantification of crcs in glacierized basins cable et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2016 he et al 2020 in which the uncertainties of crcs originated from the prior assumptions and the spatio temporal variability of tracer signatures were quantified by the posterior distributions of parameters the second widely used method is the hydrological modeling approach a considerable number of glacio hydrological models that integrate the generation of snow ice meltwater runoff and the dynamics of snowpack and glacier thickness area into the rainfall runoff generation process have been developed to quantify crcs e g immerzeel et al 2013 naz et al 2014 luo et al 2018 ragettli et al 2015 farinotti et al 2012 in contrast to the tracer based method hydrological models physically represent the dynamics of water storages in snowpack and glacier body and corresponding runoff generation processes loukas et al 2002 nolin et al 2010 lafaysse et al 2011 prasch et al 2011 frans et al 2015 lutz et al 2016 burger et al 2019 shrestha and nepal 2019 however the large number of parameters of glacio hydrological models generally introduced substantial uncertainties into the quantifications of runoff components zhang et al 2013 he et al 2018 armstrong et al 2019 multiple observations including glacier mass balance area snow surveys and even groundwater storage estimated by grace data in addition to discharge were commonly used to constrain the behavioral parameter values of the glacio hydrological models jost et al 2012 duethmann et al 2015 finger et al 2015 chen et al 2017a he et al 2018 valentin et al 2018a b shakoor and ejaz 2019 meteorological inputs and selection of the hydrological models could also be sources of uncertainties of modeled crcs nepal et al 2017 which were assessed by comparative studies using varied input datasets or model structures such as pohl et al 2015 siderius et al 2013 the third option to quantify crcs in glacierized basins is a data based method similarly to the direct discharge measurement and hydrological balance equation methods reviewed in frenierre and mark 2014 in which the contributions of different runoff components are estimated based on observations of water balance components or hydro meteorological data time series aizen et al 1996 mark and seltzer 2003 thayyen et al 2005 gabet et al 2008 kumar et al 2007 for instance measurements or estimates of water balance components of snow water equivalent precipitation and evaporation were used to calculate the shares of net water inputs in the basin water cycle błaszczyk et al 2019 jeelani et al 2012 singh et al 1997 singh and jain 2009 graphical methods and empirical methods based on observations of discharge time series were used to estimate the contribution of baseflow mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 mukhopadhyay and khan 2015 ahluwalia et al 2015 and measurements of glacier mass balance and discharge from glacier covered sub catchment were adopted to quantify the glacier melt contribution leiva et al 2007 while it is easy to implement the data based method is less suitable for quantifying crcs for short time scales e g on an event base or at a monthly time scale when runoff components constituting an extreme flow event are of interest because of the underlying assumption of hydrological balance on seasonal to decadal scales frenierre and mark 2014 furthermore it relies heavily on the availability of long term field observations which however are commonly unavailable in remotely located and poorly gauged glacierized basins frans et al 2018 wu et al 2015 crcs were often estimated by only one of the above three methods in existing studies inter comparisons of the tracer based and hydrological modeling methods in he et al 2019 indicated that crcs and the corresponding uncertainties estimated by the two methods were considerably different motivated by the above backgrounds this review article collected crcs in glacierized basins from published studies as well as basin characteristics that are assumed to have a strong influence on the crcs including mean basin elevation mbe mean annual air temperature mat mean annual precipitation map winter precipitation fraction in the total annual precipitation wpf and glacier area ratio gar the collected five basin characteristics and corresponding crcs were used to develop a random forest rf algorithm meta analysis of the collected data has been conducted to answer the three following questions 1 what are the relative influences of the reviewed basin characteristics on the contributions of the different runoff components across a wide range of studies 2 how do the estimates of contributions of rainfall and meltwater rely on the definitions of water input and flow pathway and which runoff components are affected most by the definitions 3 how do the uncertainties of quantified crcs differ depending on the applied methods and definitions of runoff components 2 data and methodology 2 1 extent of the review and collection of meta data reviewed articles were all collected from the database of web of science the key words of glacier runoff streamflow contribution share account for proportion and basin catchment watershed have been used for the literature search from 1990 to 2020 only peer reviewed published articles were included book chapters theses and project reports were not involved only studies that reported at least one of the contributions of ice melt snowmelt rainfall and groundwater to streamflow at the basin outlet were included in the meta analysis that means studies that only reported the contribution of runoff from glacier area or snow ice clean area and the contribution of glacier melt sum of ice melt and snowmelt or meltwater ice melt and snowmelt were not separated or precipitation rainfall and snowmelt were not separated were not included in the meta analysis in total 143 articles reporting crcs in 312 glacierized basin cases across the world have been reviewed see the supplement excel file here we counted the same basin that were studied by different researchers as different basin cases considering the variations of applied methods and study periods methods that were applied to quantify runoff components in the reviewed articles all fall into the three categories introduced in section 1 the following meta data were extracted from the reviewed studies characteristics of the study basins including longitude latitude basin area mbe mat map wpf fraction of precipitation occurring in november february or austral may august to approximately represent the snow fraction in the annual precipitation and gar hydrochemistry isotope tracer signatures temporal scales at which the runoff components were quantified as well as the reported crcs and the corresponding definitions of runoff components projections of crcs in future periods were not considered in the meta analysis due to large uncertainty in the projections of future climate for studies where mat map and wpf were not reported values of those characteristics were estimated from global gridded products based on the approximate centroid of the catchment using gpcc global precipitation climatology centre http gpcc dwd de for map and wpf and cru ts 4 0 climatic research unit gridded time series https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg for mat the global multi resolution terrain elevation data gmted2010 was used to estimate elevation at the approximate centroid of the catchment in studies where mbe was not reported the proxy gridded products at the centroid of catchments were used because geographic ranges and boundaries of catchments were not available from the reviewed articles especially for small basins the gpcc data was used as it provided global gridded gauge analysis estimates based on one of the largest databases of quality controlled station data covering the time period from 1950s to 2020 when crcs were quantified in the reviewed articles the gpcc products have been demonstrated as acceptable in mountainous areas by zandler et al 2019 and wortmann et al 2018 though it has to be acknowledged that precipitation estimates for mountainous areas based on globally available data are generally uncertain in cases where mat was not reported we used estimates based on cru as it is one of the most widely used climate products and covers the period 1950s to 2020 when crcs were quantified in the reviewed articles the gmted2010 data was used because it provides global elevation estimate at a high resolution 30 7 5 arc second and incorporates several good quality global elevation products we adopted some strategies to clean up the collected data before using for themeta analysis climate variables of annual precipitation and air temperature that are significantly lower or higher deviating by 50 than those reported by similar studies in the same basin during a close time period were replaced with the mean values reported in similar studies in basin cases that reported contributions of runoff components in multiple time periods we excluded results in periods with only few hydrological data in basin cases where the proxy data of global gridded products provide abnormal deviating by 50 values in comparison to the basin characteristics that were reported in similar basins i e in the same region we conducted a correction for the proxy data based on the bias between the gridded estimates and reported values in similar basins to reduce noise in the crcs only contributions of four runoff components i e ice melt snowmelt rainfall and groundwater were included in the meta analysis contributions of other runoff components like melt runoff ice melt snowmelt precipitation runoff snowmelt rainfall and glacier runoff meltwater rain on glacier were excluded from the analysis 2 2 analysis of the influences of basin characteristics on crcs the influences of basin characteristics on crcs were analyzed in two steps first correlations between basin characteristics and contributions of each of the runoff components were quantified by the pearson correlation coefficient corrf basin characteristics of mbe mat map wpf and gar were involved in the correlation analysis characteristics that show corrf values higher than 0 25 passing the significance test at level of p 0 05 were assumed to have considerable influences on crcs second regression analysis through a rf algorithm was applied we used rf as a tool for the regression analysis because of its features of being able to approximate complex non linear influences being able to capture complex interactions between variables outputting the importance of input variables small requirements of parameter tuning and low chance of overfitting adhikari et al 2020 ehsani et al 2020 the rf algorithm is a combination of numerous de correlated decision trees each decision tree is trained by randomly sampled training data with nodes split by randomly selected subsets of the input features adhikari et al 2020 at each node splitting step the decision tree identifies the optimal feature and its threshold based on a selected criterion to divide the input data into two classes the node splitting process is repeated until all remaining cases can be treated as the same class or the maximum tree depth is reached ehsani et al 2021 for the regression analysis in this paper the crcs outputs from the rf algorithm are average predictions of all the decision trees crcs and corresponding basin characteristics were first split into a training set 70 and a test set 30 then a total of 100 split sampling were repeated to run the rf training considering the uncertainty of the random sampling procedure we utilized the r package of randomforest to train and test the rf model in each of the 100 sampling runs the parameters mtry nodesize and samplefraction in the randomforest function were optimized by a grid search procedure using the ranger package based on the minimized out of bag mean squared error oob mse the number of trees ntree was set to 500 based on the prior examined learning rate curve of the rf model see fig s4 in supplement word file which indicated that 500 trees were plenty to produce a stable oob mse performance of the rf model was assessed by comparing against the test dataset using goodness of fit metrics including corrf coefficient of determination cd i e squared corrf normalized root mean squared error nrmse i e rmse mean of test value and bias sum of simulation sum of test measurements minus 1 metrics values were averaged over the 500 trees in each of the split sampling running normalized importance of basin characteristics estimated by the importance function in the randomforest package based on the reduction of gini impurity when the basin characteristics were used to split a node in the tree were used to quantify the relative influences of basin characteristics on the contributions of different runoff components the rf model was trained by the following formula eq 1 1 f i α 1 i α 2 i α n i where f i refers to the contribution of a specific runoff component i one of ice melt snowmelt rainfall and groundwater and αn i for the five basin characteristics the above two steps were conducted for annual and seasonal contributions separately data on hourly to monthly time scales were not involved in the rf training for study periods that are longer than one year we used the mean annual seasonal results each of the study periods in the reviewed articles were characterized by a map a mat a mean wpf a mean gar and corresponding mean crcs we used the mean values in the study periods to reduce the noise caused by the inconsistency of time durations in variable studies seasonal contribution of snowmelt was used as its mean contribution to runoff in the snow melting months of april june austral september november seasonal ice melt contribution referred to its mean contribution to runoff in the glacier melting months of july october austral december march seasonal contributions of rainfall and groundwater referred to their mean contributions in both snow and glacier melting months from april october austral september march we included estimates of crcs from all of the three categories of applied methods see section 1 in the analysis to increase the number of basin samples for the training of rf model 2 3 evaluation of the effects of definitions of runoff components on the quantifications of crcs in this review contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall to total water input quantified by the water input definition were compared with the contributions of direct surface flow induced by ice melt snowmelt and rainfall to total runoff quantified by the flow pathway definition studies that reported the groundwater or baseflow contribution in addition to contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall using either the hydrological modeling or tracer based mixing methods were assumed as flow pathway definition based however we only compared the modeled crcs in this section because the tracer based method was rarely used to quantify crcs without the consideration of groundwater the comparison was implemented by the rf algorithm in the following three steps first the entire modeling dataset was divided into two groups by the two definitions second rf model was trained by estimates from the basin group where the water input definition was applied the trained rf model was then applied to estimate crcs using basin characteristics in the other basin group where crcs were reported by the flow pathway definition the rf estimated crcs were assumed to represent the crcs quantified by water input definition in the other basin group mean mass bias biasm with the unit of eq 2 between the estimated and reported crcs were used to quantify the average difference of crcs quantified by the two definitions third rf model was trained by estimates from the basin group in which crcs were quantified by the flow pathway definition and then applied to estimate crcs in the other basin group where the crcs were reported by the water input definition and a similar biasm metric was calculated swapping the training dataset in the third step was used to reduce uncertainty of rf training caused by a single training dataset from water input definition or flow pathway definition fig s3 in the supplement word file indicates similar basin characteristics of basin groups where the two definitions were used it is therefore reasonable to assume that dataset in one definition is representative of datasets in the other definition 2 biasm 1 n i 1 n c r c i pred crc i repo where crc i pred refers to the estimated contribution of a specific runoff component i one of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall by rf model crc i repo to contribution of runoff component i reported in the reviewed articles and n for the number of basin cases that used the definitions of water input or flow pathway 2 4 comparison of the uncertainties of crcs we assessed to what extent uncertainties of crcs depend on the applied methods definitions of runoff components and time scales through inter comparisons of the reviewed studies collected data of uncertainties of crcs were divided into two groups according to the applied methods of tracer based mixing approach and hydrological modeling the data based method was not included in this comparison because corresponding studies rarely reported the uncertainties of crcs uncertainties estimated by the varied sources including the variability of tracer signatures of water samples hydrological model parameter model input and model selection were compared uncertainties of crcs quantified by the definitions of water input and flow pathway were compared in each basin group of the two applied methods similarly the uncertainties of annual and seasonal crcs were compared in each basin group of the two methods to remain consistent across the reviewed studies uncertainties of crcs in this review refer to the ranges between the maximum and minimum values of the reported crcs 3 results from the meta analysis the 312 glacierized basins are located in the main mountainous areas across the world fig 1 such as rocky mountains in north america andes in south america european alps tianshan in central asia and a few mountains in northern europe and new zealand a very large number of the studied glacierized basins are in the himalaya mountains in asia glacierized basins in himalaya provide very important freshwater sources for downstream areas with a high population in countries of pakistan india bangladesh and china lutz et al 2014 it is apparent that the hydrological modeling approach is the dominantly applied method for quantification of crcs in glacierized basins applied in 227 out of the 312 basins 73 in 59 basins 19 crcs were quantified by the tracer based method and in 26 basins 8 by data based methods fig 1 fig 2 examines the types of basins time scales and definitions of runoff component that the tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches were mainly applied to it is shown that the tracer based mixing approach was more likely used in small basins with areas of 50 km2 around 28 of the total 59 basins this can be explained by the fact that fieldwork of water sampling for isotope analysis is more easily implemented in small basins in contrast the hydrological modeling method was mainly applied in large basins with areas of 1000 5000 km2 around 26 of the total 227 basins distributions of mbe mat map wpf and gar of basins where the two methods were applied are rather similar for instance both methods were mainly applied in basins with mat of 5 to 5 fig 2c and map of 0 1000 mm y 1 fig 2d respectively mbe wpf and gar of the study basins mainly fall in the ranges of 2000 4000 m a s l 5 15 and 0 20 respectively fig 2g h show that the tracer based approach was mainly used to quantify seasonal crcs in study periods shorter than 5 years while hydrological modeling was more likely adopted for quantifications of annual crcs in periods longer than 10 years this can be explained by the fact that the tracer based method requires measurements of water tracer signatures from field water sampling field water sampling is often conducted in the warm season when snow cover in the basin is not heavy therefore this method has been mainly used to quantify seasonal contributions of runoff components in contrast hydrological models were typically run in periods longer than one year for parameter calibration and evaluation thus in most of the hydrological modeling works annual contributions of runoff components as well as their variability across years were quantified regarding the definitons of runoff components fig 2i a majority of around 84 tracer based cases quantified crcs under the flow pathway definition with the consideration of groundwater contribution whilst about 60 of the hydrological modeling cases estimated crcs by the water input definition modeling the contributions of runoff components based on the water input definition is more straightforward than based on the definition of flow pathway because hydrological models typically perform well on estimating the inputs of rainfall snowmelt and ice melt in contrast tracking the flow paths of rainfall and meltwater by hydrological modeling is more difficult and typically requires changes to the model source code because rainfall and melt water complexly mixed with each other in soil layers and ground water aquifers as pointed out by weiler et al 2018 more detailed descriptions of how the water inputs were tracked in hydrological models and tracking the effects of water sources on runoff at the basin outlet are important for understanding the changes of water resources in glacierized basins but often missing in the hydrological modeling studies the source area definition was used in conjunction with the water input and flow pathway definitions when contribution of runoff from the glacier area is of interest which therefore was not compared in the figure 3 1 influences of basin characteristics on crcs table 1 and fig 3 present the relations between basin characteristics and contributions of the four runoff components for each runoff component its contributions to annual and seasonal runoff were mainly influenced by two or three basin characteristics table 1 as expected contribution of ice melt is most strongly correlated with gar both annual and seasonal ice melt contributions increase with raised gar and elevation fig 3a b 3h and 3j in addition ice melt contribution in summer is negatively related to the annual precipitation fig 3i as a large proportion of annual precipitation occurs in the ice melting season in most of the reviewed basins such as aizen et al 1995a b wang et al 2015a wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2018 rai et al 2019 both annual and seasonal contributions of snowmelt show strong positive relations with wpf fig 3d and 3k in contrast annual contribution of rainfall decreases with increased gar and wpf fig 3e f as these two characteristics promote the contributions of ice melt and snowmelt e g zhang et al 2016b fang et al 2018 and luo et al 2018 mean rainfall contribution in the melting season increases with higher mat fig 3l because warmer temperature enhances the rainfall proportion in seasonal precipitation zhang et al 2016b annual contribution of groundwater tends to decrease with increasing mbe fig 3g this could be explained by the fact that high elevation mountain basins tend to have steep slopes thin soil layer and small soil water storage capacity naz et al 2014 favoring a higher proportion of direct overland runoff groundwater contribution in the melting season is negatively related to the basin gar fig 3n as meltwater from the glacier area largely occurs in the form of surface runoff the relative importance of basin characteristics quantified by the rf model fig 4 are consistent with the correlation analysis indicating that the highly related basin characteristics were used to split tree nodes in the rf model for instance basin gar shows the highest importance on annual contributions of ice melt and rainfall and seasonal contributions of meltwater and groundwater wpf has the largest influence on annual contribution of snowmelt and shows high influence on seasonal snowmelt contribution map shows high influences on seasonal contributions of rainfall and groundwater mat only has a high influence on rainfall contribution in the melting season whilst basin elevation shows the strongest influence on annual contribution of groundwater we quantified the importance of basin characteristics using meta data from both tracer based and hydrological modeling studies as the influences of basin characteristics on estimated crcs by the two approaches can be expected as similar influence of data errors on the estimated importance was reduced by using average results from the 100 repeated sampling runs the quantified importance of basin characteristics on crcs are in general consistent with the basic knowledge of hydrology processes in the glacierized basins and are also consistent with the priori correlation analysis in table 1 thus increasing our confidence in the results the trained rf models were validated against reported annual crcs in the test sub dataset in fig 5 the model showed good performance on estimating ice melt contributions quantified by both water input and flow pathway definitions fig 5a corrf between the estimated and reported ice melt contributions are higher than 0 7 bias values of the estimated contributions are smaller than 0 1 nrmse values of the estimated ice melt contribution are lower than 1 0 under both definitions similarly the rf algorithm presented good performance on estimating rainfall contributions fig 5b corrf values between the estimated and reported rainfall contributions are 0 76 and 0 63 for the two definitions respectively bias and nrmse values are smaller than 0 1 and 1 0 respectively for estimating snowmelt contributions fig 5c the model presented a high corrf of 0 73 for contribution from the water input definition but a lower corrf of 0 53 for contribution in the flow pathway definition the reduced corrf for rainfall and snowmelt contributions in the flow pathway definition could be attributed to two facts 1 snowmelt and rainfall contributions in this definition are likely affected by groundwater contribution which however cannot be well estimated based on the current five basin characteristics see fig 5d 2 uncertainty of the collected value of wpf is high as around 40 of the reviewed studies did not report details on seasonal precipitation the model estimated much lower corrf of 0 49 for groundwater contribution in fig 5d despite a total bias close to zero low performance for groundwater contribution indicated that more geological factors delineating the rock characteristics and soil storages naz et al 2014 baraer et al 2015 beyond the five characteristics should be involved in the estimation of groundwater contribution which need intensive field survey and were usually not reported in the reviewed articles when combining annual estimates by the two definitions the rf model exhibits good accuracy for estimating contributions of meltwater and rainfall fig 5e g in particular corrf values are higher than 0 6 and bias values are smaller than 0 1 cd values indicate that the rf algorithm could explain around 56 40 and 40 of the variability of the reported annual contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall respectively however the model estimation accuracy for seasonal contributions was markedly lower see table 2 with mean corrf values of around 0 4 nrmse value of seasonal contribution of ice melt tended to be comparable to that of the annual contribution whilst its values for seasonal contributions of the remaining runoff components are much larger the lower performance of seasonal rf models could be explained by the following three reasons first sample sizes of the seasonal contribution data were smaller we only collected 79 cases 55 for training and 24 for test that reported the seasonal crcs only a part of those cases reported contributions of all the four runoff components in contrast we have 233 samples 163 for training and 70 for test for the annual contributions second the used input features of mat map and wpf were calculated on annual scale likely resulting in lower power for estimating crcs in the melting season third uncertainties of the seasonal reported crcs were high because a part of the seasonal crcs were calculated from the arithmetic average of monthly contributions in the melting seasons it is noted that the rf algorithm simulated similar crcs in some basin cases where crcs quantified in the respective studies show large variations see horizontal caps in fig 5d e reasons for such cap predictions could be two fold first there are only very few data points that report high crcs e g the ice melt contributions above 40 in fig 5e these high crcs were therefore not be well reproduced by the rf algorithm as its output is based on the majority votes of decision trees second reported crcs in literatures showed large variability in basins with similar characteristics for example the reported ice melt contribution ranged from 6 to 81 in basins with gar of around 6 7 see fig 3b and the reported groundwater contribution ranged from 22 to 61 in basins with mbe of around 3100 m see fig 3g this can be partly attributed to the inaccuracy in the collected basin characteristics and can be also caused by the uncertainty of the crcs estimated by the variable studies that used different input data and models collecting more basin cases with high contributions of ice melt and groundwater could help to reduce the horizontal cap predictions involving more features than the current five basin characteristics into the rf training procedure could also be helpful to improve the algorithm performance such as the seasonal climate and energy flux soil characteristic and geological conditions these features however were typically not reported in the reviewed articles 3 2 effects of the definitions of runoff components difference of crcs quantified by the two definitions of water input and flow pathway were assessed in fig 6 rf model was trained by data from studies that used the water input definition in fig 6a c estimated ice melt contribution shows a high corrf of 0 67 with the reported contribution which was quantified by the flow pathway definition in the literatures indicating substantial correlation of ice melt contributions estimated by the two definitions biasm between the estimated and reported ice melt contributions is as low as 0 6 similarly estimated rainfall contributions show a good correlation with the reported ones fig 6b however the mean rainfall contribution estimated by the water input definition is 15 8 higher than that quantified by the flow pathway definition on average the snowmelt contribution estimated by the water input definition is 8 4 higher than that quantified by the flow pathway definition fig 6c in fig 6d f the rf model was trained by data from studies that used the flow pathway definition again estimated contributions of ice melt and rainfall show high corrf values with the reported ones it is noted that corrf values between the estimated and reported snowmelt contributions are lower than 0 4 in both fig 6c and 6f this could be attributed to the relatively lower model performance on simulating snowmelt contributions estimated by the flow pathway definition see fig 5c biasm between the estimated and reported ice melt contributions is only 4 3 in fig 6d in contrast mean contributions of rainfall and snowmelt estimated by the flow pathway definition are 11 6 and 10 5 lower than those quantified by the water input definition respectively comparisons in fig 6 suggest that crcs are affected in different ways by the two definitions rainfall and snowmelt are expected to contribute more to subsurface flow groundwater nepal et al 2014 finger et al 2015 tong et al 2016 shrestha and nepal 2019 or are subject to more water loss caused by evapotranspiration during runoff generation than ice melt and thus are more strongly affected by the two definitions reason for the little differences between ice melt contributions estimated by the two definitions falls into that ice melt was assumed to flow into the channel directly in most of the reviewed articles ice melt input quantified by the water input conception is thus close to the amount of ice melt surface runoff recognized by the flow pathway definition fig 6b and 6e fig 6c and 6f consistently indicate that the rainfall snowmelt contribution quantified by the definition of flow pathway is smaller than that quantified by the definition of water input rainfall and snowmelt runoff in the definition of flow pathway only refer to parts of rainfall and snowmelt that induced direct surface runoff which therefore are smaller than the entire rainfall and snowmelt input quantified by the water input definition differences of corrf and biasm estimated in fig 6b and 6e fig 6c and 6f were caused by the fact that the rf model was trained by data from different basin cases in the two figures to take the uncertainty of rf training into account we swapped the training datasets from the two definitions in the two panels of fig 6 the consistent patterns of the two panels indicate good reliability of our results 3 3 uncertainties of crcs fig 7 a shows in what proportion of the basin cases the reviewed studies reported uncertainties of crcs comparing the tracer based and hydrological modeling methods more than half 59 of the tracer based studies reported uncertainties of the estimated crcs while only around 20 of the hydrological modeling cases quantified the uncertainties uncertainties of crcs in the tracer based method were mainly caused by variabilities of the water tracer signatures which were typically quantified by a gaussian error propagation method 53 of the total 59 basins such as pu et al 2013 sun et al 2016a c and rai et al 2019 the remaining 6 reported the uncertainties using monte carlo error propagation or bayesian approaches e g cable et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2016 singh et al 2019 he et al 2020 around 13 of the hydrological modeling cases reported uncertainties from model parameters e g jost et al 2012 engelhardt et al 2014 and ayala et al 2016 only about 7 and 3 of the modeling cases evaluated the uncertainties of crcs caused by uncertainties of model input e g zhang et al 2013 pohl et al 2015 and model structure e g siderius et al 2013 nepal et al 2015 respectively for hydrological modeling in glacierized basins it has been demonstrated that involving more observation data in the calibration procedure particularly resulted in smaller parameter uncertainty finger et al 2015 he et al 2019 fig 7b thus compares the percentages of modeling studies that used different combinations of observations for parameter calibration the most widely used combination is discharge and glacier measurements of glacier area or glacier mass balance glacier volume around 35 of the total 227 modeling cases such as weber et al 2010 farinotti et al 2012 wu et al 2015 duethmann et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a wang et al 2018 li et al 2020a followed by the usage of discharge data solely 28 e g zhao et al 2013 ali et al 2018 duan et al 2018 ji et al 2019 measurements of snow cover area snow water equivalent swe or snow depths were involved in around only 10 5 of the modeling basins e g koboltschnig et al 2008 boscarello et al 2014 han et al 2019 partly because of the low availability of snow water equivalent and snow depth data in glacierized basin see comments in van tiel et al 2020 long term and reliable snowpack measurement is not easily to conduct in highly glacierized basins due to logistic limitations especially in macro scale basins satellite based snow cover data with high resolution such as modis products are increasingly used to constrain hydrological model parameters but their application in mountainous areas is still hindered by limited availability due to cloud cover gafurov et al 2016 the dominant use of the combination of discharge and glacier measurements for model calibration in glacierized basins is similar to the findings of van tiel et al 2020 it is worth noting that around 24 of the modeling basin cases did not involve a parameter calibration procedure such as singh and kumar 1997 gaddam et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 those studies typically used simple hydrological models and estimated parameter values based on field surveys and prior knowledge e g wang et al 2015a kumar et al 2016 or used a physically based energy balance module for the calculation of melt runoff e g prasch et al 2011 bash and marshall 2014 brown et al 2014 in total the temperature index also named as degree day method was used in about 94 of the 227 modeling cases to calculate melt runoff i e koboltschnig et al 2007 singh et al 2008 zhang and zhang 2009 li et al 2014 adnan et al 2017 while the energy balance approach was used in the remaining 6 e g loukas et al 2002 dadic et al 2008 li et al 2015 uncertainties of crcs quantified by the tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches are compared in fig 8 a c in terms of the mean values indicated by markers in the boxplots annual crcs show smaller uncertainties than seasonal ones in both approaches fig 8a this is partly because estimates of crcs at annual scale were better constrained by longer time series of data meanwhile uncertainties of crcs in the tracer based method are higher than those quantified by hydrological models at both annual and seasonal scales this can be explained by the results in fig 8b which shows that uncertainty estimates of crcs caused by variabilities of water tracer signatures in the tracer based approach are larger than those caused by the uncertainties of model parameter and input in the hydrological modeling approach the strong spatio temporal variabilities of water tracer signatures in glacierized basins have been widely reported e g engel et al 2016 liu et al 2016 li et al 2020b see the supplement excel file and were partly attributed to the elevation effect in the modeling studies uncertainties of crcs were often estimated focusing on one or two of the uncertainty sources of model parameter input data and model structure which suggests that uncertainties of modeled crcs had been likely underestimated fig 8b indicates that uncertainties caused by model selection and input data could be comparable to those caused by model parameters though it is difficult to draw conclusive results due to the small numbers of studies that analyzed uncertainties of model input e g zhang et al 2013 pohl et al 2015 mimeau et al 2019b and model structure siderius et al 2013 nepal et al 2015 latif et al 2020 one of the examples to quantify the contributions of different uncertainty sources to the total uncertainty of hydrological modeling is ismail et al 2020 who demonstrated that the selection of hydrological models could account for around 14 in the total uncertainty of runoff simulation however uncertainty analysis for hydrological modeling in high mountain areas relies heavily on the input data availability and model parameterization vaghefi et al 2019 the contributions of different uncertainty sources to the total modeling uncertainty are expected to strongly vary with the climate and terrain settings of the study basins zaremehrjardy et al 2020 comparisons of crc uncertainties estimated by different definitions of runoff components are presented in fig 8c in term of the mean uncertainty the water input definition tended to result in larger uncertainties of crcs than the flow pathway definition despite comparable uncertainty ranges of the two definitions quantifying contributions of four runoff components in the flow pathway definition tended to provide more data constraints on the estimates in comparison to the quantification of only three runoff components in the water input definition the smaller uncertainties of crcs estimated by the flow pathway definition in the tracer based method could likely be attributed to the relatively smaller variability of the groundwater tracer signatures wang et al 2015b he et al 2019 2000 however this finding should be taken cautiously because only four cases reported crc uncertainties under the water input definition using the tracer based method fig 8d compares uncertainties of the contributions of each of the four runoff components reported in all studies mean uncertainties of the contributions of groundwater ice melt and snowmelt are around 15 whilst mean uncertainty of the rainfall contribution is a bit lower at around 8 however these results are highly related to the studies we collected 3 4 limitations of the meta analysis one of the limitations falls in the data quantity for the meta analysis the reviewed 312 glacierized basins are located in a wide range of terrain and climate settings from low altitude to high altitude and cold to warm with a literature coverage from 1990s to 2020 crcs quantified in the 312 basins represent a wide range of hydrology patterns in glacierized basins worldwide and provide a good data basis for the meta analysis data quantity in our review paper is comparable to that in van tiel et al 2020 who reviewed the calibration of hydrological models in glacierized basins and larger than that in frenierre and mark 2014 who reviewed methods for estimating the glacier melt contribution for the rf training we sampled 70 of the 312 reviewed basins and repeated the sampling 100 times therefore we used around 21 840 i e 100 0 7 312 repeated examples in different combinations to train the rf model in fig 5e g resulting in a mean node size of around 10 of the decision trees the repeated random sampling approach improved the representativeness of the training dataset see fig s2 in the supplement word file results of the rf algorithm were reported as the average estimate of the 100 sampling runs with each sampling run based on the outputs from 500 trees leaning rate curves in fig s1 show small changes in rf performance with the training data quantity ranging from 80 to 100 of the total data indicating appropriate sufficiency of the total 312 reviewed basin cases for the robust training of rf algorithm similar rf performance similar nrmse and bias for the training and test datasets in fig s5 indicate a low chance of overfitting of the rf algorithm when trained by data from the 312 reviewed basin cases however our results are only applicable and limited to the reviewed basin cases which represent the majority of the peer reviewed publications on quantifying crcs in glacierized basins for example studies that investigated the impacts of model selection on the quantifications of crcs are very limited only in a few of the reviewed basins crcs had been quantified by both tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches the question of to what extent estimates of crcs by the two methods agree has not been answered basin characteristics of mbe map mat wpf and gar were not clearly reported in some of the reviewed studies proxy data sources of global gridded products of precipitation and air temperature were used to fill the missing data which however inevitably introduced uncertainty in the meta data especially for small basins with areas lower than the grid cell size future applications of lapse rates of precipitation and temperature could be helpful to downscale the grid estimates of map and mat using ensemble mean from multiple gridded datasets could also help to improve the estimates of map and mat although clean up strategies have been conducted for the collected data it is likely that there are still errors in the input data given the wide range of basin terrains and climate such errors could affect the outputs of the rf model which is typically sensitive to the input data the repeated random sampling procedure of training dataset and the approach of swapping the training dataset in fig 6 helped to partly reduce the influences of errors in the input data we selected five basin characteristics for the regression analysis based on the knowledge of influencing basin features on crcs in glacierized basins from literature e g koboltschnig and schöner 2011 lafaysse et al 2011 lutz et al 2016 adnan et al 2017 jin et al 2019 and data availability the pearson correlation coefficient corrf in a priori analysis indeed indicates that the used five basin characteristics are relevant features for crcs in glacierized basins we assumed consistent influences of basin characteristics on quantified crcs despite the use of different methods for the quantification of crcs i e tracer based hydrological modeling and data based and therefore combined data using different methods in the regression analysis however we encourage researchers to report more details of basin characteristics in their publications involving more basin characteristics such as seasonal climate and energy flux soil characteristic and geological conditions should be helpful for better considering the non linear relationships between basin characteristics and crcs in a future meta analysis these features however were typically not reported in the reviewed articles this can be left for future work as this review paper aims at interpreting the influence of the five selected basin characteristics on crcs based on the collected meta data rather than developing a robust machine learning model that is capable of extrapolation to new cases despite the mentioned limitations our meta analysis provides new insights into the influences of basin characteristics definitions of runoff components and the selection of methods on the quantifications of crcs in glacierized basins meta data collected from the reviewed articles have been summarized in the supplement excel file which additionally presents the mean water tracer signatures used in the tracer based studies and the values of degree day factors for snow and ice melt in the hydrological modeling studies we acknowledge that involving meta data from more coming studies could be helpful to improve the comparison of the tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches as well as the assessments of crcs uncertainties 4 conclusions and future perspectives our analysis of meta data collected from the reviewed articles demonstrates that 1 the reviewed five basin characteristics mbe mat map wpf and gar are strongly related to the crcs in the glacierized basins at the annual time scale the most important influencing basin characteristics were gar and mbe for the ice melt contribution wpf and map for the snow melt contribution and gar and wpf for the rainfall contribution rf algorithm based on the five basin characteristics were able to explain 56 40 and 40 of the variability of the reported annual contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall respectively whilst the variability of reported seasonal crcs and the annual contribution of groundwater could be much less well explained by the five basin characteristics 2 based on the reviewed studies ice melt contribution to the total water input was close to the contribution of ice melt induced surface flow to the total runoff in contrast the rainfall and snowmelt contributions to the total water input were around 9 14 higher than the contributions of rainfall and snowmelt induced surface flow to the total runoff due to high contributions to infiltration and subsurface flow as well as large evaporation losses 3 the tracer based end member mixing method tended to estimate larger uncertainties of crcs than the hydrological modeling approach however uncertainties of modeled crcs were likely underestimated as often only one or two of the three uncertainty sources of model parameter model input and model structure were considered in the studies based on the reviewed studies uncertainties of modeled crcs caused by the three sources are comparable to improve the understanding of crcs to streamflow in variable glacierized basins it is recommended that publications report more details on the setting up of the hydrological models the conceptualization of runoff components the terrain and climate conditions in the study basins as well as the used input data furthermore more efforts into the following three directions are encouraged 4 1 cross validation of crcs estimates from tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches table 3 compares crcs estimated by the tracer based and hydrological modeling methods in four basins indicating pronounced differences in the estimates specifically modeled snowmelt contributions in june july in the chhota shigri basin by azam et al 2019 and engelhardt et al 2017 were 65 87 which are much higher than the contributions of 17 43 estimated by the tracer based method in kumar et al 2019 in the urumqi river modeled annual and seasonal groundwater contributions were around 31 35 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b and were smaller than the groundwater contributions of 50 57 quantified by the tracer based approach chen et al 2019 sun et al 2016a whilst the modeled rainfall contributions were larger compared to estimates of the tracer based approach in the ala archa basin modeled rainfall contribution in the melting season was around 10 higher than the tracer based estimates he et al 2018 he et al 2020 modeled ice melt contribution in the melting season was 3 lower than that estimated by the tracer based method modeled and tracer based ice melt contributions were comparable in the dudh kosi basin racoviteanu et al 2013 nepal et al 2014 and 2015 the crcs differences could be partly attributed to the difference of meteorological and glacier cover conditions as well as the duration of the study periods when the corresponding studies were implemented we only found he et al 2019 compared the two methods in the same study period they found crcs estimates of the two methods were comparable when water isotope measurements were involved in the calibration of hydrological model but pronounced differences were found when the hydrological model was calibrated by discharge observation solely thus we suggest more cross validations of the two methods to reduce potential confusions on understanding the roles of runoff components in controlling the river runoff in glacierized basins the tracer based method has the advantage that tracer data are measured directly in the water sources that trigger runoff generation in the basin klaus and mcdonnell 2013 assuming water sources are well labeled before the subsequent mixing process however the tracer based method is limited to the availability of water tracer data frenierre and mark 2014 which is a serious constraint because water sampling in glacierized basins is in general difficult due to the harsh environment and logistic limitations meanwhile strong spatio temporal variability of water tracer signatures reduces the representativeness of water samples which were often collected in limited sites and short time periods penna et al 2017 schmieder et al 2018 resulting in large uncertainties in the estimation of crcs in contrast hydrological models tend to be more flexible to the data availability global gridded products of meteorological variables could be used to drive the models e g mimeau et al 2019b crcs at multiple time scales from sub daily mimeau et al 2019a daily koboltschnig et al 2008 monthly soncini et al 2016 wang et al 2019 to seasonal decadal dadic et al 2008 junghans et al 2011 simoni et al 2011 ismail and bogacki 2018 han et al 2019 singh and kumar 1997 can be estimated by hydrological models moving and mixing processes of water sources in the study basins were assumed to be physically represented in the hydrological models shrestha and nepal 2019 even though the simulated hydrological behaviors rely heavily on model concept and calibration inter comparisons of the two methods could provide multiple constraints to double check the results avoiding systematic bias in the crcs estimates caused by low representativeness of the water samples or inappropriate parameter calibration he et al 2019 cross validation of estimates from the two methods could help to improve our understanding of runoff changes and to fill the gaps between catchment experimentalists and hydrological modelers frenierre and mark 2014 4 2 reduce uncertainty using multiple datasets both tracer based and hydrological modeling methods exhibited large uncertainties of crcs considering the large uncertainty of water tracer and hydro meteorological input datasets there is hardly a unique dataset that can work well on constraining the uncertainties of crcs throughout the wide range of glacierized basins therefore one approach to reduce uncertainties of crcs could be a combined use of multiple datasets chen et al 2017b involving hydrological information such as the seasonal dominances of multiple runoff processes on river runoff and the spatio temporal variability of runoff processes in an a priori analysis of water tracer signatures could help to exclude outliers in tracer measurements for the tracer based method one of those examples is cable et al 2011 who additionally considered the spatio temporal correlations of multiple runoff processes in prior assumptions of the bayesian end member mixing approach to reduce uncertainty using water tracer data additionally for parameter calibration bears the potential to reduce uncertainties in the identification of behavioral parameters one of the alternatives is the increasingly used tracer aided hydrological model capell et al 2012 ala aho et al 2017 he et al 2019 which has demonstrated the value of water tracer data for constraining modeling uncertainties originating from both parameters and hydrological model structures however values of water tracer data for reducing uncertainty of modeled crcs in glacierized basins are still not well investigated other data sources such as snow surveys glacier field measurements remotely sensed snow glacier changes and geochemistry tracers could also be involved in the quantifications of crcs although some of these data have been used for hydrological model calibration in glacierized basins such as valentin et al 2018b integrating multiple data sources into both tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches and assessing their values for reducing uncertainties of crcs are still highly required 4 3 quantifying the effects of evapotranspiration subtraction and water transit time subtraction of actual evapotranspiration et including evaporation from open water body and soil transpiration from plants and snow ice sublimation from water components has substantial influences on the modeled crcs weiler et al 2018 to facilitate the calculation of crcs a lot of modeling studies subtracted actual et from rainfall alone e g kumar et al 2007 simoni et al 2011 pradhananga et al 2014 lutz et al 2014 fig 9 shows that about 59 of the 227 modeling basins did not specify how the actual et was subtracted in the articles in around 20 of the modeling basins the calculated actual et was fully applied to rainfall the actual et was additionally applied to snow in around 13 of the total modeling cases e g loukas et al 2002 zhang et al 2016a and adnan et al 2019 et of ice melt was taken into account in only about 5 of the modeling cases scenarios 4 and 6 e g schaper et al 1999 hagg et al 2018 ismail et al 2020 runoff coefficients were used to consider et effects in around 5 of the 227 modeling cases e g singh et al 2006 sirguey et al 2009 khadka et al 2014 gaddam et al 2018 gupta et al 2019 however no studies have assessed the effects of the different assumptions of et on the quantifications of crcs future comparative studies on the different et subtraction scenarios using the same hydrological model could serve to improve the understanding of et effects most of the tracer based studies did not take the effects of et on the quantifications of crcs into account e g kobierska et al 2015 yang et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 isotopic fractionation caused by et along the flow path from source sampling site to mixing basin outlet sites has been widely ignored frenierre and mark 2014 chen et al 2018 indicated that the isotope signature of glacier meltwater could be strongly affected by evaporation enrichment in the kaidu river basin he et al 2020 quantified the effects of et on crcs using a bayesian end member mixing approach they demonstrated that ignoring the fractionation of et likely resulted in overestimated rainfall contribution but underestimated meltwater contributions in glacierized basins meltwater samples and rain collectors are frequently collected in high altitude sites rather than near the river channel brown et al 2010 ahluwalia et al 2016 wilson et al 2016 pu et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 differences of isotopic ratios of sampled rain and meltwater and those of rain and meltwater ultimately flowing into the river are thus expected to be significant beyond that fractionation effects of water isotopic ratios caused by snowmelt and snow sublimation ala aho et al 2017 as well as the altitudinal effects on precipitation isotope signature should also be taken into account for improved quantifications of crcs furthermore transit times of melt and rain water within the basin also affect the estimated crcs to streamflow at the basin outlet gascoin et al 2011 weiler et al 2018 especially in large basins in most of the reviewed studies water transit times were not taken into account in the quantification of crcs in some cases such as he et al 2015 costa et al 2018 travel times of surface water inputs were assumed as short as a few days however transit times of rain and melt water rely on multiple factors including the soil water storage and event intensity weiler et al 2018 thus resulting in strong spatio temporal variability in glacierized basins the spatial distributions of water transit times or water ages have been appropriately quantified by tracer aided hydrological models in snowmelt dominated basins such as van huijgevoort et al 2016 ala aho et al 2017 similar applications in glacierized basins could be promising for quantifying the effects of water travel time on estimated crcs to streamflow declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

4160,quantifying the contributions of runoff components crcs to streamflow is of significant importance for understanding the dynamics of water resources under changing climate in glacierized basins this article presents a meta analysis on different approaches for quantifying runoff components in glacierized basins including the tracer based end member mixing method and the hydrological modeling approach we collected estimated crcs from 312 glacierized basin cases as well as values of five characteristics in these basins including mean basin elevation mbe mean annual air temperature mat mean annual precipitation map winter precipitation fraction wpf and glacierized area ratio gar relations between crcs and the basin characteristics were assessed using a random forest rf algorithm the review showed that crcs were most often quantified by the hydrological modeling approach 73 of the basin cases compared to hydrological modeling the tracer based approach applied in 19 of the basin cases was more likely to be used in smaller basins 50 km2 rather at the seasonal than annual time scale and within shorter study periods of 5 years meta analysis results indicate that 1 at the annual time scale the most important influencing basin characteristics were gar and mbe for the ice melt contribution wpf and map for the snow melt contribution and gar and wpf for the rainfall contribution rf algorithm based on the five basin characteristics was able to explain 56 40 and 40 of the variability of the reported annual contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall respectively the variability of seasonal crcs and annual contribution of groundwater could be less well explained by the five basin characteristics 2 comparing different definitions of runoff components based on water input or flow pathway indicated that the ice melt contribution to total water input sum of rainfall and melt water based on the water input definition was close to the contribution of ice melt induced surface flow to total runoff based on the flow pathway definition in contrast based on the reviewed studies rainfall and snowmelt contributions based on the water input definition were around 9 14 higher than the contributions of rainfall and snowmelt induced surface flow to total runoff 3 the tracer based end member mixing method tended to estimate larger uncertainties of crcs than hydrological modeling but uncertainties of modeled crcs were likely underestimated as often only one or two of the three uncertainty sources of model parameter model input and model structure were considered in the modeling studies we propose that more efforts are required to cross validate crcs estimated by the tracer based and hydrological modeling methods and to reduce uncertainties of crcs by integrations of hydro meteorological data and water tracer data 1 introduction glacierized basins in mountainous areas are typically the head watersheds of downstream rivers providing important freshwater sources for downstream ecological habitats agriculture irrigation and potable water supply immerzeel et al 2013 dynamics of water resources in these basins are strongly controlled by changes of the multiple water sources for runoff generation including rainfall snowmelt and ice melt lutz et al 2014 strong seasonality of air temperature and precipitation play key roles in regulating the dominances of specific water sources on seasonal streamflow koboltschnig et al 2007 nepal et al 2014 meanwhile warming climate accelerates the retreating of ice thickness and glacier area in these basins mark et al 2010 huss 2011 burger et al 2019 resulting in larger proportion of meltwater feeding the river in the near term and smaller in the long term runoff in the glacierized basins is thus highly vulnerable to the current climate changes loukas et al 2002 huss et al 2013 duethmann et al 2016 mackay et al 2019 quantifying the contributions of different runoff components to streamflow is critical to understanding the dynamics of availability of water resources in these basins jost et al 2012 prasch et al 2013 mimeau et al 2019a lots of efforts have been put into quantifying the crcs to streamflow in glacierized basins especially in recent years e g finger et al 2015 mimeau et al 2019b crespo et al 2020a b fatima et al 2020 it was demonstrated that crcs show strong variations in basins where landscape conditions and climate systems are variable characteristics such as snowfall rainfall ratio annual precipitation and air temperature as well as the glacier area ratio gar to the total basin area have significant effects on crcs for example snowmelt contribution is large in mountains where they receive a large amount of solid precipitation and a tendency to shifting toward the rainfall dominated precipitation caused by temperature warming reduces the snowmelt contribution lutz et al 2016 jin et al 2019 glacier melt contribution increases in highly glaciated subbasins prasch et al 2013 and a nearly logarithmic relation between glacier melt contribution and gar in the austria glacierized basins was found by koboltschnig and schöner 2011 they attributed the smaller increase of glacier melt contribution with higher gar to the increased contribution of precipitation although the influences of land and climate characteristics on crcs were widely discussed their relative importance on the contributions of specific runoff components has not been comprehensively investigated relationship between basin characteristics and the contributions of multiple runoff components have rarely been examined in a quantitative way exceptions are koboltschnig and schöner 2011 and zhang et al 2016b who used gar to quantify the possible influence of glacier melt on river runoff in their study areas one of the reasons for the lack of comprehensive comparisons of crcs across different glacierized basins is the use of different concepts for the runoff components by existing studies the same terminology in varied studies may refer to different runoff components for instance in some cases glacier runoff represents the total runoff including meltwater and rainfall runoff from glacier area radić and hock 2014 yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2020 ayala et al 2020 while representing all meltwater from the glacier area nolin et al 2010 pelto 2011 koppes et al 2015 jiskoot and mueller 2012 hirose and marshall 2013 kogutenko et al 2019 or only ice melt zhang et al 2013 racoviteanu et al 2013 clark et al 2015 chen et al 2017a burger et al 2019 in other cases in general three different concepts were used to separate the runoff components weiler et al 2018 mimeau et al 2019a in definition 1 abbreviated as water input definition runoff components are quantified based on the sources of water inputs including ice melt snowmelt and rainfall costa et al 2018 crcs refer to shares of water sources in the total water input ignoring the subsequent moving and mixing processes of water sources in definition 2 abbreviated as flow pathway definition runoff components are estimated by runoff generation processes and flow pathways of groundwater subsurface flow and surface flow the total runoff is divided into surface and subsurface flow baseflow firstly e g loukas et al 2002 lutz et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b wang et al 2018 and surface flow is further divided into three direct runoff components induced by ice melt snowmelt and rainfall aizen et al 1995a naeem et al 2013 he et al 2019 fatima et al 2020 in definition 3 abbreviated as source area definition runoff components are identified by the source areas of runoff the most prevailing runoff components quantified by definition 3 are runoff from glacier and non glacier areas e g hirose and marshall 2013 zhou et al 2013 biskop et al 2016 gabet et al 2008 thayyen and gergan 2010 thayyen et al 2005 runoff from glacier area often includes runoff components induced by multiple sources of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall in the glacier covered area e g loukas et al 2002 nepal et al 2014 this definition is typically used along with the water input and flow pathway definitions in cases that runoff from specific areas are of interest such as zhang et al 2016a mimeau et al 2019a in contrast to the water input definition contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall in the flow pathway definition were calculated under the additional consideration of groundwater or baseflow such as naeem et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 gupta et al 2019 it is interesting to know how the contributions of ice melt surface runoff snowmelt surface runoff and rainfall surface runoff calculated by the flow pathway definition differ from the corresponding water source contributions i e ice meltwater snow meltwater and rainfall estimated by the water input definition another issue that hampers the comparisons of crcs in glacierized basins is the use of different methods for quantifying crcs methods that were applied to quantify crcs in glacierized basins mainly fall into three categories different from frenierre and mark 2014 who reviewed five methods to quantify the glacier melt contribution solely the first widely used method is the end member mixing method based on the usage of various water tracers such as water stable isotopes electrical conductivity and hydrochemistry tracers liu et al 2008 maurya et al 2011 blaen et al 2014 vaughn and fountain 2005 zhou et al 2015 guido et al 2016 wang et al 2016a yang et al 2016 chang et al 2018 crespo et al 2020a b conservative and constant assumptions of the water tracer signatures were commonly adopted to conduct this method klaus and mcdonnell 2013 kong and pang 2012 groundwater contribution was typically taken into account in cases where water samples from springs or wells were available penna et al 2014 baraer et al 2015 engel et al 2016 sun et al 2016a b saberi et al 2019 large uncertainties of crcs quantified by the tracer based method were found due to the strong spatio temporal variability of tracer signatures of water sources penna et al 2017 pu et al 2013 rai et al 2019 a gaussian error propagation method was often used along with the end member mixing method to quantify the uncertainties of crcs e g wu et al 2016 assuming uncertainties caused by the variability of tracer signatures of water sources are independent of each other genereux 1998 a bayesian end member mixing approach was also applied for the quantification of crcs in glacierized basins cable et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2016 he et al 2020 in which the uncertainties of crcs originated from the prior assumptions and the spatio temporal variability of tracer signatures were quantified by the posterior distributions of parameters the second widely used method is the hydrological modeling approach a considerable number of glacio hydrological models that integrate the generation of snow ice meltwater runoff and the dynamics of snowpack and glacier thickness area into the rainfall runoff generation process have been developed to quantify crcs e g immerzeel et al 2013 naz et al 2014 luo et al 2018 ragettli et al 2015 farinotti et al 2012 in contrast to the tracer based method hydrological models physically represent the dynamics of water storages in snowpack and glacier body and corresponding runoff generation processes loukas et al 2002 nolin et al 2010 lafaysse et al 2011 prasch et al 2011 frans et al 2015 lutz et al 2016 burger et al 2019 shrestha and nepal 2019 however the large number of parameters of glacio hydrological models generally introduced substantial uncertainties into the quantifications of runoff components zhang et al 2013 he et al 2018 armstrong et al 2019 multiple observations including glacier mass balance area snow surveys and even groundwater storage estimated by grace data in addition to discharge were commonly used to constrain the behavioral parameter values of the glacio hydrological models jost et al 2012 duethmann et al 2015 finger et al 2015 chen et al 2017a he et al 2018 valentin et al 2018a b shakoor and ejaz 2019 meteorological inputs and selection of the hydrological models could also be sources of uncertainties of modeled crcs nepal et al 2017 which were assessed by comparative studies using varied input datasets or model structures such as pohl et al 2015 siderius et al 2013 the third option to quantify crcs in glacierized basins is a data based method similarly to the direct discharge measurement and hydrological balance equation methods reviewed in frenierre and mark 2014 in which the contributions of different runoff components are estimated based on observations of water balance components or hydro meteorological data time series aizen et al 1996 mark and seltzer 2003 thayyen et al 2005 gabet et al 2008 kumar et al 2007 for instance measurements or estimates of water balance components of snow water equivalent precipitation and evaporation were used to calculate the shares of net water inputs in the basin water cycle błaszczyk et al 2019 jeelani et al 2012 singh et al 1997 singh and jain 2009 graphical methods and empirical methods based on observations of discharge time series were used to estimate the contribution of baseflow mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 mukhopadhyay and khan 2015 ahluwalia et al 2015 and measurements of glacier mass balance and discharge from glacier covered sub catchment were adopted to quantify the glacier melt contribution leiva et al 2007 while it is easy to implement the data based method is less suitable for quantifying crcs for short time scales e g on an event base or at a monthly time scale when runoff components constituting an extreme flow event are of interest because of the underlying assumption of hydrological balance on seasonal to decadal scales frenierre and mark 2014 furthermore it relies heavily on the availability of long term field observations which however are commonly unavailable in remotely located and poorly gauged glacierized basins frans et al 2018 wu et al 2015 crcs were often estimated by only one of the above three methods in existing studies inter comparisons of the tracer based and hydrological modeling methods in he et al 2019 indicated that crcs and the corresponding uncertainties estimated by the two methods were considerably different motivated by the above backgrounds this review article collected crcs in glacierized basins from published studies as well as basin characteristics that are assumed to have a strong influence on the crcs including mean basin elevation mbe mean annual air temperature mat mean annual precipitation map winter precipitation fraction in the total annual precipitation wpf and glacier area ratio gar the collected five basin characteristics and corresponding crcs were used to develop a random forest rf algorithm meta analysis of the collected data has been conducted to answer the three following questions 1 what are the relative influences of the reviewed basin characteristics on the contributions of the different runoff components across a wide range of studies 2 how do the estimates of contributions of rainfall and meltwater rely on the definitions of water input and flow pathway and which runoff components are affected most by the definitions 3 how do the uncertainties of quantified crcs differ depending on the applied methods and definitions of runoff components 2 data and methodology 2 1 extent of the review and collection of meta data reviewed articles were all collected from the database of web of science the key words of glacier runoff streamflow contribution share account for proportion and basin catchment watershed have been used for the literature search from 1990 to 2020 only peer reviewed published articles were included book chapters theses and project reports were not involved only studies that reported at least one of the contributions of ice melt snowmelt rainfall and groundwater to streamflow at the basin outlet were included in the meta analysis that means studies that only reported the contribution of runoff from glacier area or snow ice clean area and the contribution of glacier melt sum of ice melt and snowmelt or meltwater ice melt and snowmelt were not separated or precipitation rainfall and snowmelt were not separated were not included in the meta analysis in total 143 articles reporting crcs in 312 glacierized basin cases across the world have been reviewed see the supplement excel file here we counted the same basin that were studied by different researchers as different basin cases considering the variations of applied methods and study periods methods that were applied to quantify runoff components in the reviewed articles all fall into the three categories introduced in section 1 the following meta data were extracted from the reviewed studies characteristics of the study basins including longitude latitude basin area mbe mat map wpf fraction of precipitation occurring in november february or austral may august to approximately represent the snow fraction in the annual precipitation and gar hydrochemistry isotope tracer signatures temporal scales at which the runoff components were quantified as well as the reported crcs and the corresponding definitions of runoff components projections of crcs in future periods were not considered in the meta analysis due to large uncertainty in the projections of future climate for studies where mat map and wpf were not reported values of those characteristics were estimated from global gridded products based on the approximate centroid of the catchment using gpcc global precipitation climatology centre http gpcc dwd de for map and wpf and cru ts 4 0 climatic research unit gridded time series https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg for mat the global multi resolution terrain elevation data gmted2010 was used to estimate elevation at the approximate centroid of the catchment in studies where mbe was not reported the proxy gridded products at the centroid of catchments were used because geographic ranges and boundaries of catchments were not available from the reviewed articles especially for small basins the gpcc data was used as it provided global gridded gauge analysis estimates based on one of the largest databases of quality controlled station data covering the time period from 1950s to 2020 when crcs were quantified in the reviewed articles the gpcc products have been demonstrated as acceptable in mountainous areas by zandler et al 2019 and wortmann et al 2018 though it has to be acknowledged that precipitation estimates for mountainous areas based on globally available data are generally uncertain in cases where mat was not reported we used estimates based on cru as it is one of the most widely used climate products and covers the period 1950s to 2020 when crcs were quantified in the reviewed articles the gmted2010 data was used because it provides global elevation estimate at a high resolution 30 7 5 arc second and incorporates several good quality global elevation products we adopted some strategies to clean up the collected data before using for themeta analysis climate variables of annual precipitation and air temperature that are significantly lower or higher deviating by 50 than those reported by similar studies in the same basin during a close time period were replaced with the mean values reported in similar studies in basin cases that reported contributions of runoff components in multiple time periods we excluded results in periods with only few hydrological data in basin cases where the proxy data of global gridded products provide abnormal deviating by 50 values in comparison to the basin characteristics that were reported in similar basins i e in the same region we conducted a correction for the proxy data based on the bias between the gridded estimates and reported values in similar basins to reduce noise in the crcs only contributions of four runoff components i e ice melt snowmelt rainfall and groundwater were included in the meta analysis contributions of other runoff components like melt runoff ice melt snowmelt precipitation runoff snowmelt rainfall and glacier runoff meltwater rain on glacier were excluded from the analysis 2 2 analysis of the influences of basin characteristics on crcs the influences of basin characteristics on crcs were analyzed in two steps first correlations between basin characteristics and contributions of each of the runoff components were quantified by the pearson correlation coefficient corrf basin characteristics of mbe mat map wpf and gar were involved in the correlation analysis characteristics that show corrf values higher than 0 25 passing the significance test at level of p 0 05 were assumed to have considerable influences on crcs second regression analysis through a rf algorithm was applied we used rf as a tool for the regression analysis because of its features of being able to approximate complex non linear influences being able to capture complex interactions between variables outputting the importance of input variables small requirements of parameter tuning and low chance of overfitting adhikari et al 2020 ehsani et al 2020 the rf algorithm is a combination of numerous de correlated decision trees each decision tree is trained by randomly sampled training data with nodes split by randomly selected subsets of the input features adhikari et al 2020 at each node splitting step the decision tree identifies the optimal feature and its threshold based on a selected criterion to divide the input data into two classes the node splitting process is repeated until all remaining cases can be treated as the same class or the maximum tree depth is reached ehsani et al 2021 for the regression analysis in this paper the crcs outputs from the rf algorithm are average predictions of all the decision trees crcs and corresponding basin characteristics were first split into a training set 70 and a test set 30 then a total of 100 split sampling were repeated to run the rf training considering the uncertainty of the random sampling procedure we utilized the r package of randomforest to train and test the rf model in each of the 100 sampling runs the parameters mtry nodesize and samplefraction in the randomforest function were optimized by a grid search procedure using the ranger package based on the minimized out of bag mean squared error oob mse the number of trees ntree was set to 500 based on the prior examined learning rate curve of the rf model see fig s4 in supplement word file which indicated that 500 trees were plenty to produce a stable oob mse performance of the rf model was assessed by comparing against the test dataset using goodness of fit metrics including corrf coefficient of determination cd i e squared corrf normalized root mean squared error nrmse i e rmse mean of test value and bias sum of simulation sum of test measurements minus 1 metrics values were averaged over the 500 trees in each of the split sampling running normalized importance of basin characteristics estimated by the importance function in the randomforest package based on the reduction of gini impurity when the basin characteristics were used to split a node in the tree were used to quantify the relative influences of basin characteristics on the contributions of different runoff components the rf model was trained by the following formula eq 1 1 f i α 1 i α 2 i α n i where f i refers to the contribution of a specific runoff component i one of ice melt snowmelt rainfall and groundwater and αn i for the five basin characteristics the above two steps were conducted for annual and seasonal contributions separately data on hourly to monthly time scales were not involved in the rf training for study periods that are longer than one year we used the mean annual seasonal results each of the study periods in the reviewed articles were characterized by a map a mat a mean wpf a mean gar and corresponding mean crcs we used the mean values in the study periods to reduce the noise caused by the inconsistency of time durations in variable studies seasonal contribution of snowmelt was used as its mean contribution to runoff in the snow melting months of april june austral september november seasonal ice melt contribution referred to its mean contribution to runoff in the glacier melting months of july october austral december march seasonal contributions of rainfall and groundwater referred to their mean contributions in both snow and glacier melting months from april october austral september march we included estimates of crcs from all of the three categories of applied methods see section 1 in the analysis to increase the number of basin samples for the training of rf model 2 3 evaluation of the effects of definitions of runoff components on the quantifications of crcs in this review contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall to total water input quantified by the water input definition were compared with the contributions of direct surface flow induced by ice melt snowmelt and rainfall to total runoff quantified by the flow pathway definition studies that reported the groundwater or baseflow contribution in addition to contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall using either the hydrological modeling or tracer based mixing methods were assumed as flow pathway definition based however we only compared the modeled crcs in this section because the tracer based method was rarely used to quantify crcs without the consideration of groundwater the comparison was implemented by the rf algorithm in the following three steps first the entire modeling dataset was divided into two groups by the two definitions second rf model was trained by estimates from the basin group where the water input definition was applied the trained rf model was then applied to estimate crcs using basin characteristics in the other basin group where crcs were reported by the flow pathway definition the rf estimated crcs were assumed to represent the crcs quantified by water input definition in the other basin group mean mass bias biasm with the unit of eq 2 between the estimated and reported crcs were used to quantify the average difference of crcs quantified by the two definitions third rf model was trained by estimates from the basin group in which crcs were quantified by the flow pathway definition and then applied to estimate crcs in the other basin group where the crcs were reported by the water input definition and a similar biasm metric was calculated swapping the training dataset in the third step was used to reduce uncertainty of rf training caused by a single training dataset from water input definition or flow pathway definition fig s3 in the supplement word file indicates similar basin characteristics of basin groups where the two definitions were used it is therefore reasonable to assume that dataset in one definition is representative of datasets in the other definition 2 biasm 1 n i 1 n c r c i pred crc i repo where crc i pred refers to the estimated contribution of a specific runoff component i one of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall by rf model crc i repo to contribution of runoff component i reported in the reviewed articles and n for the number of basin cases that used the definitions of water input or flow pathway 2 4 comparison of the uncertainties of crcs we assessed to what extent uncertainties of crcs depend on the applied methods definitions of runoff components and time scales through inter comparisons of the reviewed studies collected data of uncertainties of crcs were divided into two groups according to the applied methods of tracer based mixing approach and hydrological modeling the data based method was not included in this comparison because corresponding studies rarely reported the uncertainties of crcs uncertainties estimated by the varied sources including the variability of tracer signatures of water samples hydrological model parameter model input and model selection were compared uncertainties of crcs quantified by the definitions of water input and flow pathway were compared in each basin group of the two applied methods similarly the uncertainties of annual and seasonal crcs were compared in each basin group of the two methods to remain consistent across the reviewed studies uncertainties of crcs in this review refer to the ranges between the maximum and minimum values of the reported crcs 3 results from the meta analysis the 312 glacierized basins are located in the main mountainous areas across the world fig 1 such as rocky mountains in north america andes in south america european alps tianshan in central asia and a few mountains in northern europe and new zealand a very large number of the studied glacierized basins are in the himalaya mountains in asia glacierized basins in himalaya provide very important freshwater sources for downstream areas with a high population in countries of pakistan india bangladesh and china lutz et al 2014 it is apparent that the hydrological modeling approach is the dominantly applied method for quantification of crcs in glacierized basins applied in 227 out of the 312 basins 73 in 59 basins 19 crcs were quantified by the tracer based method and in 26 basins 8 by data based methods fig 1 fig 2 examines the types of basins time scales and definitions of runoff component that the tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches were mainly applied to it is shown that the tracer based mixing approach was more likely used in small basins with areas of 50 km2 around 28 of the total 59 basins this can be explained by the fact that fieldwork of water sampling for isotope analysis is more easily implemented in small basins in contrast the hydrological modeling method was mainly applied in large basins with areas of 1000 5000 km2 around 26 of the total 227 basins distributions of mbe mat map wpf and gar of basins where the two methods were applied are rather similar for instance both methods were mainly applied in basins with mat of 5 to 5 fig 2c and map of 0 1000 mm y 1 fig 2d respectively mbe wpf and gar of the study basins mainly fall in the ranges of 2000 4000 m a s l 5 15 and 0 20 respectively fig 2g h show that the tracer based approach was mainly used to quantify seasonal crcs in study periods shorter than 5 years while hydrological modeling was more likely adopted for quantifications of annual crcs in periods longer than 10 years this can be explained by the fact that the tracer based method requires measurements of water tracer signatures from field water sampling field water sampling is often conducted in the warm season when snow cover in the basin is not heavy therefore this method has been mainly used to quantify seasonal contributions of runoff components in contrast hydrological models were typically run in periods longer than one year for parameter calibration and evaluation thus in most of the hydrological modeling works annual contributions of runoff components as well as their variability across years were quantified regarding the definitons of runoff components fig 2i a majority of around 84 tracer based cases quantified crcs under the flow pathway definition with the consideration of groundwater contribution whilst about 60 of the hydrological modeling cases estimated crcs by the water input definition modeling the contributions of runoff components based on the water input definition is more straightforward than based on the definition of flow pathway because hydrological models typically perform well on estimating the inputs of rainfall snowmelt and ice melt in contrast tracking the flow paths of rainfall and meltwater by hydrological modeling is more difficult and typically requires changes to the model source code because rainfall and melt water complexly mixed with each other in soil layers and ground water aquifers as pointed out by weiler et al 2018 more detailed descriptions of how the water inputs were tracked in hydrological models and tracking the effects of water sources on runoff at the basin outlet are important for understanding the changes of water resources in glacierized basins but often missing in the hydrological modeling studies the source area definition was used in conjunction with the water input and flow pathway definitions when contribution of runoff from the glacier area is of interest which therefore was not compared in the figure 3 1 influences of basin characteristics on crcs table 1 and fig 3 present the relations between basin characteristics and contributions of the four runoff components for each runoff component its contributions to annual and seasonal runoff were mainly influenced by two or three basin characteristics table 1 as expected contribution of ice melt is most strongly correlated with gar both annual and seasonal ice melt contributions increase with raised gar and elevation fig 3a b 3h and 3j in addition ice melt contribution in summer is negatively related to the annual precipitation fig 3i as a large proportion of annual precipitation occurs in the ice melting season in most of the reviewed basins such as aizen et al 1995a b wang et al 2015a wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2018 rai et al 2019 both annual and seasonal contributions of snowmelt show strong positive relations with wpf fig 3d and 3k in contrast annual contribution of rainfall decreases with increased gar and wpf fig 3e f as these two characteristics promote the contributions of ice melt and snowmelt e g zhang et al 2016b fang et al 2018 and luo et al 2018 mean rainfall contribution in the melting season increases with higher mat fig 3l because warmer temperature enhances the rainfall proportion in seasonal precipitation zhang et al 2016b annual contribution of groundwater tends to decrease with increasing mbe fig 3g this could be explained by the fact that high elevation mountain basins tend to have steep slopes thin soil layer and small soil water storage capacity naz et al 2014 favoring a higher proportion of direct overland runoff groundwater contribution in the melting season is negatively related to the basin gar fig 3n as meltwater from the glacier area largely occurs in the form of surface runoff the relative importance of basin characteristics quantified by the rf model fig 4 are consistent with the correlation analysis indicating that the highly related basin characteristics were used to split tree nodes in the rf model for instance basin gar shows the highest importance on annual contributions of ice melt and rainfall and seasonal contributions of meltwater and groundwater wpf has the largest influence on annual contribution of snowmelt and shows high influence on seasonal snowmelt contribution map shows high influences on seasonal contributions of rainfall and groundwater mat only has a high influence on rainfall contribution in the melting season whilst basin elevation shows the strongest influence on annual contribution of groundwater we quantified the importance of basin characteristics using meta data from both tracer based and hydrological modeling studies as the influences of basin characteristics on estimated crcs by the two approaches can be expected as similar influence of data errors on the estimated importance was reduced by using average results from the 100 repeated sampling runs the quantified importance of basin characteristics on crcs are in general consistent with the basic knowledge of hydrology processes in the glacierized basins and are also consistent with the priori correlation analysis in table 1 thus increasing our confidence in the results the trained rf models were validated against reported annual crcs in the test sub dataset in fig 5 the model showed good performance on estimating ice melt contributions quantified by both water input and flow pathway definitions fig 5a corrf between the estimated and reported ice melt contributions are higher than 0 7 bias values of the estimated contributions are smaller than 0 1 nrmse values of the estimated ice melt contribution are lower than 1 0 under both definitions similarly the rf algorithm presented good performance on estimating rainfall contributions fig 5b corrf values between the estimated and reported rainfall contributions are 0 76 and 0 63 for the two definitions respectively bias and nrmse values are smaller than 0 1 and 1 0 respectively for estimating snowmelt contributions fig 5c the model presented a high corrf of 0 73 for contribution from the water input definition but a lower corrf of 0 53 for contribution in the flow pathway definition the reduced corrf for rainfall and snowmelt contributions in the flow pathway definition could be attributed to two facts 1 snowmelt and rainfall contributions in this definition are likely affected by groundwater contribution which however cannot be well estimated based on the current five basin characteristics see fig 5d 2 uncertainty of the collected value of wpf is high as around 40 of the reviewed studies did not report details on seasonal precipitation the model estimated much lower corrf of 0 49 for groundwater contribution in fig 5d despite a total bias close to zero low performance for groundwater contribution indicated that more geological factors delineating the rock characteristics and soil storages naz et al 2014 baraer et al 2015 beyond the five characteristics should be involved in the estimation of groundwater contribution which need intensive field survey and were usually not reported in the reviewed articles when combining annual estimates by the two definitions the rf model exhibits good accuracy for estimating contributions of meltwater and rainfall fig 5e g in particular corrf values are higher than 0 6 and bias values are smaller than 0 1 cd values indicate that the rf algorithm could explain around 56 40 and 40 of the variability of the reported annual contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall respectively however the model estimation accuracy for seasonal contributions was markedly lower see table 2 with mean corrf values of around 0 4 nrmse value of seasonal contribution of ice melt tended to be comparable to that of the annual contribution whilst its values for seasonal contributions of the remaining runoff components are much larger the lower performance of seasonal rf models could be explained by the following three reasons first sample sizes of the seasonal contribution data were smaller we only collected 79 cases 55 for training and 24 for test that reported the seasonal crcs only a part of those cases reported contributions of all the four runoff components in contrast we have 233 samples 163 for training and 70 for test for the annual contributions second the used input features of mat map and wpf were calculated on annual scale likely resulting in lower power for estimating crcs in the melting season third uncertainties of the seasonal reported crcs were high because a part of the seasonal crcs were calculated from the arithmetic average of monthly contributions in the melting seasons it is noted that the rf algorithm simulated similar crcs in some basin cases where crcs quantified in the respective studies show large variations see horizontal caps in fig 5d e reasons for such cap predictions could be two fold first there are only very few data points that report high crcs e g the ice melt contributions above 40 in fig 5e these high crcs were therefore not be well reproduced by the rf algorithm as its output is based on the majority votes of decision trees second reported crcs in literatures showed large variability in basins with similar characteristics for example the reported ice melt contribution ranged from 6 to 81 in basins with gar of around 6 7 see fig 3b and the reported groundwater contribution ranged from 22 to 61 in basins with mbe of around 3100 m see fig 3g this can be partly attributed to the inaccuracy in the collected basin characteristics and can be also caused by the uncertainty of the crcs estimated by the variable studies that used different input data and models collecting more basin cases with high contributions of ice melt and groundwater could help to reduce the horizontal cap predictions involving more features than the current five basin characteristics into the rf training procedure could also be helpful to improve the algorithm performance such as the seasonal climate and energy flux soil characteristic and geological conditions these features however were typically not reported in the reviewed articles 3 2 effects of the definitions of runoff components difference of crcs quantified by the two definitions of water input and flow pathway were assessed in fig 6 rf model was trained by data from studies that used the water input definition in fig 6a c estimated ice melt contribution shows a high corrf of 0 67 with the reported contribution which was quantified by the flow pathway definition in the literatures indicating substantial correlation of ice melt contributions estimated by the two definitions biasm between the estimated and reported ice melt contributions is as low as 0 6 similarly estimated rainfall contributions show a good correlation with the reported ones fig 6b however the mean rainfall contribution estimated by the water input definition is 15 8 higher than that quantified by the flow pathway definition on average the snowmelt contribution estimated by the water input definition is 8 4 higher than that quantified by the flow pathway definition fig 6c in fig 6d f the rf model was trained by data from studies that used the flow pathway definition again estimated contributions of ice melt and rainfall show high corrf values with the reported ones it is noted that corrf values between the estimated and reported snowmelt contributions are lower than 0 4 in both fig 6c and 6f this could be attributed to the relatively lower model performance on simulating snowmelt contributions estimated by the flow pathway definition see fig 5c biasm between the estimated and reported ice melt contributions is only 4 3 in fig 6d in contrast mean contributions of rainfall and snowmelt estimated by the flow pathway definition are 11 6 and 10 5 lower than those quantified by the water input definition respectively comparisons in fig 6 suggest that crcs are affected in different ways by the two definitions rainfall and snowmelt are expected to contribute more to subsurface flow groundwater nepal et al 2014 finger et al 2015 tong et al 2016 shrestha and nepal 2019 or are subject to more water loss caused by evapotranspiration during runoff generation than ice melt and thus are more strongly affected by the two definitions reason for the little differences between ice melt contributions estimated by the two definitions falls into that ice melt was assumed to flow into the channel directly in most of the reviewed articles ice melt input quantified by the water input conception is thus close to the amount of ice melt surface runoff recognized by the flow pathway definition fig 6b and 6e fig 6c and 6f consistently indicate that the rainfall snowmelt contribution quantified by the definition of flow pathway is smaller than that quantified by the definition of water input rainfall and snowmelt runoff in the definition of flow pathway only refer to parts of rainfall and snowmelt that induced direct surface runoff which therefore are smaller than the entire rainfall and snowmelt input quantified by the water input definition differences of corrf and biasm estimated in fig 6b and 6e fig 6c and 6f were caused by the fact that the rf model was trained by data from different basin cases in the two figures to take the uncertainty of rf training into account we swapped the training datasets from the two definitions in the two panels of fig 6 the consistent patterns of the two panels indicate good reliability of our results 3 3 uncertainties of crcs fig 7 a shows in what proportion of the basin cases the reviewed studies reported uncertainties of crcs comparing the tracer based and hydrological modeling methods more than half 59 of the tracer based studies reported uncertainties of the estimated crcs while only around 20 of the hydrological modeling cases quantified the uncertainties uncertainties of crcs in the tracer based method were mainly caused by variabilities of the water tracer signatures which were typically quantified by a gaussian error propagation method 53 of the total 59 basins such as pu et al 2013 sun et al 2016a c and rai et al 2019 the remaining 6 reported the uncertainties using monte carlo error propagation or bayesian approaches e g cable et al 2011 rodriguez et al 2016 singh et al 2019 he et al 2020 around 13 of the hydrological modeling cases reported uncertainties from model parameters e g jost et al 2012 engelhardt et al 2014 and ayala et al 2016 only about 7 and 3 of the modeling cases evaluated the uncertainties of crcs caused by uncertainties of model input e g zhang et al 2013 pohl et al 2015 and model structure e g siderius et al 2013 nepal et al 2015 respectively for hydrological modeling in glacierized basins it has been demonstrated that involving more observation data in the calibration procedure particularly resulted in smaller parameter uncertainty finger et al 2015 he et al 2019 fig 7b thus compares the percentages of modeling studies that used different combinations of observations for parameter calibration the most widely used combination is discharge and glacier measurements of glacier area or glacier mass balance glacier volume around 35 of the total 227 modeling cases such as weber et al 2010 farinotti et al 2012 wu et al 2015 duethmann et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a wang et al 2018 li et al 2020a followed by the usage of discharge data solely 28 e g zhao et al 2013 ali et al 2018 duan et al 2018 ji et al 2019 measurements of snow cover area snow water equivalent swe or snow depths were involved in around only 10 5 of the modeling basins e g koboltschnig et al 2008 boscarello et al 2014 han et al 2019 partly because of the low availability of snow water equivalent and snow depth data in glacierized basin see comments in van tiel et al 2020 long term and reliable snowpack measurement is not easily to conduct in highly glacierized basins due to logistic limitations especially in macro scale basins satellite based snow cover data with high resolution such as modis products are increasingly used to constrain hydrological model parameters but their application in mountainous areas is still hindered by limited availability due to cloud cover gafurov et al 2016 the dominant use of the combination of discharge and glacier measurements for model calibration in glacierized basins is similar to the findings of van tiel et al 2020 it is worth noting that around 24 of the modeling basin cases did not involve a parameter calibration procedure such as singh and kumar 1997 gaddam et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 those studies typically used simple hydrological models and estimated parameter values based on field surveys and prior knowledge e g wang et al 2015a kumar et al 2016 or used a physically based energy balance module for the calculation of melt runoff e g prasch et al 2011 bash and marshall 2014 brown et al 2014 in total the temperature index also named as degree day method was used in about 94 of the 227 modeling cases to calculate melt runoff i e koboltschnig et al 2007 singh et al 2008 zhang and zhang 2009 li et al 2014 adnan et al 2017 while the energy balance approach was used in the remaining 6 e g loukas et al 2002 dadic et al 2008 li et al 2015 uncertainties of crcs quantified by the tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches are compared in fig 8 a c in terms of the mean values indicated by markers in the boxplots annual crcs show smaller uncertainties than seasonal ones in both approaches fig 8a this is partly because estimates of crcs at annual scale were better constrained by longer time series of data meanwhile uncertainties of crcs in the tracer based method are higher than those quantified by hydrological models at both annual and seasonal scales this can be explained by the results in fig 8b which shows that uncertainty estimates of crcs caused by variabilities of water tracer signatures in the tracer based approach are larger than those caused by the uncertainties of model parameter and input in the hydrological modeling approach the strong spatio temporal variabilities of water tracer signatures in glacierized basins have been widely reported e g engel et al 2016 liu et al 2016 li et al 2020b see the supplement excel file and were partly attributed to the elevation effect in the modeling studies uncertainties of crcs were often estimated focusing on one or two of the uncertainty sources of model parameter input data and model structure which suggests that uncertainties of modeled crcs had been likely underestimated fig 8b indicates that uncertainties caused by model selection and input data could be comparable to those caused by model parameters though it is difficult to draw conclusive results due to the small numbers of studies that analyzed uncertainties of model input e g zhang et al 2013 pohl et al 2015 mimeau et al 2019b and model structure siderius et al 2013 nepal et al 2015 latif et al 2020 one of the examples to quantify the contributions of different uncertainty sources to the total uncertainty of hydrological modeling is ismail et al 2020 who demonstrated that the selection of hydrological models could account for around 14 in the total uncertainty of runoff simulation however uncertainty analysis for hydrological modeling in high mountain areas relies heavily on the input data availability and model parameterization vaghefi et al 2019 the contributions of different uncertainty sources to the total modeling uncertainty are expected to strongly vary with the climate and terrain settings of the study basins zaremehrjardy et al 2020 comparisons of crc uncertainties estimated by different definitions of runoff components are presented in fig 8c in term of the mean uncertainty the water input definition tended to result in larger uncertainties of crcs than the flow pathway definition despite comparable uncertainty ranges of the two definitions quantifying contributions of four runoff components in the flow pathway definition tended to provide more data constraints on the estimates in comparison to the quantification of only three runoff components in the water input definition the smaller uncertainties of crcs estimated by the flow pathway definition in the tracer based method could likely be attributed to the relatively smaller variability of the groundwater tracer signatures wang et al 2015b he et al 2019 2000 however this finding should be taken cautiously because only four cases reported crc uncertainties under the water input definition using the tracer based method fig 8d compares uncertainties of the contributions of each of the four runoff components reported in all studies mean uncertainties of the contributions of groundwater ice melt and snowmelt are around 15 whilst mean uncertainty of the rainfall contribution is a bit lower at around 8 however these results are highly related to the studies we collected 3 4 limitations of the meta analysis one of the limitations falls in the data quantity for the meta analysis the reviewed 312 glacierized basins are located in a wide range of terrain and climate settings from low altitude to high altitude and cold to warm with a literature coverage from 1990s to 2020 crcs quantified in the 312 basins represent a wide range of hydrology patterns in glacierized basins worldwide and provide a good data basis for the meta analysis data quantity in our review paper is comparable to that in van tiel et al 2020 who reviewed the calibration of hydrological models in glacierized basins and larger than that in frenierre and mark 2014 who reviewed methods for estimating the glacier melt contribution for the rf training we sampled 70 of the 312 reviewed basins and repeated the sampling 100 times therefore we used around 21 840 i e 100 0 7 312 repeated examples in different combinations to train the rf model in fig 5e g resulting in a mean node size of around 10 of the decision trees the repeated random sampling approach improved the representativeness of the training dataset see fig s2 in the supplement word file results of the rf algorithm were reported as the average estimate of the 100 sampling runs with each sampling run based on the outputs from 500 trees leaning rate curves in fig s1 show small changes in rf performance with the training data quantity ranging from 80 to 100 of the total data indicating appropriate sufficiency of the total 312 reviewed basin cases for the robust training of rf algorithm similar rf performance similar nrmse and bias for the training and test datasets in fig s5 indicate a low chance of overfitting of the rf algorithm when trained by data from the 312 reviewed basin cases however our results are only applicable and limited to the reviewed basin cases which represent the majority of the peer reviewed publications on quantifying crcs in glacierized basins for example studies that investigated the impacts of model selection on the quantifications of crcs are very limited only in a few of the reviewed basins crcs had been quantified by both tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches the question of to what extent estimates of crcs by the two methods agree has not been answered basin characteristics of mbe map mat wpf and gar were not clearly reported in some of the reviewed studies proxy data sources of global gridded products of precipitation and air temperature were used to fill the missing data which however inevitably introduced uncertainty in the meta data especially for small basins with areas lower than the grid cell size future applications of lapse rates of precipitation and temperature could be helpful to downscale the grid estimates of map and mat using ensemble mean from multiple gridded datasets could also help to improve the estimates of map and mat although clean up strategies have been conducted for the collected data it is likely that there are still errors in the input data given the wide range of basin terrains and climate such errors could affect the outputs of the rf model which is typically sensitive to the input data the repeated random sampling procedure of training dataset and the approach of swapping the training dataset in fig 6 helped to partly reduce the influences of errors in the input data we selected five basin characteristics for the regression analysis based on the knowledge of influencing basin features on crcs in glacierized basins from literature e g koboltschnig and schöner 2011 lafaysse et al 2011 lutz et al 2016 adnan et al 2017 jin et al 2019 and data availability the pearson correlation coefficient corrf in a priori analysis indeed indicates that the used five basin characteristics are relevant features for crcs in glacierized basins we assumed consistent influences of basin characteristics on quantified crcs despite the use of different methods for the quantification of crcs i e tracer based hydrological modeling and data based and therefore combined data using different methods in the regression analysis however we encourage researchers to report more details of basin characteristics in their publications involving more basin characteristics such as seasonal climate and energy flux soil characteristic and geological conditions should be helpful for better considering the non linear relationships between basin characteristics and crcs in a future meta analysis these features however were typically not reported in the reviewed articles this can be left for future work as this review paper aims at interpreting the influence of the five selected basin characteristics on crcs based on the collected meta data rather than developing a robust machine learning model that is capable of extrapolation to new cases despite the mentioned limitations our meta analysis provides new insights into the influences of basin characteristics definitions of runoff components and the selection of methods on the quantifications of crcs in glacierized basins meta data collected from the reviewed articles have been summarized in the supplement excel file which additionally presents the mean water tracer signatures used in the tracer based studies and the values of degree day factors for snow and ice melt in the hydrological modeling studies we acknowledge that involving meta data from more coming studies could be helpful to improve the comparison of the tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches as well as the assessments of crcs uncertainties 4 conclusions and future perspectives our analysis of meta data collected from the reviewed articles demonstrates that 1 the reviewed five basin characteristics mbe mat map wpf and gar are strongly related to the crcs in the glacierized basins at the annual time scale the most important influencing basin characteristics were gar and mbe for the ice melt contribution wpf and map for the snow melt contribution and gar and wpf for the rainfall contribution rf algorithm based on the five basin characteristics were able to explain 56 40 and 40 of the variability of the reported annual contributions of ice melt snowmelt and rainfall respectively whilst the variability of reported seasonal crcs and the annual contribution of groundwater could be much less well explained by the five basin characteristics 2 based on the reviewed studies ice melt contribution to the total water input was close to the contribution of ice melt induced surface flow to the total runoff in contrast the rainfall and snowmelt contributions to the total water input were around 9 14 higher than the contributions of rainfall and snowmelt induced surface flow to the total runoff due to high contributions to infiltration and subsurface flow as well as large evaporation losses 3 the tracer based end member mixing method tended to estimate larger uncertainties of crcs than the hydrological modeling approach however uncertainties of modeled crcs were likely underestimated as often only one or two of the three uncertainty sources of model parameter model input and model structure were considered in the studies based on the reviewed studies uncertainties of modeled crcs caused by the three sources are comparable to improve the understanding of crcs to streamflow in variable glacierized basins it is recommended that publications report more details on the setting up of the hydrological models the conceptualization of runoff components the terrain and climate conditions in the study basins as well as the used input data furthermore more efforts into the following three directions are encouraged 4 1 cross validation of crcs estimates from tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches table 3 compares crcs estimated by the tracer based and hydrological modeling methods in four basins indicating pronounced differences in the estimates specifically modeled snowmelt contributions in june july in the chhota shigri basin by azam et al 2019 and engelhardt et al 2017 were 65 87 which are much higher than the contributions of 17 43 estimated by the tracer based method in kumar et al 2019 in the urumqi river modeled annual and seasonal groundwater contributions were around 31 35 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b and were smaller than the groundwater contributions of 50 57 quantified by the tracer based approach chen et al 2019 sun et al 2016a whilst the modeled rainfall contributions were larger compared to estimates of the tracer based approach in the ala archa basin modeled rainfall contribution in the melting season was around 10 higher than the tracer based estimates he et al 2018 he et al 2020 modeled ice melt contribution in the melting season was 3 lower than that estimated by the tracer based method modeled and tracer based ice melt contributions were comparable in the dudh kosi basin racoviteanu et al 2013 nepal et al 2014 and 2015 the crcs differences could be partly attributed to the difference of meteorological and glacier cover conditions as well as the duration of the study periods when the corresponding studies were implemented we only found he et al 2019 compared the two methods in the same study period they found crcs estimates of the two methods were comparable when water isotope measurements were involved in the calibration of hydrological model but pronounced differences were found when the hydrological model was calibrated by discharge observation solely thus we suggest more cross validations of the two methods to reduce potential confusions on understanding the roles of runoff components in controlling the river runoff in glacierized basins the tracer based method has the advantage that tracer data are measured directly in the water sources that trigger runoff generation in the basin klaus and mcdonnell 2013 assuming water sources are well labeled before the subsequent mixing process however the tracer based method is limited to the availability of water tracer data frenierre and mark 2014 which is a serious constraint because water sampling in glacierized basins is in general difficult due to the harsh environment and logistic limitations meanwhile strong spatio temporal variability of water tracer signatures reduces the representativeness of water samples which were often collected in limited sites and short time periods penna et al 2017 schmieder et al 2018 resulting in large uncertainties in the estimation of crcs in contrast hydrological models tend to be more flexible to the data availability global gridded products of meteorological variables could be used to drive the models e g mimeau et al 2019b crcs at multiple time scales from sub daily mimeau et al 2019a daily koboltschnig et al 2008 monthly soncini et al 2016 wang et al 2019 to seasonal decadal dadic et al 2008 junghans et al 2011 simoni et al 2011 ismail and bogacki 2018 han et al 2019 singh and kumar 1997 can be estimated by hydrological models moving and mixing processes of water sources in the study basins were assumed to be physically represented in the hydrological models shrestha and nepal 2019 even though the simulated hydrological behaviors rely heavily on model concept and calibration inter comparisons of the two methods could provide multiple constraints to double check the results avoiding systematic bias in the crcs estimates caused by low representativeness of the water samples or inappropriate parameter calibration he et al 2019 cross validation of estimates from the two methods could help to improve our understanding of runoff changes and to fill the gaps between catchment experimentalists and hydrological modelers frenierre and mark 2014 4 2 reduce uncertainty using multiple datasets both tracer based and hydrological modeling methods exhibited large uncertainties of crcs considering the large uncertainty of water tracer and hydro meteorological input datasets there is hardly a unique dataset that can work well on constraining the uncertainties of crcs throughout the wide range of glacierized basins therefore one approach to reduce uncertainties of crcs could be a combined use of multiple datasets chen et al 2017b involving hydrological information such as the seasonal dominances of multiple runoff processes on river runoff and the spatio temporal variability of runoff processes in an a priori analysis of water tracer signatures could help to exclude outliers in tracer measurements for the tracer based method one of those examples is cable et al 2011 who additionally considered the spatio temporal correlations of multiple runoff processes in prior assumptions of the bayesian end member mixing approach to reduce uncertainty using water tracer data additionally for parameter calibration bears the potential to reduce uncertainties in the identification of behavioral parameters one of the alternatives is the increasingly used tracer aided hydrological model capell et al 2012 ala aho et al 2017 he et al 2019 which has demonstrated the value of water tracer data for constraining modeling uncertainties originating from both parameters and hydrological model structures however values of water tracer data for reducing uncertainty of modeled crcs in glacierized basins are still not well investigated other data sources such as snow surveys glacier field measurements remotely sensed snow glacier changes and geochemistry tracers could also be involved in the quantifications of crcs although some of these data have been used for hydrological model calibration in glacierized basins such as valentin et al 2018b integrating multiple data sources into both tracer based and hydrological modeling approaches and assessing their values for reducing uncertainties of crcs are still highly required 4 3 quantifying the effects of evapotranspiration subtraction and water transit time subtraction of actual evapotranspiration et including evaporation from open water body and soil transpiration from plants and snow ice sublimation from water components has substantial influences on the modeled crcs weiler et al 2018 to facilitate the calculation of crcs a lot of modeling studies subtracted actual et from rainfall alone e g kumar et al 2007 simoni et al 2011 pradhananga et al 2014 lutz et al 2014 fig 9 shows that about 59 of the 227 modeling basins did not specify how the actual et was subtracted in the articles in around 20 of the modeling basins the calculated actual et was fully applied to rainfall the actual et was additionally applied to snow in around 13 of the total modeling cases e g loukas et al 2002 zhang et al 2016a and adnan et al 2019 et of ice melt was taken into account in only about 5 of the modeling cases scenarios 4 and 6 e g schaper et al 1999 hagg et al 2018 ismail et al 2020 runoff coefficients were used to consider et effects in around 5 of the 227 modeling cases e g singh et al 2006 sirguey et al 2009 khadka et al 2014 gaddam et al 2018 gupta et al 2019 however no studies have assessed the effects of the different assumptions of et on the quantifications of crcs future comparative studies on the different et subtraction scenarios using the same hydrological model could serve to improve the understanding of et effects most of the tracer based studies did not take the effects of et on the quantifications of crcs into account e g kobierska et al 2015 yang et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 isotopic fractionation caused by et along the flow path from source sampling site to mixing basin outlet sites has been widely ignored frenierre and mark 2014 chen et al 2018 indicated that the isotope signature of glacier meltwater could be strongly affected by evaporation enrichment in the kaidu river basin he et al 2020 quantified the effects of et on crcs using a bayesian end member mixing approach they demonstrated that ignoring the fractionation of et likely resulted in overestimated rainfall contribution but underestimated meltwater contributions in glacierized basins meltwater samples and rain collectors are frequently collected in high altitude sites rather than near the river channel brown et al 2010 ahluwalia et al 2016 wilson et al 2016 pu et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 differences of isotopic ratios of sampled rain and meltwater and those of rain and meltwater ultimately flowing into the river are thus expected to be significant beyond that fractionation effects of water isotopic ratios caused by snowmelt and snow sublimation ala aho et al 2017 as well as the altitudinal effects on precipitation isotope signature should also be taken into account for improved quantifications of crcs furthermore transit times of melt and rain water within the basin also affect the estimated crcs to streamflow at the basin outlet gascoin et al 2011 weiler et al 2018 especially in large basins in most of the reviewed studies water transit times were not taken into account in the quantification of crcs in some cases such as he et al 2015 costa et al 2018 travel times of surface water inputs were assumed as short as a few days however transit times of rain and melt water rely on multiple factors including the soil water storage and event intensity weiler et al 2018 thus resulting in strong spatio temporal variability in glacierized basins the spatial distributions of water transit times or water ages have been appropriately quantified by tracer aided hydrological models in snowmelt dominated basins such as van huijgevoort et al 2016 ala aho et al 2017 similar applications in glacierized basins could be promising for quantifying the effects of water travel time on estimated crcs to streamflow declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

4161,irrigation discharge is a relevant water resource for lake ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions however high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the irrigation discharge raise concerns over potential lake eutrophication in these regions a delft3d hydrodynamic water quality model was used to explore the effects of multiple water sources on water quality of a large shollow lake in the semi arid west of northeast china which is surrounded by irrigated rice paddies eighteen scenarios in a combination of different precipitation rates irrigation discharge operations and flow conditions were simulated to analyze time and water allocation required in order to achieve nutrient standards of total nitrogen tn 1 5 mg l and total phosphorus tp 0 1 mg l the results showed that time required for the optimal combination to achieve nutrient management objectives displayed an increasing trend from the east to west in the best control scenario where the irrigation discharge was regulated into the lake tn and tp concentrations could be reduced by 60 and 70 respectively water diversion from a freshwater reservoir can effectively improve lake water quality even though sediment nutrient resuspension could occur in the eastern region of lake the findings suggest that using multi source water supplies can attain nutrient management objectives in order to reduce eutrophication risk for a lake that receives nutrient rich irrigation discharge the study also demonstrates the great usefulness of hydrodynamic water quality modeling for assessing water resource allocation and science based decision making in intensive agriculture practices keywords water quality multiple water source supply water diversion agricultural irrigation discharge nutrient

of the songnen plain 124 03 124 34 e 45 09 45 30 n fig 1 the lake has a total surface area of approximately 372 km2 and is shallow with an average depth of 2 5 m the area has an annual average temperature of 4 5 an annual average precipitation of about 400 mm and an annual average evaporation of 1449 mm and is therefore characterized as a semi arid cold temperate region although there is water shortage in this region riverine water resources are abundant for instance the nenjiang river and the second songhua river flowing in the region have an annual flow volume of 211 5 108 m3 and 141 4 108 m3 respectively zhang et al 2017 east of the chagan lake is a large irrigated farming land the qianguo district fig 1 therefore irrigation discharge from qianguo and natural precipitation are the two main water sources for the lake the qianguo irrigation discharge enters the lake from the chuantou weir located in the east and the lake water flows out from the liangdian weir located in the northeast the da an district is an irrigated farming land developed in 2013 west of the chagan lake fig 1 high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus with irrigation discharge flowed into the lake from the western area which resulted in the water quality transformed from chinese surface water standard iii type into v type liu et al 2019 table s2 the lake is at hypereutrophic status in

patterns in tn and tp improvement figs 4 7 several studies have demonstrated that diverting cleaner water can dilute the concentrations of nitrogen phosphorus and chlorophyll in lakes zhu et al 2008 fantin cruz et al 2016 nong et al 2020 the hadashan reservoir is 67 91 km east from the chagan lake and its water is not nutrient rich table 3 the high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the da an irrigation discharge flowed into the western of chagan lake liu et al 2019 the slowly water exchange in the western liu et al 2020a and intensely wetland purification of xinmiao at the eastern yang et al 2015 were the main reasons that both tn and tp concentrations and time required to achieve water quality control objectives displayed an increasing trend from east to west figs 4 7 reducing external nutrient loads and increasing clean diversion water were the two types of water quality restoration measures qu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 although endogenous pollution from sediment resuspension limits the water quality restoration smith et al 2005 huser et al 2016 the initial input values of our model have considered the releasement of nutrients from the sediment our study indicated that the time required to achieve the single target of tn was less than that to achieve the single target of tp and the dual nutrient np target figs 6 and 7 and table 4 reducing phosphorus should be the key problem to curb lake eutrophication schindler et al 2016 carpenter 2005 fan et al 2021 and we should provide a dual nutrient i e nitrogen and phosphorus management strategy for the chagan lake in addition the difference between the daily average concentrations of tn and tp in scenarios under multiple precipitation guarantee rates 25 50 and 75 was small the main reason for this phenomenon is that the main water source supply of the lake is irrigation discharge liu et al 2020a which is less affected by climate change 4 2 implications for water quality management zhang and others postulated that using the percentage in improvement of water quality ipwq for evaluating the effectiveness of multiple water source supply should be explored zhang et al 2016 the findings gained form this modeling study show that when the da an irrigation discharge is restricted to flow into the lake was the most beneficial to reduce the concentrations of tn and tp in the lake reduce most figs 4 7 namely 60 and 70 respectively fig 8 for the scenarios where 50 of the da an irrigation discharge or all the irrigation discharge are allowed to flow into the lake the improvement rates of tli in the lake were 24 or 27 respectively fig 9 therefore regulating da an irrigation discharge was limited to flow into the lake can be successfully used for supporting the identification of potential regulations for water allocation within a dual nutrient target lower nutrient concentrations were the premise and foundation of water diversion from the hadashan reservoir the concentrations of tn and tp of the hadashan reservoir were lower than those of the chagan lake table 2 the conventional water resources of the second songhua river through the hadashan reservoir to the chagan lake are 0 77 108 m3 a and the maximum flood resources are 0 51 108 m3 a provided by the ecological water replenishment scheme for the chagan lake in river lake connectivity project in the western jilin province zhang et al 2017 diversion water could not achieve the water quality control objectives in the scenario that all the da an irrigation discharge flowed into the lake table 5 there was 0 84 108 m3 a 0 99 108 m3 a diversion water required in the scenario that 1 2 da an irrigation discharge flowed into the lake which was more than the conventional water resources the maximum diversion water 0 72 108 m3 a for the scenario when da an irrigation discharge to the lake was limited was less than the conventional water resources hence the scenario that the da an irrigation discharge was limited to flow into the lake was the best scheme coupling with the ipwq results however the water quality could not improve quickly by the single point multiple water source supply in the western and middle areas figs 6 7 and table 4 multi directional water diversion could accelerate water exchange and mass transport rasmussen et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 therefore we recommend a multi point and multiple water source supply strategy for water quality improvement in all lake another water diversion project should be introduced to the western chagan lake 4 3 conclusions this study developed a coupled hydrodynamic water quality model to assess under which water allocation scheme dual nutrient n p management objectives can be attainable for a large lake in the semi arid west of northeast china this lake is surrounded by intensively managed rice paddies and receives nutrient rich irrigation discharge the model was applied to 18 scenarios made in a combination of three irrigation discharge schemes two outflow designs and three precipitation rates based on the findings the main conclusions can be drawn 1 water diversion is the most effective approach to attain the dual nutrient management objective for the chagan lake 2 limiting external nutrient input from irrigation discharge water is fundamental to reducing nutrient levels in the lake and 3 coupling water diversion with reducing irrigation discharge can not only improve the current water quality condition but is also a manageable and sustainable solution for maintaining the health of the lake furthermore the study demonstrates the great usefulness of hydrodynamic water quality modeling for assessing water resource allocation and science based decision making in intensive agriculture practices credit authorship

4161,irrigation discharge is a relevant water resource for lake ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions however high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the irrigation discharge raise concerns over potential lake eutrophication in these regions a delft3d hydrodynamic water quality model was used to explore the effects of multiple water sources on water quality of a large shollow lake in the semi arid west of northeast china which is surrounded by irrigated rice paddies eighteen scenarios in a combination of different precipitation rates irrigation discharge operations and flow conditions were simulated to analyze time and water allocation required in order to achieve nutrient standards of total nitrogen tn 1 5 mg l and total phosphorus tp 0 1 mg l the results showed that time required for the optimal combination to achieve nutrient management objectives displayed an increasing trend from the east to west in the best control scenario where the irrigation discharge was regulated into the lake tn and tp concentrations could be reduced by 60 and 70 respectively water diversion from a freshwater reservoir can effectively improve lake water quality even though sediment nutrient resuspension could occur in the eastern region of lake the findings suggest that using multi source water supplies can attain nutrient management objectives in order to reduce eutrophication risk for a lake that receives nutrient rich irrigation discharge the study also demonstrates the great usefulness of hydrodynamic water quality modeling for assessing water resource allocation and science based decision making in intensive agriculture practices keywords water quality multiple water source supply water diversion agricultural irrigation discharge nutrient

2013a zhang et al 2016 in arid and semi arid regions irrigation discharge from the paddy fields can be an important water source for lakes however irrigation discharges often carry high nitrogen and phosphorus loads processing the risk of deteriorating water quality of the receiving water bodies conley et al 2009 schindler et al 2016 to reduce the risk diverting water from other sources while regulating irrigation discharge can be an important approach for agriculture sustainable development and freshwater ecosystems restoration in arid and semi arid areas to evaluate reservoir diversion effects on water quality of lakes that receive agricultural irrigation discharge we conducted a modeling study for the chagan lake located in the semi arid west of northeast china the delft3d model has been widely used in the hydrodynamic and water quality simulation of large shallow lakes which can analyze pollutant transport janssen et al 2017 wang et al 2019 koshelev et al 2021 the chagan lake has an open water surface of 372 km2 is completely surrounded by paddy fields and receives irrigation discharge as its main water source liu et al 2019 a recent study found high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the irrigation discharge resulting in increasingly severe lake eutrophication liu et al 2020a as one of the ten largest freshwater lakes and one of the most important freshwater fisheries bases in china this has raised concerns over water quality degradation in the recent years the clean diversion water was transferred from the hadashan reservoir to the chagan lake to maintain ecosystem health relying on river lake connectivity project in the western jilin province a coupled 2d hydrodynamic model with the water quality model in this study has been calibrated against the measurements in 2018 and 2019 in the previous study liu et al 2020b the hydrodynamic model provided flow rates and physical transport processes related to the pollutants to the 2d water

of the songnen plain 124 03 124 34 e 45 09 45 30 n fig 1 the lake has a total surface area of approximately 372 km2 and is shallow with an average depth of 2 5 m the area has an annual average temperature of 4 5 an annual average precipitation of about 400 mm and an annual average evaporation of 1449 mm and is therefore characterized as a semi arid cold temperate region although there is water shortage in this region riverine water resources are abundant for instance the nenjiang river and the second songhua river flowing in the region have an annual flow volume of 211 5 108 m3 and 141 4 108 m3 respectively zhang et al 2017 east of the chagan lake is a large irrigated farming land the qianguo district fig 1 therefore irrigation discharge from qianguo and natural precipitation are the two main water sources for the lake the qianguo irrigation discharge enters the lake from the chuantou weir located in the east and the lake water flows out from the liangdian weir located in the northeast the da an district is an irrigated farming land developed in 2013 west of the chagan lake fig 1 high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus with irrigation discharge flowed into the lake from the western area which resulted in the water quality transformed from chinese surface water standard iii type into v type liu et al 2019 table s2 the lake is at hypereutrophic status in

potential regulations for water allocation within a dual nutrient target lower nutrient concentrations were the premise and foundation of water diversion from the hadashan reservoir the concentrations of tn and tp of the hadashan reservoir were lower than those of the chagan lake table 2 the conventional water resources of the second songhua river through the hadashan reservoir to the chagan lake are 0 77 108 m3 a and the maximum flood resources are 0 51 108 m3 a provided by the ecological water replenishment scheme for the chagan lake in river lake connectivity project in the western jilin province zhang et al 2017 diversion water could not achieve the water quality control objectives in the scenario that all the da an irrigation discharge flowed into the lake table 5 there was 0 84 108 m3 a 0 99 108 m3 a diversion water required in the scenario that 1 2 da an irrigation discharge flowed into the lake which was more than the conventional water resources the maximum diversion water 0 72 108 m3 a for the scenario when da an irrigation discharge to the lake was limited was less than the conventional water resources hence the scenario that the da an irrigation discharge was limited to flow into the lake was the best scheme coupling with the ipwq results however the water quality could not improve quickly by the single point multiple water source supply in the western and middle areas figs 6 7 and table 4 multi directional water diversion could accelerate water exchange and mass transport rasmussen et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 therefore we recommend a multi point and multiple water source supply strategy for water quality improvement in all lake another water diversion project should be introduced to the western chagan lake 4 3 conclusions this study developed a coupled hydrodynamic water quality model to assess under which water allocation scheme dual nutrient n p management objectives can be attainable for a large lake in the semi arid west of northeast china this lake is surrounded by intensively managed rice paddies and receives nutrient rich irrigation discharge the model was applied to 18 scenarios made in a combination of three irrigation discharge schemes two outflow designs and three precipitation rates based on the findings the main conclusions can be drawn 1 water diversion is the most effective approach to attain the dual nutrient management objective for the chagan lake 2 limiting external nutrient input from irrigation discharge water is fundamental to reducing nutrient levels in the lake and 3 coupling water diversion with reducing irrigation discharge can not only improve the current water quality condition but is also a manageable and sustainable solution for maintaining the health of the lake furthermore the study demonstrates the great usefulness of hydrodynamic water quality modeling for assessing water resource allocation and science based decision making in intensive agriculture practices credit authorship

4162,the temperature distribution in coastal aquifers is determined by the effect of different heat sources surface water recharge sea infiltration and geothermal heat in previous studies the signal generated in groundwater by each source was individually studied and in the case of geothermal heat it was often not considered this research is the first in considering all possible sources of heat in a coastal aquifer simultaneously by using a combination of field data and numerical modeling to present a reference model based on the characteristics of a real aquifer the position of the freshwater saltwater interface fsi and its effect on temperature distribution have been modeled considering variable density flow coupled heat and solute transport this study broadens the theoretical knowledge of temperature distribution in coastal aquifers based on a sensitivity analysis of hydraulic and thermic parameters furthermore a case study the motril salobreña aquifer was modeled with field data calibration to test the applicability to real aquifers the new insights gained through this study provide integrated knowledge of the temperature distribution in coastal areas and establish the basis for future research using heat as a tracer in seaside aquifers keywords heat transport numerical modeling geothermal gradient saltwater intrusion temperature fluctuations 1 introduction the use of heat as a groundwater tracer is growing in popularity and it has been extended in a wide range of hydrogeological studies anderson 2005 heat and solute transport have many similarities demarsily 1986 bear 1972 hopmans et al 2002 which is the reason heat has been used as a tracer in groundwater systems however there are also differences in their behavior vandenbohede et al 2009 ma et al 2012 due to the thermal exchange between water and aquifer solids which depends on the heat properties of both bakker et al 2015 this reflects a time delay of heat transport with respect to solute transport for this reason understanding the different aspects involved in both processes is important when including both solute transport and heat transport in the same model traditionally the direct relationship of density and viscosity with temperature has been ignored in hydrogeological modeling because of its negligible effect over the results of variable density models nevertheless there is a broad area of research in groundwater systems where temperature is considered to play a significant role e g sole source aquifers and coastal aquifer ocean interactions thorne et al 2006 vandenbohede and van houtte 2012 befus et al 2013 debnath et al 2005 studies about groundwater surface water interaction have shown that thermal distribution in the aquifer can indicate the degree of connection with rivers that has seasonal and daily temperature fluctuations constantz 1998 duque et al 2010 keery et al 2007 lautz 2012 mccallum et al 2014 sebok et al 2015 recharge processes can have an impact on temperature of the surficial zone of the aquifer to a maximum depth of a few tens of meters as a consequence of atmospheric temperature pollack and huang 2000 smerdon et al 2003 variations in environmental temperature produce groundwater temperature fluctuations due to the effect of cooling or heating of the surface water before infiltration pollack et al 2005 duque et al 2010 the amplitude of fluctuations decreases with depth silliman and booth 1993 kurylyk et al 2013 as a result the thermal signal has been used in analytical and numerical solutions to estimate groundwater recharge discharge rates suzuki 1960 bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 stallman 1965 rushton 2007 duque et al 2016 taniguchi et al 1999 calvache et al 2011 and kurylyk et al 2019 have described how the shape of temperature profiles is connected with discharge and recharge areas apart from the surficial zone where temperature is affected by recharge and air temperature aquifers can be affected by the geothermal gradient parsons 1970 temperature profiles within the geothermal zone are unaffected by seasonal variations and adopt a linear trend anderson 2005 domenico and palciauskas 1973 indicated that the distribution of groundwater temperature can be disturbed by groundwater flow and stallman 1963 suggested that it depends directly on the velocity and direction of water flow the geothermal gradient is greater in groundwater discharge areas than in recharge areas tóth 1962 domenico and palciauskas 1973 an et al 2015 which results from the fact that a hot upwelling is forced by convection within the discharge zone szijártó et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity also plays an important role in the geothermal gradient due to the high degree of convective heat transport with large hydraulic conductivity values an et al 2015 other parameters such as anisotropy heterogeneity recharge rate and the position of the water table have an important influence on the magnitude of the disturbance parsons 1970 smith and chapman 1983 woodbury and smith 1988 forster and smith 1989 the groundwater flow pattern of coastal aquifers was initially studied in the 1950 s and 1960 s glover 1959 kohout 1964 the intrusion of saline water into the deepest part of aquifers disturbs the freshwater flow due to the difference in density of the two fluids groundwater originated by recharge inland flows vertically upward resulting in fresh terrestrial submarine groundwater discharge sgd across the seafloor between land and sea this process is intimately associated with the location of the freshwater saltwater interface fsi and has been studied along many coasts of the world kinnear et al 2013 eissa et al 2018 duque et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 despite good knowledge about coastal areas few studies have investigated heat distribution a series of papers by the u s geological survey usgs in the 1960s hypothesized the existence of seawater circulation intensified by temperature induced density gradients in a carbonate platform in southern of florida kohout 1965 kohout 1967 henry and kohout 1972 kohout et al 1977 they hypothesized that infiltrated cold seawater could be heated by geothermal heat driving to an open cycle thermal convection in addition to variable density effects subsequently henry and kohout 1972 tested kohout s thermal convection with a laboratory experiment cold saltwater and warm freshwater were introduced in a glass tank with sand for the first time a laboratory experiment represented combined solute and heat transport and their effects on flow patterns were represented in porous media the henry and hilleke problem was modeled with different numerical codes such as sutra ms hughes et al 2007 seawat dausman et al 2010 and hst3d thorne et al 2006 showing very similar results among them the same benchmark problem was used to simulate this physical experiment with seawat but also included variable density groundwater flow langevin et al 2010 nevertheless there are only a few studies that support their hypothesis with field measurements such as kim et al 2008 2009 who described the dynamics within the freshwater saltwater interface in a volcanic island with a geothermal gradient the vertical logs in boreholes situated close to the coastline in an aquifer in southeastern of spain molina et al 2002 did not show a normal increase in temperature with depth but revealed a sharp decrease in temperature at 160 m depth due to the entry of cooler seawater into the aquifer furthermore time series data of electrical conductivity and temperature at different depths showed variations due to two external influences tidal fluctuation and recharge produced by rainfall beyond this vandenbohede and lebbe 2011 observed yearly fluctuations in temperature in the surficial zone of a shallow detrital coastal aquifer and developed a density dependent model to simulate how yearly temperature oscillations influence the distribution of groundwater temperature they concluded that the thickness of the surficial zone and the amplitude of the temperature oscillations are dependent on the conduction convection dominance on heat transport in most cases research has focused on either surficial temperature processes vandenbohede and lebbe 2011 befus et al 2013 debnath et al 2005 tirado conde et al 2019 or geothermal effects taniguchi 2000 taniguchi et al 1999 as the distance between these effects hinders the exchange between them in coastal aquifers the circulation patterns generated due to variable density of the fluid and the hydrodynamic dispersion can facilitate the interaction between shallow and deep groundwater but research has been limited thus far to a few theoretical e g thorne et al 2006 langevin et al 2007 2008 2010 or field measurements in all the depth of shallow aquifers but without detection of geothermal gradient e g folch et al 2020 the difficulties in obtaining temperature data in deep zones of coastal areas originate the scarcity of research focused on the geothermal effect this paper shows the temperature distribution in coastal aquifers distinguishes the different thermal zones that can be found in coastal areas and takes into consideration constant or variable temperature sources over for this purpose and due to the scarcity of information in the scientific literature a numerical model was developed to propose a generic synthetic theoretical model of temperature distribution in coastal aquifers a detailed sensitivity analysis was applied to different parameters and properties for a range of realistic values in the study area the results established the basis for the understanding of heat distribution for diverse types of coastal aquifers furthermore the acquired knowledge was tested with field data obtained in the coastal aquifer of motril salobreña making it one of the few studies that combined heat modeling with temperature field data obtained near the discharge zone 2 research area 2 1 hydrogeological setting the motril salobreña detrital aquifer is located on the southeastern coast of spain in the province of granada fig 1 a it has an area of 42 km2 and its thickness varies from 30 to 50 m in the north to more than 250 m in the south duque et al 2008 the aquifer is composed mostly of gravel sand silt and clay of quaternary age that overlay a very low permeability basement consisting of schist and phyllite fig 1c the hydraulic conductivity of the materials is widely variable calvache et al 2015 due to the fluvial deltaic depositional environment of the aquifer in the vicinity of the mouth of the guadalfeo river the upper layers of the aquifer are characterized by gravel layers characterized by high hydraulic conductivity however the ratio diminishes dramatically at a depth of 140 m due to the prevalence of clay layers fig 1c numerical and sedimentological studies have estimated values of hydraulic conductivities which ranged from 12 to 300 m d calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2018 the general flow direction in the aquifer is from north to south toward the mediterranean sea with a hydraulic gradient estimated between 1 6 10 3 and 5 10 3 duque et al 2010 although currently it reaches 7 10 3 in the northern part of the aquifer the main water entrance to the aquifer is supplied by the guadalfeo river which provides direct infiltration along the riverbed and indirect infiltration from irrigation return flows estimated at 11 mm3 year and 16 mm3 year respectively calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2011 in the study area several wells were drilled from north to south w10 w250 w60 and w180 at distances of 285 m 300 m 700 m and 1900 m from the shoreline fig 1b w10 w60 and w180 are three full screened wells 10 m 60 m and 180 m deep respectively and w250 is a deep well 250 m deep with one screen that is 6 m and 11 screens that are 3 m each at the depths indicated in fig 1c w250 is an artesian well with an average flow of 18 l s providing evidence of the presence of vertical flows in this area of the aquifer calvache et al 2015 according to the flow pattern of the discharge zone proposed by glover 1959 and kohout 1964 for a coastal aquifer duque et al 2008 indicated slight marine intrusion in the aquifer by using gravitational and electromagnetic sounding methods which were supported by the low electrical conductivity ec data obtained in w180 additionally well w250 intersected the fsi which was approximately 135 200 m deep calvache et al 2015 the area is characterized by a subtropical climate with scarce rainfall and mild temperature the average precipitation is 420 mm year and the mean annual temperature is 18 c the mean air temperature follows a regular pattern each year a maximum of 25 c in july august and a minimum of 10 12 c in january february duque et al 2010 a similar pattern was observed in the temperature of water in the river with almost identical values to the atmospheric temperature but with an approximate delay of 1 month on the other hand the mediterranean sea in this area is characterized by a warm temperature that fluctuates between a maximum of 24 c in august and a minimum of 14 c in february data supplied by the state harbors spanish ministry of development the temperature pattern in the upper section of the aquifer and in the proximity of the fsi was disturbed due to the influence of the thermal signal from the river duque et al 2010 and the influence of the sea temperature respectively the collected data from well w180 represented the vertical heat distribution in the motril salobreña aquifer fig 2 three zones can be identified the surficial zone intermediate zone and deep zone the surficial zone is subject to seasonal changes in temperature the intermediate zone does not have any significant seasonal variations and remains practically constant the deep zone has a constant increase in temperature due to geothermal heat 2 2 temperature conceptual model the conceptual model fig 3 was created from the field data information the measurements obtained in w180 fig 2 were used to establish the initial temperature distribution within the freshwater domain a surficial zone 23 m deep with an oscillating thermal signal could be distinguished due to infiltration of the river flow and air temperature influence below the surficial zone the intermediate zone is differentiated because temperature had no oscillations and remained at 17 2 c until a depth of approximately 110 m in the deep zone an increment in temperature of 0 02 c per meter was calculated which represents 20 c at 250 m the temperature of the sea oscillated seasonally in the same manner as the temperature of the river flow this conceptualization was used for assigning boundary conditions in the numerical model and temperature and head measurements in w10 w250 and w60 were used for calibration and verification of the model 3 methodology 3 1 solute and heat transport equation numerical model and model indicators in the present study seawat v 4 langevin et al 2007 was used to simulate simultaneous multispecies solute and heat transport this software couples modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and solves the following form of the variable density groundwater flow equation 1 1 ρ b k d k θ θ c k t θ d m k α q θ c k q c k q s c s k where ρ b is the bulk density mass of the solids divided by the total volume ml 3 k d k is the distribution coefficient of species k l3m 1 θ is porosity c k is the concentration of

source or sink concentration ml 3 of species k dimensions include length l mass m time t and temperature t temperature is represented as one of the species of mt3dms given that heat transport is analogous to solute transport in groundwater modeling thorne et al 2006 adapted equation 1 to assign suitable thermal parameters for temperature species 2 1 1 θ θ ρ s ρ c psolid c pfluid θ t t θ k

source temperature t bulk density is calculated by ρ b ρ s 1 θ equations 1 and 2 show that heat transport is controlled by convection and conduction which are mathematically equivalent to advection and diffusion for solute transport respectively both transport equations incorporate a retardation term the adsorption of solutes by the aquifer matrix generates retardation in solute transport whereas the thermal transfer between the fluid and solid aquifer matrix produces retardation in heat transport a linear sorption isotherm was applied to the model to represent the thermal retardation by calculating the distribution coefficient k d for temperature species 3 k d t c psolid ρ c pfluid the thermal conduction term for temperature species d m t l2 t is mathematically equivalent to

1 θ k tsolid thermal dispersion in heat transport is frequently ignored in most analytical solutions langevin et al 2010 because heat conduction often dominates thermal dispersion in heat transport anderson 2005 ferguson 2007 however seawat version 4 includes the thermal dispersion term in the code formulation therefore it has been included in our models to interpret the temperature distribution within the aquifer and to quantitatively compare the model results we used the following indicators 1 d b tc i is the vertical distance from the aquifer basement to each thermal contour 6 d b tc i z b z tc i 2 r is the dimensionless factor obtained from the division of the vertical distance from sea surface level to each thermal contour and the location of the arbitrary observation point 7 r z sl z tc i x obs where i is the temperature of the thermal contour t z b is the elevation of the aquifer basement l using sea level as a reference z tc i is the elevation of the thermal contour l using sea level as a reference z sl is the elevation of sea level l and x obs is the position of the observation point on the x axis l the root mean squared error rmse was calculated on the basis of the comparison of the observed data with the field measurements the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean squared error rmse were calculated on the basis of the comparison of the observed data with the field measurements r 2 1 t m t s t m t rmse 1 n i 1 n t m t s 2 where t m is the measured temperature t t s is the simulated temperature t t is the mean of the temperature values t and n is the number of observations 3 2 field data four research wells were used to study the temperature distribution of the aquifer vertical temperature profiles were logged monthly at w180 and w60 and sporadically at w250 using the multiparameter probe kll q 2 accuracy 0 1 c resolution 0 01 c during the period 2005 2019 in w180 the profiles were obtained by measuring every five meters throughout the well in w250 the measurement points of the logs were taken at the depths of the 12 screens fig 1c in w60 the observation points of the logs were obtained every 5 m to a depth of 20 m in w10 one pressure temperature sensor was installed at a 5 m depth to measure at 1 hour intervals seametrics levelscout smart pressure sensors accuracy 0 1 c and resolution 0 01 c the collection of temperature profiles is subject to uncertainties water circulation inside the casing of the well affects the temperature distribution and the measurements could not be an exact replica of temperature into the aquifer however as the objective of this research was to focus on the major trends and general dynamics this limitation was considered acceptable other methodologies to collect temperature profiles such as fiber optic distributed temperature sensing fo dts directly inserted in the aquifer sediments prevent the problem of water circulation inside wells del val et al 2021 but it requires specific design and construction of the monitoring system instead of using boreholes already drilled the temperature dataset of the mediterranean sea was supplied from monthly mean temperature by the state harbors spanish ministry of development on the coast at málaga this station was chosen because it was closer to the research area 75 km west and because climatic conditions were practically the same the same mean monthly temperature and mean precipitation the measurement device was a triaxys directional wave buoy that measures temperature 0 5 m below the sea surface and provides real time data via radio to a land station with hourly cadence 3 3 numerical model characteristics the temperature distribution within the coastal aquifer was modeled with a finite difference 2d model using seawat which solved the variable density groundwater flow and heat transport equations the 2d model cross section was 8 5 km long x axis of which 5 km were landward and 3 5 km seaward from the coastline and 100 m wide y axis the depth of the model z axis varied from 150 m in the south offshore boundary to 290 m deep in the north onshore boundary the topography of the aquifer and seabed had slopes of 0 8 and 2 8 respectively based on a groundwater age model of the study area calvache et al 2020 and the seabed bathymetric information jabaloy sánchez et al 2014 the grid was defined based on a mesh with 124 rows and 22 layers with cells of 85 12 m it was refined near the fsi area 42 12 m and surface area 42 6 m these dimensions of the model were applied to the case study model and for the sensitivity analysis however depth topography and basement were modified to test how the size of the model affects the temperature distribution the flow was solved using the pre conditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver the solution method for the advective term of the transport equation was the generalized conjugate gradient gcg solver with jacobi pre conditioner the courant number used was 0 75 the simulation of models 1 and 2 requires between 1000 and 1600 years to reach the steady state conditions however simulation of the model 3 was run during 15 years for the boundary conditions the basement of the aquifer and the left border were defined as a nonflow boundary neumann boundary condition in the sea bed and right boundary constant hydraulic heads and salinities were defined dirichlet boundary condition with respect to the thermal boundary conditions temperature recorded data from w180 were used to establish them on the other hand temperature measurements of w60 w250 and w10 were used to calibrate the study model the workflow with the numerical models included a sensitivity analysis and a real case simulation sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of model parameters on heat transport in coastal aquifers to reproduce the field observations with the real case study model specific site characteristics obtained from previous studies duque et al 2008 duque et al 2018 sánchez úbeda et al 2018a and fieldwork were considered such as aquifer geometry hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity and hydraulic gradient in the process three different models models 1 2 and 3 were constructed addressing the different purposes and the boundary conditions were modified for each of them fig 4 and table 1 4 results 4 1 temperature distribution an initial synthetic cross section of the temperature distribution of a coastal aquifer was obtained based on model 2 which was compared with model 1 fig 5 the hydraulic conductivity used was kx 1 and the anisotropic ratio kx kz 10 and the boundary conditions and the rest of the input parameters are specified in fig 4 and table 1 groundwater temperature increases with depth due to the geothermal gradient however temperature propagation and thermal contours are bent because of the change in flow direction fig 5a generating a hotter temperature plume along the fsi at deeper locations in the aquifer fresh groundwater is forced to ascend toward the sea due to the presence of the salt wedge which implies greater heat transport than other parts of the aquifer where convection is less important in turn temperature also affects the position of the fsi when adding temperature to the model comparing model 1 and model 2 the fsi width changed but it also rotated and moved its toe inland fig 5b the fsi toe moved tens of meters when temperature difference between the surface and basement is 1 c for our case study however it is also highly dependent on the aquifer properties in general an increase of temperature difference will favor the encroachment of seawater this is consistent with henry and kohout 1972 and langevin et al 2010 who indicated that convective cells are stronger when density is affected by temperature groundwater is heated at the bottom of the aquifer rises because of the combination of the effect of the saline wedge and the buoyancy effect in warmer water and saltwater replaces the heated upward water 4 2 sensitivity analysis heat transport is controlled by different parameters hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity thermal distribution coefficient thermal diffusivity hydraulic gradient thermal boundary seafloor slope and depth of the basement sensitivity analysis of the variable density groundwater flow and heat transport model showed the impact of each parameter on thermal distribution the sensitivity analysis was focused on heat transport within the deep zone of each model and especially around the area of the fsi thus modeling of this section consisted of a variable density model with geothermal heat input fig 4 the value of the parameters was changed for a range based on realistic values obtained in the literature specified in table 1 the assignation of maximum mean and minimum values to each parameter aimed to cover those parameters with scarce information and to show the differences associated with the natural variability in aquifers homogeneous conditions were assumed with a hydraulic conductivity of kx 1 m d a kx kz ratio of 10 and the input parameter values of table 1 except for the parameter that was tested in each case 4 2 1 hydraulic conductivity four sets of hydraulic conductivities were tested obtained from the literature calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2017 two with a lower hydraulic conductivity kx 1 m d and changing anisotropic ratios kx kz of 1 and 10 and two with higher hydraulic conductivity kx 300 m d and anisotropic ratios kx kz of 1 and 10 the resulting temperature distribution of the different scenarios showed changes in the order of magnitude of hundreds of meters depending on the value of the hydraulic conductivity fig 6 lower hydraulic conductivity generated thermal contours distributed parallel to the base of the aquifer while higher values related to more changes in the section anisotropy played a more important role in the area where the flow components were more vertical that is along the zone where the fsi is located high hydraulic conductivities 300 m d produced a sharper rise in the thermal plume than low hydraulic conductivities 1 m d anisotropy of kx kz 10 generated a higher horizontal than vertical component hindering vertical heat transport and flattening the thermal contours anisotropy favored the horizontal flow thereby displacing the fsi seawards and the thermal plume was affected in the same manner due to the direct relationship with the fsi this test indicates that the anisotropy can cause a change on an order of magnitude of tens of meters in the thermal distribution under the boundary conditions selected 4 2 2 porosity θ the sensitivity of temperature to porosity was evaluated by introducing two extreme values 0 2 and 0 6 to the model obtained from the literature freeze and cherry 1979 although the depth of the thermal contours was very similar for both cases there were slight differences in the shape of the isothermal lines fig 7a for θ 0 6 the thermal contours became flattened and therefore the geothermal gradient was practically the same for any observation point on the x axis for θ 0 2 the thermal plume was slightly higher likewise the fsi varied depending on the porosity value for θ 0 6 the fsi was narrower in the upper area in comparison with a θ 0 2 this indicates that a reduction in porosity is related to higher advective transport hence the buoyancy effect is larger which causes a modification in the upper part of the fsi fresh groundwater discharge zone and consequently in the temperature distribution nevertheless the effect of this parameter is very reduced considering the range of values tested for the range of porosities commonly found in real aquifers the differences would be minor 4 2 3 dispersivity α both salinity dispersivity and thermal dispersivity were considered as they are modeled in an analogous manner demarsily 1986 therefore they have the same value bridger and allen 2010 engelhardt et al 2013 the thermal dispersivity of aquifers usually ranges from 0 1 to 100 m stauffer et al 2014 the three values for the dispersivity tensor α were considered based on the dimensions of the model 1 m 50 m and 100 m the temperature profiles obtained 300 m from the coastline showed that higher dispersivity α 100 m increased temperature throughout the entire thickness of the aquifer fig 7b as the heat effect from the geothermal source of heat can spread more easily for α 1 m the trend of the temperature profile was more concave whereas temperature increased more linearly with depth for α 100 m when thermal dispersivity played a more important role in heat transport heat convection decreased hence weaker convection and thus dispersivity dominant heat transfer produced a linear increase in temperature as demonstrated by an et al 2015 the temperature difference reached more than 1 c which had significant relevance in the comparison with other parameters a dispersivity of approximately 100 can move water with a temperature of 18 c upwards to the shallow part of the aquifer this has not been possible to reach with the sensitivity analysis of the other parameters 4 2 4 thermal distribution coefficient k d t k d t was estimated with equation 3 applying maximum minimum and mean values of c psolid for rocks and minerals reported in the literature schärli and rybach 2001 clauser 2011 the resulting values of k d t were 2 3 10 7 1 27 10 7 and 2 3 10 8 l mg the sensitivity analysis showed variations up to tens of meters in the distance from the basement to the thermal contours d b tci fig 8 a a low value of k d t 2 3 10 8 l mg generated a greater d b tci i e a further propagation of the thermal signal compared with higher values of k d t the shallowest thermal contour 18 c was the one with greater displacement from the basement when changing the values of k d t these results are consistent with the fact that k d t works as a retardation coefficient that causes the temperature changes to be slower than the linear flow velocity langevin et al 2008 if more heat is necessary to increase the sediment temperature the retardation of heat transport will increase ma et al 2012 k d t had no direct effect on the salinity distribution but did on the heat distribution therefore the fsi can be affected by the buoyancy effect however the changes were so small that they were not appreciable in these simulations 4 2 5 thermal diffusivity d m t the thermal diffusivity d m t was calculated with equations 4 and 5 using the given value of k tsolid the maximum and minimum values and a middle value of k tsolid were estimated for different lithologies and were obtained from xiaoqing et al 2018 the values assigned to d m t were 0 3 0 15 and 0 06 m2 d corresponding to dolomites marlstone and mudstones respectively the results of each simulation were observed in different locations of the model and represented with the r parameter fig 8b modification of the values of d m t produced a greater variability in r for the thermal contour of 18 c in contrast r did not change for the thermal contour of 20 c when changing d m t for d m t 0 06 the r value can reach 24 higher than that for d m t 0 3 as is the case of the thermal contour of 18 c observed at xobs 100 m just as k d t the thermal contour of 18 c showed larger changes than the rest of the temperatures due to the greater vertical component of the flow at this depth the variation in the fsi position was so small that it could not be detected while testing the different values of d m t 4 2 6 hydraulic gradient δh the hydraulic gradient in aquifers is a variable parameter in time and space seasonal oscillation in recharge conditions can modify it in short periods the impact on heat transfer was tested with a range between 0 003 and 0 007 from the lateral inflow the constant head of the sea boundary was maintained at 0 and only the constant head of the freshwater boundary was changed from 15 m to 35 m these changes were on the same order of magnitude as observed in the motril salobreña aquifer during the last 20 years duque et al 2010 δh changed the distribution of salinity moving the fsi hundreds of meters and temperature by changing the pattern fig 9 for δh 0 007 the fsi was positioned more seaward and vertical and the temperature transport had a higher vertical component throughout the entire model compared with the results for δh 0 003 additionally the thermal plume in the discharge zone moved seaward and had a more pointy shape 4 2 7 thermal boundary the effect of the input of geothermal heat was tested based on different rates as the geothermal gradient increased 1 c per 20 to 40 m of depth anderson 2005 and the model was 250 m deep the highest temperature difference between the surface and basement δt was 13 c additionally a δt of 6 c and 2 c were also tested as the shallow part of the aquifer was assigned 17 2 c the basement of the model was 30 c 23 c and 19 c the δt was compared with the temperature distribution at different depths 30 m 100 m 160 m and 230 m at 300 m fig 10 a the point where the resultant lines intersected the x axis represented the temperature of a homoeothermic aquifer in which temperature would be homogeneous regardless of depth δt 13 c produced an increase in temperature in the shallowest observation point 30 m of 3 c with respect to the homoeothermic aquifer there were small changes in the fsi position for higher δt the fsi had more verticality a few meters seaward of the fsi toe and was wider than for smaller δt although there were no large differences 4 2 8 seafloor slope sfs the seafloor geometry of the model was tested in order to study its relevance on temperature distribution the different slope values used were 2 8 based on the estimated value for the motril salobreña aquifer by bathymetric techniques jabaloy sánchez et al 2014 and a minimum and maximum values of 0 and 5 respectively to take account of other possible sfs representative of more study areas fig 10b the starting point of the slope was the coastline and the continental topography was not changed regarding previous models for sfs 5 the thermal contour had a larger r parameter in comparison with the rest of the inclinations which indicates that the isotherms ascended less for sfs 5 the r value can reach 9 higher than that for sfs 0 as is the case of the thermal contour of 18 c observed at xobs 100 m the thermal contour of 18 c as it was located at a shallower location in the aquifer was more affected by the change in slope than the other isotherms and this sector had greater vertical flow components thus the higher the seafloor slope is the lower the elevation of the thermal contour moreover the slope of the seafloor had an impact on the position of the fsi for sfs 5 the fsi is less vertical and its toe is situated a few meters seaward than for sfs 0 4 2 9 model basement depth mbd three model basement depths mbd 100 m 500 m and 1000 m were considered fig 10c although an increase in depth is usually associated with a major geothermal gradient the temperature of the basement boundary was the same for all cases since the target was to understand their influence separately the results showed important variations in the distance from the basement to the thermal contours d b tci for example for d b tc18 c the difference between a model of 100 and 1000 m was almost 40 m 4 3 case study model the model had the same structure as the model used for sensitivity analysis but the parameters were adjusted based on the local knowledge of the areas table 1 horizontal layers without lateral facies changes were defined as this is the major sedimentary architecture of the aquifer smaller scale heterogeneity was not introduced to focus on major aspects of the thermal distribution hydraulic conductivity was initially defined based on previous studies calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2018 and the lithological core of w250 fig 1 model results were compared with the field measurements of temperature and salinity in w10 w250 and w60 for temperature boundary conditions a fixed temperature 20 05 c was assigned to the base of the aquifer based on the expected temperature at 250 m due to the linear temperature increment in w180 fig 2 temperature of the right boundary freshwater entry was 16 7 c which is an approximate value for temperature in the intermediate zone the temperature oscillation assigned to the seafloor fluctuated between 14 and 24 c at the surface boundary a constant recharge of 5000 mm yr was assigned that represented the river inflow to the aquifer as the observation wells were all located at a maximum distance of a few tens of meters from the trace of the river the temperature of this recharge was a sinus function according to the seasonal oscillation of the river water temperature 12 26 c duque et al 2010 in the calibration hydraulic conductivity of the different layers was adjusted as well as temperature in the right boundary and in the recharge these changes were minor adjustments as still the boundary conditions were coherent with the field measurements i e temperature value of the right boundary was modified to 16 7 c from 17 2 c additionally the adjusted recharge was four times smaller than that estimated in previous studies the model was run for a total of 15 years to give enough time to reach the semistability which was reached in the 9th year of simulation from this time the fsi position and geothermal heat were in steady state and the temperature of the surficial zone and saltwater had repeated seasonal oscillations annually the results displayed below correspond once the steady state condition had been reached the coefficient of determination r2 of the calculated rating curves was 0 81 and the rmse was 0 37 c the vertical profiles of temperature at x 300 m are displayed with the field data obtained from w250 fig 11 a the differences in the first few meters correspond with the seasonal temperature oscillation from 50 m these differences were buffered indicating that recharge had no influence however in the field data temporal variations were observed when w250 intersected the fsi from 150 m this issue is discussed in the next section there is a strong connection between hydraulic conductivity values of the model table 2 and temperature distribution the intermediate zone of the temperature profiles was related to a layer with high hydraulic conductivity layer 2 this suggested that the temperature distribution is strongly dependent on the geology of the study area the seasonal temperature oscillation in the surficial part of the aquifer was analyzed by the temperature logs at x 700 m fig 11b and compared with the envelopes of the field logs measured in w60 the results ranged between 17 3 and 19 1 c and were between the maximum and minimum envelopes 16 4 19 6 c and had very similar shapes the profile with the minimum value was slightly lower than the minimum field measurement the thermal signal obtained at 5 m at x 285 m demonstrated that the model was able to simulate seasonal oscillations fig 11c the sensor installed in w10 showed temperature oscillations with a maximum of 20 c in december and a minimum of 17 5 c in may and the simulated temperature oscillated from 17 3 to 19 3 c therefore the maximum value was slightly lower than the observed value for temperature distribution near the sea boundary the simulated data obtained at x 600 m fig 12 a reflected the relevance of sea temperature to groundwater temperature in the saltwater domain groundwater under the sea followed the seasonal oscillation of sea temperature but the amplitude was smaller and the delay increased with depth at z 50 m oscillation could be observed although the signal was poor cross sections of temperature distribution fig 12b and 12c showed that below the surficial zone the temperature of the freshwater domain was maintained at approximately 17 c during summer and winter this means that fsi acted as a barrier for temperature distribution because fresh groundwater removed the sea thermal signal due to the significant vertical flux near the discharge zone to the sea in the vicinity of the fsi on the left side there was a high infiltration of seawater consequently the thermal signal was transferred to a greater depth and a temperature mixing zone of several tens of meters was generated this indicates the presence of an interface for temperature along the fsi that does not allow the heat transfer between freshwater and saltwater 5 discussion sources of different temperatures and hydrodynamics established in coastal aquifers including variable density convective processes generate a challenging scenario for developing temperature models the availability of temperature data is scarce as this parameter has not traditionally garnered extensive attention but also because of the lack of deep wells in the proximity of the sea due to the dearth of salty water utilization the development of a numerical model improved the knowledge of temperature distribution within coastal aquifers and the generation of a prototype compiling the main characteristics of these areas regarding temperature and the interaction with variable density preliminary simulations disclosed the existence of thermal warm upwelling below the discharge area an et al 2015 and szijártó et al 2019 simulated this phenomenon with a groundwater flow model but in a freshwater setting where flow moved upwards in discharge areas however coastal areas and variable density were not considered there was a lack of information about temperature distribution in coastal aquifers and the differences with other types of groundwater systems such as the dependence of the warm plume on the position and shape of the fsi additionally the fsi changes because of the buoyancy caused by temperature over density of water which is consistent with the convective cells demonstrated in a laboratory experiment henry and kohout 1972 and in a small dimensional model langevin et al 2010 based on a previous experiment environmental tracers also indicated the rise of old deep groundwater nearby the fsi i e sánchez úbeda et al 2018b calvache et al 2020 indicating that the temperature distribution in coastal aquifers could be directly related to the age distribution sensitivity analysis allowed us to quantify the order of magnitude of the impacts of the different parameters that are used for simulating temperature in coastal aquifers these results are based on an aquifer that has been used as a reference the motril salobreña aquifer and the implementation of much higher and lower values in the range of what can be considered common in natural settings see section 4 2 therefore the impact of each value table 3 can be used as a general indicator but in settings that differ extremely from our starting point for example karstified highly heterogeneous or extreme in size aquifers i e a few meters deep aquifer which should be used more carefully k is the most controlling parameter in the temperature distribution of a coastal aquifer this can be applied to noncoastal aquifers ma et al 2012 an et al 2015 the kx kz ratio had a notable influence on the vertical component of heat transport the importance of this parameter increased in coastal areas due to its impact on the position of the fsi on which heat transport depends both of them must be considered the primary calibration parameters when modeling a coastal aquifer heat distribution of the entire aquifer is influenced by the temperature established at the base of the model which is associated with geothermal heat thus δt should be treated with special attention in studies based on aquifers located in zones with positive anomalies in the geothermal gradient such as tectonically and volcanically active zones geothermal gradients greater than 40 c km as well as thin aquifers additionally even thick aquifers with normal geothermal gradients 30 c km can have relatively high temperatures such as the southern permian basin in europe limberger et al 2018 there are conflicting points of view in the literature about the role of dispersivity in heat transport some authors i e bear 1972 ingebritsen and sanford 1998 hopmans et al 2002 have given greater weight to conduction and have ignored thermal dispersivity while others i e molina giraldo et al 2011 park et al 2015 piga et al 2017 have given a higher relevance to thermal dispersion in their studies our research showed how dissipation of heat energy leading to high dispersivity values in a coastal aquifer could change the temperature pattern an aquifer with a deeper basement kept the thermal contours closest to the bottom compared with a model with a small mbd and the same boundary conditions reduction in heat transport at a greater mbd is related to the findings of szijártó et al 2019 who suggested that flux decreased with the increase in deeper models both k d t and d m t were the least sensitive parameters for temperature modeling in a previous study using a heat tracer test ma et al 2012 however our results showed that larger values of k d t and d m t maintained the temperature input generated by geothermal heat near the basement preventing the ascent of thermal contours this is because the heat is dispersed quickly and cannot ascend to the upper layers of the aquifer k d t and d m t depend on c psolid and k tsolid respectively therefore aquifer materials play an important role in conduction transfer when they reach higher values of k d t and d m t the effect of hydraulic gradient has a direct impact on the position of the fsi and hence the thermal plume the same happened with the increase in hydraulic conductivity although the magnitude of heat propagation was considerably lower for the hydraulic gradient for this reason δh could play a more relevant role in areas with climatic variability strong seasonality where hydraulic heads will vary due to changes in recharge geometry of the seafloor and its impact on the fsi has been previously studied and a bigger sfs led to an augmentation of the intrusion abarca et al 2007 walther et al 2017 in our case the range of values considered based on the studies in the area do not have a significant effect compared with other parameters considered the verticality of the fsi for smaller sfs also impacts on the temperature distribution in coastal aquifers because it favors the vertical component of the flux and the thermal contours were positioned more towards the surface porosity was the least controlling parameter in the temperature distribution it had an effect on both advection and convection components but in opposite ways panteli 2018 piga et al 2017 an increase in porosity resulted in a decrease in the effective velocity of groundwater and a reduction in plume length but also caused a decrease in thermal conductivity groundwater is less conductive than the solid phase which increased plume length the opposite effects compensated for each other however porosity slightly affected the advection component and the plume was slightly larger at lower porosities ranjan et al 2004 found that a change in porosity does not lead to a change in the position of the fsi but only leads to a change in the length of time to achieve the steady state of the interface however our results showed that when heat transport is added to the model porosity could affect the fsi by thermal buoyancy though only slightly analysis of the changes in porosity is in this case a theoretical example because in real aquifers changes in porosity such as the extremes considered in this study would likely be associated with changes in hydraulic conductivity that as has been explained before could have a strong impact on temperature distribution within the aquifer the study model of the motril salobreña aquifer is the first attempt to our knowledge of a model including temperature and variable density that is calibrated based on field temperature data it is a synthetic model of the natural system that consider recharge and the hydraulic gradient constant but with seasonal changes in temperature inputs although the results were consistent with observations there are three aspects that should be clarified with this model 1 recharge was assigned continuously but there were dry periods that could reduce the flow even if there was a dam that regulated river flow upstream additionally recharge from the river to the aquifer was four times less than the recharge estimated in previous studies from the river to the aquifer calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2011 however this model does not simulate all river tracks over the aquifer and infiltration is higher in the northern stretch of the river which was not included in the model 2 the hydraulic gradient has seasonal and interannual oscillations with dry and wet periods that in the model were represented with a mean value for both cases 3 for the calibration of k in line with the sedimentology in the study area fig 1c k was drastically reduced the hydraulic conductivity value is due to the high topographic gradient 3482 m from the river head to the river mouth that allows the deposition of coarse sediments the geological and geometrical characteristics of the aquifer depth high k and hydraulic gradient are very relevant for the temperature pattern identified comparison of the model results with the field observations showed some differences the modeled temperature logs in w250 were constant over time fig 11a however field measurements indicated slight variations at the depth where the fsi was intersected i e at the intersection of the ascendant thermal plume this contrasts with the field data in w180 where temporal variations were not observed fig 2 this demonstrates that temperature in the proximity of the fsi was more exposed to changes related to variations in water entry to the aquifer such as hydraulic gradient or surficial recharge this hypothesis is reinforced by the sensitivity analysis fig 9 indicating movement of the fsi on the order of magnitude of hundreds of meters and hence of the thermal plume due to changes in hydraulic gradient discrepancies between the model and field data regarding the movement of temperature are then due to the absence of changing recharge and hydraulic gradient in the model and they can be the object of study in future research oscillation of the recharge temperature allowed us to obtain a time series of temperature at x 285 m fig 11c with better fitting than the vertical logs fig 11b nevertheless lateral changes in hydraulic conductivity would be needed to achieve a better calibration of the results this model does not consider lateral changes in hydraulic conductivity that are likely to take place in the study area as it corresponds with a deltaic sedimentary architecture however it should be taken into consideration that there are field measurements that have been collected in different years and that climatic conditions are likely to be dissimilar therefore both temperature data and model results must be considered general indicators of trends even if the results have achieved a very high degree of matching between observations and model results the recharge temperature was decided based on the average temperature of the air in this region nevertheless for different seasons this temperature changes along the year with colder recharge during winter and warmer in summer in this region the temperature changes are relatively mild due to the proximity of the coast also recharge is almost inexistent during the warmest months of the year still a better characterization of recharge temperatures would be a useful input for further studies on this topic changes in temperature generated by seawater infiltration are an infrequent parameter considered in previous studies as hypothesized by kohout 1965 seawater infiltrates the aquifer and is warmed by geothermal heating however he assumed a constant temperature our results demonstrated that seasonal oscillation of sea temperature created a thermal signal in the aquifer that only affected the saltwater domain the fsi acts as a barrier for the thermal domains in freshwater dominated by the temperature associated with the geothermal input and the temperature of the recharge and saltwater affected by seawater infiltration and the deep processes associated with variable density convection hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient are clearly related favoring the flushing of the seawater thermal signal due to the upwards fresh groundwater flux near to the fsi the thermal barrier could be sharper in the case of the motril salobreña aquifer in comparison with other aquifers due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient however temperature separation is also expected in other study areas although the thermal barrier would be more or less evident depending on the conditions of the area such as the temperature difference between the aquifer and sea temperature variations along the sea water column were not considered in the model instead the same value of temperature was established at all depths preliminary analysis indicated that other parameters had more influence on the groundwater temperature distribution however its impact was not studied in detail due to the limited availability of seawater temperature data in depth cross disciplinary collaboration with both oceanographic and hydrogeologic viewpoints would strengthen the perspectives on this matter as has been highlighted previously duque et al 2020 human activities such as pumping altered groundwater flow producing saline upconing beneath the pumping area and enhancing the seawater intrusion the geometry of the fsi can be modified significantly with this process as has been the case of the andarax coastal aquifer stein et al 2020 given the close connection of the fsi with temperature distribution human induced changes can have a direct impact on the heat plume described in this work one general issue in the development of groundwater temperature models is how to obtain reliable temperature data temperature profiles inside wells can be highly affected by water circulation inside the casing and even the mixing of water when collecting data can generate problems if this is not performed carefully this problem has been discussed in previous research that has suggested alternative methods for measuring temperature such as shalev et al 2009 carrera et al 2010 and levanon et al 2016 some of the temperature data collected in this investigation have been obtained in similar wells but systematic collection with monthly campaigns and continued activity for years indicates that the temperature profiles are consistent for example elad et al 2017 indicated how these types of measurements show significant trends and prevalent dynamics for salinity it is not common to find deep wells in coastal areas well equipped for conducting research and drilling prices are prohibitive therefore as long as drilling and measuring technology is in the current state this type of temperature profile is our best approach for groundwater temperature research a recent investigation using dts fiber optic cables allowed us to obtain temperature profiles without flow inside the well folch et al 2020 but still the depth reached did not exceed 25 m this also indicates the utility at the moment of the development of numerical models to further scientific knowledge in areas where it is challenging to collect high quality data such as sensitivity analysis conducted in this study further progress in the development of more realistic models including lateral heterogeneity and seasonal hydrogeological processes will contribute to a better knowledge of heat transport processes in coastal aquifers 6 conclusion heat sources for groundwater in coastal aquifers include surface water recharge sea infiltration and geothermal heat each source produces a thermal signal within the aquifer generating changes in temperature at different depths recharge water temperature produces a surficial temperature zone that is highly variable throughout the year sea water temperature also produces a seasonal temperature oscillation within the saltwater domain these two sources are affected by seasonal changes while the earth s internal heat induces a continuous geothermal gradient within the aquifer that increases with depth in coastal aquifers all these factors coalesce in the area where groundwater discharges to the sea geothermal heat ascends boosted by variable density processes that bring deep aquifer water to the surface where recharge water and sea infiltration all meet generating a complex mix of different temperatures the variable density and temperature transport model using seawat revealed that the effect of the geothermal gradient is strongly dependent on the fsi and that the heat plume ascends following the fsi i e thermal contour of 19 c ascended 100 m in the proximity of the fsi for kx 300 m d and kx kz 10 the shape and position of the thermal plume depend on different parameters e g more flattened plumes affected by higher anisotropic ratios with the same values of kx in addition temperature also influences water density therefore the fsi can be modified with respect to a model without temperature species the fsi toe can be moved tens or even hundreds of meters depending on the aquifer properties by using or not using temperature the results indicated that the most sensitive parameters are hydraulic conductivity and thermal input at the base of the aquifer these findings demonstrate the importance of convection on heat transport in an aquifer with these characteristics high hydraulic conductivities and hydraulic gradient the changes in parameters open a range of possibilities for research and work in this sector with a view on the application to other study areas the case study model integrates the three heat sources into the same model which provides a better understanding of heat interactions with different origins as there are no precedents on including all the different temperature sources in coastal aquifers furthermore the model demonstrates the existence of a thermal barrier coinciding with the position of the fsi that separates the temperature of the saltwater and freshwater despite our results are focused on one case study many of our findings could be applied to other coastal aquifers as the temperature barrier of the fsi the plume of higher temperature associated with geothermal heat especially in aquifers with significant thickness and the presence of different temperature sectors that can be identified at different depths still geological conditions can play a fundamental role in these processes and aquifers with higher heterogeneity alternation of layers with high contrast in hydraulic conductivity or different temperature seasonality can generate a picture differing from what has been presented in this work this is the first attempt at providing a full picture of temperature distribution in coastal aquifers but further research applying a similar methodology to other hydrogeological settings climatic conditions and with more focus on the simplified aspects that have been done in this study would help to provide answers to this emerging field of research the use of heat as a tracer in hydrogeological studies is growing in interest as this is a reliable and inexpensive tracer in this study we discussed the major processes and the effect of parameters on the application of temperature in coastal aquifers where a number of processes generate a different picture of what can be found in other coastal or non coastal settings credit

4162,the temperature distribution in coastal aquifers is determined by the effect of different heat sources surface water recharge sea infiltration and geothermal heat in previous studies the signal generated in groundwater by each source was individually studied and in the case of geothermal heat it was often not considered this research is the first in considering all possible sources of heat in a coastal aquifer simultaneously by using a combination of field data and numerical modeling to present a reference model based on the characteristics of a real aquifer the position of the freshwater saltwater interface fsi and its effect on temperature distribution have been modeled considering variable density flow coupled heat and solute transport this study broadens the theoretical knowledge of temperature distribution in coastal aquifers based on a sensitivity analysis of hydraulic and thermic parameters furthermore a case study the motril salobreña aquifer was modeled with field data calibration to test the applicability to real aquifers the new insights gained through this study provide integrated knowledge of the temperature distribution in coastal areas and establish the basis for future research using heat as a tracer in seaside aquifers keywords heat transport numerical modeling geothermal gradient saltwater intrusion temperature fluctuations 1 introduction the use of heat as a groundwater tracer is growing in popularity and it has been extended in a wide range of hydrogeological studies anderson 2005 heat and solute transport have many similarities demarsily 1986 bear 1972 hopmans et al 2002 which is the reason heat has been used as a tracer in groundwater systems however there are also differences in their behavior vandenbohede et al 2009 ma et al 2012 due to the thermal exchange between water and aquifer solids which depends on the heat properties of both bakker et al 2015 this reflects a time delay of heat transport with respect to solute transport for this reason understanding the different aspects involved in both processes is important when including both solute transport and heat transport in the same model traditionally the direct relationship of density and viscosity with temperature has been ignored in hydrogeological modeling because of its negligible effect over the results of variable density models nevertheless there is a broad area of research in groundwater systems where temperature is considered to play a significant role e g sole source aquifers and coastal aquifer ocean interactions thorne et al 2006 vandenbohede and van houtte 2012 befus et al 2013 debnath et al 2005 studies about groundwater surface water interaction have shown that thermal distribution in the aquifer can indicate the degree of connection with rivers that has seasonal and daily temperature fluctuations constantz 1998 duque et al 2010 keery et al 2007 lautz 2012 mccallum et al 2014 sebok et al 2015 recharge processes can have an impact on temperature of the surficial zone of the aquifer to a maximum depth of a few tens of meters as a consequence of atmospheric temperature pollack and huang 2000 smerdon et al 2003 variations in environmental temperature produce groundwater temperature fluctuations due to the effect of cooling or heating of the surface water before infiltration pollack et al 2005 duque et al 2010 the amplitude of fluctuations decreases with depth silliman and booth 1993 kurylyk et al 2013 as a result the thermal signal has been used in analytical and numerical solutions to estimate groundwater recharge discharge rates suzuki 1960 bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 stallman 1965 rushton 2007 duque et al 2016 taniguchi et al 1999 calvache et al 2011 and kurylyk et al 2019 have described how the shape of temperature profiles is connected with discharge and recharge areas apart from the surficial zone where temperature is affected by recharge and air temperature aquifers can be affected by the geothermal gradient parsons 1970 temperature profiles within the geothermal zone are unaffected by seasonal variations and adopt a linear trend anderson 2005 domenico and palciauskas 1973 indicated that the distribution of groundwater temperature can be disturbed by groundwater flow and stallman 1963 suggested that it depends directly on the velocity and direction of water flow the geothermal gradient is greater in groundwater discharge areas than in recharge areas tóth 1962 domenico and palciauskas 1973 an et al 2015 which results from the fact that a hot upwelling is forced by convection within the discharge zone szijártó et al 2019 hydraulic conductivity also plays an important role in the geothermal gradient due to the high degree of convective heat transport with large hydraulic conductivity values an et al 2015 other parameters such as anisotropy heterogeneity recharge rate and the position of the water table have an important influence on the magnitude of the disturbance parsons 1970 smith and chapman 1983 woodbury and smith 1988 forster and smith 1989 the groundwater flow pattern of coastal aquifers was initially studied in the 1950 s and 1960 s glover 1959 kohout 1964 the intrusion of saline water into the deepest part of aquifers disturbs the freshwater flow due to the difference in density of the two fluids groundwater originated by recharge inland flows vertically upward resulting in fresh terrestrial submarine groundwater discharge sgd across the seafloor between land and sea this process is intimately associated with the location of the freshwater saltwater interface fsi and has been studied along many coasts of the world kinnear et al 2013 eissa et al 2018 duque et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 despite good knowledge about coastal areas few studies have investigated heat distribution a series of papers by the u s geological survey usgs in the 1960s hypothesized the existence of seawater circulation intensified by temperature induced density gradients in a carbonate platform in southern of florida kohout 1965 kohout 1967 henry and kohout 1972 kohout et al 1977 they hypothesized that infiltrated cold seawater could be heated by geothermal heat driving to an open cycle thermal convection in addition to variable density effects subsequently henry and kohout 1972 tested kohout s thermal convection with a laboratory experiment cold saltwater and warm freshwater were introduced in a glass tank with sand for the first time a laboratory experiment represented combined solute and heat transport and their effects on flow patterns were represented in porous media the henry and hilleke problem was modeled with different numerical codes such as sutra ms hughes et al 2007 seawat dausman et al 2010 and hst3d thorne et al 2006 showing very similar results among them the same benchmark problem was used to simulate this physical experiment with seawat but also included variable density groundwater flow langevin et al 2010 nevertheless there are only a few studies that support their hypothesis with field measurements such as kim et al 2008 2009 who described the dynamics within the freshwater saltwater interface in a volcanic island with a geothermal gradient the vertical logs in boreholes situated close to the coastline in an aquifer in southeastern of spain molina et al 2002 did not show a normal increase in temperature with depth but revealed a sharp decrease in temperature at 160 m depth due to the entry of cooler seawater into the aquifer furthermore time series data of electrical conductivity and temperature at different depths showed variations due to two external influences tidal fluctuation and recharge produced by rainfall beyond this vandenbohede and lebbe 2011 observed yearly fluctuations in temperature in the surficial zone of a shallow detrital coastal aquifer and developed a density dependent model to simulate how yearly temperature oscillations influence the distribution of groundwater temperature they concluded that the thickness of the surficial zone and the amplitude of the temperature oscillations are dependent on the conduction convection dominance on heat transport in most cases research has focused on either surficial temperature processes vandenbohede and lebbe 2011 befus et al 2013 debnath et al 2005 tirado conde et al 2019 or geothermal effects taniguchi 2000 taniguchi et al 1999 as the distance between these effects hinders the exchange between them in coastal aquifers the circulation patterns generated due to variable density of the fluid and the hydrodynamic dispersion can facilitate the interaction between shallow and deep groundwater but research has been limited thus far to a few theoretical e g thorne et al 2006 langevin et al 2007 2008 2010 or field measurements in all the depth of shallow aquifers but without detection of geothermal gradient e g folch et al 2020 the difficulties in obtaining temperature data in deep zones of coastal areas originate the scarcity of research focused on the geothermal effect this paper shows the temperature distribution in coastal aquifers distinguishes the different thermal zones that can be found in coastal areas and takes into consideration constant or variable temperature sources over for this purpose and due to the scarcity of information in the scientific literature a numerical model was developed to propose a generic synthetic theoretical model of temperature distribution in coastal aquifers a detailed sensitivity analysis was applied to different parameters and properties for a range of realistic values in the study area the results established the basis for the understanding of heat distribution for diverse types of coastal aquifers furthermore the acquired knowledge was tested with field data obtained in the coastal aquifer of motril salobreña making it one of the few studies that combined heat modeling with temperature field data obtained near the discharge zone 2 research area 2 1 hydrogeological setting the motril salobreña detrital aquifer is located on the southeastern coast of spain in the province of granada fig 1 a it has an area of 42 km2 and its thickness varies from 30 to 50 m in the north to more than 250 m in the south duque et al 2008 the aquifer is composed mostly of gravel sand silt and clay of quaternary age that overlay a very low permeability basement consisting of schist and phyllite fig 1c the hydraulic conductivity of the materials is widely variable calvache et al 2015 due to the fluvial deltaic depositional environment of the aquifer in the vicinity of the mouth of the guadalfeo river the upper layers of the aquifer are characterized by gravel layers characterized by high hydraulic conductivity however the ratio diminishes dramatically at a depth of 140 m due to the prevalence of clay layers fig 1c numerical and sedimentological studies have estimated values of hydraulic conductivities which ranged from 12 to 300 m d calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2018 the general flow direction in the aquifer is from north to south toward the mediterranean sea with a hydraulic gradient estimated between 1 6 10 3 and 5 10 3 duque et al 2010 although currently it reaches 7 10 3 in the northern part of the aquifer the main water entrance to the aquifer is supplied by the guadalfeo river which provides direct infiltration along the riverbed and indirect infiltration from irrigation return flows estimated at 11 mm3 year and 16 mm3 year respectively calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2011 in the study area several wells were drilled from north to south w10 w250 w60 and w180 at distances of 285 m 300 m 700 m and 1900 m from the shoreline fig 1b w10 w60 and w180 are three full screened wells 10 m 60 m and 180 m deep respectively and w250 is a deep well 250 m deep with one screen that is 6 m and 11 screens that are 3 m each at the depths indicated in fig 1c w250 is an artesian well with an average flow of 18 l s providing evidence of the presence of vertical flows in this area of the aquifer calvache et al 2015 according to the flow pattern of the discharge zone proposed by glover 1959 and kohout 1964 for a coastal aquifer duque et al 2008 indicated slight marine intrusion in the aquifer by using gravitational and electromagnetic sounding methods which were supported by the low electrical conductivity ec data obtained in w180 additionally well w250 intersected the fsi which was approximately 135 200 m deep calvache et al 2015 the area is characterized by a subtropical climate with scarce rainfall and mild temperature the average precipitation is 420 mm year and the mean annual temperature is 18 c the mean air temperature follows a regular pattern each year a maximum of 25 c in july august and a minimum of 10 12 c in january february duque et al 2010 a similar pattern was observed in the temperature of water in the river with almost identical values to the atmospheric temperature but with an approximate delay of 1 month on the other hand the mediterranean sea in this area is characterized by a warm temperature that fluctuates between a maximum of 24 c in august and a minimum of 14 c in february data supplied by the state harbors spanish ministry of development the temperature pattern in the upper section of the aquifer and in the proximity of the fsi was disturbed due to the influence of the thermal signal from the river duque et al 2010 and the influence of the sea temperature respectively the collected data from well w180 represented the vertical heat distribution in the motril salobreña aquifer fig 2 three zones can be identified the surficial zone intermediate zone and deep zone the surficial zone is subject to seasonal changes in temperature the intermediate zone does not have any significant seasonal variations and remains practically constant the deep zone has a constant increase in temperature due to geothermal heat 2 2 temperature conceptual model the conceptual model fig 3 was created from the field data information the measurements obtained in w180 fig 2 were used to establish the initial temperature distribution within the freshwater domain a surficial zone 23 m deep with an oscillating thermal signal could be distinguished due to infiltration of the river flow and air temperature influence below the surficial zone the intermediate zone is differentiated because temperature had no oscillations and remained at 17 2 c until a depth of approximately 110 m in the deep zone an increment in temperature of 0 02 c per meter was calculated which represents 20 c at 250 m the temperature of the sea oscillated seasonally in the same manner as the temperature of the river flow this conceptualization was used for assigning boundary conditions in the numerical model and temperature and head measurements in w10 w250 and w60 were used for calibration and verification of the model 3 methodology 3 1 solute and heat transport equation numerical model and model indicators in the present study seawat v 4 langevin et al 2007 was used to simulate simultaneous multispecies solute and heat transport this software couples modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and solves the following form of the variable density groundwater flow equation 1 1 ρ b k d k θ θ c k t θ d m k α q θ c k q

and diffusion for solute transport respectively both transport equations incorporate a retardation term the adsorption of solutes by the aquifer matrix generates retardation in solute transport

1 θ k tsolid thermal dispersion in heat transport is frequently ignored in most analytical solutions langevin et al 2010 because heat conduction often dominates thermal dispersion in heat transport anderson 2005 ferguson 2007 however seawat version 4 includes the thermal dispersion term in the code formulation therefore it has been included in our models to interpret the temperature distribution within the aquifer and to quantitatively compare the model results we used the following indicators 1 d b tc i is the vertical distance from the aquifer basement to each thermal contour 6 d b tc i z b z tc i 2 r is the dimensionless factor obtained from the division of the vertical distance from sea surface level to each thermal contour and the location of the arbitrary observation point 7 r z sl z

level as a reference z sl is the elevation of sea level l and x obs is the position of the observation point on the x axis l the root mean squared error rmse was calculated on the basis of the comparison of the observed data with the field measurements the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean squared error rmse were calculated on the basis of the comparison of the observed data

the number of observations 3 2 field data four research wells were used to study the temperature distribution of the aquifer vertical temperature profiles were logged monthly at w180 and w60 and sporadically at w250 using the multiparameter probe kll q 2 accuracy 0 1 c resolution 0 01 c during the period 2005 2019 in w180 the profiles were obtained by measuring every five meters throughout the well in w250 the measurement points of the logs were taken at the depths of the 12 screens fig 1c in w60 the observation points of the logs were obtained every 5 m to a depth of 20 m in w10 one pressure temperature sensor was installed at a 5 m depth to measure at 1 hour intervals seametrics levelscout smart pressure sensors accuracy 0 1 c and resolution 0 01 c the collection of temperature profiles is subject to uncertainties water circulation inside the casing of the well affects the temperature distribution and the measurements could not be an exact replica of temperature into the aquifer however as the objective of this research was to focus on the major trends and general dynamics this limitation was considered acceptable other methodologies to collect temperature profiles such as fiber optic distributed temperature sensing fo dts directly inserted in the aquifer sediments prevent the problem of water circulation inside wells del val et al 2021 but it requires specific design and construction of the monitoring system instead of using boreholes already drilled the temperature dataset of the mediterranean sea was supplied from monthly mean temperature by the state harbors spanish ministry of development on the coast at málaga this station was chosen because it was closer to the research area 75 km west and because climatic conditions were practically the same the same mean monthly temperature and mean precipitation the measurement device was a triaxys directional wave buoy that measures temperature 0 5 m below the sea surface and provides real time data via radio to a land station with hourly cadence 3 3 numerical model characteristics the temperature distribution within the coastal aquifer was modeled with a finite difference 2d model using seawat which solved the variable density groundwater flow and heat transport equations the 2d model cross section was 8 5 km long x axis of which 5 km were landward and 3 5 km seaward from the coastline and 100 m wide y axis the depth of the model z axis varied from 150 m in the south offshore boundary to 290 m deep in the north onshore boundary the topography of the aquifer and seabed had slopes of 0 8 and 2 8 respectively based on a groundwater age model of the study area calvache et al 2020 and the seabed bathymetric information jabaloy sánchez et al 2014 the grid was defined based on a mesh with 124 rows and 22 layers with cells of 85 12 m it was refined near the fsi area 42 12 m and surface area 42 6 m these dimensions of the model were applied to the case study model and for the sensitivity analysis however depth topography and basement were modified to test how the size of the model affects the temperature distribution the flow was solved using the pre conditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver the solution method for the advective term of the transport equation was the generalized conjugate gradient gcg solver with jacobi pre conditioner the courant number used was 0 75 the simulation of models 1 and 2 requires between 1000 and 1600 years to reach the steady state conditions however simulation of the model 3 was run during 15 years for the boundary conditions the basement of the aquifer and the left border were defined as a nonflow boundary neumann boundary condition in the sea bed and right boundary constant hydraulic heads and salinities were defined dirichlet boundary condition with respect to the thermal boundary conditions temperature recorded data from w180 were used to establish them on the other hand temperature measurements of w60 w250 and w10 were used to calibrate the study model the workflow with the numerical models included a sensitivity analysis and a real case simulation sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of model parameters on heat transport in coastal aquifers to reproduce the field observations with the real case study model specific site characteristics obtained from previous studies duque et al 2008 duque et al 2018 sánchez úbeda et al 2018a and fieldwork were considered such as aquifer geometry hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity and hydraulic gradient in the process three different models models 1 2 and 3 were constructed addressing the different purposes and the boundary conditions were modified for each of them fig 4 and table 1 4 results 4 1 temperature distribution an initial synthetic cross section of the temperature distribution of a coastal aquifer was obtained based on model 2 which was compared with model 1 fig 5 the hydraulic conductivity used was kx 1 and the anisotropic ratio kx kz 10 and the boundary conditions and the rest of the input parameters are specified in fig 4 and table 1 groundwater temperature increases with depth due to the geothermal gradient however temperature propagation and thermal contours are bent because of the change in flow direction fig 5a generating a hotter temperature plume along the fsi at deeper locations in the aquifer fresh groundwater is forced to ascend toward the sea due to the presence of the salt wedge which implies greater heat transport than other parts of the aquifer where convection is less important in turn temperature also affects the position of the fsi when adding temperature to the model comparing model 1 and model 2 the fsi width changed but it also rotated and moved its toe inland fig 5b the fsi toe moved tens of meters when temperature difference between the surface and basement is 1 c for our case study however it is also highly dependent on the aquifer properties in general an increase of temperature difference will favor the encroachment of seawater this is consistent with henry and kohout 1972 and langevin et al 2010 who indicated that convective cells are stronger when density is affected by temperature groundwater is heated at the bottom of the aquifer rises because of the combination of the effect of the saline wedge and the buoyancy effect in warmer water and saltwater replaces the heated upward water 4 2 sensitivity analysis heat transport is controlled by different parameters hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity thermal distribution coefficient thermal diffusivity hydraulic gradient thermal boundary seafloor slope and depth of the basement sensitivity analysis of the variable density groundwater flow and heat transport model showed the impact of each parameter on thermal distribution the sensitivity analysis was focused on heat transport within the deep zone of each model and especially around the area of the fsi thus modeling of this section consisted of a variable density model with geothermal heat input fig 4 the value of the parameters was changed for a range based on realistic values obtained in the literature specified in table 1 the assignation of maximum mean and minimum values to each parameter aimed to cover those parameters with scarce information and to show the differences associated with the natural variability in aquifers homogeneous conditions were assumed with a hydraulic conductivity of kx 1 m d a kx kz ratio of 10 and the input parameter values of table 1 except for the parameter that was tested in each case 4 2 1 hydraulic conductivity four sets of hydraulic conductivities were tested obtained from the literature calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2017 two with a lower hydraulic conductivity kx 1 m d and changing anisotropic ratios kx kz of 1 and 10 and two with higher hydraulic conductivity kx 300 m d and anisotropic ratios kx kz of 1 and 10 the resulting temperature distribution of the different scenarios showed changes in the order of magnitude of hundreds of meters depending on the value of the hydraulic conductivity fig 6 lower hydraulic conductivity generated thermal contours distributed parallel to the base of the aquifer while higher values related to more changes in the section anisotropy played a more important role in the area where the flow components were more vertical that is along the zone where the fsi is located high hydraulic conductivities 300 m d produced a sharper rise in the thermal plume than low hydraulic conductivities 1 m d anisotropy of kx kz 10 generated a higher horizontal than vertical component hindering vertical heat transport and flattening the thermal contours anisotropy favored the horizontal flow thereby displacing the fsi seawards and the thermal plume was affected in the same manner due to the direct relationship with the fsi this test indicates that the anisotropy can cause a change on an order of magnitude of tens of meters in the thermal distribution under the boundary conditions selected 4 2 2 porosity θ the sensitivity of temperature to porosity was evaluated by introducing two extreme values 0 2 and 0 6 to the model obtained from the literature freeze and cherry 1979 although the depth of the thermal contours was very similar for both cases there were slight differences in the shape of the isothermal lines fig 7a for θ 0 6 the thermal contours became flattened and therefore the geothermal gradient was practically the same for any observation point on the x axis for θ 0 2 the thermal plume was slightly higher likewise the fsi varied depending on the porosity value for θ 0 6 the fsi was narrower in the upper area in comparison with a θ 0 2 this indicates that a reduction in porosity is related to higher advective transport hence the buoyancy effect is larger which causes a modification in the upper part of the fsi fresh groundwater discharge zone and consequently in the temperature distribution nevertheless the effect of this parameter is very reduced considering the range of values tested for the range of porosities commonly found in real aquifers the differences would be minor 4 2 3 dispersivity α both salinity dispersivity and thermal dispersivity were considered as they are modeled in an analogous manner demarsily 1986 therefore they have the same value bridger and allen 2010 engelhardt et al 2013 the thermal dispersivity of aquifers usually ranges from 0 1 to 100 m stauffer et al 2014 the three values for the dispersivity tensor α were considered based on the dimensions of the model 1 m 50 m and 100 m the temperature profiles obtained 300 m from the coastline showed that higher dispersivity α 100 m increased temperature throughout the entire thickness of the aquifer fig 7b as the heat effect from the geothermal source of heat can spread more easily for α 1 m the trend of the temperature profile was more concave whereas temperature increased more linearly with depth for α 100 m when thermal dispersivity played a more important role in heat transport heat convection decreased hence weaker convection and thus dispersivity dominant heat transfer produced a linear increase in temperature as demonstrated by an et al 2015 the temperature difference reached more than 1 c which had significant relevance in the comparison with other parameters a dispersivity of approximately 100 can move water with a temperature of 18 c upwards to the shallow part of the aquifer this has not been possible to reach with the sensitivity analysis of the other parameters 4 2 4 thermal distribution coefficient k d t k d t was estimated with equation 3 applying maximum minimum and mean values of c psolid for rocks and minerals reported in the literature schärli and rybach 2001 clauser 2011 the resulting values of k d t were 2 3 10 7 1 27 10 7 and 2 3 10 8 l mg the sensitivity analysis showed variations up to tens of meters in the distance from the basement to the thermal contours d b tci fig 8 a a low value of k d t 2 3 10 8 l mg generated a greater d b tci i e a further propagation of the thermal signal compared with higher values of k d t the shallowest thermal contour 18 c was the one with greater displacement from the basement when changing the values of k d t these results are consistent with the fact that k d t works as a retardation coefficient that causes the temperature changes to be slower than the linear flow velocity langevin et al 2008 if more heat is necessary to increase the sediment temperature the retardation of heat transport will increase ma et al 2012 k d t had no direct effect on the salinity distribution but did on the heat distribution therefore the fsi can be affected by the buoyancy effect however the changes were so small that they were not appreciable in these simulations 4 2 5 thermal diffusivity d m t the thermal diffusivity d m t was calculated with equations 4 and 5 using the given value of k tsolid the maximum and minimum values and a middle value of k tsolid were estimated for different lithologies and were obtained from xiaoqing et al 2018 the values assigned to d m t were 0 3 0 15 and 0 06 m2 d corresponding to dolomites marlstone and mudstones respectively the results of each simulation were observed in different locations of the model and represented with the r parameter fig 8b modification of the values of d m t produced a greater variability in r for the thermal contour of 18 c in contrast r did not change for the thermal contour of 20 c when changing d m t for d m t 0 06 the r value can reach 24 higher than that for d m t 0 3 as is the case of the thermal contour of 18 c observed at xobs 100 m just as k d t the thermal contour of 18 c showed larger changes than the rest of the temperatures due to the greater vertical component of the flow at this depth the variation in the fsi position was so small that it could not be detected while testing the different values of d m t 4 2 6 hydraulic gradient δh the hydraulic gradient in aquifers is a variable parameter in time and space seasonal oscillation in recharge conditions can modify it in short periods the impact on heat transfer was tested with a range between 0 003 and 0 007 from the lateral inflow the constant head of the sea boundary was maintained at 0 and only the constant head of the freshwater boundary was changed from 15 m to 35 m these changes were on the same order of magnitude as observed in the motril salobreña aquifer during the last 20 years duque et al 2010 δh changed the distribution of salinity moving the fsi hundreds of meters and temperature by changing the pattern fig 9 for δh 0 007 the fsi was positioned more seaward and vertical and the temperature transport had a higher vertical component throughout the entire model compared with the results for δh 0 003 additionally the thermal plume in the discharge zone moved seaward and had a more pointy shape 4 2 7 thermal boundary the effect of the input of geothermal heat was tested based on different rates as the geothermal gradient increased 1 c per 20 to 40 m of depth anderson 2005 and the model was 250 m deep the highest temperature difference between the surface and basement δt was 13 c additionally a δt of 6 c and 2 c were also tested as the shallow part of the aquifer was assigned 17 2 c the basement of the model was 30 c 23 c and 19 c the δt was compared with the temperature distribution at different depths 30 m 100 m 160 m and 230 m at 300 m fig 10 a the point where the resultant lines intersected the x axis represented the temperature of a homoeothermic aquifer in which temperature would be homogeneous regardless of depth δt 13 c produced an increase in temperature in the shallowest observation point 30 m of 3 c with respect to the homoeothermic aquifer there were small changes in the fsi position for higher δt the fsi had more verticality a few meters seaward of the fsi toe and was wider than for smaller δt although there were no large differences 4 2 8 seafloor slope sfs the seafloor geometry of the model was tested in order to study its relevance on temperature distribution the different slope values used were 2 8 based on the estimated value for the motril salobreña aquifer by bathymetric techniques jabaloy sánchez et al 2014 and a minimum and maximum values of 0 and 5 respectively to take account of other possible sfs representative of more study areas fig 10b the starting point of the slope was the coastline and the continental topography was not changed regarding previous models for sfs 5 the thermal contour had a larger r parameter in comparison with the rest of the inclinations which indicates that the isotherms ascended less for sfs 5 the r value can reach 9 higher than that for sfs 0 as is the case of the thermal contour of 18 c observed at xobs 100 m the thermal contour of 18 c as it was located at a shallower location in the aquifer was more affected by the change in slope than the other isotherms and this sector had greater vertical flow components thus the higher the seafloor slope is the lower the elevation of the thermal contour moreover the slope of the seafloor had an impact on the position of the fsi for sfs 5 the fsi is less vertical and its toe is situated a few meters seaward than for sfs 0 4 2 9 model basement depth mbd three model basement depths mbd 100 m 500 m and 1000 m were considered fig 10c although an increase in depth is usually associated with a major geothermal gradient the temperature of the basement boundary was the same for all cases since the target was to understand their influence separately the results showed important variations in the distance from the basement to the thermal contours d b tci for example for d b tc18 c the difference between a model of 100 and 1000 m was almost 40 m 4 3 case study model the model had the same structure as the model used for sensitivity analysis but the parameters were adjusted based on the local knowledge of the areas table 1 horizontal layers without lateral facies changes were defined as this is the major sedimentary architecture of the aquifer smaller scale heterogeneity was not introduced to focus on major aspects of the thermal distribution hydraulic conductivity was initially defined based on previous studies calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2018 and the lithological core of w250 fig 1 model results were compared with the field measurements of temperature and salinity in w10 w250 and w60 for temperature boundary conditions a fixed temperature 20 05 c was assigned to the base of the aquifer based on the expected temperature at 250 m due to the linear temperature increment in w180 fig 2 temperature of the right boundary freshwater entry was 16 7 c which is an approximate value for temperature in the intermediate zone the temperature oscillation assigned to the seafloor fluctuated between 14 and 24 c at the surface boundary a constant recharge of 5000 mm yr was assigned that represented the river inflow to the aquifer as the observation wells were all located at a maximum distance of a few tens of meters from the trace of the river the temperature of this recharge was a sinus function according to the seasonal oscillation of the river water temperature 12 26 c duque et al 2010 in the calibration hydraulic conductivity of the different layers was adjusted as well as temperature in the right boundary and in the recharge these changes were minor adjustments as still the boundary conditions were coherent with the field measurements i e temperature value of the right boundary was modified to 16 7 c from 17 2 c additionally the adjusted recharge was four times smaller than that estimated in previous studies the model was run for a total of 15 years to give enough time to reach the semistability which was reached in the 9th year of simulation from this time the fsi position and geothermal heat were in steady state and the temperature of the surficial zone and saltwater had repeated seasonal oscillations annually the results displayed below correspond once the steady state condition had been reached the coefficient of determination r2 of the calculated rating curves was 0 81 and the rmse was 0 37 c the vertical profiles of temperature at x 300 m are displayed with the field data obtained from w250 fig 11 a the differences in the first few meters correspond with the seasonal temperature oscillation from 50 m these differences were buffered indicating that recharge had no influence however in the field data temporal variations were observed when w250 intersected the fsi from 150 m this issue is discussed in the next section there is a strong connection between hydraulic conductivity values of the model table 2 and temperature distribution the intermediate zone of the temperature profiles was related to a layer with high hydraulic conductivity layer 2 this suggested that the temperature distribution is strongly dependent on the geology of the study area the seasonal temperature oscillation in the surficial part of the aquifer was analyzed by the temperature logs at x 700 m fig 11b and compared with the envelopes of the field logs measured in w60 the results ranged between 17 3 and 19 1 c and were between the maximum and minimum envelopes 16 4 19 6 c and had very similar shapes the profile with the minimum value was slightly lower than the minimum field measurement the thermal signal obtained at 5 m at x 285 m demonstrated that the model was able to simulate seasonal oscillations fig 11c the sensor installed in w10 showed temperature oscillations with a maximum of 20 c in december and a minimum of 17 5 c in may and the simulated temperature oscillated from 17 3 to 19 3 c therefore the maximum value was slightly lower than the observed value for temperature distribution near the sea boundary the simulated data obtained at x 600 m fig 12 a reflected the relevance of sea temperature to groundwater temperature in the saltwater domain groundwater under the sea followed the seasonal oscillation of sea temperature but the amplitude was smaller and the delay increased with depth at z 50 m oscillation could be observed although the signal was poor cross sections of temperature distribution fig 12b and 12c showed that below the surficial zone the temperature of the freshwater domain was maintained at approximately 17 c during summer and winter this means that fsi acted as a barrier for temperature distribution because fresh groundwater removed the sea thermal signal due to the significant vertical flux near the discharge zone to the sea in the vicinity of the fsi on the left side there was a high infiltration of seawater consequently the thermal signal was transferred to a greater depth and a temperature mixing zone of several tens of meters was generated this indicates the presence of an interface for temperature along the fsi that does not allow the heat transfer between freshwater and saltwater 5 discussion sources of different temperatures and hydrodynamics established in coastal aquifers including variable density convective processes generate a challenging scenario for developing temperature models the availability of temperature data is scarce as this parameter has not traditionally garnered extensive attention but also because of the lack of deep wells in the proximity of the sea due to the dearth of salty water utilization the development of a numerical model improved the knowledge of temperature distribution within coastal aquifers and the generation of a prototype compiling the main characteristics of these areas regarding temperature and the interaction with variable density preliminary simulations disclosed the existence of thermal warm upwelling below the discharge area an et al 2015 and szijártó et al 2019 simulated this phenomenon with a groundwater flow model but in a freshwater setting where flow moved upwards in discharge areas however coastal areas and variable density were not considered there was a lack of information about temperature distribution in coastal aquifers and the differences with other types of groundwater systems such as the dependence of the warm plume on the position and shape of the fsi additionally the fsi changes because of the buoyancy caused by temperature over density of water which is consistent with the convective cells demonstrated in a laboratory experiment henry and kohout 1972 and in a small dimensional model langevin et al 2010 based on a previous experiment environmental tracers also indicated the rise of old deep groundwater nearby the fsi i e sánchez úbeda et al 2018b calvache et al 2020 indicating that the temperature distribution in coastal aquifers could be directly related to the age distribution sensitivity analysis allowed us to quantify the order of magnitude of the impacts of the different parameters that are used for simulating temperature in coastal aquifers these results are based on an aquifer that has been used as a reference the motril salobreña aquifer and the implementation of much higher and lower values in the range of what can be considered common in natural settings see section 4 2 therefore the impact of each value table 3 can be used as a general indicator but in settings that differ extremely from our starting point for example karstified highly heterogeneous or extreme in size aquifers i e a few meters deep aquifer which should be used more carefully k is the most controlling parameter in the temperature distribution of a coastal aquifer this can be applied to noncoastal aquifers ma et al 2012 an et al 2015 the kx kz ratio had a notable influence on the vertical component of heat transport the importance of this parameter increased in coastal areas due to its impact on the position of the fsi on which heat transport depends both of them must be considered the primary calibration parameters when modeling a coastal aquifer heat distribution of the entire aquifer is influenced by the temperature established at the base of the model which is associated with geothermal heat thus δt should be treated with special attention in studies based on aquifers located in zones with positive anomalies in the geothermal gradient such as tectonically and volcanically active zones geothermal gradients greater than 40 c km as well as thin aquifers additionally even thick aquifers with normal geothermal gradients 30 c km can have relatively high temperatures such as the southern permian basin in europe limberger et al 2018 there are conflicting points of view in the literature about the role of dispersivity in heat transport some authors i e bear 1972 ingebritsen and sanford 1998 hopmans et al 2002 have given greater weight to conduction and have ignored thermal dispersivity while others i e molina giraldo et al 2011 park et al 2015 piga et al 2017 have given a higher relevance to thermal dispersion in their studies our research showed how dissipation of heat energy leading to high dispersivity values in a coastal aquifer could change the temperature pattern an aquifer with a deeper basement kept the thermal contours closest to the bottom compared with a model with a small mbd and the same boundary conditions reduction in heat transport at a greater mbd is related to the findings of szijártó et al 2019 who suggested that flux decreased with the increase in deeper models both k d t and d m t were the least sensitive parameters for temperature modeling in a previous study using a heat tracer test ma et al 2012 however our results showed that larger values of k d t and d m t maintained the temperature input generated by geothermal heat near the basement preventing the ascent of thermal contours this is because the heat is dispersed quickly and cannot ascend to the upper layers of the aquifer k d t and d m t depend on c psolid and k tsolid respectively therefore aquifer materials play an important role in conduction transfer when they reach higher values of k d t and d m t the effect of hydraulic gradient has a direct impact on the position of the fsi and hence the thermal plume the same happened with the increase in hydraulic conductivity although the magnitude of heat propagation was considerably lower for the hydraulic gradient for this reason δh could play a more relevant role in areas with climatic variability strong seasonality where hydraulic heads will vary due to changes in recharge geometry of the seafloor and its impact on the fsi has been previously studied and a bigger sfs led to an augmentation of the intrusion abarca et al 2007 walther et al 2017 in our case the range of values considered based on the studies in the area do not have a significant effect compared with other parameters considered the verticality of the fsi for smaller sfs also impacts on the temperature distribution in coastal aquifers because it favors the vertical component of the flux and the thermal contours were positioned more towards the surface porosity was the least controlling parameter in the temperature distribution it had an effect on both advection and convection components but in opposite ways panteli 2018 piga et al 2017 an increase in porosity resulted in a decrease in the effective velocity of groundwater and a reduction in plume length but also caused a decrease in thermal conductivity groundwater is less conductive than the solid phase which increased plume length the opposite effects compensated for each other however porosity slightly affected the advection component and the plume was slightly larger at lower porosities ranjan et al 2004 found that a change in porosity does not lead to a change in the position of the fsi but only leads to a change in the length of time to achieve the steady state of the interface however our results showed that when heat transport is added to the model porosity could affect the fsi by thermal buoyancy though only slightly analysis of the changes in porosity is in this case a theoretical example because in real aquifers changes in porosity such as the extremes considered in this study would likely be associated with changes in hydraulic conductivity that as has been explained before could have a strong impact on temperature distribution within the aquifer the study model of the motril salobreña aquifer is the first attempt to our knowledge of a model including temperature and variable density that is calibrated based on field temperature data it is a synthetic model of the natural system that consider recharge and the hydraulic gradient constant but with seasonal changes in temperature inputs although the results were consistent with observations there are three aspects that should be clarified with this model 1 recharge was assigned continuously but there were dry periods that could reduce the flow even if there was a dam that regulated river flow upstream additionally recharge from the river to the aquifer was four times less than the recharge estimated in previous studies from the river to the aquifer calvache et al 2009 duque et al 2011 however this model does not simulate all river tracks over the aquifer and infiltration is higher in the northern stretch of the river which was not included in the model 2 the hydraulic gradient has seasonal and interannual oscillations with dry and wet periods that in the model were represented with a mean value for both cases 3 for the calibration of k in line with the sedimentology in the study area fig 1c k was drastically reduced the hydraulic conductivity value is due to the high topographic gradient 3482 m from the river head to the river mouth that allows the deposition of coarse sediments the geological and geometrical characteristics of the aquifer depth high k and hydraulic gradient are very relevant for the temperature pattern identified comparison of the model results with the field observations showed some differences the modeled temperature logs in w250 were constant over time fig 11a however field measurements indicated slight variations at the depth where the fsi was intersected i e at the intersection of the ascendant thermal plume this contrasts with the field data in w180 where temporal variations were not observed fig 2 this demonstrates that temperature in the proximity of the fsi was more exposed to changes related to variations in water entry to the aquifer such as hydraulic gradient or surficial recharge this hypothesis is reinforced by the sensitivity analysis fig 9 indicating movement of the fsi on the order of magnitude of hundreds of meters and hence of the thermal plume due to changes in hydraulic gradient discrepancies between the model and field data regarding the movement of temperature are then due to the absence of changing recharge and hydraulic gradient in the model and they can be the object of study in future research oscillation of the recharge temperature allowed us to obtain a time series of temperature at x 285 m fig 11c with better fitting than the vertical logs fig 11b nevertheless lateral changes in hydraulic conductivity would be needed to achieve a better calibration of the results this model does not consider lateral changes in hydraulic conductivity that are likely to take place in the study area as it corresponds with a deltaic sedimentary architecture however it should be taken into consideration that there are field measurements that have been collected in different years and that climatic conditions are likely to be dissimilar therefore both temperature data and model results must be considered general indicators of trends even if the results have achieved a very high degree of matching between observations and model results the recharge temperature was decided based on the average temperature of the air in this region nevertheless for different seasons this temperature changes along the year with colder recharge during winter and warmer in summer in this region the temperature changes are relatively mild due to the proximity of the coast also recharge is almost inexistent during the warmest months of the year still a better characterization of recharge temperatures would be a useful input for further studies on this topic changes in temperature generated by seawater infiltration are an infrequent parameter considered in previous studies as hypothesized by kohout 1965 seawater infiltrates the aquifer and is warmed by geothermal heating however he assumed a constant temperature our results demonstrated that seasonal oscillation of sea temperature created a thermal signal in the aquifer that only affected the saltwater domain the fsi acts as a barrier for the thermal domains in freshwater dominated by the temperature associated with the geothermal input and the temperature of the recharge and saltwater affected by seawater infiltration and the deep processes associated with variable density convection hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient are clearly related favoring the flushing of the seawater thermal signal due to the upwards fresh groundwater flux near to the fsi the thermal barrier could be sharper in the case of the motril salobreña aquifer in comparison with other aquifers due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient however temperature separation is also expected in other study areas although the thermal barrier would be more or less evident depending on the conditions of the area such as the temperature difference between the aquifer and sea temperature variations along the sea water column were not considered in the model instead the same value of temperature was established at all depths preliminary analysis indicated that other parameters had more influence on the groundwater temperature distribution however its impact was not studied in detail due to the limited availability of seawater temperature data in depth cross disciplinary collaboration with both oceanographic and hydrogeologic viewpoints would strengthen the perspectives on this matter as has been highlighted previously duque et al 2020 human activities such as pumping altered groundwater flow producing saline upconing beneath the pumping area and enhancing the seawater intrusion the geometry of the fsi can be modified significantly with this process as has been the case of the andarax coastal aquifer stein et al 2020 given the close connection of the fsi with temperature distribution human induced changes can have a direct impact on the heat plume described in this work one general issue in the development of groundwater temperature models is how to obtain reliable temperature data temperature profiles inside wells can be highly affected by water circulation inside the casing and even the mixing of water when collecting data can generate problems if this is not performed carefully this problem has been discussed in previous research that has suggested alternative methods for measuring temperature such as shalev et al 2009 carrera et al 2010 and levanon et al 2016 some of the temperature data collected in this investigation have been obtained in similar wells but systematic collection with monthly campaigns and continued activity for years indicates that the temperature profiles are consistent for example elad et al 2017 indicated how these types of measurements show significant trends and prevalent dynamics for salinity it is not common to find deep wells in coastal areas well equipped for conducting research and drilling prices are prohibitive therefore as long as drilling and measuring technology is in the current state this type of temperature profile is our best approach for groundwater temperature research a recent investigation using dts fiber optic cables allowed us to obtain temperature profiles without flow inside the well folch et al 2020 but still the depth reached did not exceed 25 m this also indicates the utility at the moment of the development of numerical models to further scientific knowledge in areas where it is challenging to collect high quality data such as sensitivity analysis conducted in this study further progress in the development of more realistic models including lateral heterogeneity and seasonal hydrogeological processes will contribute to a better knowledge of heat transport processes in coastal aquifers 6 conclusion heat sources for groundwater in coastal aquifers include surface water recharge sea infiltration and geothermal heat each source produces a thermal signal within the aquifer generating changes in temperature at different depths recharge water temperature produces a surficial temperature zone that is highly variable throughout the year sea water temperature also produces a seasonal temperature oscillation within the saltwater domain these two sources are affected by seasonal changes while the earth s internal heat induces a continuous geothermal gradient within the aquifer that increases with depth in coastal aquifers all these factors coalesce in the area where groundwater discharges to the sea geothermal heat ascends boosted by variable density processes that bring deep aquifer water to the surface where recharge water and sea infiltration all meet generating a complex mix of different temperatures the variable density and temperature transport model using seawat revealed that the effect of the geothermal gradient is strongly dependent on the fsi and that the heat plume ascends following the fsi i e thermal contour of 19 c ascended 100 m in the proximity of the fsi for kx 300 m d and kx kz 10 the shape and position of the thermal plume depend on different parameters e g more flattened plumes affected by higher anisotropic ratios with the same values of kx in addition temperature also influences water density therefore the fsi can be modified with respect to a model without temperature species the fsi toe can be moved tens or even hundreds of meters depending on the aquifer properties by using or not using temperature the results indicated that the most sensitive parameters are hydraulic conductivity and thermal input at the base of the aquifer these findings demonstrate the importance of convection on heat transport in an aquifer with these characteristics high hydraulic conductivities and hydraulic gradient the changes in parameters open a range of possibilities for research and work in this sector with a view on the application to other study areas the case study model integrates the three heat sources into the same model which provides a better understanding of heat interactions with different origins as there are no precedents on including all the different temperature sources in coastal aquifers furthermore the model demonstrates the existence of a thermal barrier coinciding with the position of the fsi that separates the temperature of the saltwater and freshwater despite our results are focused on one case study many of our findings could be applied to other coastal aquifers as the temperature barrier of the fsi the plume of higher temperature associated with geothermal heat especially in aquifers with significant thickness and the presence of different temperature sectors that can be identified at different depths still geological conditions can play a fundamental role in these processes and aquifers with higher heterogeneity alternation of layers with high contrast in hydraulic conductivity or different temperature seasonality can generate a picture differing from what has been presented in this work this is the first attempt at providing a full picture of temperature distribution in coastal aquifers but further research applying a similar methodology to other hydrogeological settings climatic conditions and with more focus on the simplified aspects that have been done in this study would help to provide answers to this emerging field of research the use of heat as a tracer in hydrogeological studies is growing in interest as this is a reliable and inexpensive tracer in this study we discussed the major processes and the effect of parameters on the application of temperature in coastal aquifers where a number of processes generate a different picture of what can be found in other coastal or non coastal settings credit

of xiaohui lei associate editor the longitudinal profile of rivers in active orogenic belts records the competitive process occurring between erosion and uplift and the knickpoint as a unique sign can support this a series of distinctive knickpoints are distributed at different heights in the basin of the layue river which is a tributary located on the northwest side of the yurlung tsangpo basin china by combining the stream power erosion model and field investigation this paper explores the relationship among dams knickpoints and the normalized steepness index ksn in addition to sporadic damming type knickpoints a 4 k knickpoint group located in the basin has attracted attention using the slope area analysis method and the integration analysis method paleo profile reconstruction of 14 tributaries and trunks was carried out to estimate the resulting paleo relief and net uplift the results show that the topographic relief increases by 35 3 214 3 during the process in which the knickpoint entered into the basin and spread which is the result of the growth and retreat of the knickpoint using the celerity model for the 4 k knickpoint group 83 3 of the model knickpoints are less than 5 km away from the observed knickpoints which indicates that the model is suitable for application in the layue river basin and the migration rate of the knickpoint in the layue basin is 10

2008 wang et al 2014 xiao et al 2015 in active orogenic belts an increase in the bedrock uplift rate or a decrease in the relative baseline level may cause river erosion to accelerate and spread upstream through the drainage network thereby changing the channel slope hillslope relief and average erosion rate e g crosby and whipple 2006 castillo et al 2017 liu et al 2020 under such circumstances the original boundary conditions are changed and the balance maintained by the landscape is also broken a long duration is required for the fluvial response to adapt to this new transient usually for several tens of m y a long response time leads to disjoint between the original landscape and the later boundary conditions which could form a remarkable geomorphic sign namely a knickpoint clark et al 2005 the knickpoint is usually defined as a sudden change in the slope of a river profile and this change in slope is often placed in a power law function to discuss its relationship with the drainage area flint 1974 snyder et al 2003 wobus et al 2006 kirby and whipple 2012 the steepness index and concavity are used to characterize the erosion rate and bedrock uplift rate in above power law function snyder et al 2006 whittaker et al 2007 dibiase et al 2010 in the expression of quantitative relationships the slope area analysis method and integral method are widely used in river profile analysis whipple 2004 berlin and anderson 2007 perron and royden 2013 jaiswara et al 2019a jaiswara et al 2019b the former performs well in the calculation of concavity however due to the error propagation in the process of elevation data and slope calculation the data are scattered and regularity is difficult to identify perron and royden 2013 proposed the integration method and specific parameter chi χ to solve the above problems wang et al 2017 combined the two methods and carried out research in the mendocino triple junction area usa through the durbin watson statistical test the linear correlation regression residuals were investigated and eliminated and more accurate reference river dynamic parameters were obtained the knickpoint divides a river profile into two reaches with different slopes the upper reach of the knickpoint is called the relict reach or paleo reach which records the paleotectonic conditions and climate change characteristics the paleo longitudinal channel profile can be reconstructed by projecting the basin outlet in front of a mountain by using the relevant parameters derived from the relict reach clark et al 2005 however a critical threshold must be considered to divide the watershed so that the process of slope deposition and alluvial processes can be distinguished based on the above method the net uplift and paleo relief of each reach can be estimated the celerity model can be used to simulate the spatial distribution of knickpoints with time schmidt et al 2015 jaiswara et al 2019a the model simulates the propagation of a single erosion wave along the main stream and gradually distributes itself to fewer tributaries crosby and whipple 2006 berlin and anderson 2007 a collection of studies have found that the shape change of longitudinal river profile has a substantial response to natural damming events which may be caused by giant landslides large debris flows or rock avalanches hewitt 1998 korup 2006 korup et al 2006 ouimet et al 2007 korup et al 2010 walsh et al 2012 ahmed et al 2018 2019 zhao et al 2019 hewitt 1998 studied the properties and geomorphic effects of rock avalanche sediments blocking rivers in the karakoram himalaya area they are reconstructed in terms of the location and nature of sediments resulting from rock avalanches and the response of rivers to their disturbance according to the moraine dam theory proposed by korup and montgomery 2008 the river channel is blocked by the impoundment of moraine dams which are widely distributed upstream of the yarlung tsangpo river china as a result it hindered the retreat of the knickpoint upstream and concentrated the erosion in the reach below the knickpoint which played an important role in maintaining the integrity of the tibetan plateau this study conducted a detailed field survey of the layue river china and found that there were many large natural dams in the basin caused by landslides debris flows or large rockfall in addition a number of thick deposits of fine grained materials were discovered which may be remnants of large damming events to explore the relationship between these geological phenomena and the evolution of regional geomorphology this paper carried out a study on the distribution of knickpoints in the layue basin reconstructed the paleo longitudinal profiles of the trunk and tributaries in the region and estimated the resulting paleo relief and net uplift finally the celerity model was used to estimate the pattern of knickpoint headward migration based on dating results 2 study area 2 1 geological conditions the layue basin is located on the northwest side of the eastern himalaya syntaxis with a sinistral strike slip fault zone running along the river lulang river and a dextral strike slip jiali fault zone on the north side the study area is cut by the indus yarlung suture zone and surrounded by the lhasa block which consists of low to medium metamorphic metasedimentary rocks granite zones layered gneiss layered gneiss intervals and gangdese plutons fig 1 zeitler et al 2014 the interior is the himalayan block roughly bounded by the nam la thrust fault with the namche barwa antiform in the southeast and the namche barwa peak in the north due to strong tectonic activities heavy precipitation gradients and glacial processes in the alpine region the denudation rate of the eastern himalayan syntaxis reached as high as 8 mm a within the past 1 million years enkelmann et al 2011 in addition thermochronological studies show that the cooling ages of the rocks in the layue basin are relatively new 0 6 6 ma as two extreme values indicating that the basin has experienced river erosion and rock mass exhumation since the mio pliocene malloy et al 2003 stewart et al 2008 2 2 topography the strong tectonic action that occurred in the region influenced the topography in the study area which mainly consist of deep cut valleys with the highest elevation being 6802 m i e the gyala peir peak the elevation of the bottom of the valley is approximately 2000 m and the straight line distance is slightly longer than 20 km this creates noticeable relief in the area high mountains collide with warm and humid air from the indian ocean along the yarlung tsangpo river creating widespread marine glaciers in the region the modern equilibrium line altitude is more than 4400 m loibl et al 2014 but during the last glacial maximum it was much lower than the present elevation glaciation plays an important role in shaping the present landforms zhou et al 2010 hu et al 2020 in particular there are more than 20 glacial lakes in the study area with areas in the range of 0 1 1 8 km2 and most of them are distributed at an elevation of more than 4000 m the dongjiu and lulang rivers are two tributaries flowing in a near perpendicular direction and after their confluence they are known as the layue river fig 1 2 3 natural damming event in the study area and adjacent region various gravity type geological disaster events occur frequently li et al 2021a li et al 2021b for example debris flows in the tianmo gully wei et al 2017 and guxiang gully yu et al 2020 zou et al 2020 and large scale landslides in the layue du 2017 caused blocking events in the parlung tsangpo river two large scale rock landslides occurred in the yigong tsangpo river forming landslide dams and an extensive lake delaney and evans 2015 the jiaobunong landslide blocked the lulang river which made the river channel shrink rapidly and formed a valley approximately 2 km wide upstream fig 2 a d the resulting dam had a height of 270 m and a volume of 3 58 108 m3 wang et al 2019 all of these natural damming events formed lake sediments of a certain scale in the river channel which had an impact on the longitudinal profile of the river and might have formed a knickpoint ouimet et al 2007 in addition there is a large deposit on the left bank of the dongjiu river which is referred to as the baimu deposit fig 2c f h volume 2 109 m3 this has also been noted by previous researchers korup and montgomery 2008 korup et al 2010 the delun landslide dam is located downstream of the dongjiu village which has a height of 150 m and a volume of 2 5 108 m3 fig 2b e we focus on the three giant bodies that have been investigated in the field and denoted as damming events namely the jiaobunong and delun landslide dams and the baimu deposit these dams have an important impact on the evolution of the river profile and the distribution of river knickpoints throughout the whole region therefore based on the analysis of river profiles and natural dams the distribution of knickpoints and the river evolution of the layue basin are studied in this paper 3 methods 3 1 channel profile analysis rivers tend to have flat and concave profiles due to their increased drainage area and reduced slope the stream power model is able to express a power law relationship between the local channel slope s and the corresponding drainage area a which can be used to describe the rate of uplift and the evolution of knickpoints in river geomorphology flint 1974 1 s k s a θ 2 k s u k 1 n 3 θ m n where ks is the steepness index θ is the concavity index m and n are constants u is the bedrock uplift rate and k is the erodibility coefficient in the above calculations small changes and or uncertainties in θ can lead to significant variations in k s a normalized steepness index k sn with a reference concavity θ ref can correlate catchments of various shapes and sizes wobus et al 2006 4 s k sn a θ r e f o r k sn k s a θ r e f θ the steepness and concavity indices can be found more directly by a logarithmic variation of eq 1 namely the slope area s a analysis method however the s a method makes the results more inaccurate due to the introduction of elevation differentiation and the scattered nature of the resulting data perron and royden 2013 goren et al 2014 wang et al 2017 nones et al 2019 the integration method proposed by perron and royden 2013 can avoid the abovementioned errors to retain river profile information by integrating eq 1 we can obtain the following results 5 z x z b u ka o m 1 n χ x 6 χ x 0 x a 0 a x m n d x where χ is the chi value and zb is the elevation at the base level of the drainage network at x xb the parameter a0 is the reference area which can take any value to make the coefficient and integrand dimensionless but when comparing the steepness of the transformed contour it is important to use the same value of a0 to calculate χ perron and royden 2013 in this study a0 1 m2 this type of plot based on the change in horizontal spatial coordinates of the longitudinal profile of the river is referred to as a chi plot χ z plot although data dispersion does exist the s a analysis method is by far the most straightforward method to determine the concavity index in contrast the integral method has mainly been applied to estimate river power parameters and to determine the steepness index perron and royden 2013 combining the two and comparing the results often leads to more satisfactory results wang et al 2017 therefore both methods are used in this study for the calculation of river profiles we used 12 5 m digital elevation model dem data from the advanced land observing satellite search asf alaska edu in 2011 for the layue basin the stream network extraction and cumulative flow raster was obtained by hydrological preprocessing of the dem through arcgis software then the above data files are imported into the matlab script provided by jaiswara et al 2019a to complete the application of the model the window smoothing distance is set to 1000 m and the rest of the parameters are set to the default parameters the critical area is a value in square meters which is considered the lowest accumulation area for automatically selecting the channels the smaller the critical area is the larger the number of identified channels through several pre experiments 1 0 107 was set as the critical area for the layue basin at which point a total of 58 channels were selected for river profile analysis 3 2 reconstruction of the paleo profile in an active orogenic belt such as the eastern himalayan syntaxes zeitler et al 2014 transient events can usually persist for tens of millions of years long durations may cause relict landscapes to disjoin modern tectonic conditions thus becoming a passive indicator of the vertical displacement of the earth s surface clark et al 2005 researchers can use the characteristics of relict landscapes to describe paleo landforms in this disjointed state to estimate the magnitude of paleo relief in the layue basin we first determined the paleo base level of the relict surface using the channel segments above the knickpoints gallen et al 2013 using an empirically derived rule of scale the equilibrium longitudinal profile of the relict reach was reconstructed by relating the local channel slope s to the drainage area a through channel steepness k s and concavity θ parameters as shown in eq 1 channel parameters measured from relict reaches were used to infer the original channel profile downstream of the confluence with the main stem clark et al 2005 the reconstructed paleo channel elevation will provide a minimum estimate of the total amount of surface uplift and or incision kirby and whipple 2012 the two methods mentioned above i e the s a analysis method and χ analysis method can be used to reconstruct the paleo base level wang et al 2017 jaiswara et al 2019a jaiswara et al 2019b 3 3 celerity model it is a popular interpretation mechanism to regard the headward erosion of the knickpoint as a motion wave that breaks the steady state of the river crosby and whipple 2006 proposed a celerity model to explain how knickpoints propagate through river networks the model can explain the essential characteristics of knickpoint mobility and homology the following equation is used to describe the retreat rate of the knickpoint 7 dx d t c a p where dx dt is the retreat rate of the knickpoint m yr c is the erosion coefficient m 1 2p yr 1 a is the upstream contribution drainage area and p is a dimensionless constant reflecting the dependence of the rate on the basin area the celerity model uses the dynamic time step method to calculate the cumulative time along the longitudinal profile path of the river through each pixel linear or diagonal distance crosby and whipple 2006 when the cumulative time of the knickpoint is greater than or equal to the total time set by the model the model runs out the two parameters c and p in the equation are obtained by an two dimensional algorithm the purpose of which is to minimize the misfit between the modeled and observed knickpoints it usually relies on the interval given in the literature crosby and whipple 2006 berlin and anderson 2007 in the celerity model some factors that may affect the rate are ignored including the displacement bedrock lithology sediment type thickness etc but there is no evidence that increasing the complexity of the model can improve the accuracy of the prediction kirby and whipple 2012 nones 2020 a flow chart is given to better understand the relationships and results of the various methods fig 3 4 results and analysis 4 1 reference concavity to computationally implement the χ z plot and the normalized steepness index calculation it is first necessary to determine the appropriate reference concavity perron and royden 2013 wang et al 2017 in this paper 58 channels in the layue river basin are selected and calculated based on a series of concavity values ranging from 0 to 1 in steps of 0 05 theoretically the constraint condition is that a reasonable reference concavity θ ref should both linearize all the chi χ profiles and collapse the tributaries and main stem to a single line perron and royden 2013 this means that when the tributary and the mainstream have the same uplift rate and erosion parameters the above constraints should be met therefore the significance of selecting the reference concavity lies in obtaining the normalized steepness index k sn of the layue basin under the same conditions to facilitate the overall evaluation with the increase in the number of branches the constraints that strictly meet the above conditions will become weak wang et al 2017 further elevation scatter is used to measure the constraint performance the χ space is subdivided into 100 bins and the scatter points are defined by the distribution average of the elevation standard deviation within each bin perron and royden 2013 wang et al 2017 when the elevation scatter takes the lowest value the optimal reference concavity is obtained compared to fig 4 b the tributaries in fig 4 a are clearly biased to one side while fig 4 c has a poor linearization of the tributaries and main streams also the elevation scatter reaches its minimum value when θ 0 45 fig 4d finally 0 45 was selected as the reference concavity θ ref for the study area 4 2 knickpoint distribution and dams the channel profiles of the layue basin were calculated and drawn according to the matlab script jaiswara et al 2019b three kinds of plots are obtained including a river profile b logarithmic plot of area and slope and c chi plot any plot from which the knickpoint is most easily identified is selected and the location of the knickpoint is manually selected and a segmental fit of the channel data on either side of it is carried out then the fit is automatically calculated for the corresponding position in the two remaining plots the result of the knickpoint identification we require to exceed a given thresholds greater than 20 m in elevation drop coupled with a slope threshold 0 1 gallen et al 2013 finally 52 knickpoints in the basin were identified including 15 damming type knickpoints fig 5 a according to the distribution histogram of the knickpoint elevation frequency fig 5d the knickpoints of the river are distributed at an elevation of 3000 m or above and are intensively distributed near the gray contour line of 4000 m fig 5a which is called the 4 k knickpoint group the comparable height and radial distribution of these knickpoints indicate that they evolved from a coeval origin berlin and anderson 2007 gallen et al 2013 jaiswara et al 2019a the results of the longitudinal profile of the basin show that the 4 k knickpoint group contains few n 2 damming type knickpoints fig 5d but their causes are different so they are excluded from the 4 k knickpoint group studied for the damming type knickpoints their distribution elevation is relatively low and most of them n 13 are lower than 3750 m their location is random and controlled by the location of events such as landslides debris flows and rockfalls the distribution range of elevation is also the obvious difference between the two types of knickpoints systematic changes in the normalized steepness index k sn often reflect the state of regional uplift and erosion in the basin with a higher uplift rate it will be affected by the erosion of river network system which leads to the increase of k sn whipple 2004 wobus et al 2006 in practical calculations the steepness index is derived from the dem which is the comprehensive products of all the earth surfaces processes thus there is often a spatial correspondence between local abrupt changes in the k sn and external disturbances such as large landslides and debris flows this relationship is applied as a marker for determining the blockage of rivers by landslide dams korup 2006 korup et al 2006 ahmed et al 2018 ahmed et al 2019 the maximum k sn in the layue basin is 1782 48 m0 9 fig 6 a which appears in the downstream part of the main channel the minimum k sn value appears at the location of the glacial lake close to the source of the gully the irregular polygon drawn by the white line fifteen channels are selected to calculate the k sn values upstream and downstream of the knickpoints which represent the characteristics of the relict reach and the modern reach the average values of k sn upstream and downstream are 103 3 10 7 m0 9 and 397 43 3 m0 9 respectively the systematic changes of k sn clearly shows the active adaptation to the uplift erosion stage in the downstream reaches of the knickpoint the local abrupt change in the downstream steepness index of the delun landslide and jiaobunong landslide is in response to natural damming events and the corresponding k sn suddenly increases by 300 to even greater than 600 fig 6 in addition several other similar events in the study area can be found on the k sn distribution map for the baimu deposit its volume is estimated to be more than 2 billion square meters such a large scale barrier dam should correspond to an obvious response on the river profile korup 2006 korup et al 2006 but this is not the case in the analysis of the longitudinal profile of the dongjiu channel no corresponding knickpoints were formed the ksn along the river did not change abruptly in the range of 212 287 m0 9 indicating that the evolution of the baimu deposit did not directly affect the longitudinal profile of the dongjiu river at least it did not match its potential volume to explain the inconsistency between the volume and the result some possibilities are 1 the true volume or sliding direction of the baimu deposit is misestimated and misjudged which may indicate that it has no impact on the river in other words the actual baimu deposit has only experienced some small volume sliding 2 the change in the width of the dongjiu river channel led to the lack of a knickpoint on the longitudinal profile when the baimu deposit blocked the river the river was diverted to a floodplain or a river terrace with similar conditions as the original river course korup et al 2006 dongjiu river was only partially narrowed however the above are all inferences based on a strange phenomenon revealed by the knickpoint analysis 4 3 river profile reconstruction results the reconstruction of river profiles can estimate the amount of river erosion and the paleo topography the results of the reconstruction of the lulang channel are controlled by two main knickpoints including the knickpoint caused by the jiaobunong landslide abbreviated as jbn kp highlighted in fig 5a d due to the impact of two influential knickpoints the longitudinal profile of the lulang river is divided into the relict reach the intermediate reach and the modern reach fig 7 a in the s a analysis method the threshold value of the watershed area can be used to distinguish the reach dominated by slope deposits or bedrock reaches dominated by river erosion and to adopt different threshold values for different watershed areas the average concavity θ of the remaining and middle reaches is 0 22 0 11 and 0 64 0 11 with normalized steepness indices k sn of 159 m0 9 and 198 m0 9 respectively fig 7b according to the above parameters the net uplift solid black line with arrow is 1656 55 m by subtracting the uplift from the drainage divide elevation the paleo relief solid blue line with arrow is 1065 m in addition the net uplift of the intermediate reach controlled by jbn kp is 1196 47 m dotted blackline with arrow which reveals that the jiaobunong landslide dam controls and changes the profile of the lulang river the landslide makes the deposition of the upstream reach more obvious and the downstream erosion increase especially after the landslide dam is destroyed in the s a analysis the accumulation paths of modern rivers on each pixel are used to reconstruct the paleo profile however χ analysis is a linear projection of the slope of the χ interval representing the relict reach fig 7c the net uplift of the basin is 1635 m in the results of χ analysis and the maximum difference between the two methods is only 4 6 indicating the consistency of the two methods the whole drainage basin has experienced a net uplift of at least 1600 m accordingly the projection results of the middle reach based on jbn kp are also given in χ analysis in addition to the lulang channel corresponding to channel no 8 in fig 5a the remaining 14 channels in the basin have also been reconstructed which retained the relict reach the elevation of most reconstructed confluences is approximately 3600 m fig d1 and table d1 in the appendix which is 1600 m higher than that of modern confluences therefore it can be considered that these knickpoints in the layue basin evolved from the same paleo level along with an erosion wave 4 4 celerity model results we used the celerity model to model the 4 k knickpoint group in the layue basin to understand the process of headward migration based on a variety of available dating data malloy et al 2003 stewart et al 2008 cooling age of the rock mass in the layue basin is generally between 1 and 6 ma fig 1 but two abnormal values are ignored therefore in the celerity velocity model it can be assumed that the initial time of the knickpoint headward migration is 1 25 6 ma with an interval of 0 25 ma to consider the reasonableness of the initial time period of the model the volume for time substitution method was used as a reference crosby and whipple 2006 berlin and anderson 2007 norton et al 2008 gallen et al 2013 and the results indicate an initial time of 1 28 5 10 ma method i and table d2 in the appendix which is essentially the same as the above choice in searching for the best combination of c and p we allow p to vary linearly between 0 2 and 1 2 over 40 values while c varies logarithmically between 10 10 and 10 4 over 500 values the c and p parameters are determined by minimizing the misfit between the modeled knickpoint and the observed knickpoint in each model run finally the two parameters are locked in a narrow range berlin and anderson 2007 the results show that the minimum model mismatch occurs in the following range fig 8 a c parameter ranges from 2 62 10 9 to 1 27 10 8 which is roughly in the range of an order of magnitude while the corresponding p parameter ranges from 0 76 to 0 79 which is basically in the same range as the celerity model of bedrock rivers loget and driessche 2009 jaiswara et al 2019b the least square sum of residuals is the estimator of model mismatch and the final distribution ranges between 1 637 109 and 1 639 109 fig 8b the celerity model of the layue basin shows that the average retreat rate of the knickpoint is 10 8 51 7 km ma fig 8c in a series of model results an initial time of 6 ma was chosen for illustration as the model possesses a minimum sum of square residuals fig 9 the results of the final celerity model show that the misfit between the observed and modeled knickpoints lie between 16 3 and 23 2 km with negative values representing modeled knickpoints located downstream of the observed knickpoints the majority 18 of 24 of the predicted nodal points were within 5 km of their true counterparts with an average distance of 6 4 km through regression analysis the linear relationship between the knickpoint position obtained by modeling and the observed knickpoint position is y 0 9597x 5 126 and the correlation coefficient is 0 9332 which indicates that the model fits the distribution of knickpoints well it is also noted that the propagation rate of the knickpoints in the main stream is faster than that in the tributaries especially within the last 2 ma of this model 5 discussion in this study two types of knickpoints in the layue basin are distinguished i the damming type knickpoint represented by the jbn kp ii homologous knickpoints 4 k knickpoint group which are usually called slope break type knickpoints this leads to two different directions in the study of knickpoints in the layue basin 5 1 reconstruction of paleo profile the eastern himalayan syntaxis and its surrounding areas are one of the most frequent areas of earth s tectonic activities considering that surface uplift erosion is a regional phenomenon this study reconstructed a total of 15 paleo profile in the layue basin the paleo relief is distinguished based on the relict reach and the results show that the basin has experienced a net uplift of approximately 1600 m which means that the river may have undergone an equal amount of river undercutting the layue basin has experienced intense geomorphological evolution activities although it is lower than the erosion in the central section of the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon and the dibang basin further downstream 2028 132 m jaiswara et al 2019a this is substantially higher than the cullasaja basin in southern appalachia 480 30 m gallen et al 2013 locally the relief of the southwest south side of the layue basin changed more obviously the results of the reconstruction of channels no 2 to no 9 show that the relief has increased by more than 100 and the erosion of channels no 3 and no 6 is largest table d1 this is directly related to regional lithology changes the south is gangdese plutonic rocks while the north is the metasedimentary rocks of the lhasa block mostly slate and phyllite fig 1 the concavity index of the river upstream of the knickpoint is used to reconstruct the paleo profile the reconstructions show that the concavity index of most of the channels lies between 0 45 and 0 65 table d1 channel numbers 6 7 9 10 12 13 14 and 15 suggesting that the geological characteristics of the channels the upstream of knickpoint are similar within the layue watershed whipple 2004 however a small part of the concavity index deviated from this range showing a lower or higher concavity index although the erosion history of the surface of the relic reaches is not clear the unusual concavity index is thought to be due to diffuse steepening above the knickpoint berlin and anderson 2007 it seems possible to use a usual concavity index 0 45 0 65 to replace these out of range values for paleo profile reconstruction to reflect more reasonable geological information whipple 2004 wang et al 2017 however this simplification is tempting but not strictly accurate following a step change in the relative uplift rate the upstream propagating knickpoints experience stable vertical velocities and therefore have similar concavity indices niemann et al 2001 consequently as more complex relative uplift histories are examined notable differences in the relic reach above the knickpoints occur across tributary channels the rapid exhumation of yurlung tsangpo grand canyon is accepted by most scholars and it is generally believed that the exhumation rate can reach 10 mm a e g finnegan et al 2008 zeitler et al 2014 schmidt et al 2015 king et al 2016 yang et al 2018 liu 2020 the rapid exhumation of the northern basin is in response to the rapid uplift which is the result of the northward expansion of the eastern himalayan syntaxis king et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the layue basin is in the north western part of the eastern himalayan syntaxis and it is undeniably an area of rapid exhumation especially in the valley of the layue river i e after the confluence of the two tributaries when the initial time of the knickpoint entering the basin is set at 1 25 6 ma the exhumation rate derived from the profile reconstruction result is 0 27 1 28 mm a in this study according to the research results of king et al 2016 and yang et al 2018 the exhumation rate of the tributaries lulang river and dongjiu river in the layue basin is 1 5 mm a which is higher than or equal to the results obtained by us but note that the layue basin is not the focus of the above studies and there may be some errors our results are closer to the exhumation rate at the confluence of niyang river and yurlung tsangpo river which is 0 25 mm a zeitler et al 2014 schmidt et al 2015 besides the dominant tectonic factors the exhumation rate is related to stream power precipitation and lithology for example the stream power of the layue river is less than 360 w m2 finnegan et al 2008 which is far lower than that of the yurlung tsangbo river grand canyon 1000 w m2 larsen and montgomery 2012 resulting in the lower exhumation rate of the former through an analysis of the yigong tsangpo river dating results liu 2020 suggested that the exhumation rate tends to decrease as one moves away from the central area of the eastern himalayan syntaxis along the river channel furthermore there is a temporal scale problem in the discussion of exhumation rate additionally according to the elevation and location of jbn kp the intermediate reach has also been reconstructed with the corresponding paleo profile blue dotted line in fig 7 the intermediate paleo profile is not in a real state but this process can be used to analyze the impact of the knickpoint on the river it corresponds to another uplift erosion transient motion in the basin to adjust the change in the regional base level caused by the landslide dam although there are obvious differences in the mechanisms of the two types of knickpoints from the results of the reconstruction it can be seen that the knickpoints produced by the damming events have no lesser impact on the evolution of river geomorphology than structural or climatic conditions this impact is limited to a specific time frame usually less than one hundred thousand years 5 2 knickpoint migration the celerity model believes that the knickpoint propagates through the entire river network at the rate of the power law function of the upstream area in the model we mainly test the effect of changes in the c parameter and p parameter value the above two parameters are derived from references in similar regions on average however the modeled knickpoint is located downstream of the observed knickpoint so a larger c parameter may give more relevant results the sum of the least square residual for the model is between 1 67 109 and 1 69 109 in km2 fig 8b which evaluates the performance of the model in a range larger than the results from gallen et al 2013 and jaiswara et al 2019a but close to the results from berlin and anderson 2007 the residual sum of squares is strongly influenced by extreme values in the modeling results for 6 ma 16 67 4 blue dots out of 24 results in fig 9b of the model results are more than 10 km away from the observations with one extreme value of 23 km when the extremes are removed the residuals drop to 4 84 108 typically the natural rate of knickpoint migration is so slow that it is difficult to achieve measurements in the field berlin and anderson 2007 except for studies carried out under special conditions such as fragile bedrock and extremely large drainage volumes the celerity model utilized for this study estimated migration rates in the layue basin of 21 5 103 4 km ma in the statistical results of loget and driessche 2009 the retreat rate of the study area is basically equal to or lower than that in the literature under similar migration times and areas indicating the rationality of the study area when the initial time was set to 1 6 ma the knickpoint retreat rate within the layue basin was 40 km ma fig 8c this result is close to the jiacha knickpoint retreat rate of the yurlung tsangpo river studied by schmidt et al 2015 using the same model however their interpretation of 3d thermokinematic model pecube yielded a knickpoint retreat rate of 30 km ma the large discrepancy in the rate of knickpoint retreat may result from the simplified nature of the pecube which does not contain the full evolutionary character of the landscape we use the cooling age and volume for time substitution method to give the initial time of the celerity model but there is still a large uncertainty many scholars have suggested that the namcha barwa region has undergone strong tectonic uplift seward and burg 2008 tu et al 2015 zeitler et al 2014 and possible hydrological reorganization e g hallet and molnar 2001 clark et al 2004 liang et al 2008 lang and huntington 2014 robinson et al 2014 all the studies indicate that the layue river did not undergo a change in flow direction but the erosion waves that formed the knickpoint could have come from two directions into the basin namely the direction of the parlung tsangpo river before the reorganization and the direction of the po tsangpo river after the reorganization we prefer the latter as both hydrological reorganization and knickpoint retreat are the result of changes in the erosional datum caused by tectonic uplift stewart et al 2008 enkelmann et al 2011 schmidt et al 2015 this means that the initial timing of the celerity model may be limited by the timing of riverine capture in the region there is a significant gap between the knickpoints in the fast model and the observed ones this is because the role of glacial lakes in modern profiles is obvious especially when judging the remaining river sections because the distribution of these glacial lakes is often distributed near a given threshold of watershed area in addition the methods and modeling ideas described in this study are based on a digital elevation model dem for extraction and analysis however the accuracy of the dem may be the most fundamental factor affecting the model therefore it is necessary to discuss the knickpoint distribution and evolution models under different dem accuracy conditions boulton and stokes 2018 jaiswara et al 2020 5 3 effect of natural damming events on river profiles a case study from jiaobunong landslide it is believed that many natural dams in history were short lived and 80 of them were destroyed in 6 months or even less costa and schuster 1988 ermini and casagli 2003 however we have found that rivers in the layue basin have been blocked for a long time the spatial pattern of incisions and sedimentation caused by damming events in mountain rivers can be seen in both the longitudinal profile and the slope area map korup 2006 figs 6 and 7 moreover these damming type knickpoints are fixed in space compared with moving slope break type knickpoints they do not share a coeval source hayakawa and oguchi 2009 jaiswara et al 2019b the impact of the dam on the longitudinal profile of the river can provide a new perspective and entry point for explaining the evolution of river geomorphology the presence of a knickpoint at the jiaobunong landslide is obvious as the location of the knickpoint coincides with the landslide the question of whether it was caused by the landslide is raised alternatively it is a coincidence of the two because the knickpoint during the process of headward migration reached jiaobunong and changed the local geological conditions causing the landslide thereafter the jiaobunong landslide is abbreviated as jbn l we will put forth the following two hypotheses hypothesis 1 jbn kp led to jbn l hypothesis 2 jbn l caused jbn kp for hypothesis 1 the jbn kp is identified as a mobile knickpoint formed by erosion in this case we can consider the issue regarding the timing with the jbn kp landslide occurring at 20 30 ka wang et al 2019 the erosion process of the knickpoint throughout the whole layue watershed was simulated by the celerity model the time scale of landslide occurrence is 1 50 1 200 of the celerity model the distance that the rift point migrates to the landslide is 2 3 of the celerity model however this value can be adjusted to 1 2 of the celerity model taking into account that the retreat rate of the knickpoint decreases as the watershed area decreases crosby and whipple 2006 gallen et al 2013 at this point the retreat rate of the knickpoint can be simply estimated to be 25 100 times the celerity model rate i e 250 5000 km ma this exaggerated result far exceeds the range of knickpoint retreat rates 20 40 km ma calculated by schmidt et al 2015 jaiswara et al 2019a and jaiswara et al 2019b for the eastern himalayan syntaxis the above results illustrate the mismatch between the retreat rate of knickpoint and the time of occurrence of jbn l which proves that hypothesis 1 is unreasonable considering hypothesis 2 the jbn kp is a damming type knickpoint in this case the knickpoint formed by headward migration must have eroded somewhere upstream of the landslide indeed another knickpoint exists upstream hypothesis 2 may hold due to two reasons on the one hand the time of occurrence of the landslide ka level is short compared to the time of knickpoint headward migration ma level therefore it was able to leave a sufficiently visible trace on the longitudinal profile of the river on the other hand the narrower gully in which jbn l is located and the presence of mountains on the opposite bank impede the movement of this super large landslide resulting in the formation of a large thick leading edge of jbn l the present day jbn l has a topographic difference of 300 m fig 10 a this feature can be seen even more clearly when comparing the morphology of another famous landslide fig 10b guo et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 the great thickness of the mound makes the erosion process even slower therefore we consider hypothesis 2 to be more reasonable as stated by korup et al 2006 the high steepness and specific stream power represented by knickpoints are not always the cause but often a result of large natural damming events in mountain basins according to the reconstruction of the paleo profile the net uplift of the damming type knickpoint represented by jbn kp is 1196 47 m note that this uplift does not exist in fact but only uses a similar reconstruction process to express the control effect of landslide on the river profile while the slope break type knickpoint of headward migration is 1656 55 m fig d1 and table d1 in the appendix have already given the reconstruction results of paleo profiles of the other 14 channels compared with the reconstruction process of two kinds of knickpoints in the current river profile the obvious control effect of large natural dams on the river profile is similar to the driving force of climate and tectonic action however they represent different time scales on a million year time scale the impacts of similar landslides debris flows and rock collapses will disappear completely in other words within a short time range 104 a the natural damming event will have an obvious influence on the river profile similar to that driven by climate and tectonic action 6 conclusion the layue basin located near the eastern himalayan syntaxis has undergone strong geomorphological evolution and many different types of knickpoints have developed in the basin in this study it is divided into the movable 4 k knickpoint group and fixed damming type knickpoints based on the slope area analysis and χ analysis method it is shown that most of the knickpoints in the layue basin are mainly distributed at 4000 m but the regularity of damming type knickpoints is not obvious based on the analysis of the location of the knickpoints and the normalized steepness index ksn the geomorphic features of the three natural damming events investigated in the field are discussed both the jiaobunong and delun landslides have an obvious knickpoint and the normalized steepness index changes suddenly however the baimu deposit has little effect on the longitudinal profile of the river so it is recognized that it may not be a large volume landslide dam or moraine dam fifteen channels were selected to reconstruct the paleo profile the results show that the average relief of the basin has increased by approximately 104 since the knickpoint entered the basin indicating that the basin has experienced significant uplift and erosion the celerity model was used to model the observed knickpoints and the results showed that the model was highly consistent indicating the mobility and homology of 4 k knickpoint group in addition a paleo profile reconstruction or projection process was carried out for the intermediate reach corresponding to the jbn kp combined with the results of the celerity model this confirms the apparent control of the river profile by large landslides over short time periods credit authorship contribution statement

china by combining the stream power erosion model and field investigation this paper explores the relationship among dams knickpoints and the normalized steepness index ksn in addition to sporadic damming type knickpoints a 4 k knickpoint group located in the basin has attracted attention using the slope area analysis method and the integration analysis method paleo profile reconstruction of 14 tributaries and trunks was carried out to estimate the resulting paleo relief and net uplift the results show that the topographic relief increases by 35 3 214 3 during the process in which the knickpoint entered into the basin and spread which is the result of the growth and retreat of the knickpoint using the celerity model for the 4 k knickpoint group 83 3 of the model knickpoints are less than 5 km away from the observed knickpoints which indicates that the model is suitable for application in the layue river basin and the migration rate of the knickpoint in the layue basin is 10

circumstances the original boundary conditions are changed and the balance maintained by the landscape is also broken a long duration is required for the fluvial response to adapt to this new transient usually for several tens of m y a long response time leads to disjoint between the original landscape and the later boundary conditions which could form a remarkable geomorphic sign namely a knickpoint clark et al 2005 the knickpoint is usually defined as a sudden change in the slope of a river profile and this change in slope is often placed in a power law function to discuss its relationship with the drainage area flint 1974 snyder et al 2003 wobus et al 2006 kirby and whipple 2012 the steepness index and concavity are used to characterize the erosion rate and bedrock uplift

due to the error propagation in the process of elevation data and slope calculation the data are scattered and regularity is difficult to identify perron and royden 2013 proposed the integration

statistical test the linear correlation regression residuals were investigated and eliminated and more accurate reference river dynamic parameters were obtained the knickpoint divides a river profile into two reaches with different slopes the upper reach of the knickpoint is called the relict reach or paleo reach which records the paleotectonic conditions and climate change characteristics the paleo longitudinal channel profile can be reconstructed by projecting the basin outlet in front of a mountain by using the relevant parameters derived from the relict reach clark et al 2005 however a critical threshold must be considered to divide the watershed so that the process of slope deposition and alluvial processes can be distinguished based on the above method the net uplift and paleo relief of each reach can be estimated the celerity model can be used to simulate the spatial distribution of knickpoints with time schmidt et al 2015 jaiswara et al 2019a the model simulates the propagation of a single erosion wave along the main stream and gradually distributes itself to fewer tributaries crosby and whipple 2006 berlin and anderson 2007 a collection of studies have found that the shape change of longitudinal river profile has a substantial response to natural damming events which may be caused by giant landslides large debris flows or rock avalanches hewitt 1998 korup 2006 korup et al 2006 ouimet et al 2007 korup et al 2010 walsh et al 2012 ahmed et al 2018 2019 zhao et al 2019 hewitt 1998 studied the properties and geomorphic effects of rock avalanche sediments blocking rivers in the karakoram himalaya area they are reconstructed in terms of the location and nature of sediments resulting from rock avalanches and the response of rivers to their disturbance according to the moraine dam theory proposed by korup and montgomery 2008 the river channel is blocked by the impoundment of moraine dams which are widely distributed upstream of the yarlung tsangpo river china as a result it hindered the retreat of the knickpoint upstream and concentrated the erosion in the reach below the knickpoint which played an important role in maintaining the integrity of the tibetan plateau this study conducted a detailed field survey of the layue river china and found that there were many large natural dams in the basin caused by landslides debris flows or large rockfall in addition a number of thick deposits of fine grained materials were discovered which may be remnants of large damming events to explore the relationship between these geological phenomena and the evolution of regional geomorphology this paper carried out a study on the distribution of knickpoints in the layue basin reconstructed the paleo longitudinal profiles of the trunk and tributaries in the region and estimated the resulting paleo relief and net uplift finally the celerity model was used to estimate the pattern of knickpoint headward migration based on dating results 2 study area 2 1 geological conditions the layue basin is located on the northwest side of the eastern himalaya syntaxis with a sinistral strike slip fault zone running along the river lulang river and a dextral strike slip jiali fault zone on the north side the study area is cut by the indus yarlung suture zone and surrounded by the lhasa block which consists of low to medium metamorphic metasedimentary rocks granite zones layered gneiss layered gneiss intervals and gangdese plutons fig 1 zeitler et al 2014 the interior is the himalayan block roughly bounded by the nam la thrust fault with the namche barwa antiform in the southeast and the namche barwa peak in the north due to strong tectonic activities heavy precipitation gradients and glacial processes in the alpine region the denudation rate of the eastern himalayan syntaxis reached as high as 8 mm a within the past 1 million years enkelmann et al 2011 in addition thermochronological studies show that the cooling ages of the rocks in the layue basin are relatively new 0 6 6 ma as two extreme values indicating that the basin has experienced river erosion and rock mass exhumation since the mio pliocene malloy et al 2003 stewart et al 2008 2 2 topography the strong tectonic action that occurred in the region influenced the topography in the study area which mainly consist of deep cut valleys with the highest elevation being 6802 m i e the gyala peir peak the elevation of the bottom of the valley is approximately 2000 m and the straight line distance is slightly longer than 20 km this creates noticeable relief in the area high mountains collide with warm and humid air from the indian ocean along the yarlung tsangpo river creating widespread marine glaciers in the region the modern equilibrium line altitude is more than 4400 m loibl et al 2014 but during the last glacial maximum it was much lower than the present elevation glaciation plays an important role in shaping the present landforms zhou et al 2010 hu et al 2020 in particular there are more than 20 glacial lakes in the study area with areas in the range of 0 1 1 8 km2 and most of them are distributed at an elevation of more than 4000 m the dongjiu and lulang rivers are two tributaries flowing in a near perpendicular direction and after their confluence they are known as the layue river fig 1 2 3 natural damming event in the study area and adjacent region various gravity type geological disaster events occur frequently li et al 2021a li et al 2021b for example debris flows in the tianmo gully wei et al 2017 and guxiang gully yu et al 2020 zou et al 2020 and large scale landslides in the layue du 2017 caused blocking events in the parlung tsangpo river two large scale rock landslides occurred in the yigong tsangpo river forming landslide dams and an extensive lake delaney and evans 2015 the jiaobunong landslide blocked the lulang river which made the river channel shrink rapidly and formed a valley approximately 2 km wide upstream fig 2 a d the resulting dam had a height of 270 m and a volume of 3 58 108 m3 wang et al 2019 all of these natural damming events formed lake sediments of a certain scale in the river channel which had an impact on the longitudinal profile of the river and might have formed a knickpoint ouimet et al 2007 in addition there is a large deposit on the left bank of the dongjiu river which is referred to as the baimu deposit fig 2c f h volume 2 109 m3 this has also been noted by previous researchers korup and montgomery 2008 korup et al 2010 the delun landslide dam is located downstream of the dongjiu village which has a height of 150 m and a volume of 2 5 108 m3 fig 2b e we focus on the three giant bodies that have been investigated in the field and denoted as damming events namely the jiaobunong and delun landslide dams and the baimu deposit these dams have an important impact on the evolution of the river profile and the distribution of river knickpoints throughout the whole region therefore based on the analysis of river profiles and natural dams the distribution of knickpoints and the river evolution of the layue basin are studied in this paper 3 methods 3 1 channel profile analysis rivers tend to have flat and concave profiles due to their increased drainage area and reduced slope the stream power model is able to express a power law relationship between the local channel slope s and the corresponding drainage area a which can be used to describe the rate of uplift and the evolution of knickpoints in river geomorphology flint 1974 1 s k s a θ 2 k s u k 1 n 3 θ m n where ks is the steepness index θ is the concavity index m and n are constants u is the bedrock uplift rate and k is the erodibility coefficient in the above calculations small changes and or uncertainties in θ can lead to significant variations in k s a normalized steepness index k sn with a reference concavity θ ref can correlate catchments of various shapes and sizes wobus et al 2006 4 s k sn a θ r e f o r k sn k s a θ r e f θ the steepness and concavity indices can be found more directly by a logarithmic variation of eq 1 namely the slope area s a analysis method however the s a method makes the results more inaccurate due to the introduction of elevation differentiation and the scattered nature of the resulting data perron and royden 2013 goren et al 2014 wang et al 2017 nones et al 2019 the integration method proposed by perron and royden 2013 can avoid the abovementioned errors to retain river profile information by integrating eq 1 we can obtain the following results 5 z x z b u ka o m 1 n χ x 6 χ x 0 x a 0 a x m n d x where χ is the chi value and zb is the elevation at the base level of the drainage network at x xb the parameter a0 is the reference area which can take any value to make the coefficient and integrand dimensionless but when comparing the steepness of the transformed contour it is important to use the same value of a0 to calculate χ perron and royden 2013 in this study a0 1 m2 this type of plot based on the change in horizontal spatial coordinates of the longitudinal profile of the river is referred to as a chi plot χ z plot although data dispersion does exist the s a analysis method is by far the most straightforward method to determine the concavity index in contrast the integral method has mainly been applied to estimate river power parameters and to determine the steepness index perron and royden 2013 combining the two and comparing the results often leads to more satisfactory results wang et al 2017 therefore both methods are used in this study for the calculation of river profiles we used 12 5 m digital elevation model dem data from the advanced land observing satellite search asf alaska edu in 2011 for the layue basin the stream network extraction and cumulative flow raster was obtained by hydrological preprocessing of the dem through arcgis software then the above data files are imported into the matlab script provided by jaiswara et al 2019a to complete the application of the model the window smoothing distance is set to 1000 m and the rest of the parameters are set to the default parameters the critical area is a value in square meters which is considered the lowest accumulation area for automatically selecting the channels the smaller the critical area is the larger the number of identified channels through several pre experiments 1 0 107 was set as the critical area for the layue basin at which point a total of 58 channels were selected for river profile analysis 3 2 reconstruction of the paleo profile in an active orogenic belt such as the eastern himalayan syntaxes zeitler et al 2014 transient events can usually persist for tens of millions of years long durations may cause relict landscapes to disjoin modern tectonic conditions thus becoming a passive indicator of the vertical displacement of the earth s surface clark et al 2005 researchers can use the characteristics of relict landscapes to describe paleo landforms in this disjointed state to estimate the magnitude of paleo relief in the layue basin we first determined the paleo base level of the relict surface using the channel segments above the knickpoints gallen et al 2013 using an empirically derived rule of scale the equilibrium longitudinal profile of the relict reach was reconstructed by relating the local channel slope s to the drainage area a through channel steepness k s and concavity θ parameters as shown in eq 1 channel parameters measured from relict reaches were used to infer the original channel profile downstream of the confluence with the main stem clark et al 2005 the reconstructed paleo channel elevation will provide a minimum estimate of the total amount of surface uplift and or incision kirby and whipple 2012 the two methods mentioned above i e the s a analysis method and χ analysis method can be used to reconstruct the paleo base level wang et al 2017 jaiswara et al 2019a jaiswara et al 2019b 3 3 celerity model it is a popular interpretation mechanism to regard the headward erosion of the knickpoint as a motion wave that breaks the steady state of the river crosby and whipple 2006 proposed a celerity model to explain how knickpoints propagate through river networks the model can explain the essential characteristics of knickpoint mobility and homology the following equation is used to describe the retreat rate of the knickpoint 7 dx d t c a p where dx dt is the retreat rate of the knickpoint m yr c is the erosion coefficient m 1 2p yr 1 a is the upstream contribution drainage area and p is a dimensionless constant reflecting the dependence of the rate on the basin area the celerity model uses the dynamic time step method to calculate the cumulative time along the longitudinal profile path of the river through each pixel linear or diagonal distance crosby and whipple 2006 when the cumulative time of the knickpoint is greater than or equal to the total time set by the model the model runs out the two parameters c and p in the equation are obtained by an two dimensional algorithm the purpose of which is to minimize the misfit between the modeled and observed knickpoints it usually relies on the interval given in the literature crosby and whipple 2006 berlin and anderson 2007 in the celerity model some factors that may affect the rate are ignored including the displacement bedrock lithology sediment type thickness etc but there is no evidence that increasing the complexity of the model can improve the accuracy of the prediction kirby and whipple 2012 nones 2020 a flow chart is given to better understand the relationships and results of the various methods fig 3 4 results and analysis 4 1 reference concavity to computationally implement the χ z plot and the normalized steepness index calculation it is first necessary to determine the appropriate reference concavity perron and royden 2013 wang et al 2017 in this paper 58 channels in the layue river basin are selected and calculated based on a series of concavity values ranging from 0 to 1 in steps of 0 05 theoretically the constraint condition is that a reasonable reference concavity θ ref should both linearize all the chi χ profiles and collapse the tributaries and main stem to a single line perron and royden 2013 this means that when the tributary and the mainstream have the same uplift rate and erosion parameters the above constraints should be met therefore the significance of selecting the reference concavity lies in obtaining the normalized steepness index k sn of the layue basin under the same conditions to facilitate the overall evaluation with the increase in the number of branches the constraints that strictly meet the above conditions will become weak wang et al 2017 further elevation scatter is used to measure the constraint performance the χ space is subdivided into 100 bins and the scatter points are defined by the distribution average of the elevation standard deviation within each bin perron and royden 2013 wang et al 2017 when the elevation scatter takes the lowest value the optimal reference concavity is obtained compared to fig 4 b the tributaries in fig 4 a are clearly biased to one side while fig 4 c has a poor linearization of the tributaries and main streams also the elevation scatter reaches its minimum value when θ 0 45 fig 4d finally 0 45 was selected as the reference concavity θ ref for the study area 4 2 knickpoint distribution and dams the channel profiles of the layue basin were calculated and drawn according to the matlab script jaiswara et al 2019b three kinds of plots are obtained including a river profile b logarithmic plot of area and slope and c chi plot any plot from which the knickpoint is most easily identified is selected and the location of the knickpoint is manually selected and a segmental fit of the channel data on either side of it is carried out then the fit is automatically calculated for the corresponding position in the two remaining plots the result of the knickpoint identification we require to exceed a given thresholds greater than 20 m in elevation drop coupled with a slope threshold 0 1 gallen et al 2013 finally 52 knickpoints in the basin were identified including 15 damming type knickpoints fig 5 a according to the distribution histogram of the knickpoint elevation frequency fig 5d the knickpoints of the river are distributed at an elevation of 3000 m or above and are intensively distributed near the gray contour line of 4000 m fig 5a which is called the 4 k knickpoint group the comparable height and radial distribution of these knickpoints indicate that they evolved from a coeval origin berlin and anderson 2007 gallen et al 2013 jaiswara et al 2019a the results of the longitudinal profile of the basin show that the 4 k knickpoint group contains few n 2 damming type knickpoints fig 5d but their causes are different so they are excluded from the 4 k knickpoint group studied for the damming type knickpoints their distribution elevation is relatively low and most of them n 13 are lower than 3750 m their location is random and controlled by the location of events such as landslides debris flows and rockfalls the distribution range of elevation is also the obvious difference between the two types of knickpoints systematic changes in the normalized steepness index k sn often reflect the state of regional uplift and erosion in the basin with a higher uplift rate it will be affected by the erosion of river network system which leads to the increase of k sn whipple 2004 wobus et al 2006 in practical calculations the steepness index is derived from the dem which is the comprehensive products of all the earth surfaces processes thus there is often a spatial correspondence between local abrupt changes in the k sn and external disturbances such as large landslides and debris flows this relationship is applied as a marker for determining the blockage of rivers by landslide dams korup 2006 korup et al 2006 ahmed et al 2018 ahmed et al 2019 the maximum k sn in the layue basin is 1782 48 m0 9 fig 6 a which appears in the downstream part of the main channel the minimum k sn value appears at the location of the glacial lake close to the source of the gully the irregular polygon drawn by the white line fifteen channels are selected to calculate the k sn values upstream and downstream of the knickpoints which represent the characteristics of the relict reach and the modern reach the average values of k sn upstream and downstream are 103 3 10 7 m0 9 and 397 43 3 m0 9 respectively the systematic changes of k sn clearly shows the active adaptation to the uplift erosion stage in the downstream reaches of the knickpoint the local abrupt change in the downstream steepness index of the delun landslide and jiaobunong landslide is in response to natural damming events and the corresponding k sn suddenly increases by 300 to even greater than 600 fig 6 in addition several other similar events in the study area can be found on the k sn distribution map for the baimu deposit its volume is estimated to be more than 2 billion square meters such a large scale barrier dam should correspond to an obvious response on the river profile korup 2006 korup et al 2006 but this is not the case in the analysis of the longitudinal profile of the dongjiu channel no corresponding knickpoints were formed the ksn along the river did not change abruptly in the range of 212 287 m0 9 indicating that the evolution of the baimu deposit did not directly affect the longitudinal profile of the dongjiu river at least it did not match its potential volume to explain the inconsistency between the volume and the result some possibilities are 1 the true volume or sliding direction of the baimu deposit is misestimated and misjudged which may indicate that it has no impact on the river in other words the actual baimu deposit has only experienced some small volume sliding 2 the change in the width of the dongjiu river channel led to the lack of a knickpoint on the longitudinal profile when the baimu deposit blocked the river the river was diverted to a floodplain or a river terrace with similar conditions as the original river course korup et al 2006 dongjiu river was only partially narrowed however the above are all inferences based on a strange phenomenon revealed by the knickpoint analysis 4 3 river profile reconstruction results the reconstruction of river profiles can estimate the amount of river erosion and the paleo topography the results of the reconstruction of the lulang channel are controlled by two main knickpoints including the knickpoint caused by the jiaobunong landslide abbreviated as jbn kp highlighted in fig 5a d due to the impact of two influential knickpoints the longitudinal profile of the lulang river is divided into the relict reach the intermediate reach and the modern reach fig 7 a in the s a analysis method the threshold value of the watershed area can be used to distinguish the reach dominated by slope deposits or bedrock reaches dominated by river erosion and to adopt different threshold values for different watershed areas the average concavity θ of the remaining and middle reaches is 0 22 0 11 and 0 64 0 11 with normalized steepness indices k sn of 159 m0 9 and 198 m0 9 respectively fig 7b according to the above parameters the net uplift solid black line with arrow is 1656 55 m by subtracting the uplift from the drainage divide elevation the paleo relief solid blue line with arrow is 1065 m in addition the net uplift of the intermediate reach controlled by jbn kp is 1196 47 m dotted blackline with arrow which reveals that the jiaobunong landslide dam controls and changes the profile of the lulang river the landslide makes the deposition of the upstream reach more obvious and the downstream erosion increase especially after the landslide dam is destroyed in the s a analysis the accumulation paths of modern rivers on each pixel are used to reconstruct the paleo profile however χ analysis is a linear projection of the slope of the χ interval representing the relict reach fig 7c the net uplift of the basin is 1635 m in the results of χ analysis and the maximum difference between the two methods is only 4 6 indicating the consistency of the two methods the whole drainage basin has experienced a net uplift of at least 1600 m accordingly the projection results of the middle reach based on jbn kp are also given in χ analysis in addition to the lulang channel corresponding to channel no 8 in fig 5a the remaining 14 channels in the basin have also been reconstructed which retained the relict reach the elevation of most reconstructed confluences is approximately 3600 m fig d1 and table d1 in the appendix which is 1600 m higher than that of modern confluences therefore it can be considered that these knickpoints in the layue basin evolved from the same paleo level along with an erosion wave 4 4 celerity model results we used the celerity model to model the 4 k knickpoint group in the layue basin to understand the process of headward migration based on a variety of available dating data malloy et al 2003 stewart et al 2008 cooling age of the rock mass in the layue basin is generally between 1 and 6 ma fig 1 but two abnormal values are ignored therefore in the celerity velocity model it can be assumed that the initial time of the knickpoint headward migration is 1 25 6 ma with an interval of 0 25 ma to consider the reasonableness of the initial time period of the model the volume for time substitution method was used as a reference crosby and whipple 2006 berlin and anderson 2007 norton et al 2008 gallen et al 2013 and the results indicate an initial time of 1 28 5 10 ma method i and table d2 in the appendix which is essentially the same as the above choice in searching for the best combination of c and p we allow p to vary linearly between 0 2 and 1 2 over 40 values while c varies logarithmically between 10 10 and 10 4 over 500 values the c and p parameters are determined by minimizing the misfit between the modeled knickpoint and the observed knickpoint in each model run finally the two parameters are locked in a narrow range berlin and anderson 2007 the results show that the minimum model mismatch occurs in the following range fig 8 a c parameter ranges from 2 62 10 9 to 1 27 10 8 which is roughly in the range of an order of magnitude while the corresponding p parameter ranges from 0 76 to 0 79 which is basically in the same range as the celerity model of bedrock rivers loget and driessche 2009 jaiswara et al 2019b the least square sum of residuals is the estimator of model mismatch and the final distribution ranges between 1 637 109 and 1 639 109 fig 8b the celerity model of the layue basin shows that the average retreat rate of the knickpoint is 10 8 51 7 km ma fig 8c in a series of model results an initial time of 6 ma was chosen for illustration as the model possesses a minimum sum of square residuals fig 9 the results of the final celerity model show that the misfit between the observed and modeled knickpoints lie between 16 3 and 23 2 km with negative values representing modeled knickpoints located downstream of the observed knickpoints the majority 18 of 24 of the predicted nodal points were within 5 km of their true counterparts with an average distance of 6 4 km through regression analysis the linear relationship between the knickpoint position obtained by modeling and the observed knickpoint position is y 0 9597x 5 126 and the correlation coefficient is 0 9332 which indicates that the model fits the distribution of knickpoints well it is also noted that the propagation rate of the knickpoints in the main stream is faster than that in the tributaries especially within the last 2 ma of this model 5 discussion in this study two types of knickpoints in the layue basin are distinguished i the damming type knickpoint represented by the jbn kp ii homologous knickpoints 4 k knickpoint group which are usually called slope break type knickpoints this leads to two different directions in the study of knickpoints in the layue basin 5 1 reconstruction of paleo profile the eastern himalayan syntaxis and its surrounding areas are one of the most frequent areas of earth s tectonic activities considering that surface uplift erosion is a regional phenomenon this study reconstructed a total of 15 paleo profile in the layue basin the paleo relief is distinguished based on the relict reach and the results show that the basin has experienced a net uplift of approximately 1600 m which means that the river may have undergone an equal amount of river undercutting the layue basin has experienced intense geomorphological evolution activities although it is lower than the erosion in the central section of the yarlung tsangpo grand canyon and the dibang basin further downstream 2028 132 m jaiswara et al 2019a this is substantially higher than the cullasaja basin in southern appalachia 480 30 m gallen et al 2013 locally the relief of the southwest south side of the layue basin changed more obviously the results of the reconstruction of channels no 2 to no 9 show that the relief has increased by more than 100 and the erosion of channels no 3 and no 6 is largest table d1 this is directly related to regional lithology changes the south is gangdese plutonic rocks while the north is the metasedimentary rocks of the lhasa block mostly slate and phyllite fig 1 the concavity index of the river upstream of the knickpoint is used to reconstruct the paleo profile the reconstructions show that the concavity index of most of the channels lies between 0 45 and 0 65 table d1 channel numbers 6 7 9 10 12 13 14 and 15 suggesting that the geological characteristics of the channels the upstream of knickpoint are similar within the layue watershed whipple 2004 however a small part of the concavity index deviated from this range showing a lower or higher concavity index although the erosion history of the surface of the relic reaches is not clear the unusual concavity index is thought to be due to diffuse steepening above the knickpoint berlin and anderson 2007 it seems possible to use a usual concavity index 0 45 0 65 to replace these out of range values for paleo profile reconstruction to reflect more reasonable geological information whipple 2004 wang et al 2017 however this simplification is tempting but not strictly accurate following a step change in the relative uplift rate the upstream propagating knickpoints experience stable vertical velocities and therefore have similar concavity indices niemann et al 2001 consequently as more complex relative uplift histories are examined notable differences in the relic reach above the knickpoints occur across tributary channels the rapid exhumation of yurlung tsangpo grand canyon is accepted by most scholars and it is generally believed that the exhumation rate can reach 10 mm a e g finnegan et al 2008 zeitler et al 2014 schmidt et al 2015 king et al 2016 yang et al 2018 liu 2020 the rapid exhumation of the northern basin is in response to the rapid uplift which is the result of the northward expansion of the eastern himalayan syntaxis king et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the layue basin is in the north western part of the eastern himalayan syntaxis and it is undeniably an area of rapid exhumation especially in the valley of the layue river i e after the confluence of the two tributaries when the initial time of the knickpoint entering the basin is set at 1 25 6 ma the exhumation rate derived from the profile reconstruction result is 0 27 1 28 mm a in this study according to the research results of king et al 2016 and yang et al 2018 the exhumation rate of the tributaries lulang river and dongjiu river in the layue basin is 1 5 mm a which is higher than or equal to the results obtained by us but note that the layue basin is not the focus of the above studies and there may be some errors our results are closer to the exhumation rate at the confluence of niyang river and yurlung tsangpo river which is 0 25 mm a zeitler et al 2014 schmidt et al 2015 besides the dominant tectonic factors the exhumation rate is related to stream power precipitation and lithology for example the stream power of the layue river is less than 360 w m2 finnegan et al 2008 which is far lower than that of the yurlung tsangbo river grand canyon 1000 w m2 larsen and montgomery 2012 resulting in the lower exhumation rate of the former through an analysis of the yigong tsangpo river dating results liu 2020 suggested that the exhumation rate tends to decrease as one moves away from the central area of the eastern himalayan syntaxis along the river channel furthermore there is a temporal scale problem in the discussion of exhumation rate additionally according to the elevation and location of jbn kp the intermediate reach has also been reconstructed with the corresponding paleo profile blue dotted line in fig 7 the intermediate paleo profile is not in a real state but this process can be used to analyze the impact of the knickpoint on the river it corresponds to another uplift erosion transient motion in the basin to adjust the change in the regional base level caused by the landslide dam although there are obvious differences in the mechanisms of the two types of knickpoints from the results of the reconstruction it can be seen that the knickpoints produced by the damming events have no lesser impact on the evolution of river geomorphology than structural or climatic conditions this impact is limited to a specific time frame usually less than one hundred thousand years 5 2 knickpoint migration the celerity model believes that the knickpoint propagates through the entire river network at the rate of the power law function of the upstream area in the model we mainly test the effect of changes in the c parameter and p parameter value the above two parameters are derived from references in similar regions on average however the modeled knickpoint is located downstream of the observed knickpoint so a larger c parameter may give more relevant results the sum of the least square residual for the model is between 1 67 109 and 1 69 109 in km2 fig 8b which evaluates the performance of the model in a range larger than the results from gallen et al 2013 and jaiswara et al 2019a but close to the results from berlin and anderson 2007 the residual sum of squares is strongly influenced by extreme values in the modeling results for 6 ma 16 67 4 blue dots out of 24 results in fig 9b of the model results are more than 10 km away from the observations with one extreme value of 23 km when the extremes are removed the residuals drop to 4 84 108 typically the natural rate of knickpoint migration is so slow that it is difficult to achieve measurements in the field berlin and anderson 2007 except for studies carried out under special conditions such as fragile bedrock and extremely large drainage volumes the celerity model utilized for this study estimated migration rates in the layue basin of 21 5 103 4 km ma in the statistical results of loget and driessche 2009 the retreat rate of the study area is basically equal to or lower than that in the literature under similar migration times and areas indicating the rationality of the study area when the initial time was set to 1 6 ma the knickpoint retreat rate within the layue basin was 40 km ma fig 8c this result is close to the jiacha knickpoint retreat rate of the yurlung tsangpo river studied by schmidt et al 2015 using the same model however their interpretation of 3d thermokinematic model pecube yielded a knickpoint retreat rate of 30 km ma the large discrepancy in the rate of knickpoint retreat may result from the simplified nature of the pecube which does not contain the full evolutionary character of the landscape we use the cooling age and volume for time substitution method to give the initial time of the celerity model but there is still a large uncertainty many scholars have suggested that the namcha barwa region has undergone strong tectonic uplift seward and burg 2008 tu et al 2015 zeitler et al 2014 and possible hydrological reorganization e g hallet and molnar 2001 clark et al 2004 liang et al 2008 lang and huntington 2014 robinson et al 2014 all the studies indicate that the layue river did not undergo a change in flow direction but the erosion waves that formed the knickpoint could have come from two directions into the basin namely the direction of the parlung tsangpo river before the reorganization and the direction of the po tsangpo river after the reorganization we prefer the latter as both hydrological reorganization and knickpoint retreat are the result of changes in the erosional datum caused by tectonic uplift stewart et al 2008 enkelmann et al 2011 schmidt et al 2015 this means that the initial timing of the celerity model may be limited by the timing of riverine capture in the region there is a significant gap between the knickpoints in the fast model and the observed ones this is because the role of glacial lakes in modern profiles is obvious especially when judging the remaining river sections because the distribution of these glacial lakes is often distributed near a given threshold of watershed area in addition the methods and modeling ideas described in this study are based on a digital elevation model dem for extraction and analysis however the accuracy of the dem may be the most fundamental factor affecting the model therefore it is necessary to discuss the knickpoint distribution and evolution models under different dem accuracy conditions boulton and stokes 2018 jaiswara et al 2020 5 3 effect of natural damming events on river profiles a case study from jiaobunong landslide it is believed that many natural dams in history were short lived and 80 of them were destroyed in 6 months or even less costa and schuster 1988 ermini and casagli 2003 however we have found that rivers in the layue basin have been blocked for a long time the spatial pattern of incisions and sedimentation caused by damming events in mountain rivers can be seen in both the longitudinal profile and the slope area map korup 2006 figs 6 and 7 moreover these damming type knickpoints are fixed in space compared with moving slope break type knickpoints they do not share a coeval source hayakawa and oguchi 2009 jaiswara et al 2019b the impact of the dam on the longitudinal profile of the river can provide a new perspective and entry point for explaining the evolution of river geomorphology the presence of a knickpoint at the jiaobunong landslide is obvious as the location of the knickpoint coincides with the landslide the question of whether it was caused by the landslide is raised alternatively it is a coincidence of the two because the knickpoint during the process of headward migration reached jiaobunong and changed the local geological conditions causing the landslide thereafter the jiaobunong landslide is abbreviated as jbn l we will put forth the following two hypotheses hypothesis 1 jbn kp led to jbn l hypothesis 2 jbn l caused jbn kp for hypothesis 1 the jbn kp is identified as a mobile knickpoint formed by erosion in this case we can consider the issue regarding the timing with the jbn kp landslide occurring at 20 30 ka wang et al 2019 the erosion process of the knickpoint throughout the whole layue watershed was simulated by the celerity model the time scale of landslide occurrence is 1 50 1 200 of the celerity model the distance that the rift point migrates to the landslide is 2 3 of the celerity model however this value can be adjusted to 1 2 of the celerity model taking into account that the retreat rate of the knickpoint decreases as the watershed area decreases crosby and whipple 2006 gallen et al 2013 at this point the retreat rate of the knickpoint can be simply estimated to be 25 100 times the celerity model rate i e 250 5000 km ma this exaggerated result far exceeds the range of knickpoint retreat rates 20 40 km ma calculated by schmidt et al 2015 jaiswara et al 2019a and jaiswara et al 2019b for the eastern himalayan syntaxis the above results illustrate the mismatch between the retreat rate of knickpoint and the time of occurrence of jbn l which proves that hypothesis 1 is unreasonable considering hypothesis 2 the jbn kp is a damming type knickpoint in this case the knickpoint formed by headward migration must have eroded somewhere upstream of the landslide indeed another knickpoint exists upstream hypothesis 2 may hold due to two reasons on the one hand the time of occurrence of the landslide ka level is short compared to the time of knickpoint headward migration ma level therefore it was able to leave a sufficiently visible trace on the longitudinal profile of the river on the other hand the narrower gully in which jbn l is located and the presence of mountains on the opposite bank impede the movement of this super large landslide resulting in the formation of a large thick leading edge of jbn l the present day jbn l has a topographic difference of 300 m fig 10 a this feature can be seen even more clearly when comparing the morphology of another famous landslide fig 10b guo et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 the great thickness of the mound makes the erosion process even slower therefore we consider hypothesis 2 to be more reasonable as stated by korup et al 2006 the high steepness and specific stream power represented by knickpoints are not always the cause but often a result of large natural damming events in mountain basins according to the reconstruction of the paleo profile the net uplift of the damming type knickpoint represented by jbn kp is 1196 47 m note that this uplift does not exist in fact but only uses a similar reconstruction process to express the control effect of landslide on the river profile while the slope break type knickpoint of headward migration is 1656 55 m fig d1 and table d1 in the appendix have already given the reconstruction results of paleo profiles of the other 14 channels compared with the reconstruction process of two kinds of knickpoints in the current river profile the obvious control effect of large natural dams on the river profile is similar to the driving force of climate and tectonic action however they represent different time scales on a million year time scale the impacts of similar landslides debris flows and rock collapses will disappear completely in other words within a short time range 104 a the natural damming event will have an obvious influence on the river profile similar to that driven by climate and tectonic action 6 conclusion the layue basin located near the eastern himalayan syntaxis has undergone strong geomorphological evolution and many different types of knickpoints have developed in the basin in this study it is divided into the movable 4 k knickpoint group and fixed damming type knickpoints based on the slope area analysis and χ analysis method it is shown that most of the knickpoints in the layue basin are mainly distributed at 4000 m but the regularity of damming type knickpoints is not obvious based on the analysis of the location of the knickpoints and the normalized steepness index ksn the geomorphic features of the three natural damming events investigated in the field are discussed both the jiaobunong and delun landslides have an obvious knickpoint and the normalized steepness index changes suddenly however the baimu deposit has little effect on the longitudinal profile of the river so it is recognized that it may not be a large volume landslide dam or moraine dam fifteen channels were selected to reconstruct the paleo profile the results show that the average relief of the basin has increased by approximately 104 since the knickpoint entered the basin indicating that the basin has experienced significant uplift and erosion the celerity model was used to model the observed knickpoints and the results showed that the model was highly consistent indicating the mobility and homology of 4 k knickpoint group in addition a paleo profile reconstruction or projection process was carried out for the intermediate reach corresponding to the jbn kp combined with the results of the celerity model this confirms the apparent control of the river profile by large landslides over short time periods credit authorship contribution statement

4164,excess export of nitrate to streams has been an environmental issue attracting attention across the world lumped models based on storage selection sas functions have been used widely to investigate this export processes in terms of hydrological and chemical responses in catchment outflux both in discharge q and in evapotranspiration et the validity of these models depends on the appropriate choice of water age selection preferences i e the parameterization of the sas functions of q and et which are often calibrated against observed in stream tracer data this study attempted to assess the usefulness of in stream nitrate n no3 concentrations for resolving the sas functions in terms of plausibility being physically meaningful and parameter uncertainty in a small agricultural catchment in central germany that experiences strong seasonality a spatially implicit model was built to simulate the dynamics of nitrate export the data sets of in stream nitrate concentrations nitrogen surplus in the soil and the median age of q were used to constrain the model the best fit to all data sets results indicate high plausibility of the calibrated temporally

nitrate n no3 excess export of nitrate to streams threatens ecosystem structure and functions and human health via drinking water vitousek et al 2009 alvarez cobelas et al 2008 dupas et al 2017 this has been an environmental issue attracting attention in germany across europe and the world the dynamics of nitrate transport from diffuse sources is regulated by the dominant flow paths that determine the speed at which precipitation travels through catchments before it reaches the stream jasechko et al 2016 this transport process is subject to both hydrological and biogeochemical influences better understanding and simulating this process are necessary for the management of water quality in connection with agricultural activities describing and modelling solute not limited to nitrate transport based on transit time distributions ttds is being used increasingly as a spatially implicit way to estimate solute dynamics at large spatial and temporal scales this includes the transport of conservative tracers benettin et al 2015 the fate of nutrients and pollutants in catchments van der velde et al 2010 2012 hrachowitz et al 2015 and legacy sources sinks in large river basins van meter et al 2017 rather than assigning predefined ttds recent catchment scale transport models have focused on estimating the ttds following an age master equation botter et al 2011 which describes the water mass balance in control volumes of all possible ages in this approach transport processes are described by the choice of storage selection sas functions which have been argued to be more stable in time van der velde et al 2012 or to be easily parameterized based on state variables kim et al 2016 than underlying ttds that tend to reflect the system state in one instance in time and thus strongly vary temporally heidbüchel et al 2012 2013 kim et al 2016 the theory of sas functions has been developed to mathematically characterize the selection preferences for certain water ages during outflow generation botter et al 2011 van der velde et al 2012 harman 2015 rinaldo et al 2015 i e to characterize the relative contributions of the stored water of different ages to discharge q and evapotranspiration et note that the concept of selection in a hydrologic system refers to the discharge of stored water via different flow paths rather than to an active selection of water parcels the sas functions being flexible in shape can represent complex age selection preferences while the underlying physical mechanisms may not yet be understood see text 1 in the supplementary material for an illustration of three typical shapes of sas function it has been argued that sas functions can be adequately approximated by theoretical probability distributions such as beta van der velde et al 2012 or power law distributions harman 2019 in turn the ability of the model to simulate and predict solute export patterns hinges on the appropriate parameterization of the sas functions i e the correct choice of age selection preferences with acceptable parameter uncertainty levels given the difficulty of directly measuring water age distributions and sas functions in natural catchments model calibration is one of the most efficient method to determine them i e to adjust and optimize the sas functions such that the simulated results fit observational data sets also referred to as constraining the sas functions studies using inverse modeling calibration to determine et and q sas functions abbreviated as saset and sasq respectively and assessing the associated parameter uncertainty i e the region of the input parameter space that produce significant output results are still rare some studies have successfully determined the sas functions using inverse modeling but did not included parameter uncertainties for example benettin et al 2015 used high frequency chloride concentration data to constrain their transport model for the upper hafren catchment uk indicating a shift of the q selection preference between young water shallower storage and older water deeper storage however the results were based on a model with two distributed storage volumes each one assumed to be well mixed and did not include uncertainty analysis van der velde et al 2015 numerically explored the impact of four age selection preferences mixing assumptions on ttds with parameters being calibrated against the in stream isotopic signature from two catchments in sweden and arizona usa however they focused on the improvement of model performance with different selection preferences not on deriving the parameter uncertainty under the constraint of concentration data some studies were limited to smaller scales such as the lysimeter scale queloz et al 2015 and the scale of root zones sprenger et al 2016 evaristo et al 2019 rather than at catchment of strong seasonality queloz et al 2015 simulated the transport of fluorobenzoate tracers during a large lysimeter experiment and calibrated the sas functions against the tracer breakthrough curves they argued that the conservative tracers were more informative for characterizing transport processes as any reaction processes may hamper parameter identification as number of parameters increases queloz et al 2015 they also suggested that the saset could be determined through calibration constrained only by tracer concentrations in q these suggestions are helpful guidelines for the use of tracer data however they were made at the lysimeter scale where the age selection preferences did not exhibit much temporal variability compared to natural catchments yang et al 2018a harman 2015 2019 simulated the chloride transport at plynlimon uk where in stream concentration data were used to constrain the sasq and saset that were defined as storage dependent and hence dynamic we note that plynlimon is subject to much smaller seasonality than our studied catchment in central germany described later as indicated by the moderately variable chloride concentrations in streams varying on the event scale recent studies have pointed out the necessity of considering uncertainty for the interpretation of sas functions wilusz et al 2017 knighton et al 2019 visser et al 2019 wilusz et al 2017 used a lumped transit time model to numerically investigate of the effect of rainfall variability on young stream water friction of the streams plynlimon and wales uk saset and sasq which were calibrated using conservative chloride tracer in the stream water were interpreted together with uncertainties estimated using markov chain monte carlo method visser et al 2019 provided the first study combining data sets of three radioactive and one stable isotopes in determining the age selection preferences of q and et in providence creek california usa they demonstrated the varying uncertainty of sasq and saset in response to the different constraining data sets individual or combined these studies successfully addressed the challenge of sas function uncertainty in their transit time solute transport modeling however similar studies are still rare and expected especially for catchments with pronounced seasonality in climatic drivers given that most studies used conservative tracers e g chloride δ18o benettin et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2015 van der velde et al 2015 queloz et al 2015 harman 2015 2019 the use of nitrate n no3 as tracer for constraining the sas functions is scarce this can be due to i the complexity of reactive transport and ii the lack of either field data of nitrate inputs and outputs denitrification plant uptake or an effective method for estimating them van der velde et al 2012 constructed a numerical nitrate transport model for the hupsel brook catchment in the netherlands where the nitrate source input and reactions were simplified into a representation by diffusion and degradation processes they suggested that the in stream data contained a wealth of information that could potentially be used to infer the age selection preferences however their suggestion has not yet been systematically examined for nitrate nguyen et al 2021 used their coupled mhm sas model to simulating the nitrate export from a mesoscale catchment where the age selection preferences were constrained using in stream nitrate data however they focused on the applicability of sas function based solute transport models to mesoscale catchments rather than on the data usefulness on resolving age selection preferences of q and et the seasonal variability of in stream nitrate concentration is strongly linked to the seasonal age selection preferences caused by shifting flow paths field observations in mountainous central german catchments indicate that in stream nitrate concentrations as well as the mass load vary seasonally with maxima during the wet winter and minima during the dry summer dupas et al 2017 based on data driven analyses musolff et al 2015 and dupas et al 2017 suggested a systematic seasonal dis connection of nitrate source zones from to streams for such seasonal variability under wetter winter conditions the near surface nitrate source zones in agricultural soils are connected to the stream by fast shallow flow paths fig 1 a under drier summer conditions those nitrate source zones are deactivated because their direct hydrologic connectivity to the stream is inhibited by low groundwater levels fig 1b based on high frequency monitoring in the wood brook catchment in the uk blaen et al 2017 also reported mobilization of nitrate from the uppermost soil layers via shallow preferential flow paths during high flow conditions which does not occur during base flow in drier periods we hypothesize that the responses of in stream concentrations caused by changing flow paths and the associated changes in transit times can in turn be used to determine the age selection preferences in catchments however how useful the nitrate related data sets are exactly for constraining the age selection preferences in terms of plausibility i e being physically meaningful and uncertainty is still unclear and needs to be carefully assessed this study assesses the plausibility of the age selection preferences constrained by different data sets and quantifies the associated uncertainty the study seeks thereby to evaluate the usefulness of the constraining data sets in resolving the age selection preferences for q and et we chose the small agricultural catchment schäfertal in central germany as a study site a spatially implicit sas function based model was built to simulate the reactive transport of nitrate in the catchment the model was calibrated to the data sets of 1 in stream nitrate concentrations 2 nitrogen surplus nitrogen input plants uptake and 3 discharge age the sas functions calculated in our previous study yang et al 2018a using particle tracking for the same catchment provided a reference to assess the plausibility of the calibrated ones in present study a monte carlo approach was used to generate acceptable model realizations against the constraints using individual or combined data sets the accepted realizations were then used to calculate the uncertainties in the parameters of sas functions finally the uncertainties in response to the different constraining data sets were assessed the study aims at answering the following research questions i does the in stream nitrate data used individually or combinedly with other data sets nitrogen surplus and discharge age allows to identify plausible sasq and saset ii how much uncertainty is associated with different calibrated sas functions iii what can improve the determination of age selection preferences for q and et by answering these questions we aim to provide potential guidelines for similar studies of nitrate export especially for these catchments in temperate humid climates and with pronounced seasonality in wetness conditions 2 data collection our study used data of the catchment schäfertal during the 13 years period 1997 2010 this catchment is situated in the lower part of the harz mountains in central germany fig 2 a the catchment has an area of 1 44 km2 the valley bottom contains riparian zones with pasture and a small channel the hillslopes are mostly used for intensive agriculture the aquifer thickness varies from 2 m at the top of the hillslopes to 5 m near the valley bottom consisting of two layers a top layer of approximately 0 5 m thickness which has higher permeability and higher porosity with a developed root zone from crops and a base layer which is less permeable due to high loam content yang et al 2018a groundwater storage is low in such a thin aquifer and mostly limited to the vicinity of the channel with the upper part of the hillslopes generally being unsaturated the gauging station provides q data at 10 min intervals aggregated to daily means in this study the catchment has a temperate humid climate with pronounced seasonality being wet in winter jan apr and dry in summer jul oct a meteorological station near 200 m the catchment outlet provides records of daily precipitation j with the snow being treated as rainfall neglecting the snow storage and snowmelt processes and daily soil temperature measured in the depth of 20 cm actual evapotranspiration et was obtained from a calibrated hydrological flow model of the catchment created using hydrogeosphere in previous work yang et al 2018a the annual mean j q and et fig 2b were 610 mm 160 mm and 450 mm respectively according to the data records and the process based modeling exercise three types of data sets were collected to constrain the sas function based transport model in this study i in stream concentration of dissolved nitrate cq data with samples taken near the gauging station at 14 days to monthly intervals dupas et al 2017 covering the period 2001 2010 ii the nitrogen surplus surplus data which is the annual amount of nitrogen remaining in the soil after the consumption by plant uptake from the total nitrogen input including fertilizer on a unit area we used the mean nitrogen surplus during 1997 2010 for this catchment which was estimated as 48 8 kg n ha 1 year 1 county landkreis harz bach and frede 1998 bach et al 2011 iii the median stream water age age data i e the 50th percentile age of q we used the temporal mean of this age during 1997 2010 which was estimated as 79 days using particle tracking in yang et al 2018a even the age was derived from numerical method we still used it as data because the stream water age is kind of information that can be estimated using measured isotope data it should be noted here that the cq data are time series records while surplus data and age data are constant values derived from temporal means different estimation errors can be associated with these data sets due to the distinct data sources in this study we defined estimations errors of 10 for cq data 50 for surplus data and 50 for age data the selected estimation error for surplus are comparable with the value 66 reported in nguyen et al 2021 where surplus was estimated using their mhm nitrate model for the upper selke catchment in central germany and the estimation error for the age is comparable with the average estimation error 36 reported in lutz et al 2018 where mean transit times of 21 sub catchments were modeled using isotope data in the bode catchment in central germany the estimation error of cq were selected respecting the fact that directly measured cq data are of higher confidence than surplus data based on large scale estimation and age data derived from a numerical model 3 methods 3 1 nitrogen source zone the soil zone of our studied catchment has a depth of around 0 5 m representing a source zone for nitrate n no3 in natural system nitrate that be transported with water is formed from this nitrogen n source zone by a microbiological immobile mobile exchange process musolff et al 2017 van meter et al 2017 this study employed a simplified framework to track the fate of n in soil zone as shown in fig 3 a this framework is modified from the element approach exploration of long term nutrient trajectories van meter et al 2017 which uses a parsimonious modeling framework to estimate the biogeochemical legacy nitrate loading in the soil zone and the n fluxes leaching from the soil zone to groundwater the employed framework assumes that total n load in the soil zone is the sum of inorganic n sin and organic n son the organic n load is distinguished as active organic n sona and protected organic n sonp by the reaction kinetics the former is faster the source zone is replenished by external n input representing atmospheric deposition biological fixation animal manure from the pasture area and fertilizer from the farmland on the hillslopes the framework assumes that all the external n input contributes to the son then transforms into sin via mineralization the sin can be further consumed by plants uptake and denitrification and finally leaches to groundwater as dissolved inorganic n din representing mainly n no3 in the studied catchment yang et al 2018b nguyen et al 2021 this assumption is made based on the fact that most of the n no3 fluxes from source zone has undergone biogeochemical transformation in organic n pool haag and kaupenjohann 2001 the described framework simplifies complexities of different n pools and transformations via mineralization dissolution and denitrification within the soil zone lindström et al 2010 while preserving the main pathway for n no3 leachate in particular the n surplus can be estimated by subtracting the plants uptake from external n input in the employed framework the mineralization and plants uptake only occur in the soil zone denitrification occurs in both soil zone and later during the transport in groundwater the leaching process allows for n fluxes from the soil to groundwater a certain portion h of the external n input contributes to the sonp pool and the rest contributes to the sona pool h is the land use dependent protection coefficient van meter et al 2017 the mineralization and denitrification are described as first order processes with rate coefficients ka kp and λs respectively using 1 mine a k a f t e m p son a 2 mine p k p f t e m p son p 3 deni s λ s s i n where mine a mine p deni s kg ha 1 day 1 are the for mineralization rates for sona and sonp and denitrification rate for sin ka kp and λs day 1 are coefficients for the first order processes f t e m p is a factor representing constraint by soil temperature lindström et al 2010 plants uptake rate upt follows the equation used in the

uptake rates the computation of upt p considers logistic plant growth function dno is the day number p1 p2 p3 are three parameters depending on crop plant type and are in the units of kg ha 1 kg ha 1 and day respectively p4 is the day number of the sowing date sin leaching rate lea kg ha 1 day 1 is conceptualized as first order process using 6 lea k l f s s i n 7 f s s s max where k l is a leaching coefficient day 1 f s is a factor representing the constraint by soil moisture to the leaching process in this study it is formulated as the ratio between the water storage s in the catchment to the max water storage s max 3 2 sas function based transport model this study employed a sas function based transport model as a numerical tool to simulate the water ages and nitrate transport the model considers a typical catchment with time variable precipitation j t evapotranspiration et t and discharge q t at a time t the total storage s t in the catchment comprises water of different ages t from precipitation events that occurred in the past therefore the storage can be characterized by the age distribution ps t t similarly both evapotranspiration and discharge select water parcels of different ages from the storage according to specific selection preferences resulting in the age distributions of water leaving the catchment via et pet t t and via q pq t t respectively subsequently the control volume of stored water that has age t is defined as s t ps t t dt s t t dt the backward formulation of the age master equation has been frequently presented to describe the mass conservation of that control volume expressed in the form of the following partial differential equation botter et al 2011 van der velde et al 2012 benettin et al 2013 queloz et al 2015 harman 2015 benettin and bertuzzo 2018 8 s t t t q t p q t t e t t p et t t s t t t where the change of s t t over time is described in terms of removal by q et and aging the three terms on the right hand side of equation 8 equation 9 defines the boundary condition for the system indicating that the water has zero age when entering the storage from precipitation 9 s 0 t j t pq t t and pet t t are typically unknown and need to be defined in order to solve equation 8 for s t t to this end the theory of storage selection sas functions has been developed botter et al 2011 van der velde et al 2012 harman 2015 rinaldo et al 2015 which allows the formulation of pq t t and pet t t based on the age distribution of the water in storage ps t t 10 p q t t ω q p s t t 11 p et t t ω et p s t t where ω q and ω et are the sas functions for q and et respectively the sas functions represent the selective removal of water of different ages stored in the catchment via shifting flow paths van der velde et al 2012 van der velde et al 2015 harman 2015 yang et al 2018a sas functions can be expressed as the functions ω ps t of cumulative age distribution of storage with ps ranging from 0 to 1 van der velde et al 2012 this formalization allows an easy parameterization by means of beta distributions equation 12 and can ensure mass conservation van der velde et al 2012 harman 2015 12 ω p s t b e t a p s a b where a and b are the two beta distribution parameters with a b 1 indicating no selection preference for specific ages uniform selection and a b a b indicating a selection preference for younger older water note that the a and b can be defined as time dependent parameters the variable ps in the sas function is linked to s t t via p s 0 t p s t t d t 0 t s t t s t d t thus the age master equation equation 8 can be solved numerically similarly considering conservation of nitrate mass dissolved din in the aforementioned control volume a solute transport equation can be derived for more details see queloz et al 2015 c t t s t t t m leaching t t c t t q t p q t t α e t t p et t t 13 c t t s t t t λ c t t s t t where c t t is the nitrate concentration associated with the control volume the right side terms represent the source from leaching sinks associated with q et aging and denitrification along flow paths respectively α is a parameter to constrain the solute transport by et λ is the denitrification rate coefficient assuming that denitrification is a first order decay process leachates of sin from soil zone provides the din sources for the transport in the groundwater system fig 3b it is assumed a water parcel from precipitation falls on land surface at age zero and with zero concentration it continuously receives some leaching mass along the way passing through the soil zone until it exiting the soil zone at an age t therefore the source term from leaching in equation 13 can be calculated using 14 m leaching t t lea s t t 0 t s t t d t t t 0 t t where t represents an average time duration for fresh precipitation to take nitrate mass from soil zone the nitrate mass entering the groundwater system din can further be transported and denitrificated and eventually export to stream water the age master equation equation 8 and the nitrate transport equation equation 13 form a coupled system of equations numerically solving the equation system is accomplished using the method of characteristics which converts the partial differential equations into a set of ordinary differential equations along characteristic lines details of the approach can be found in queloz et al 2015 and benettin and bertuzzo 2018 in this study the time and age were discretized using the same step sizes δt δt 1 day outputs of the model are the age distribution of storage q and et as well as the nitrate concentration associated with different ages specifically the median ages and the concentration associated with q and et can be calculated in post processes the numerical solution was tested by simulating a transport process in an experimental rectangular catchment showing that the model can simulate the transport process well and can be used for our study see text 2 in the supplementary material 3 3 model setup we simulated nitrate transport in the catchment schäfertal for the 13 years period 1997 2010 using the aforementioned framework for the source zone and lumped numerical model for transport in the groundwater system 4 model inputs for the source zone the n external input was fixed as 180 kg ha 1 year 1 according to nguyen et al 2021 where the nitrate balance was simulated for the larger upper selke catchment central germany that covered our studied catchment we assumed the constant n external input due to the limited information on its temporal variation subsequently the temporal variation of n pools son sin is mainly controlled by time variant mineralization and plant uptake the protection coefficient h was selected as 0 3 based on the mostly agricultural usage of the land and being consistent with the values reported in van meter et al 2017 for the plants uptake sowing date p4 was selected as 60 days based on the fact that growth of plants and sowing activities of crops starts at the beginning of march testing different t values showed that when t 3 days further reducing t did not significantly improve model performance thus t was fixed as one day in this study for the transport model an initial storage s 0 of 0 3 m was used which approximately corresponds to the mean storage in the aquifer yang et al 2018a the age of initial storage was set to be uniformly distributed over the age range 0 13 yr as ps t 0 1 13 yr the initial nitrate concentration in the storage c t 0 was set to zero independent of its associated age however the influence of the initial conditions was minimized by iterating the ten year period simulations two times where the first iteration was a spin up phase providing better initial conditions for the second iteration the time series of q et and j were directly obtained from the collected data the parameter α that constrains the nitrate transport by et was assigned a value of 0 assuming that et does not remove nitrate mass from the water in storage this is because the plant uptake is already considered in the source zone according to the plant growth function eqs 4 and 5 being independent on et flux 5 model unknowns sas functions being unknown and difficult to measure is a general feature in natural catchments sas functions have to be assumed in prior and optimized later in model calibration yang et al 2018 suggested symmetrical seasonal shift of flow paths between the wet jan apr drying may jun dry jul oct and wetting nov dec periods of the year for the catchment therefore we defined time variant seasonal sasq for the four periods using four beta distributions rather than using a single sasq for an entire year while for the saset we used a temporally constant beta distribution in line with fact that temporal variability of saset is not as high as that of sasq visser et al 2019 in total there were five sas functions 4 sasq 1 saset these sas functions were determined via calibration we attempted to examine the plausibility and uncertainty of the calibrated sas functions when using the data sets to constrain the age selection preferences in our previous work yang et al 2018a a 3d physically based hydrological flow model of the catchment was built and calibrated against groundwater levels and q then the particle tracking was used to compute the age distributions for storage q and et and finally to compute mean sas functions for the four periods of the year these calculated sas functions using particle tracking can be used to compare with the calibrated ones of present study the sas functions as well as all other parameters that need calibration are listed in table 1 the calibration inverse modelling was performed using the software package pest doherty and hunt 2010 fig 4 pest uses the marquardt method to minimize the objective function which is defined as the summed squared residuals between simulated and measured data by varying the values of the parameter set until the optimization criterion is reached we used three different data sets cq surplus and age section 2 to constrain the calibration a weighting scheme was used such that the defined multi objective function was not dominated by one data set the adjustable ranges for the parameters during the calibration were selected to cover values that the parameters can potentially reach and according to literatures table 1 5 1 uncertainty assessment we assessed the uncertainty of the sas functions i e the age selection preferences in response to using different data sets to constrain the nitrate transport model this uncertainty assessment included three steps 1 calibrating the model to its best fit scenario 2 performing monte carlo simulations and 3 quantifying the uncertainty of the sas functions for the step 1 the model was calibrated to obtain best fit scenario using pest constrained against all three data types cq surplus age fig 4 the calibrated best fit scenarios allowed us to evaluate the model performances and to examine the plausibility of the calibrated sas functions by comparing them with the known ones reported in yang et al 2018 for the step 2 we used a monte carlo approach to identify acceptable model realizations other than the best fit scenario 100 000 realizations were generated by running the model with random parameter values of all adjustable parameters table 1 sampled using the latin hypercube sampling technique that guarantees reasonable distributions of parameter values over their adjustable ranges this technique has been frequently used to assess uncertainties of model predictions such as groundwater recharge and river discharge xie et al 2018 our test suggested that the 100 000 model realizations cpu time 1 min for one realization were sufficient to ensure a convergence of the calculated uncertainties acceptable realizations need to be identified against the constraints of different data sets the root mean squared error rmse for fitting each data set was calculated for each realization 15 r m s e 1 n i n m i o i 2 where the mi and oi are the modeled and observed data records of size n as we used three data sets there different rmse values were calculated a realization was considered acceptable for fitting one data set if the relevant rmse was smaller than a certain criterion following the method used in xie et al 2018 this criterion was defined by adding a portion of the estimation error to the rmse of the calibrated best fit scenario from step one for example the calibrated best fit scenario has an rmse of 1 60 mg l for fitting the cq data that has an estimation error of 10 see section 2 hence the criterion for the cq data would be 1 60 mg l plus an additional 10 so 1 60 mg l 0 16 mg l 1 76 mg l therefore a realization can be accepted with regard to the cq data constrain if its rmse is smaller than 1 76 mg l we considered four different constraints with individual or combined use of data sets 1 cq 2 cq surplus 3 cq age 4 cq surplus age when using a constraint of two or more data sets a realization was only accepted if each criterion of the individual data sets was satisfied therefore constraint 4 is the strictest one with this setup we aimed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the sas functions determined using dissolved nitrate as tracer as well as the benefit of having additional n surplus and or age data for the calibration for the step 3 the post calibration parameter uncertainty of sas functions was calculated based on the accepted model realizations the uncertainty was defined as the region that the accepted realization covers on the a b plane quantified by the area of this region see fig 3 of the supplementary material note that the uncertainty in this study referred to as parameter uncertainty describes the region of the parameter space that produce significant model output being different with typical uncertainty that focuses on the model output the uncertainties were calculated for each of the aforementioned four constraint types the reduction of these uncertainties from their prior states i e the adjustable range of a b table 1 indicates the improvement of the level of parameter uniqueness following from the calibration process brunner et al 2012 in short sas functions were more uniquely estimable if the uncertainties were reduced to a low level the most interesting statistics were the changes of the uncertainties between different constraints in such a way we were able to assess the ability of the cq surplus and age data sets to constrain age selection preferences additionally the uncertainty of other parameters other than sas functions can be also calculated because these parameters were adjustable during the random sampling step 2 however they are not the focus of this study and not discussed 6 results and discussion 6 1 plausibility assessment best fit results 6 1 1 nitrogen dynamics in source zone fig 5 a lists the calculated 13 year n mass balance in the source zone under the calibrated best fit scenario the results suggest that the inorganic sin and organic dona donp n loads were 31 kg ha 1 and 464 kg ha 1 respectively the later accounted 94 of the total n in soil source zone being consistent with the values reported in stevenson 1995 organic n fraction 90 being equal to the external input in long term mineralization provided 180 kg ha 1 yr 1 flux into sin pool 72 of this flux was consumed by plant uptake 128 kg ha 1 yr 1 followed by 22 by denitrification 40 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the source zone before leaching and in groundwater after leaching and finally 6 exported to stream water 11 kg ha 1 yr 1 the mineralization rate is within the range 14 187 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reported in heumann et al 2011 for study sites in lower saxony germany the plant uptake rate is comparable to the value around 120 kg ha 1 yr 1 suggested in nguyen et al 2021 for the same area the denitrification rate is within the range 8 51 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reported in hofstra and bouwman 2005 for 336 agricultural soils located worldwide the simulated leaching rate is around 43 kg ha 1 yr 1 which is comparable to value range 15 60 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reported in nguyen et al 2021 the long term balance demonstrated that 74 and 26 of the leaching nitrate were further removed via denitrification in groundwater system and export to stream respectively which are comparable to the values 61 and 39 reported in nguyen et al 2021 we thus conclude that the simulated n fluxes are acceptable the leaching concentrations the nitrate concentration when water parcel stops receiving leaching mass can be outputted by our model during the simulation it was verified by comparing with the nitrate concentrations measurements in soil water below the root zone of a planted and fertilized lysimeter in the nearby catchment sauerbach that has similar agricultural land use wollschläger et al 2017 our simulated leaching concentrations fitted well with the measured ones by reproducing the seasonal variation pattern fig 5b the lowest concentrations were reached at drying period may june followed by a generally rising trend throughout the dry and wetting periods reaching the highest concentrations at the end of the wetting period dec jan and finally dropping again during wet periods mechanically explain such pattern requires a close look at the temporal variation of the nitrate fluxes in source zone fig 6 a it suggested that i significant plant uptake maintained a low level of nitrate source concentration such that there was hardly any sin available for leaching during the drying and early dry periods ii the cessation of plant uptake during the late dry period caused the increase of sin load and the increase of leaching concentration iii reduction of mineralization rate in response to dropping temperatures in winter time cut the sin supply such that sin load reached its maximum at the end of wetting period and started to drop due to the leaching and plants uptake these seasonal behaviors generally are in accordance with the knowledge on nitrate transport reported in other studies dupas et al 2017 nguyen et al 2021 6 1 2 in stream concentrations generally the best fit scenario of the model showed good performance in fitting the cq data fig 6b with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 69 a preliminary calibration test using temporally constant sasq not show in this study instead of using time variant sasq suggested that the best fitting can only reach a nse of 0 55 this highlights the fact that the time variant sasq functions provide sufficient degrees of freedom to allow for the adjustment of the selection preferences for each season producing discharge with a high temporal variance in transit times to ensure a good fit for the seasonally variable concentration signal 6 1 3 age selection preferences the best fit scenarios of the model provided us with the age selection preferences of q and et in the form of sas functions fig 7 solid lines and allowed us to examine their plausibility by comparing them with the sas functions computed in yang et al 2018 fig 7 dashed lines for q distinct seasonal shifts in the selection preferences in this catchment as well as the underlying mechanisms have already been reported in yang et al 2018 during the wet periods young water from storage is preferentially discharged fig 7a with the peak of the sas function on the left side this preference shifts gradually to the older water in storage as the catchment transitions into the drying dry and wetting periods fig 7b d with the peaks of the sas function shifting towards the right side these systematic seasonal shifts are caused by the de activation of the fast shallow flow paths that influences the connectivity between the channel and the shallow soil on the hillslopes fig 1 our model can successfully identify four different sasq for different periods given that the temporal variability in the age selection preferences is a key feature of the catchment applying time variant sas functions can at least reduce potential systematic errors associated with the model structure the patterns of strong young water preference during wet periods due to fast shallow flow paths and old water preference during dry periods due deeper flow paths were well reproduced while the modeled sasq mismatches with those ones from yang et al 2018 their uncertainties grey area in fig 7 can well cover the later for the wet and dry periods thus we concluded that the model was able to determine plausible q selection preferences for the wet and dry periods for et the computed saset from yang et al 2018 generally indicates a strong selection preference for young water throughout the year fig 7e because there is always a high chance for young water from the root zone to be taken up by et unfortunately our model was not able to capture the general preference for young water fractions with the calibrated saset deviated significantly in shape from the one of yang et al 2018 even if considering the uncertainty grey area in fig 7e this suggests that the calibration process is not able to determine fully plausible et selection preferences using in stream nitrate as a tracer and constraints from the three data sets in other words the saset did not adequately represent the known dominant flow paths of et despite a good model fit to the data sets thus we hypothesize that with regard to et the constraints of data sets are weak this can be potentially due to that i the independence of plant uptake on et i e et removes water but not nitrate mass may introduce structural errors that inhabit the determination of plausible saset and ii et mainly affects the nitrate transport by altering the age composition of the storage and q such that the datasets are not directly linked to et while comparative analysis between our model sas functions and the ones from yang et al 2018 helped us evaluating the physically meaningfulness behind various shapes of sas functions it should not be considered as a validation process between our model and reality even through yang et al 2018 used particle tracking in a calibrated hydrological flow model their calculated ages and sas functions still involved errors due to the uncertainty in their flow model and limitations in the particle tracking algorithm e g excluding flow paths through or partially through land surface limitation in particle sampling for discharge see yang et al 2018 for details our present model as a spatially implicit model considered all the potential flow paths by considering the associated transit times in the out flow generation therefore the mismatches in the comparative analysis are reasonable in this sense the plausibility of the calibrated sas functions should indicate a good reproduction of general trends of age selection preferences rather than exactly matching the ones from yang et al 2018 6 2 uncertainty assessment monte carlo simulation results analysis of the accepted model realizations provided insights into the uncertainty of the sas functions associated with the four types of constraints using individual or combined data sets fig 8 generally the sasq have lower uncertainty levels and are better constrained than saset this confirms that the constraints for the selection preferences of et using cq n surplus and age of discharge were weaker since these data sets are not directly linked to et the uncertainty levels of sasq differed for the four periods it indicates that i q selection preference in the wetting period nov dec is less important for fitting all the data sets ii the q selection preference in the dry summer is less important for fitting the cq and n surplus data correctly unless additional age data is used see explanation below the uncertainty of the sas functions is influenced by the type of constraints using individual or combined data sets generally the uncertainty decreases if more constraining data sets are used this trend is observed for both the sasq and saset on average the uncertainty of sasq and saset reduced 60 and 69 respectively from using only the cq data set to using all the three data sets additional data such as the median age of discharge and the n surplus can be very helpful in reducing the uncertainty of the selection preferences once they are combined with in stream concentration measurements even if they just provide sparse yearly averaged values with significant estimation errors of up to 50 however this reduction trend of sasq uncertainty behaved differently for different periods being less pronounced during wet and wetting periods while being more pronounced during dry and drying periods this is because we used the yearly averaged n surplus and age data for the catchment of high seasonality instead of using seasonally dependent values another interesting behavior is that the age data had a significantly larger ability to constrain the sasq during the dry periods to a low uncertainty level than any other data sets compare the constraints with age to these without age fig 8 this suggested that during the low flow condition in dry summer time the q itself and the tracer related data sets cq surplus becomes less informative for example the q response to precipitation events becomes weaker in summer time in such situation on one hand additional information such as water ages becomes important to determine the q selection preferences and should be obtained and applied in similar studies whenever possible on the other hand it is necessary to improve the quality of cq during dry summer time 6 3 usefulness of the data sets the model was able to simulate in stream nitrate concentrations based on calibrated sas functions a good model performance can be achieved by choosing appropriate outflow selection preferences and does not necessarily require resolving the spatially varying catchment properties in a physically based hydrogeological model e g henri and harter 2019 henri et al 2020 in that sense the simple integrated model is a highly efficient tool to simulate nitrate export at the catchment scale with a cpu time in the order of minutes compared to days for a physically based hydrogeological models like e g the hydrogeosphere model in yang et al 2018 however only matching data sets to a good level does not necessary reveal the reasonable selection preferences in the catchment evaluating the usefulness of the data sets requires assessing the plausibility and uncertainty of the calibrated sas functions in our study a sas function was identified as good when it produced the plausible selection preferences revealing the general seasonal shifts of flow paths reported in previous study with an acceptable level of uncertainty we simply assumed that the uncertainties less than 3 5 were acceptable which corresponds to 10 of the maximum uncertainty 35 fig 8 following this we generated a summary of the plausibility and uncertainty of the calibrated sas functions table 2 with sas functions being unknown prior to calibration the combined constraint consisting of in stream concentrations discharge median age and n surplus was useful to determine the good q selection preferences for most time of a year wet and dry periods the constraint failed to determine a good et selection preference this indicates that the data sets we used were not sufficiently informative to adequately constrain the et selection preference they are thus ill constrained in fact this ill constrained problem led to some of the a b values of the calibrated sas functions being located near the boundaries of their adjustable ranges see fig 3e of the supplementary material these overall results suggest that more or different data sets are required in the inverse process to better constrain the selection preferences for example the following methods data can potentially be used i enhancing the data quality of the in stream nitrate concentration time series through more frequent measurements especially in the dry period in summer ii providing additional data sets more closely linked to et e g the age of et that may be derived from isotope data or other tracers previous studies have pointed out that in stream data contained a wealth of information that could be used to infer age selection preferences van der velde et al 2012 queloz et al 2015 our study using in stream nitrate data confirmed that by showing the data usefulness in identifying the age selection preference for q during the calibration the reactive tracer was considered to be less informative than conservative tracer as the reaction processes may hamper the calibration processes queloz et al 2015 our study suggested that the potential disadvantage of using reactive tracer over using conservative tracer may be overcome by introducing additional constraints against tracer source e g n surplus and reaction processes e g discharge transit time because the combined constraint using these additional data together with in stream data can significant reduce the uncertainties of age selection preferences as q and et can both affect the age composition in streamflow queloz et al 2015 suggested that the et selection preference can potentially be identified through the constraint using only the tracer data in q however our study using nitrate as a tracer failed in determining an appropriate age selection preference for et suggesting that saset can be harder to constrain using reactive tracer data in q in our study the calibration performance was generally better in wet and dry periods than in drying and wetting periods e g the former having better plausibility and lower uncertainty this suggests that hydrology and hydrologic transport is more difficult to characterize and simulate under transition periods than under stable periods when flow filed is more stable and smoother future emphasis should be placed on improving the model both forward inverse performance during the two transition periods 7 limitations first complexities n fluxes in source zone were simplified by defining a framework describing the main pathway for n no3 leachate with temporally constant external n input on the one hand this simplification neglected other processes such as the time variant external n input direct input of external n to inorganic n pool the transformation from protected organic n to active organic n and the loss of organic n via dissolution lindström et al 2010 on the other hand this simplification allows us to focus on the main source of n no3 rather than keeping track of the full nitrogen fluxes in the source zone of the catchment while maintaining the overall nitrogen balance using surplus as a constraint second spatial source heterogeneity cannot be considered in the model currently the source concentration is uniformly applied to all water parcels that enter the catchment regardless of where they enter this assumption ignores the strong spatial source heterogeneity that may exist in catchments in particular when larger in size for example higher source concentrations are associated with water parcels entering from hillslopes where fertilizer is applied with longer flow paths and different source concentrations are distributed along catchment depths zhi et al 2019 this spatial source heterogeneity can affect the nitrate export patterns significantly musolff et al 2017 zhi et al 2019 this assumption is essential for a lumped model implementing distributed physically based hydrogeological models for solute transport can easily overcome such limitation but in turn requiring resolving the spatially varying catchment properties henri and harter 2019 henri et al 2020 last a constant denitrification rate coefficient in groundwater was assumed in the model such that the denitrification rate is only affected by the available nitrate mass in water parcels however in reality the denitrification rates are also affected by various other factors and may vary in space and time those factors include the temperature higher rates during warmer periods and the redox boundaries caused by fluctuating groundwater levels e g high oxygen concentration in shallow flow paths they also contribute to the seasonality in nitrate concentrations böhlke et al 2007 the abovementioned limitations can surely be overcome by implementing more detailed processes in the model at the same time increasing the degrees of freedom or even by choosing other physically based models that can fully resolve the flow and transport processes in catchment space however by doing so model complexity and parameter uncertainty will increase models with a larger number of parameters which are difficult to constrain could then mask some of the integral trends in catchment response which we could reveal here with a more parsimonious model in that sense the presented model is first of all an explorative tool to elucidate general catchment behavior for more specific applications the decision which parameters are allowed to vary and which parameters remain constant in the model should be problem oriented so that the model can have problem related adequate levels of uncertainty in our study even though these limitations exist the model proved to be successful in simulating the dynamics of nitrate transport investigating the usefulness of the data sets and providing some general guidelines for inverse modeling 8 conclusions in this study we assessed how different sources of data help in constraining catchment selection preferences in the agricultural catchment schäfertal in germany nitrate export from this catchment was simulated with a lumped transport model based on the age selection preferences for q and et described by sas functions model calibration allowed us to determine the sas functions for q and et the plausibility of the calibrated spatially implicit sas functions was assessed by comparing them to the sas functions derived from spatially explicit particle tracking the parameter uncertainties of the sas functions in response to different constraints using individual or combined data sets in stream concentrations discharge median age and n surplus were calculated and assessed via monte carlo simulations the main conclusions of this study are the observed nitrate in stream nitrate concentrations were well reproduced in the model with acceptable n fluxes in the source zone using dynamic sas functions improved the model performance for fitting the in stream concentrations due to more flexibility in capturing the temporal variability in the age selection preference plausible q selection preferences which exhibit distinct seasonal shifts could be determined in the model calibration for wet and dry periods of a year however the used constraints were not able to determine plausible et selection preferences as the data sets were only weakly linked to et uncertainty analysis suggested that the uncertainty for the q selection preferences was smaller than that for et more than 60 reduction of uncertainty was achieved when using combined data sets instead of using only the in stream concentration data in dry summer time additional information of water age is significantly helpful in reducing the uncertainty for the q selection preferences even if it is just sparse yearly averaged value that can only be indirectly derived from other methods such as isotope data or numerical models a combined constraint in stream concentrations discharge median age and n surplus was useful to determine good being plausible low uncertainty q selection preferences for most time of a year however it failed to determine good et selection preferences in order to determine better selection preferences our study suggests to acquire in stream concentration data set of improved quality and additional data sets with a closer link to et despite simplifying assumptions and some limitations this study has improved our understanding of the ability of certain data sets to constrain the seasonal age selection preferences that are controlled by shifting flow paths our conclusions can provide important guidelines in terms of data collection and model design for similar nitrate export studies in particular for catchments in temperate humid climates with pronounced

4164,excess export of nitrate to streams has been an environmental issue attracting attention across the world lumped models based on storage selection sas functions have been used widely to investigate this export processes in terms of hydrological and chemical responses in catchment outflux both in discharge q and in evapotranspiration et the validity of these models depends on the appropriate choice of water age selection preferences i e the parameterization of the sas functions of q and et which are often calibrated against observed in stream tracer data this study attempted to assess the usefulness of in stream nitrate n no3 concentrations for resolving the sas functions in terms of plausibility being physically meaningful and parameter uncertainty in a small agricultural catchment in central germany that experiences strong seasonality a spatially implicit model was built to simulate the dynamics of nitrate export the data sets of in stream nitrate concentrations nitrogen surplus in the soil and the median age of q were used to constrain the model the best fit to all data sets results indicate high plausibility of the calibrated temporally dynamic age selection preferences for q for most time of a year however not for et the uncertainty analysis using a monte carlo approach suggests that lower uncertainty is associated with the sas functions for q than that for et the uncertainties of the sas functions can be reduced by 60 combining the three datasets instead of using only in stream concentration data this study demonstrated the

nitrate n no3 excess export of nitrate to streams threatens ecosystem structure and functions and human health via drinking water vitousek et al 2009 alvarez cobelas et al 2008 dupas et al 2017 this has been an environmental issue attracting attention in germany across europe and the world the dynamics of nitrate transport from diffuse sources is regulated by the dominant flow paths that determine the speed at which precipitation travels through catchments before it reaches the stream jasechko et al 2016 this transport process is subject to both hydrological and biogeochemical influences better understanding and simulating this process are necessary for the management of water quality in connection with agricultural activities describing and modelling solute not limited to nitrate transport based on transit time distributions ttds is being used increasingly as a spatially implicit way to estimate solute dynamics at large spatial and temporal scales this includes the transport of conservative tracers benettin et al 2015 the fate of nutrients and pollutants in catchments van der velde et al 2010 2012 hrachowitz et al 2015 and legacy sources sinks in large river basins van meter et al 2017 rather than assigning predefined ttds recent catchment scale transport models have focused on estimating the ttds following an age master equation botter et al 2011 which describes the water mass balance in control volumes of all possible ages in this approach transport processes are described by the choice of storage selection sas functions which have been argued to be more stable in time van der velde et al 2012 or to be easily parameterized based on state variables kim et al 2016 than underlying ttds that tend to reflect the system state in one instance in time and thus strongly vary temporally heidbüchel et al 2012 2013 kim et al 2016 the theory of sas functions has been developed to mathematically characterize the selection preferences for certain water ages during outflow generation botter et al 2011 van der velde et al 2012 harman 2015 rinaldo et al 2015 i e to characterize the relative contributions of the stored water of different ages to discharge q and evapotranspiration et note that the concept of selection in a hydrologic system refers to the discharge of stored water via different flow paths rather than to an active selection of water parcels the sas functions being flexible in shape can represent complex age selection preferences while the underlying physical mechanisms may not yet be understood see text 1 in the supplementary material for an illustration of three typical shapes of sas function it has been argued that sas functions can be adequately approximated by theoretical probability distributions such as beta van der velde et al 2012 or power law distributions harman 2019 in turn the ability of the model to simulate and predict solute export patterns hinges on the appropriate parameterization of the sas functions i e the correct choice of age selection preferences with acceptable parameter uncertainty levels given the difficulty of directly measuring water age distributions and sas functions in natural catchments model calibration is one of the most efficient method to determine them i e to adjust and optimize the sas functions such that the simulated results fit observational data sets also referred to as constraining the sas functions studies using inverse modeling calibration to determine et and q sas functions abbreviated as saset and sasq respectively and assessing the associated parameter uncertainty i e the region of the input parameter space that produce significant output results are still rare some studies have successfully determined the sas functions using inverse modeling but did not included parameter uncertainties for example benettin et al 2015 used high frequency chloride concentration data to constrain their transport model for the upper hafren catchment uk indicating a shift of the q selection preference between young water shallower storage and older water deeper storage however the results were based on a model with two distributed storage volumes each one assumed to be well mixed and did not include uncertainty analysis van der velde et al 2015 numerically explored the impact of four age selection preferences mixing assumptions on ttds with parameters being calibrated against the in stream isotopic signature from two catchments in sweden and arizona usa however they focused on the improvement of model performance with different selection preferences not on deriving the parameter uncertainty under the constraint of concentration data some studies were limited to smaller scales such as the lysimeter scale queloz et al 2015 and the scale of root zones sprenger et al 2016 evaristo et al 2019 rather than at catchment of strong seasonality queloz et al 2015 simulated the transport of fluorobenzoate tracers during a large lysimeter experiment and calibrated the sas functions against the tracer breakthrough curves they argued that the conservative tracers were more informative for characterizing transport processes as any reaction processes may hamper parameter identification as number of parameters increases queloz et al 2015 they also suggested that the saset could be determined through calibration constrained only by tracer concentrations in q these suggestions are helpful guidelines for the use of tracer data however they were made at the lysimeter scale where the age selection preferences did not exhibit much temporal variability compared to natural catchments yang et al 2018a harman 2015 2019 simulated the chloride transport at plynlimon uk where in stream concentration data were used to constrain the sasq and saset that were defined as storage dependent and hence dynamic we note that plynlimon is subject to much smaller seasonality than our studied catchment in central germany described later as indicated by the moderately variable chloride concentrations in streams varying on the event scale recent studies have pointed out the necessity of considering uncertainty for the interpretation of sas functions wilusz et al 2017 knighton et al 2019 visser et al 2019 wilusz et al 2017 used a lumped transit time model to numerically investigate of the effect of rainfall variability on young stream water friction of the streams plynlimon and wales uk saset and sasq which were calibrated using conservative chloride tracer in the stream water were interpreted together with uncertainties estimated using markov chain monte carlo method visser et al 2019 provided the first study combining data sets of three radioactive and one stable isotopes in determining the age selection preferences of q and et in providence creek california usa they demonstrated the varying uncertainty of sasq and saset in response to the different constraining data sets individual or combined these studies successfully addressed the challenge of sas function uncertainty in their transit time solute transport modeling however similar studies are still rare and expected especially for catchments with pronounced seasonality in climatic drivers given that most studies used conservative tracers e g chloride δ18o benettin et al 2013 hrachowitz et al 2015 van der velde et al 2015 queloz et al 2015 harman 2015 2019 the use of nitrate n no3 as tracer for constraining the sas functions is scarce this can be due to i the complexity of reactive transport and ii the lack of either field data of nitrate inputs and outputs denitrification plant uptake or an effective method for estimating them van der velde et al 2012 constructed a numerical nitrate transport model for the hupsel brook catchment in the netherlands where the nitrate source input and reactions were simplified into a representation by diffusion and degradation processes they suggested that the in stream data contained a wealth of information that could potentially be used to infer the age selection preferences however their suggestion has not yet been systematically examined for nitrate nguyen et al 2021 used their coupled mhm sas model to simulating the nitrate export from a mesoscale catchment where the age selection preferences were constrained using in stream nitrate data however they focused on the applicability of sas function based solute transport models to mesoscale catchments rather than on the data usefulness on resolving age selection preferences of q and et the seasonal variability of in stream nitrate concentration is strongly linked to the seasonal age selection preferences caused by shifting flow paths field observations in mountainous central german catchments indicate that in stream nitrate concentrations as well as the mass load vary seasonally with maxima during the wet winter and minima during the dry summer dupas et al 2017 based on data driven analyses musolff et al 2015 and dupas et al 2017 suggested a systematic seasonal dis connection of nitrate source zones from to streams for such seasonal variability under wetter winter conditions the near surface nitrate source zones in agricultural soils are connected to the stream by fast shallow flow paths fig 1 a under drier summer conditions those nitrate source zones are deactivated because their direct hydrologic connectivity to the stream is inhibited by low groundwater levels fig 1b based on high frequency monitoring in the wood brook catchment in the uk blaen et al 2017 also reported mobilization of nitrate from the uppermost soil layers via shallow preferential flow paths during high flow conditions which does not occur during base flow in drier periods we hypothesize that the responses of in stream concentrations caused by changing flow paths and the associated changes in transit times can in turn be used to determine the age selection preferences in catchments however how useful the nitrate related data sets are exactly for constraining the age selection preferences in terms of plausibility i e being physically meaningful and uncertainty is still unclear and needs to be carefully assessed this study assesses the plausibility of the age selection preferences constrained by different data sets and quantifies the associated uncertainty the study seeks thereby to evaluate the usefulness of the constraining data sets in resolving the age selection preferences for q and et we chose the small agricultural catchment schäfertal in central germany as a study site a spatially implicit sas function based model was built to simulate the reactive transport of nitrate in the catchment the model was calibrated to the data sets of 1 in stream nitrate concentrations 2 nitrogen surplus nitrogen input plants uptake and 3 discharge age the sas functions calculated in our previous study yang et al 2018a using particle tracking for the same catchment provided a reference to assess the plausibility of the calibrated ones in present study a monte carlo approach was used to generate acceptable model realizations against the constraints using individual or combined data sets the accepted realizations were then used to calculate the uncertainties in the parameters of sas functions finally the uncertainties in response to the different constraining data sets were assessed the study aims at answering the following research questions i does the in stream nitrate data used individually or combinedly with other data sets nitrogen surplus and discharge age allows to identify plausible sasq and saset ii how much uncertainty is associated with different calibrated sas functions iii what can improve the determination of age selection preferences for q and et by answering these questions we aim to provide potential guidelines for similar studies of nitrate export especially for these catchments in temperate humid climates and with pronounced seasonality in wetness conditions 2 data collection our study used data of the catchment schäfertal during the 13 years period 1997 2010 this catchment is situated in the lower part of the harz mountains in central germany fig 2 a the catchment has an area of 1 44 km2 the valley bottom contains riparian zones with pasture and a small channel the hillslopes are mostly used for intensive agriculture the aquifer thickness varies from 2 m at the top of the hillslopes to 5 m near the valley bottom consisting of two layers a top layer of approximately 0 5 m thickness which has higher permeability and higher porosity with a developed root zone from crops and a base layer which is less permeable due to high loam content yang et al 2018a groundwater storage is low in such a thin aquifer and mostly limited to the vicinity of the channel with the upper part of the hillslopes generally being unsaturated the gauging station provides q data at 10 min intervals aggregated to daily means in this study the catchment has a temperate humid climate with pronounced seasonality being wet in winter jan apr and dry in summer jul oct a meteorological station near 200 m the catchment outlet provides records of daily precipitation j with the snow being treated as rainfall neglecting the snow storage and snowmelt processes and daily soil temperature measured in the depth of 20 cm actual evapotranspiration et was obtained from a calibrated hydrological flow model of the catchment created using hydrogeosphere in previous work yang et al 2018a the annual mean j q and et fig 2b were 610 mm 160 mm and 450 mm respectively according to the data records and the process based modeling exercise three types of data sets were collected to constrain the sas function based transport model in this study i in stream concentration of dissolved nitrate cq data with samples taken near the gauging station at 14 days to monthly intervals dupas et al 2017 covering the period 2001 2010 ii the nitrogen surplus surplus data which is the annual amount of nitrogen remaining in the soil after the consumption by plant uptake from the total nitrogen input including fertilizer on a unit area we used the mean nitrogen surplus during 1997 2010 for this catchment which was estimated as 48 8 kg n ha 1 year 1 county landkreis harz bach and frede 1998 bach et al 2011 iii the median stream water age age data i e the 50th percentile age of q we used the temporal mean of this age during 1997 2010 which was estimated as 79 days using particle tracking in yang et al 2018a even the age was derived from numerical method we still used it as data because the stream water age is kind of information that can be estimated using measured isotope data it should be noted here that the cq data are time series records while surplus data and age data are constant values derived from temporal means different estimation errors can be associated with these data sets due to the distinct data sources in this study we defined estimations errors of 10 for cq data 50 for surplus data and 50 for age data the selected estimation error for surplus are comparable with the value 66 reported in nguyen et al 2021 where surplus was estimated using their mhm nitrate model for the upper selke catchment in central germany and the estimation error for the age is comparable with the average estimation error 36 reported in lutz et al 2018 where mean transit times of 21 sub catchments were modeled using isotope data in the bode catchment in central germany the estimation error of cq were selected respecting the fact that directly measured cq data are of higher confidence than surplus data based on large scale estimation and age data derived from a numerical model 3 methods 3 1 nitrogen source zone the soil zone of our studied catchment has a depth of around 0 5 m representing a source zone for nitrate n no3 in natural system nitrate that be transported with water is formed from this nitrogen n source zone by a microbiological immobile mobile exchange process musolff et al 2017 van meter et al 2017 this study employed a simplified framework to track the fate of n in soil zone as shown in fig 3 a this framework is modified from the element approach exploration of long term nutrient trajectories van meter et al 2017 which uses a parsimonious modeling framework to estimate the biogeochemical legacy nitrate loading in the soil zone and the n fluxes leaching from the soil zone to groundwater the employed framework assumes that total n load in the soil zone is the sum of inorganic n sin and organic n son the organic n load is distinguished as active organic n sona and protected organic n sonp by the reaction kinetics the former is faster the source zone is replenished by external n input representing atmospheric deposition biological fixation animal manure from the pasture area and fertilizer from the farmland on the hillslopes the framework assumes that all the external n input contributes to the son then transforms into sin via mineralization the sin can be further consumed by plants uptake and denitrification and finally leaches to groundwater as dissolved inorganic n din representing mainly n no3 in the studied catchment yang et al 2018b nguyen et al 2021 this assumption is made based on the fact that most of the n no3 fluxes from source zone has undergone biogeochemical transformation in organic n pool haag and kaupenjohann 2001 the described framework simplifies complexities of different n pools and transformations via mineralization dissolution and denitrification within the soil zone lindström et al 2010 while preserving the main pathway for n no3 leachate in particular the n surplus can be estimated by subtracting the plants uptake from external n input in the employed framework the mineralization and plants uptake only occur in the soil zone denitrification occurs in both soil zone and later during the transport in groundwater the leaching process allows for n fluxes from the soil to groundwater a certain portion h of the external n input contributes to the sonp pool and the rest contributes to the sona pool h is the land use dependent protection coefficient van meter et al 2017 the mineralization and denitrification are described as first order processes with rate coefficients ka kp and λs respectively using 1 mine a k a f t e m p son a 2 mine p k p f t e m p son p 3 deni s λ s s i n where mine a mine p deni s kg ha 1 day 1 are the for mineralization rates for sona and sonp and denitrification rate for sin ka kp and λs day 1 are coefficients for the first order processes f t e m p is a factor representing constraint by soil temperature lindström et al 2010 plants uptake rate upt follows the equation used in the

uptake rates the computation of upt p considers logistic plant growth function dno is the day number p1 p2 p3 are three parameters depending on crop plant type and are in the units of kg ha 1 kg ha 1 and day respectively p4 is the day number of the sowing date sin leaching rate lea kg ha 1 day 1 is conceptualized as first order process using 6 lea k l f s s i n 7 f s s s max where k l is a leaching coefficient day 1 f s is a factor representing the constraint by soil moisture to the leaching process in this study it is formulated as the ratio between the water storage s in the catchment to the max water storage s max 3 2 sas function based transport model this study employed a sas function based transport model as a numerical tool to simulate the water ages and nitrate transport the model considers a typical catchment with time variable precipitation j t evapotranspiration et t and discharge q t at a time t the total storage s t in the catchment comprises water of different ages t from precipitation events that occurred in the past therefore the storage can be characterized by the age distribution ps t t similarly both evapotranspiration and discharge select water parcels of different ages from the storage according to specific selection preferences resulting in the age distributions of water leaving the catchment via et pet t t and via q pq t t respectively subsequently the control volume of stored water that has age t is defined as s t ps t t dt s t t dt the backward formulation of the age master equation has been frequently presented to describe the mass conservation of that control volume expressed in the form of the following partial differential equation botter et al 2011 van der velde et al 2012 benettin et al 2013 queloz et al 2015 harman 2015 benettin and bertuzzo 2018 8 s t t t q t p q t t e t t p et t t s t t t where the change of s t t over time is described in terms of removal by q et and aging the three terms on the right hand side of equation 8 equation 9 defines the boundary condition for the system indicating that the water has zero age when entering the storage from precipitation 9 s 0 t j t pq t t and pet t t are typically unknown and need to be defined in order to solve equation 8 for s t t to this end the theory of storage selection sas functions has been developed botter et al 2011 van der velde et al 2012 harman 2015 rinaldo et al 2015 which allows the formulation of pq t t and pet t t based on the age distribution of the water in storage ps t t 10 p q t t ω q p s t t 11 p et t t ω et p s t t where ω q and ω et are the sas functions for q and et respectively the sas functions represent the selective removal of water of different ages stored in the catchment via shifting flow paths van der velde et al 2012 van der velde et al 2015 harman 2015 yang et al 2018a sas functions can be expressed as the functions ω ps t of cumulative age distribution of storage with ps ranging from 0 to 1 van der velde et al 2012 this formalization allows an easy parameterization by means of beta distributions equation 12 and can ensure mass conservation van der velde et al 2012 harman 2015 12 ω p s t b e t a p s a b where a and b are the two beta distribution parameters with a b 1 indicating no selection preference for specific ages uniform selection and a b a b indicating a selection preference for younger older water note that the a and b can be defined as time dependent parameters the variable ps in the sas function is linked to s t t via p s 0 t p s t t d t 0 t s t t s t d t thus the age master equation equation 8 can be solved numerically similarly considering conservation of nitrate mass dissolved din in the aforementioned control volume a solute transport equation can be derived for more details see queloz et al 2015 c t t s t t t m leaching t t c t t q t p q t t α e t t p et t t 13 c t t s t t t λ c t t s t t where c t t is the nitrate concentration associated with the control volume the right side terms represent the source from leaching sinks associated with q et aging and denitrification along flow paths respectively α is a parameter to constrain the solute transport by et λ is the denitrification rate coefficient assuming that denitrification is a first order decay process leachates of sin from soil zone provides the din sources for the transport in the groundwater system fig 3b it is assumed a water parcel from precipitation falls on land surface at age zero and with zero concentration it continuously receives some leaching mass along the way passing through the soil zone until it exiting the soil zone at an age t therefore the source term from leaching in equation 13 can be calculated using 14 m leaching t t lea s t t 0 t s t t d t t t 0 t t where t represents an average time duration for fresh precipitation to take nitrate mass from soil zone the nitrate mass entering the groundwater system din can further be transported and denitrificated and eventually export to stream water the age master equation equation 8 and the nitrate transport equation equation 13 form a coupled system of equations numerically solving the equation system is accomplished using the method of characteristics which converts the partial differential equations into a set of ordinary differential equations along characteristic lines details of the approach can be found in queloz et al 2015 and benettin and bertuzzo 2018 in this study the time and age were discretized using the same step sizes δt δt 1 day outputs of the model are the age distribution of storage q and et as well as the nitrate concentration associated with different ages specifically the median ages and the concentration associated with q and et can be calculated in post processes the numerical solution was tested by simulating a transport process in an experimental rectangular catchment showing that the model can simulate the transport process well and can be used for our study see text 2 in the supplementary material 3 3 model setup we simulated nitrate transport in the catchment schäfertal for the 13 years period 1997 2010 using the aforementioned framework for the source zone and lumped numerical model for transport in the groundwater system 4 model inputs for the source zone the n external input was fixed as 180 kg ha 1 year 1 according to nguyen et al 2021 where the nitrate balance was simulated for the larger upper selke catchment central germany that covered our studied catchment we assumed the constant n external input due to the limited information on its temporal variation subsequently the temporal variation of n pools son sin is mainly controlled by time variant mineralization and plant uptake the protection coefficient h was selected as 0 3 based on the mostly agricultural usage of the land and being consistent with the values reported in van meter et al 2017 for the plants uptake sowing date p4 was selected as 60 days based on the fact that growth of plants and sowing activities of crops starts at the beginning of march testing different t values showed that when t 3 days further reducing t did not significantly improve model performance thus t was fixed as one day in this study for the transport model an initial storage s 0 of 0 3 m was used which approximately corresponds to the mean storage in the aquifer yang et al 2018a the age of initial storage was set to be uniformly distributed over the age range 0 13 yr as ps t 0 1 13 yr the initial nitrate concentration in the storage c t 0 was set to zero independent of its associated age however the influence of the initial conditions was minimized by iterating the ten year period simulations two times where the first iteration was a spin up phase providing better initial conditions for the second iteration the time series of q et and j were directly obtained from the collected data the parameter α that constrains the nitrate transport by et was assigned a value of 0 assuming that et does not remove nitrate mass from the water in storage this is because the plant uptake is already considered in the source zone according to the plant growth function eqs 4 and 5 being independent on et flux 5 model unknowns sas functions being unknown and difficult to measure is a general feature in natural catchments sas functions have to be assumed in prior and optimized later in model calibration yang et al 2018 suggested symmetrical seasonal shift of flow paths between the wet jan apr drying may jun dry jul oct and wetting nov dec periods of the year for the catchment therefore we defined time variant seasonal sasq for the four periods using four beta distributions rather than using a single sasq for an entire year while for the saset we used a temporally constant beta distribution in line with fact that temporal variability of saset is not as high as that of sasq visser et al 2019 in total there were five sas functions 4 sasq 1 saset these sas functions were determined via calibration we attempted to examine the plausibility and uncertainty of the calibrated sas functions when using the data sets to constrain the age selection preferences in our previous work yang et al 2018a a 3d physically based hydrological flow model of the catchment was built and calibrated against groundwater levels and q then the particle tracking was used to compute the age distributions for storage q and et and finally to compute mean sas functions for the four periods of the year these calculated sas functions using particle tracking can be used to compare with the calibrated ones of present study the sas functions as well as all other parameters that need calibration are listed in table 1 the calibration inverse modelling was performed using the software package pest doherty and hunt 2010 fig 4 pest uses the marquardt method to minimize the objective function which is defined as the summed squared residuals between simulated and measured data by varying the values of the parameter set until the optimization criterion is reached we used three different data sets cq surplus and age section 2 to constrain the calibration a weighting scheme was used such that the defined multi objective function was not dominated by one data set the adjustable ranges for the parameters during the calibration were selected to cover values that the parameters can potentially reach and according to literatures table 1 5 1 uncertainty assessment we assessed the uncertainty of the sas functions i e the age selection preferences in response to using different data sets to constrain the nitrate transport model this uncertainty assessment included three steps 1 calibrating the model to its best fit scenario 2 performing monte carlo simulations and 3 quantifying the uncertainty of the sas functions for the step 1 the model was calibrated to obtain best fit scenario using pest constrained against all three data types cq surplus age fig 4 the calibrated best fit scenarios allowed us to evaluate the model performances and to examine the plausibility of the calibrated sas functions by comparing them with the known ones reported in yang et al 2018 for the step 2 we used a monte carlo approach to identify acceptable model realizations other than the best fit scenario 100 000 realizations were generated by running the model with random parameter values of all adjustable parameters table 1 sampled using the latin hypercube sampling technique that guarantees reasonable distributions of parameter values over their adjustable ranges this technique has been frequently used to assess uncertainties of model predictions such as groundwater recharge and river discharge xie et al 2018 our test suggested that the 100 000 model realizations cpu time 1 min for one realization were sufficient to ensure a convergence of the calculated uncertainties acceptable realizations need to be identified against the constraints of different data sets the root mean squared error rmse for fitting each data set was calculated for each realization 15 r m s e 1 n i n m i o i 2 where the mi and oi are the modeled and observed data records of size n as we used three data sets there different rmse values were calculated a realization was considered acceptable for fitting one data set if the relevant rmse was smaller than a certain criterion following the method used in xie et al 2018 this criterion was defined by adding a portion of the estimation error to the rmse of the calibrated best fit scenario from step one for example the calibrated best fit scenario has an rmse of 1 60 mg l for fitting the cq data that has an estimation error of 10 see section 2 hence the criterion for the cq data would be 1 60 mg l plus an additional 10 so 1 60 mg l 0 16 mg l 1 76 mg l therefore a realization can be accepted with regard to the cq data constrain if its rmse is smaller than 1 76 mg l we considered four different constraints with individual or combined use of data sets 1 cq 2 cq surplus 3 cq age 4 cq surplus age when using a constraint of two or more data sets a realization was only accepted if each criterion of the individual data sets was satisfied therefore constraint 4 is the strictest one with this setup we aimed to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the sas functions determined using dissolved nitrate as tracer as well as the benefit of having additional n surplus and or age data for the calibration for the step 3 the post calibration parameter uncertainty of sas functions was calculated based on the accepted model realizations the uncertainty was defined as the region that the accepted realization covers on the a b plane quantified by the area of this region see fig 3 of the supplementary material note that the uncertainty in this study referred to as parameter uncertainty describes the region of the parameter space that produce significant model output being different with typical uncertainty that focuses on the model output the uncertainties were calculated for each of the aforementioned four constraint types the reduction of these uncertainties from their prior states i e the adjustable range of a b table 1 indicates the improvement of the level of parameter uniqueness following from the calibration process brunner et al 2012 in short sas functions were more uniquely estimable if the uncertainties were reduced to a low level the most interesting statistics were the changes of the uncertainties between different constraints in such a way we were able to assess the ability of the cq surplus and age data sets to constrain age selection preferences additionally the uncertainty of other parameters other than sas functions can be also calculated because these parameters were adjustable during the random sampling step 2 however they are not the focus of this study and not discussed 6 results and discussion 6 1 plausibility assessment best fit results 6 1 1 nitrogen dynamics in source zone fig 5 a lists the calculated 13 year n mass balance in the source zone under the calibrated best fit scenario the results suggest that the inorganic sin and organic dona donp n loads were 31 kg ha 1 and 464 kg ha 1 respectively the later accounted 94 of the total n in soil source zone being consistent with the values reported in stevenson 1995 organic n fraction 90 being equal to the external input in long term mineralization provided 180 kg ha 1 yr 1 flux into sin pool 72 of this flux was consumed by plant uptake 128 kg ha 1 yr 1 followed by 22 by denitrification 40 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the source zone before leaching and in groundwater after leaching and finally 6 exported to stream water 11 kg ha 1 yr 1 the mineralization rate is within the range 14 187 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reported in heumann et al 2011 for study sites in lower saxony germany the plant uptake rate is comparable to the value around 120 kg ha 1 yr 1 suggested in nguyen et al 2021 for the same area the denitrification rate is within the range 8 51 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reported in hofstra and bouwman 2005 for 336 agricultural soils located worldwide the simulated leaching rate is around 43 kg ha 1 yr 1 which is comparable to value range 15 60 kg n ha 1 yr 1 reported in nguyen et al 2021 the long term balance demonstrated that 74 and 26 of the leaching nitrate were further removed via denitrification in groundwater system and export to stream respectively which are comparable to the values 61 and 39 reported in nguyen et al 2021 we thus conclude that the simulated n fluxes are acceptable the leaching concentrations the nitrate concentration when water parcel stops receiving leaching mass can be outputted by our model during the simulation it was verified by comparing with the nitrate concentrations measurements in soil water below the root zone of a planted and fertilized lysimeter in the nearby catchment sauerbach that has similar agricultural land use wollschläger et al 2017 our simulated leaching concentrations fitted well with the measured ones by reproducing the seasonal variation pattern fig 5b the lowest concentrations were reached at drying period may june followed by a generally rising trend throughout the dry and wetting periods reaching the highest concentrations at the end of the wetting period dec jan and finally dropping again during wet periods mechanically explain such pattern requires a close look at the temporal variation of the nitrate fluxes in source zone fig 6 a it suggested that i significant plant uptake maintained a low level of nitrate source concentration such that there was hardly any sin available for leaching during the drying and early dry periods ii the cessation of plant uptake during the late dry period caused the increase of sin load and the increase of leaching concentration iii reduction of mineralization rate in response to dropping temperatures in winter time cut the sin supply such that sin load reached its maximum at the end of wetting period and started to drop due to the leaching and plants uptake these seasonal behaviors generally are in accordance with the knowledge on nitrate transport reported in other studies dupas et al 2017 nguyen et al 2021 6 1 2 in stream concentrations generally the best fit scenario of the model showed good performance in fitting the cq data fig 6b with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 69 a preliminary calibration test using temporally constant sasq not show in this study instead of using time variant sasq suggested that the best fitting can only reach a nse of 0 55 this highlights the fact that the time variant sasq functions provide sufficient degrees of freedom to allow for the adjustment of the selection preferences for each season producing discharge with a high temporal variance in transit times to ensure a good fit for the seasonally variable concentration signal 6 1 3 age selection preferences the best fit scenarios of the model provided us with the age selection preferences of q and et in the form of sas functions fig 7 solid lines and allowed us to examine their plausibility by comparing them with the sas functions computed in yang et al 2018 fig 7 dashed lines for q distinct seasonal shifts in the selection preferences in this catchment as well as the underlying mechanisms have already been reported in yang et al 2018 during the wet periods young water from storage is preferentially discharged fig 7a with the peak of the sas function on the left side this preference shifts gradually to the older water in storage as the catchment transitions into the drying dry and wetting periods fig 7b d with the peaks of the sas function shifting towards the right side these systematic seasonal shifts are caused by the de activation of the fast shallow flow paths that influences the connectivity between the channel and the shallow soil on the hillslopes fig 1 our model can successfully identify four different sasq for different periods given that the temporal variability in the age selection preferences is a key feature of the catchment applying time variant sas functions can at least reduce potential systematic errors associated with the model structure the patterns of strong young water preference during wet periods due to fast shallow flow paths and old water preference during dry periods due deeper flow paths were well reproduced while the modeled sasq mismatches with those ones from yang et al 2018 their uncertainties grey area in fig 7 can well cover the later for the wet and dry periods thus we concluded that the model was able to determine plausible q selection preferences for the wet and dry periods for et the computed saset from yang et al 2018 generally indicates a strong selection preference for young water throughout the year fig 7e because there is always a high chance for young water from the root zone to be taken up by et unfortunately our model was not able to capture the general preference for young water fractions with the calibrated saset deviated significantly in shape from the one of yang et al 2018 even if considering the uncertainty grey area in fig 7e this suggests that the calibration process is not able to determine fully plausible et selection preferences using in stream nitrate as a tracer and constraints from the three data sets in other words the saset did not adequately represent the known dominant flow paths of et despite a good model fit to the data sets thus we hypothesize that with regard to et the constraints of data sets are weak this can be potentially due to that i the independence of plant uptake on et i e et removes water but not nitrate mass may introduce structural errors that inhabit the determination of plausible saset and ii et mainly affects the nitrate transport by altering the age composition of the storage and q such that the datasets are not directly linked to et while comparative analysis between our model sas functions and the ones from yang et al 2018 helped us evaluating the physically meaningfulness behind various shapes of sas functions it should not be considered as a validation process between our model and reality even through yang et al 2018 used particle tracking in a calibrated hydrological flow model their calculated ages and sas functions still involved errors due to the uncertainty in their flow model and limitations in the particle tracking algorithm e g excluding flow paths through or partially through land surface limitation in particle sampling for discharge see yang et al 2018 for details our present model as a spatially implicit model considered all the potential flow paths by considering the associated transit times in the out flow generation therefore the mismatches in the comparative analysis are reasonable in this sense the plausibility of the calibrated sas functions should indicate a good reproduction of general trends of age selection preferences rather than exactly matching the ones from yang et al 2018 6 2 uncertainty assessment monte carlo simulation results analysis of the accepted model realizations provided insights into the uncertainty of the sas functions associated with the four types of constraints using individual or combined data sets fig 8 generally the sasq have lower uncertainty levels and are better constrained than saset this confirms that the constraints for the selection preferences of et using cq n surplus and age of discharge were weaker since these data sets are not directly linked to et the uncertainty levels of sasq differed for the four periods it indicates that i q selection preference in the wetting period nov dec is less important for fitting all the data sets ii the q selection preference in the dry summer is less important for fitting the cq and n surplus data correctly unless additional age data is used see explanation below the uncertainty of the sas functions is influenced by the type of constraints using individual or combined data sets generally the uncertainty decreases if more constraining data sets are used this trend is observed for both the sasq and saset on average the uncertainty of sasq and saset reduced 60 and 69 respectively from using only the cq data set to using all the three data sets additional data such as the median age of discharge and the n surplus can be very helpful in reducing the uncertainty of the selection preferences once they are combined with in stream concentration measurements even if they just provide sparse yearly averaged values with significant estimation errors of up to 50 however this reduction trend of sasq uncertainty behaved differently for different periods being less pronounced during wet and wetting periods while being more pronounced during dry and drying periods this is because we used the yearly averaged n surplus and age data for the catchment of high seasonality instead of using seasonally dependent values another interesting behavior is that the age data had a significantly larger ability to constrain the sasq during the dry periods to a low uncertainty level than any other data sets compare the constraints with age to these without age fig 8 this suggested that during the low flow condition in dry summer time the q itself and the tracer related data sets cq surplus becomes less informative for example the q response to precipitation events becomes weaker in summer time in such situation on one hand additional information such as water ages becomes important to determine the q selection preferences and should be obtained and applied in similar studies whenever possible on the other hand it is necessary to improve the quality of cq during dry summer time 6 3 usefulness of the data sets the model was able to simulate in stream nitrate concentrations based on calibrated sas functions a good model performance can be achieved by choosing appropriate outflow selection preferences and does not necessarily require resolving the spatially varying catchment properties in a physically based hydrogeological model e g henri and harter 2019 henri et al 2020 in that sense the simple integrated model is a highly efficient tool to simulate nitrate export at the catchment scale with a cpu time in the order of minutes compared to days for a physically based hydrogeological models like e g the hydrogeosphere model in yang et al 2018 however only matching data sets to a good level does not necessary reveal the reasonable selection preferences in the catchment evaluating the usefulness of the data sets requires assessing the plausibility and uncertainty of the calibrated sas functions in our study a sas function was identified as good when it produced the plausible selection preferences revealing the general seasonal shifts of flow paths reported in previous study with an acceptable level of uncertainty we simply assumed that the uncertainties less than 3 5 were acceptable which corresponds to 10 of the maximum uncertainty 35 fig 8 following this we generated a summary of the plausibility and uncertainty of the calibrated sas functions table 2 with sas functions being unknown prior to calibration the combined constraint consisting of in stream concentrations discharge median age and n surplus was useful to determine the good q selection preferences for most time of a year wet and dry periods the constraint failed to determine a good et selection preference this indicates that the data sets we used were not sufficiently informative to adequately constrain the et selection preference they are thus ill constrained in fact this ill constrained problem led to some of the a b values of the calibrated sas functions being located near the boundaries of their adjustable ranges see fig 3e of the supplementary material these overall results suggest that more or different data sets are required in the inverse process to better constrain the selection preferences for example the following methods data can potentially be used i enhancing the data quality of the in stream nitrate concentration time series through more frequent measurements especially in the dry period in summer ii providing additional data sets more closely linked to et e g the age of et that may be derived from isotope data or other tracers previous studies have pointed out that in stream data contained a wealth of information that could be used to infer age selection preferences van der velde et al 2012 queloz et al 2015 our study using in stream nitrate data confirmed that by showing the data usefulness in identifying the age selection preference for q during the calibration the reactive tracer was considered to be less informative than conservative tracer as the reaction processes may hamper the calibration processes queloz et al 2015 our study suggested that the potential disadvantage of using reactive tracer over using conservative tracer may be overcome by introducing additional constraints against tracer source e g n surplus and reaction processes e g discharge transit time because the combined constraint using these additional data together with in stream data can significant reduce the uncertainties of age selection preferences as q and et can both affect the age composition in streamflow queloz et al 2015 suggested that the et selection preference can potentially be identified through the constraint using only the tracer data in q however our study using nitrate as a tracer failed in determining an appropriate age selection preference for et suggesting that saset can be harder to constrain using reactive tracer data in q in our study the calibration performance was generally better in wet and dry periods than in drying and wetting periods e g the former having better plausibility and lower uncertainty this suggests that hydrology and hydrologic transport is more difficult to characterize and simulate under transition periods than under stable periods when flow filed is more stable and smoother future emphasis should be placed on improving the model both forward inverse performance during the two transition periods 7 limitations first complexities n fluxes in source zone were simplified by defining a framework describing the main pathway for n no3 leachate with temporally constant external n input on the one hand this simplification neglected other processes such as the time variant external n input direct input of external n to inorganic n pool the transformation from protected organic n to active organic n and the loss of organic n via dissolution lindström et al 2010 on the other hand this simplification allows us to focus on the main source of n no3 rather than keeping track of the full nitrogen fluxes in the source zone of the catchment while maintaining the overall nitrogen balance using surplus as a constraint second spatial source heterogeneity cannot be considered in the model currently the source concentration is uniformly applied to all water parcels that enter the catchment regardless of where they enter this assumption ignores the strong spatial source heterogeneity that may exist in catchments in particular when larger in size for example higher source concentrations are associated with water parcels entering from hillslopes where fertilizer is applied with longer flow paths and different source concentrations are distributed along catchment depths zhi et al 2019 this spatial source heterogeneity can affect the nitrate export patterns significantly musolff et al 2017 zhi et al 2019 this assumption is essential for a lumped model implementing distributed physically based hydrogeological models for solute transport can easily overcome such limitation but in turn requiring resolving the spatially varying catchment properties henri and harter 2019 henri et al 2020 last a constant denitrification rate coefficient in groundwater was assumed in the model such that the denitrification rate is only affected by the available nitrate mass in water parcels however in reality the denitrification rates are also affected by various other factors and may vary in space and time those factors include the temperature higher rates during warmer periods and the redox boundaries caused by fluctuating groundwater levels e g high oxygen concentration in shallow flow paths they also contribute to the seasonality in nitrate concentrations böhlke et al 2007 the abovementioned limitations can surely be overcome by implementing more detailed processes in the model at the same time increasing the degrees of freedom or even by choosing other physically based models that can fully resolve the flow and transport processes in catchment space however by doing so model complexity and parameter uncertainty will increase models with a larger number of parameters which are difficult to constrain could then mask some of the integral trends in catchment response which we could reveal here with a more parsimonious model in that sense the presented model is first of all an explorative tool to elucidate general catchment behavior for more specific applications the decision which parameters are allowed to vary and which parameters remain constant in the model should be problem oriented so that the model can have problem related adequate levels of uncertainty in our study even though these limitations exist the model proved to be successful in simulating the dynamics of nitrate transport investigating the usefulness of the data sets and providing some general guidelines for inverse modeling 8 conclusions in this study we assessed how different sources of data help in constraining catchment selection preferences in the agricultural catchment schäfertal in germany nitrate export from this catchment was simulated with a lumped transport model based on the age selection preferences for q and et described by sas functions model calibration allowed us to determine the sas functions for q and et the plausibility of the calibrated spatially implicit sas functions was assessed by comparing them to the sas functions derived from spatially explicit particle tracking the parameter uncertainties of the sas functions in response to different constraints using individual or combined data sets in stream concentrations discharge median age and n surplus were calculated and assessed via monte carlo simulations the main conclusions of this study are the observed nitrate in stream nitrate concentrations were well reproduced in the model with acceptable n fluxes in the source zone using dynamic sas functions improved the model performance for fitting the in stream concentrations due to more flexibility in capturing the temporal variability in the age selection preference plausible q selection preferences which exhibit distinct seasonal shifts could be determined in the model calibration for wet and dry periods of a year however the used constraints were not able to determine plausible et selection preferences as the data sets were only weakly linked to et uncertainty analysis suggested that the uncertainty for the q selection preferences was smaller than that for et more than 60 reduction of uncertainty was achieved when using combined data sets instead of using only the in stream concentration data in dry summer time additional information of water age is significantly helpful in reducing the uncertainty for the q selection preferences even if it is just sparse yearly averaged value that can only be indirectly derived from other methods such as isotope data or numerical models a combined constraint in stream concentrations discharge median age and n surplus was useful to determine good being plausible low uncertainty q selection preferences for most time of a year however it failed to determine good et selection preferences in order to determine better selection preferences our study suggests to acquire in stream concentration data set of improved quality and additional data sets with a closer link to et despite simplifying assumptions and some limitations this study has improved our understanding of the ability of certain data sets to constrain the seasonal age selection preferences that are controlled by shifting flow paths our conclusions can provide important guidelines in terms of data collection and model design for similar nitrate export studies in particular for catchments in temperate humid climates with pronounced
