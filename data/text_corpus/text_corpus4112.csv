the key idea is to apply success history based adaptive differential evolution algorithm including linear population size reduction l shade to the optimization of energy in addition motion constraints are considered during the diving process to ensure that the path points are reachable we take the sequence of motion angles as the population and propose an angle modification strategy to apply to the population evolution process so that the angle sequence remains in the space of feasible solutions the modification strategy lays a theoretical foundation for the application of l shade in this path planning problem the performance of ppm bbd is evaluated on data from simulation test the most suitable control parameters are determined through simulation experiments the effects of ppm bbd with l shade and five types of de are compared the experimental evaluation was performed through sea trials in tuandao bay qingdao china results show that ppm bbd saves at least 9 energy compared to the other algorithms it is concluded that it is workable to obtain a reachable path with optimized energy consumption during diving process keywords auv path planning behavioral decision making l shade 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are utilized to collect data from the ocean ahn et al 2017 they play an important role in a wide range of applications such as intelligent detection lin et al 2017 mine detection kohntopp et al 2017 and military support hasvold et al 2006 aras et al 2016 when performing tasks auvs must periodically ascend to the water surface for gps positioning and data communication tian et al 2019 gao et al 2021 and then to dive underwater to continue tasks the quality of the diving path is directly related to whether an auv can successfully complete tasks and this affects its energy consumption performance scientific and technological development has led to an increasing number of path planning methods in the auv field such as dijkstra s algorithm wang et al 2011 the artificial potential field kumar et al 2019 and the a carroll et al 1992 field d ferguson and stentz 2010 fast marching fm petres et al 2005 and rapidly exploring random tree rrt kuffner and lavalle 2000 li and yang 2020 algorithms most of these methods consider 2d environments albarakati et al 2019 wang et al 2016 which limits the trajectory of the vehicle to a constant depth diving path planning is obviously a three dimensional problem for which three dimensional path planning methods are more appropriate the motion constraint of the diving process is more complicated than that of constant depth navigation to maintain the attitude stability requires the pitch angle to be maintained in a certain range considering that the maximum rotation angle of the auv rudder is invariant the change of heading angle is restricted when the diving path has the characteristics of large depth and short horizontal distance as shown in fig 1 path points planned while ignoring motion control constraints of the auv are probably not easy to reach which will waste energy and affect the implementation of tasks therefore it is of great significance to plan a feasible diving path with lower energy consumption to choose the optimized path from numerous feasible solutions is a common problem in path planning in addition the ocean current has a great influence on the diving path for these reasons the optimal path cannot be obtained in a short time with traditional search algorithm for the auv path planning problem a feasible solution that satisfies constraints is more important than an exact optimal solution zadeh et al 2018 evolutionary algorithms are suitable for path planning because of its computational efficiency evolutionary algorithms are favored by many researchers to deal with path planning problems of an np hard nature whale cuckoo search optimization algorithm wcsoa was applied to the path planning of oil spill detection it was observed from the simulation results obtained that wcsoa provides reduction in auv energy consumption vinoth kumar et al 2020 albert sans muntadas et al proposed method for path planning used the search tree g to reconstruct the path by reading backward through the search tree a series of waypoints were found sans muntadas et al 2019 zheping yan et al improved the water wave optimization wwo algorithm and applied it into path planning of auv the experimental results showed that it was an effective and feasible method for solving auv path planning problem yan et al 2021 genetic algorithm ga is utilized to find a safe path that takes a vehicle from its starting location to a specified destination while minimizing the energy cost which prove that evolutionary algorithms are suitable for such problems alvarez et al 2004 considering ocean currents an energy efficient path is generated by means of a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm witt and dunbabin 2008 an improved pso algorithm quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso is introduced to solve the optimal path planning problem of an auv operating in environments with ocean currents zeng et al 2016 lim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 differential evolution de was proposed by storn and price stron and price 1995 and it won several evolutionary algorithm competitions after modifications and extensions brest et al 2009 2013 zhang et al 2008 it has the advantages of a good combination of evolutionary operators brest et al 2006 mezura montes and lopez ramirez 2007 liu et al 2001 mutation step size adaptation and elitist selection zamuda and hernández sosa 2014 the success history based adaptive differential evolution algorithm including linear population size reduction l shade is an extension of de das and suganthan 2011 that has been a winner of recent ieee competitions in evolutionary computation piotrowski 2018 biswas et al applied l shade to minimize distortion in power systems biswas et al 2017 zamuda and sosa presented an application of l shade to an expert system for underwater glider path planning ugpp this new application of evolutionary algorithms to ugpp contributes significantly to the capacity of the decision makers zamuda and sosa 2019 therefore we choose to apply l shade as an optimizer researchers have mostly used evolutionary algorithms to solve path planning problems and have not considered the effect of motion constraints on path planning during the diving process in an actual working environment if the horizontal distance between the auv position on the water surface and an underwater target point is short then path points planned without considering the motion control constraints of the auv probably cannot be followed in view of the above problems this work is concerned with the motion constraints of the auv to ensure a feasible path with optimal energy consumption a path planning method based on behavioral decision making ppm bbd is proposed ppm bbd draws on the experience of the rrt algorithm to generate a decision sequence consisting of yaw and pitch angles when these exceed the range of motion constraints they are revised so as to develop feasible behavioral sequences l shade is applied to optimize the energy consumption of the behavioral sequence aiming at the problem of a motion constraint which is easily ignored in the diving process we propose a feasible solution with ppm bbd based on rrt and l shade the modification strategy of behavior is formulated and the optimal control parameters of l shade are determined through simulation experiments the motivation of this study is to optimize the auv diving path to save energy and improve mission efficiency its contribution is to solve problems in the application of l shade in diving path planning in the process of mutation and crossover of l shade it is difficult to keep the solution in the feasible space according to the motion constraints four possible situations are analyzed and a modification strategy is proposed to solve this problem rrt is applied to generate the initial feasible solution and l shade is used to optimize the energy consumption 2 problem statement an auv works in a three dimensional bounded environment where ocean currents are distributed we establish three dimensional cartesian coordinate system to describe the work space yaw and pitch angles are used to represent the behavior of the auv a simplified ocean current formula is structured to calculate the energy consumption of a diving path 2 1 coordinate system of auv a right handed cartesian coordinate system is shown in fig 2 o xyz represents the geodetic coordinate system oz points to the opposite direction of the geocentric ox points due east and oy points due north when an auv sails from point a to underwater point b the projection of ab on plane oxy is ob the angle between ob and ab is the pitch angle θ the angle between ob and oy is the yaw angle φ 0 φ 2 π owing to the limited rotation angle of the auv rudder the maximum change of the yaw angle is d φ m a x to maintain a stable auv attitude the maximum pitch angle is θ m a x 0 θ θ m a x 2 2 ocean current formula a random vortex field is used to simulate the ocean current this is defined as xuliang et al 2019 1 f x p x 2 y p y 2 c x a x f x a y f y 1 2 f c y s i g n a y a x f x a y f y 1 2 f where p x p y is the position of the vortex field center and c x c y represent the strength of the ocean current along the x and y axes respectively a x a y are the intensity coefficients of the vortex field where the sign of a y determines the rotation direction when it is positive the rotation direction of the vortex field is clockwise s i g n represents a symbolic function 2 3 path planning problem during diving process auv path planning during the diving process has three goals 1 to make the auv move from the start point to the target point 2 to make the diving path conform to the motion constraint and 3 to optimize the diving path to minimize energy consumption the following expressions describe the problem of path planning during the diving process 2 min t 1 n e wp t 1 wp t subject to 3 θ t θ m a x φ t φ t 1 d φ m a x where wp t is the path point at time t e wp t 1 wp t is the energy consumption of the auv from wp t 1 to wp t and θ t and φ t are the pitch and yaw angles respectively at time t 3 path planning method based on behavioral decision making the proposed ppm bbd as illustrated in fig 3 has three components 1 path generation 2 modification strategy 3 optimization method path generation provides a feasible solution set which is the basis of the implementation method the modification strategy keeps the feasible solution set in the solution space during the evolution process the optimization method includes population evolution and parameter updating which determine the convergence speed and optimization results 3 1 path generation based on the idea of the rapidly exploring random tree rrt the path generation algorithm has a certain probability to extend to the target point every time the growth direction is selected suppose that the probability of extending to the target point is br 0 1 the vertical distance between the starting point on the water surface and the underwater target point is d the attitude must be adjusted n times when the auv achieves a depth of 1 meter and every time it achieves a depth of dn 1 n meter then m r o u n d d n path points must be planned where r o u n d is a rounding function if we generate a random number then if that number is less than br then the extended tree will grow toward the target point otherwise a temporary target point will be generated randomly within the coordinate range of the starting point and final target point and the extended tree will grow toward that point this step is repeated until a diving path from the starting point to the final underwater target point is generated the diving path generated by this method is not the optimal path and it may not satisfy the motion constraints therefore we transform the path points to behaviors and estimate whether the planned behavioral sequence satisfies the motion constraints if not then a modification strategy is applied to the behavioral sequence to generate feasible pitch and yaw angle sequences such that the auv can reach the underwater target point 3 2 modification strategy it is of great significant to ensure that the yaw and pitch angles change in a certain range during the growth of the extended tree and the evolutionary process of the feasible solution we assume that the auv is at path point p i where 1 i m m is the number of path points the next path point is t if t does not conform to the motion constraint the t is modified to p i 1 the modification strategy is as follows 1 calculate two groups of angles one group is the angle φ p t between the projection of p i t in plane xoy and o y and the angle θ p t between p i t and plane xoy the other is the angle φ p p between the projection of p i 1 p i in plane xoy and o y and the angle θ p p between p i 1 p i and plane xoy the yaw angle is calculated as 4 φ p t a c o s p i t x y o y p i t x y o y p i x t x 2 π a c o s p i t x y o y p i t x y o y p i x t x e m p t y p i x t x p i y t y π p i x t x p i y t y 0 p i x t x p i y t y 5 θ p t a s i n p i z t z p i t where p i t x y is the projection of p i t in plane xoy the coordinates of p i and t are p i x p i y p i z and t x t y t z respectively the angles φ p p and θ p p are computed similarly to φ p t and θ p t a c o s and a s i n denote a r c c o s i n e and a r c s i n e respectively e m p t y represent an empty set 2 in the light of the relationship between φ p t and φ p p and the relationship between θ p t and θ p p we modify t to p i 1 to satisfy the motion constraint p i 1 is obtained by calculating φ i 1 and θ i 1 the four relationships between φ p p and φ p t are shown in fig 4 when 0 φ p t φ p p π as shown in fig 4 a there are two possible situations their difference is in the interval 0 d φ m a x or it is greater than d φ m a x the formula for modification of yaw angle is 6 φ i 1 φ p t φ p t φ p p d φ m a x φ p p d φ m a x φ p t φ p p d φ m a x when φ p t φ p p π as shown in fig 4 b two cases are taken into account to modify t 2 π φ p t φ p p d φ m a x and 2 π φ p t φ p p d φ m a x the formula for modification of yaw angle is 7 φ i 1 φ p t 2 π φ p t φ p p d φ m a x φ p p d φ m a x 2 π φ p t φ p p d φ m a x when 0 φ p p φ p t π and φ p p φ p t π as shown in fig 4 c and d the situation is similar to the above mentioned the formulas for φ i 1 are as follows 8 φ i 1 φ p t φ p p φ p t d φ m a x φ p p d φ m a x φ p p φ p t d φ m a x 9 φ i 1 φ p t 2 π φ p p φ p t d φ m a x φ p p d φ m a x 2 π φ p p φ p t d φ m a x the pitch angle θ i 1 is 10 θ i 1 θ p t 0 θ p t θ m a x θ m a x δ θ θ p t π 2 3 calculate the waypoint p i 1 on the basis of φ i 1 θ i 1 and the coordinates of p i suppose those coordinates are p i x p i y p i z then the coordinates of p i 1 can be expressed as 11 p i 1 x dn s i n φ i 1 t a n θ i 1 p i x p i 1 y dn c o s φ i 1 t a n θ i 1 p i y p i 1 z p i z dn dn is the vertical distance between two adjacent path points this strategy provides a way for the generated path to satisfy the motion constraints and it makes outstanding contributions in the process of population evolution 3 3 optimization method to solve the path planning problem in the diving process of an auv the path planning method based on behavioral decision making with l shade as computing engine is adopted to generate an optimized path the results of behavioral decision making are expressed by the yaw and pitch angles which is easier to judge whether the motion constraints are satisfied the method has three parts generation of an initial population construction of fitness function and evolution of the population 3 3 1 generation of initial population the population is a set of feasible solutions which are known as an individuals in the population we introduced the method of individual generation based on the idea of rrt in section 3 1 while a path point is generated it must generate a number at random compared with the parameter br therefore each generation of individuals is random and np individuals can be generated to form the initial population we leave out sampling the coordinates of path points but collect the yaw and pitch angles that correspond to the path points to form populations of yaw and pitch angles 3 3 2 construction of fitness function we plan a diving path based on behavioral decision making with the aim of reducing the energy consumption of the auv in ocean currents a fitness function is constructed whose value represents the energy consumption a small value indicates high individual fitness assume that an auv sails at a constant speed and the energy consumed between path points p i and p i 1 is e i where i 1 m then e i can be calculated as xuliang et al 2019 12 e i p v e h i c l e t i k r c v c i 3 p i p i 1 v g i where k r c is the resistance coefficient of water k r c is related to the auv design it can be obtained by fitting the historical data of energy consumption and auv speed xuliang et al 2019 when the auv structure and speed are fixed k r c is a constant in a fixed water area p v e h i c l e is the power of the auv thruster and v c i and v g i are the propulsion speed and auv speed respectively relative to the seafloor then the total energy consumption of the diving path is 13 e i 1 m 1 e i 3 3 3 evolution of population to improve the convergence rate we use the l shade advanced evolutionary method to make the population evolve rapidly in which the population size decreases linearly with the number of iterations the initial population size is np 0 iteration stops when the population size reaches the minimum size np e n d l shade proceeds similarly to differential evolution in the four stages of mutation crossover selection and parameter updating poláková 2017 1 mutation process np 0 yaw angle sequences and pitch angle sequences are generated based on the method in section 3 1 since the two populations have the same evolutionary pattern we take an evolutionary process as an example to illustrate the evolution of l shade set a stores the eliminated individuals during the selection process and initializes as empty define arrays mf and mcr to store the mutation factors and crossover factors that performed well in past generations their sizes are mf mcr h where h is the control parameter representing the length of mf and mcr the elements in mf and mcr are initialized to 0 5 f is the mutation factor and cr is the crossover factor the value of r is a randomly selected from 1 to h the mutation factor and crossover factor of the ith individual in generation g are 14 f i g mf r 0 1 tan rand π π 2 15 cr i g 0 mcr r 1 n o r m r n d mcr r 0 1 o t h e r w i s e where rand is a random number in the interval 0 1 and n o r m r n d is a function that generates a normally distributed random number if f i g exceeds the interval 0 1 then we set f i g 0 5 then the fitness value of each individual in the population is calculated and the individual x r 1 g with the highest fitness is selected islam et al 2011 two basis vectors x r 2 g and x r 3 g are randomly selected from the union of two sets the set of the remaining p of individuals with the highest fitness and the set a to perform mutation operations 16 v i g x i g f i g x r 1 g x i g f i g x r 2 g x r 3 g after mutation individuals that do not conform to the motion constraints probably appear in the population and it is necessary to use the strategy introduced in section 3 2 to modify them 2 crossover process the crossover process refers to the crossover transformation of elements between the original and the mutated individuals in the population if x i g j is the jth element of the ith individual in the g generation population j 1 m 1 then the crossover process is carried out according to the following rules 17 u i g j v i g j r a n d cr i g x i g j o t h e r w i s e where v i g j is the jth element of the ith mutated individual in the g generation population and u i g j is the result of crossing the jth element of the ith individual and the ith mutated individual in the g generation population after crossover the obtained value of u should be in the range of feasible solutions as with the mutation process the strategy in section 3 2 should be used to modify individuals that do not satisfy the motion constraints after the crossover process 3 selection process comparing the results of the crossover process and the original population the individuals with high fitness are retained as the next generation population those with low fitness are eliminated and the eliminated individuals are stored in set a the formula is as follows 18 x i g 1 x i g f u i g f x i g u i g o t h e r w i s e 4 parameter updating process in the g generation population the initial sets sf and scr are empty if new individuals are selected after mutation crossover then their mutation factors f i g and crossover factors cr i g are stored in sets sf and scr respectively sf scr sf and scr are used to update mf and mcr if k is the index of mf and mcr then the following conditions are satisfied 19 k mod g h mod g h 0 h o t h e r w i s e where mod is modulo function represents the remainder of g h the parameters are updated as 20 mf k l 1 sf w l sf l 2 l 1 sf w l sf l 21 mcr k l 1 scr w l scr l 2 l 1 scr w l scr l 22 w l δ f l α 1 scr δ f α 23 δ f l f u l g f x l g if the population size of generation g is np g then the rule of linear population size reduction is 24 np g 1 round np 0 np 0 min np max g g where round is an integral function min np is the smallest population size max g is the largest population iteration time and g is the current population iteration time the np g 1 individuals with the highest fitness in the g generation population are retained to form the g 1 generation population and the rest are stored in set a 3 4 stability of planning method it can be seen from the l shade algorithm flow that with sufficient iterations regardless of the initial population the algorithm will eventually converge to the global best point therefore the global optimal point x m i n can be regarded as the equilibrium point in the sense of lyapunov suppose that the initial state of the l shade algorithm is in a circle with the equilibrium point as the center and δ as the radius that is 25 x 0 x m i n δ as shown in fig 5 the circle with x m i n as the center and radius ϵ is denoted as s ϵ the circle with radius δ is s δ and the red curve is the fitness function f x s δ and f x intersect at x 1 x 2 from the convergence of the l shade algorithm it can be seen that when x i is in the area where s δ and f x intersect the solution of eq 13 will only approach the function value corresponding to x m i n and will not escape the circle s δ which is 26 f x t x 0 t 0 f x m i n ϵ it can be seen that the solution x t x 0 t 0 of the system is located in the circle s ϵ with x m i n as the center and with arbitrarily prescribed radius δ as t so the equilibrium state of the algorithm x m i n is stable in the lyapunov sense 4 simulation results and discussion the de algorithm includes five types according to different mutation strategies d e r a n d 1 d e r a n d 2 d e b e s t 1 de current to best 1 and de current to rand 1 it is difficult to select the optimal control parameters when applying evolutionary algorithms to the diving path planning problem we determined suitable parameters through simulation experiments and we compared the effects of ppm bbd with l shade and the five types of de algorithm in simulation experiments the starting point of auv was set to s 10 10 20 and the target point was set to t 0 5 1 the resistance coefficient was k r c 3 and the position of the vortex field center was p x p y 5 5 the propulsion speed of the auv v c was set to 1 5 which is equal to v g the motion constraints d φ m a x and θ m a x were set to π 4 the attitude must be adjusted n 1 time when auv achieves depth with 1 meter in order to prove that the algorithm can keep stable and the result is convincing the maximum number of iterations was set to 500 in practice the maximum number of iterations should be selected according to the requirements of calculation time and optimization results the important control parameters of de in diving path planning are random target probability br population size np mutation factor f and crossover probability cr the optimal control parameters are those that minimize the energy consumption of the diving path the optimal value of br was selected in 0 1 with a sampling interval of 0 1 the population size np was selected from 10 200 with an interval of 10 the value range and sampling interval of f and cr were the same as for br the sampling value of each parameter was calculated 15 times and the optimal value was selected according to a box plot the results are as follows energy consumption from different parameters of d e r a n d 1 is shown in fig 6 fig 6 a d show the effects of different values of br np f and cr when applied to de a mark indicates an outlier and the red line in the middle of a box indicates the median of energy consumption it can be seen that when br 0 4 there are no outliers in the algorithm results and the median energy consumption is relatively low when br 1 there is only one line in the box plot indicating that the results of 15 calculation are the same this is because br 1 means that a temporary target point cannot be generated randomly and there is only one feasible solution in the population hence the diversity of the population is lost under this parameter the chance of mutation is limited and the energy consumption of a feasible path generated by mutation is not as low as that of the original population which leads to the same results from repeated calculation when the population size np increases from 10 to 200 the energy consumption of the path in the population becomes increasingly lower until np is greater than 60 the results tend to be stable and the difference is not significant since the consumption of computing resources increases with np we choose np 60 similarly the optimal f and cr are 0 5 and 0 6 respectively fig 7 shows that when d e r a n d 2 is selected as the evolutionary strategy the parameter mutation factor f has a greater impact on the calculation results and other parameters have less influence after observation a group of optimal parameters was selected br 0 4 np 90 f 0 3 cr 0 6 unlike the results of d e r a n d 1 and d e r a n d 2 the results of d e b e s t 1 show that f has little effect on energy consumption of the diving path as shown in fig 8 we choose br 0 5 np 90 f 0 5 and cr 0 3 as the optimal parameters of this evolutionary strategy the performance of strategy de current to best 1 is different from that of other strategies and each parameter has distinct influence on the results as shown in fig 9 from the figure the optimal set of parameters is br 0 4 np 90 f 0 5 and cr 0 3 the de current to rand 1 and de current to best 1 strategies are similar and the optimal parameters are br 0 4 np 90 f 0 7 and cr 0 7 as obtained from fig 10 the optimal parameters corresponding to the five evolutionary strategies are summarized in table 1 ppm bbd with l shade has seven control parameters which is more than de has they are random target probability br population retention percentage p population size np h which is the size of array mf and mcr the initial value of mf and mcr and the minimum size of population after iteration np m i n we obtained a set of optimal control parameters in the same way as for de with results as shown in table 2 to compare the effects of ppm bbd with l shade and five types of de the optimal combination of control parameters was applied to calculate the energy consumption of the diving path each group of parameters was calculated 15 times the box plot for comparison is shown in fig 11 as can be seen in the figure the optimization results of de current to rand 1 and de current to best 1 were not as good as the others ppm bbd with l shade had a slight advantage over the other three types of de the important thing is that its distribution interval span was small which shows that ppm bbd with l shade was more stable than the other algorithms this method is based on heuristic search algorithm which can only get the optimized path but not the optimal path it is the common limitation of heuristic methods in addition the mutation and crossover process is random which results in obtaining different solutions every time fig 11 shows that the results obtained by ppm bbd are not always the same but stable in a very small range if the diving depth is small the method is able to get the optimal solution in a short time and the result is stable and reliable otherwise it takes a long time to search for more accurate and stable results therefore increasing the calculation time can effectively improve the accuracy and stability of the algorithm it is for this reason that we should pay attention to the trade off between real time and accuracy in the application of this method fig 12 shows that the minimum energy consumption decreased as the number of iterations increased when the number of iterations exceeded 300 the energy consumption of the diving path generated by ppm bbd with l shade was the lowest of the six algorithms the average fitness of the population is another important index to measure an evolutionary algorithm fig 13 shows the change of the average energy consumption of the six algorithms during iteration ppm bbd with l shade converges most quickly to a stable state and the average energy consumption is lower than that of other algorithms ppm bbd with l shade reaches a stable state after 30 iterations while other algorithms need 50 60 iterations after 500 iterations the average energy consumption of ppm bbd with l shade is 17 71 and that of other algorithms are respectively 20 11 19 92 19 65 45 75 and 39 25 it can be calculated that our method saves at least 9 8 of energy compared to other algorithms the behavioral sequence obtained by ppm bbd is shown in table 3 the variation of θ is very small all below the critical value φ has a relatively large change at each time when diving because the final target point t can only be reached following the spiral trajectory fig 14 shows the relationship between the behavior results generated by ppm bbd and the motion constraint the solid line represents the motion constraint which means d φ m a x π 4 and θ m a x π 4 and the histogram shows the values of δ φ and θ where 27 δ φ i 1 φ i φ i 1 i 2 3 m the results indicate that the adjustment of the pitch and yaw angles is not more than π 4 which shows that the behavior of the auv satisfies the motion constraint the location of the path point during the diving process can be deduced from these angles the three dimensional diving path calculated from the behavior is shown in fig 15 the red circle and red square indicate the starting point s and the final target point t the black arrows represent the current direction and the blue solid line is the diving path obtained by ppm bbd the pitch angle required from s to t is greater than π 4 which means that the auv cannot be reached directly due to the motion constraints the three dimensional diving path planned by ppm bbd rotates along the current direction and reaches the target point t with optimized energy consumption fig 16 is a top view of the diving path from which it is seen that the auv is rotating in the direction of the current which is in line with the actual situation we tested the generation of an optimized path with 20 path points 500 iterations which took 29 7 s for 15 times calculation on average an optimized path can be generated every 1 98 s as can be seen from figs 12 and 13 the results generated by l shade are stable after 50 iterations therefore we tested the time required for 50 iterations and also calculated 15 times which took 3 6 s on average an optimized path can be generated every 0 24 s therefore the proposed method is efficient in real time planning comparisons to three other methods strengthen the case of ea these are a the firefly algorithm fa and rapidly exploring random tree rrt the starting point and target point are set as in the simulation experiment above and these methods are used to plan the diving path of the auv the results are shown in fig 17 according to eq 13 the energy consumption of the four paths generated by ppm bbd a fa rrt are 21 46 25 71 24 19 39 93 respectively it can be seen that fa comes closest to the ppm bbd result and its energy consumption is 1 12 times that of ppm bbd the energy consumption of the path obtained by ppm bbd is 16 53 11 28 and 46 25 less than that of a fa and rrt respectively to fairly compare the differences between ppm bbd and the other three algorithms we performed 15 calculations using the four algorithms and made overall comparisons a box plot is shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the energy consumption of ppm bbd and fa is less than that of a and rrt and the results are more stable the average energy consumption of ppm bbd is similar to that of fa and the result is more stable 5 sea trials and experimental evaluation the performance of ppm bbd was evaluated by a set of real world test in the form of sea trials which took place at tuandao bay shandong province china in november 2020 fig 21 shows a schematic diagram of the trial locations and experimental conditions the depth of the sea area was about 10 m the utm coordinate of the starting point was 256420 41 3992581 49 0 and the target point was 4 m underwater east of the starting point 256470 41 3992581 49 4 the auv sailed at a speed of 1 5 kn our experimental platform is the sailfish 210 auv independently developed by ocean university of china the shape and main technical indicators are shown in fig 19 the structure of the platform is shown in fig 20 usbl is used in underwater acoustic positioning lifting ring is used for lifting operation when placing and recycling antenna is used to communicate with shore based platform when the power of auv is low it is necessary to connect the power supply from the charging socket to charge the battery the rudder is divided into vertical rudder and horizontal rudder which are used to control the course and depth respectively the auv is equipped with doppler velocity log dvl attitude and heading reference system ahrs and pressure sensor to measure speed attitude and current depth respectively according to the velocity and attitude data we use the navigation algorithm to calculate the horizontal position of auv under the water it takes a short time to dive so the horizontal coordinates are accurate the pressure sensor meets the factory standard so the vertical coordinate is also accurate ppm bbd pso and the general diving method were used to perform the experiment the general method is to dive to the target depth first and then sail to the target point at a constant depth for auv security and to ensure successful trials we conducted experiments and set the minimum depth from the bottom when the depth was less than 5 m the auv would float up in emergency state the motion constraints were d φ m a x and θ m a x which were set to π 4 and π 160 respectively the other parameters were set to the values in table 2 the experimental results are shown in figs 22 and 23 which show the navigation paths of the three algorithms from different perspectives it can be seen that ppm bbd and pso generated spiral diving paths while the path using the general method reached the specified depth first and then moved to the target point when diving in a real marine environment the auv is affected by current and waves and its path has some fluctuations the path energy consumption is obtained by substituting the path point coordinates in eq 13 the path point coordinates were generated in real time by the methods the path energy consumption of ppm bbd pso and general method are 2562 85 2828 91 and 5292 68 respectively it can be seen that ppm bbd used 9 4 less energy than pso and 51 57 less than the general method the proportion of energy saved in the sea trial is similar to the simulated results results of simulation and sea trial indicated that ppm bbd was reliable however if the sea state is severe in practice especially when currents make the auv unable to be controlled the results will become unreliable therefore the method needs to work in the appropriate sea state in general the larger the auv mass the better it can adapt to the severe sea state 6 conclusion we presented an approach to auv path planning using l shade to optimize a diving trajectory with motion constraints this approach is especially interesting with computing appropriate path points through behavioral decision making of auv which effectively avoids the generation of unreachable path points it is of economic value for marine investigation tasks that require frequent dives we used rrt as a reference to generate an initial diving path and proposed a modification strategy for population generation and evolution the advanced evolutionary algorithm l shade was applied to compute the yaw and pitch angle sequence to determine the behavior of auv the optimal control parameters of six algorithms were determined by simulation experiments and the energy consumption of their generated by diving paths was compared comparisons of ppm bbd and three other methods bolstered the case for using ea sea trials were conducted for evaluation results showed that ppm bbd with l shade is performed better than five forms of de owing to the population reduction mechanism the convergence rate was faster the modified strategy makes the population evolve within the feasible solution space which is the key to the practicability of the method in the future we plan to explore the application of more evolutionary algorithms to the

20560,this study proposes a path planning method based on behavioral decision making ppm bbd an optimized path is planned for autonomous underwater vehicle auv to save energy during the diving process the key idea is to apply success history based adaptive differential evolution algorithm including linear population size reduction l shade to the optimization of energy in addition motion constraints are considered during the diving process to ensure that the path points are reachable we take the sequence of motion angles as the population and propose an angle modification strategy to apply to the population evolution process so that the angle sequence remains in the space of feasible solutions the modification strategy lays a theoretical foundation for the application of l shade in this path planning problem the performance of ppm bbd is evaluated on data from simulation test the most suitable control parameters are determined through simulation experiments the effects of ppm bbd with l shade and five types of de are compared the experimental evaluation was performed through sea trials in tuandao bay qingdao china results show that ppm bbd saves at least 9 energy compared to the other algorithms it is concluded that it is workable to obtain a reachable path with optimized energy consumption during diving process keywords auv path planning behavioral decision making l shade 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are utilized to collect data from the ocean ahn et al 2017 they play an important role in a wide range of applications such as intelligent detection lin et al 2017 mine detection kohntopp et al 2017 and military support hasvold et al 2006 aras et al 2016 when performing tasks auvs must periodically ascend to the water surface for gps positioning and data communication tian et al 2019 gao et al 2021 and then to dive underwater to continue tasks the quality of the diving path is directly related to whether an auv can successfully complete tasks and this affects its energy consumption performance scientific and technological development has led to an increasing number of path planning methods in the auv field such as dijkstra s algorithm wang et al 2011 the artificial potential field kumar et al 2019 and the a carroll et al 1992 field d ferguson and stentz 2010 fast marching fm petres et al 2005 and rapidly exploring random tree rrt kuffner and lavalle 2000 li and yang 2020 algorithms most of these methods consider 2d environments albarakati et al 2019 wang et al 2016 which limits the trajectory of the vehicle to a constant depth diving path planning is obviously a three dimensional problem for which three dimensional path planning methods are more appropriate the motion constraint of the diving process is more complicated than that of constant depth navigation to maintain the attitude stability requires the pitch angle to be maintained in a certain range considering that the maximum rotation angle of the auv rudder is invariant the change of heading angle is restricted when the diving path has the characteristics of large depth and short horizontal distance as shown in fig 1 path points planned while ignoring motion control constraints of the auv are probably not easy to reach which will waste energy and affect the implementation of tasks therefore it is of great significance to plan a feasible diving path with lower energy consumption to choose the optimized path from numerous feasible solutions is a common problem in path planning in addition the ocean current has a great influence on the diving path for these reasons the optimal path cannot be obtained in a short time with traditional search algorithm for the auv path planning problem a feasible solution that satisfies constraints is more important than an exact optimal solution zadeh et al 2018 evolutionary algorithms are suitable for path planning because of its computational efficiency evolutionary algorithms are favored by many researchers to deal with path planning problems of an np hard nature whale cuckoo search optimization algorithm wcsoa was applied to the path planning of oil spill detection it was observed from the simulation results obtained that wcsoa provides reduction in auv energy consumption vinoth kumar et al 2020 albert sans muntadas et al proposed method for path planning used the search tree g to reconstruct the path by reading backward through the search tree a series of waypoints were found sans muntadas et al 2019 zheping yan et al improved the water wave optimization wwo algorithm and applied it into path planning of auv the experimental results showed that it was an effective and feasible method for solving auv path planning problem yan et al 2021 genetic algorithm ga is utilized to find a safe path that takes a vehicle from its starting location to a specified destination while minimizing the energy cost which prove that evolutionary algorithms are suitable for such problems alvarez et al 2004 considering ocean currents an energy efficient path is generated by means of a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm witt and dunbabin 2008 an improved pso algorithm quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso is introduced to solve the optimal path planning problem of an auv operating in environments with ocean currents zeng et al 2016 lim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 differential evolution de was proposed by storn and price stron and price 1995 and it won several evolutionary algorithm competitions after modifications and extensions brest et al 2009 2013 zhang et al 2008 it has the advantages of a good combination of evolutionary operators brest et al 2006 mezura montes and lopez ramirez 2007 liu et al 2001 mutation step size adaptation and elitist selection zamuda and hernández sosa 2014 the success history based adaptive differential evolution algorithm including linear population size reduction l shade is an extension of de das and suganthan 2011 that has been a winner of recent ieee competitions in evolutionary computation piotrowski 2018 biswas et al applied l shade to minimize distortion in power systems biswas et al 2017 zamuda and sosa presented an application of l shade to an expert system for underwater glider path planning ugpp this new application of evolutionary algorithms to ugpp contributes significantly to the capacity of the decision makers zamuda and sosa 2019 therefore we choose to apply l shade as an optimizer researchers have mostly used evolutionary algorithms to solve path planning problems and have not considered the effect of motion constraints on path planning during the diving process in an actual working environment if the horizontal distance between the auv position on the water surface and an underwater target point is short then path points planned without considering the motion control constraints of the auv probably cannot be followed in view of the above problems this work is concerned with the motion constraints of the auv to ensure a feasible path with optimal energy consumption a path planning method based on behavioral decision making ppm bbd is proposed ppm bbd draws on the experience of the rrt algorithm to generate a decision sequence consisting of yaw and pitch angles when these exceed the range of motion constraints they are revised so as to develop feasible behavioral sequences l shade is applied to optimize the energy consumption of the behavioral sequence aiming at the problem of a motion constraint which is easily ignored in the diving process we propose a feasible solution with ppm bbd based on rrt and l shade the modification strategy of behavior is formulated and the optimal control parameters of l shade are determined through simulation experiments the motivation of this study is to optimize the auv diving path to save energy and improve mission efficiency its contribution is to solve problems in the application of l shade in diving path planning in the process of mutation and crossover of l shade it is difficult to keep the solution in the feasible space according to the motion constraints four possible situations are analyzed and a modification strategy is proposed to solve this problem rrt is applied to generate the initial feasible solution and l shade is used to optimize the energy consumption 2 problem statement an auv works in a three dimensional bounded environment where ocean currents are distributed we establish three dimensional cartesian coordinate system to describe the work space yaw and pitch angles are used to represent the behavior of the auv a simplified ocean current formula is structured to calculate the energy consumption of a diving path 2 1 coordinate system of auv a right handed cartesian coordinate system is shown in fig 2 o xyz represents the geodetic coordinate system oz points to the opposite direction of the geocentric ox points due east and oy points due north when an auv sails from point a to underwater point b the projection of ab on plane oxy is ob the angle between ob and ab is the pitch angle θ the angle between ob and oy is the yaw angle φ 0 φ 2 π owing to the limited rotation angle of the auv rudder the maximum change of the yaw angle is d φ m a x to maintain a stable auv attitude the maximum pitch angle is θ m a x 0 θ θ m a x 2 2 ocean current formula a random vortex field is used to simulate the ocean current this is defined as xuliang et al 2019 1 f x p x 2 y p y 2 c x a x f x a y f y 1 2 f c y s i g n a y a x f x a y f y 1 2 f where p x p y is the position of the vortex field center and c x c y represent the strength of the ocean current along the x and y axes respectively a x a y are the intensity coefficients of the vortex field where the sign of a y determines the rotation direction when it is positive the rotation direction of the vortex field is clockwise s i g n represents a symbolic function 2 3 path planning problem during diving process auv path planning during the diving process has three goals 1 to make the auv move from the start point to the target point 2 to make the diving path conform to the motion constraint and 3 to optimize the diving path to minimize energy consumption the following expressions describe the problem of path planning during the diving process 2 min t 1 n e wp t 1 wp t subject to 3 θ t θ m a x φ t φ t 1 d φ m a x where wp t is the path point at time t e wp t 1 wp t is the energy consumption of the auv from wp t 1 to wp t and θ t and φ t are the pitch and yaw angles respectively at time t 3 path planning method based on behavioral decision making the proposed ppm bbd as illustrated in fig 3 has three components 1 path generation 2 modification strategy 3 optimization method path generation provides a feasible solution set which is the basis of the implementation method the modification strategy keeps the feasible solution set in the solution space during the evolution process the optimization method includes population evolution and parameter updating which determine the convergence speed and optimization results 3 1 path generation based on the idea of the rapidly exploring random tree rrt the path generation algorithm has a certain probability to extend to the target point every time the growth direction is selected suppose that the probability of extending to the target point is br 0 1 the vertical distance between the starting point on the water surface and the underwater target point is d the attitude must be adjusted n times when the auv achieves a depth of 1 meter and every time it achieves a depth of dn 1 n meter then m r o u n d d n path points must be planned where r o u n d is a rounding function if we generate a random number then if that number is less than br then the extended tree will grow toward the target point otherwise a temporary target point will be generated randomly within the coordinate range of the starting point and final target point and the extended tree will grow toward that point this step is repeated until a diving path from the starting point to the final underwater target point is generated the diving path generated by this method is not the optimal path and it may not satisfy the motion constraints therefore we transform the path points to behaviors and estimate whether the planned behavioral sequence satisfies the motion constraints if not then a modification strategy is applied to the behavioral sequence to generate feasible pitch and yaw angle sequences such that the auv can reach the underwater target point 3 2 modification strategy it is of great significant to ensure that the yaw and pitch angles change in a certain range during the growth of the extended tree and the evolutionary process of the feasible solution we assume that the auv is at path point p i where 1 i m m is the number of path points the next path point is t if t does not conform to the motion constraint the t is modified to p i 1 the modification strategy is as follows 1 calculate two groups of angles one group is the angle φ p t between the projection of p i t in plane xoy and o y and the angle θ p t between p i t and plane xoy the other is the angle φ p p between the projection of p i 1 p i in plane xoy and o y and the angle θ p p between p i 1 p i and plane xoy the yaw angle is calculated as 4 φ p t a c o s p i t x y o y p i t x y o y p i x t x 2 π a c o s p i t x y o y p i t x y o y p i x t x e m p t y p i x t x p i y t y π p i x t x p i y t y 0 p i x t x p i y t y 5 θ p t a s i n p i z t z p i t where p i t x y is the projection of p i t in plane xoy the coordinates of p i and t are p i x p i y p i z and t x t y t z respectively the angles φ p p and θ p p are computed similarly to φ p t and θ p t a c o s and a s i n denote a r c c o s i n e and a r c s i n e respectively e m p t y represent an empty set 2 in the light of the relationship between φ p t and φ p p and the relationship between θ p t and θ p p we modify t to p i 1 to satisfy the motion constraint p i 1 is obtained by calculating φ i 1 and θ i 1 the four relationships between φ p p and φ p t are shown in fig 4 when 0 φ p t φ p p π as shown in fig 4 a there are two possible situations their difference is in the interval 0 d φ m a x or it is greater than d φ m a x the formula for modification of yaw angle is 6 φ i 1 φ p t φ p t φ p p d φ m a x φ p p d φ m a x φ p t φ p p d φ m a x when φ p t φ p p π as shown in fig 4 b two cases are taken into account to modify t 2 π φ p t φ p p d φ m a x and 2 π φ p t φ p p d φ m a x the formula for modification of yaw angle is 7 φ i 1 φ p t 2 π φ p t φ p p d φ m a x φ p p d φ m a x 2 π φ p t φ p p d φ m a x when 0 φ p p φ p t π and φ p p φ p t π as shown in fig 4 c and d the situation is similar to the above mentioned the formulas for φ i 1 are as follows 8 φ i 1 φ p t φ p p φ p t d φ m a x φ p p d φ m a x φ p p φ p t d φ m a x 9 φ i 1 φ p t 2 π φ p p φ p t d φ m a x φ p p d φ m a x 2 π φ p p φ p t d φ m a x the pitch angle θ i 1 is 10 θ i 1 θ p t 0 θ p t θ m a x θ m a x δ θ θ p t π 2 3 calculate the waypoint p i 1 on the basis of φ i 1 θ i 1 and the coordinates of p i suppose those coordinates are p i x p i y p i z then the coordinates of p i 1 can be expressed as 11 p i 1 x dn s i n φ i 1 t a n θ i 1 p i x p i 1 y dn c o s φ i 1 t a n θ i 1 p i y p i 1 z p i z dn dn is the vertical distance between two adjacent path points this strategy provides a way for the generated path to satisfy the motion constraints and it makes outstanding contributions in the process of population evolution 3 3 optimization method to solve the path planning problem in the diving process of an auv the path planning method based on behavioral decision making with l shade as computing engine is adopted to generate an optimized path the results of behavioral decision making are expressed by the yaw and pitch angles which is easier to judge whether the motion constraints are satisfied the method has three parts generation of an initial population construction of fitness function and evolution of the population 3 3 1 generation of initial population the population is a set of feasible solutions which are known as an individuals in the population we introduced the method of individual generation based on the idea of rrt in section 3 1 while a path point is generated it must generate a number at random compared with the parameter br therefore each generation of individuals is random and np individuals can be generated to form the initial population we leave out sampling the coordinates of path points but collect the yaw and pitch angles that correspond to the path points to form populations of yaw and pitch angles 3 3 2 construction of fitness function we plan a diving path based on behavioral decision making with the aim of reducing the energy consumption of the auv in ocean currents a fitness function is constructed whose value represents the energy consumption a small value indicates high individual fitness assume that an auv sails at a constant speed and the energy consumed between path points p i and p i 1 is e i where i 1 m then e i can be calculated as xuliang et al 2019 12 e i p v e h i c l e t i k r c v c i 3 p i p i 1 v g i where k r c is the resistance coefficient of water k r c is related to the auv design it can be obtained by fitting the historical data of energy consumption and auv speed xuliang et al 2019 when the auv structure and speed are fixed k r c is a constant in a fixed water area p v e h i c l e is the power of the auv thruster and v c i and v g i are the propulsion speed and auv speed respectively relative to the seafloor then the total energy consumption of the diving path is 13 e i 1 m 1 e i 3 3 3 evolution of population to improve the convergence rate we use the l shade advanced evolutionary method to make the population evolve rapidly in which the population size decreases linearly with the number of iterations the initial population size is np 0 iteration stops when the population size reaches the minimum size np e n d l shade proceeds similarly to differential evolution in the four stages of mutation crossover selection and parameter updating poláková 2017 1 mutation process np 0 yaw angle sequences and pitch angle sequences are generated based on the method in section 3 1 since the two populations have the same evolutionary pattern we take an evolutionary process as an example to illustrate the evolution of l shade set a stores the eliminated individuals during the selection process and initializes as empty define arrays mf and mcr to store the mutation factors and crossover factors that performed well in past generations their sizes are mf mcr h where h is the control parameter representing the length of mf and mcr the elements in mf and mcr are initialized to 0 5 f is the mutation factor and cr is the crossover factor the value of r is a randomly selected from 1 to h the mutation factor and crossover factor of the ith individual in generation g are 14 f i g mf r 0 1 tan rand π π 2 15 cr i g 0 mcr r 1 n o r m r n d mcr r 0 1 o t h e r w i s e where rand is a random number in the interval 0 1 and n o r m r n d is a function that generates a normally distributed random number if f i g exceeds the interval 0 1 then we set f i g 0 5 then the fitness value of each individual in the population is calculated and the individual x r 1 g with the highest fitness is selected islam et al 2011 two basis vectors x r 2 g and x r 3 g are randomly selected from the union of two sets the set of the remaining p of individuals with the highest fitness and the set a to perform mutation operations 16 v i g x i g f i g x r 1 g x i g f i g x r 2 g x r 3 g after mutation individuals that do not conform to the motion constraints probably appear in the population and it is necessary to use the strategy introduced in section 3 2 to modify them 2 crossover process the crossover process refers to the crossover transformation of elements between the original and the mutated individuals in the population if x i g j is the jth element of the ith individual in the g generation population j 1 m 1 then the crossover process is carried out according to the following rules 17 u i g j v i g j r a n d cr i g x i g j o t h e r w i s e where v i g j is the jth element of the ith mutated individual in the g generation population and u i g j is the result of crossing the jth element of the ith individual and the ith mutated individual in the g generation population after crossover the obtained value of u should be in the range of feasible solutions as with the mutation process the strategy in section 3 2 should be used to modify individuals that do not satisfy the motion constraints after the crossover process 3 selection process comparing the results of the crossover process and the original population the individuals with high fitness are retained as the next generation population those with low fitness are eliminated and the eliminated individuals are stored in set a the formula is as follows 18 x i g 1 x i g f u i g f x i g u i g o t h e r w i s e 4 parameter updating process in the g generation population the initial sets sf and scr are empty if new individuals are selected after mutation crossover then their mutation factors f i g and crossover factors cr i g are stored in sets sf and scr respectively sf scr sf and scr are used to update mf and mcr if k is the index of mf and mcr then the following conditions are satisfied 19 k mod g h mod g h 0 h o t h e r w i s e where mod is modulo function represents the remainder of g h the parameters are updated as 20 mf k l 1 sf w l sf l 2 l 1 sf w l sf l 21 mcr k l 1 scr w l scr l 2 l 1 scr w l scr l 22 w l δ f l α 1 scr δ f α 23 δ f l f u l g f x l g if the population size of generation g is np g then the rule of linear population size reduction is 24 np g 1 round np 0 np 0 min np max g g where round is an integral function min np is the smallest population size max g is the largest population iteration time and g is the current population iteration time the np g 1 individuals with the highest fitness in the g generation population are retained to form the g 1 generation population and the rest are stored in set a 3 4 stability of planning method it can be seen from the l shade algorithm flow that with sufficient iterations regardless of the initial population the algorithm will eventually converge to the global best point therefore the global optimal point x m i n can be regarded as the equilibrium point in the sense of lyapunov suppose that the initial state of the l shade algorithm is in a circle with the equilibrium point as the center and δ as the radius that is 25 x 0 x m i n δ as shown in fig 5 the circle with x m i n as the center and radius ϵ is denoted as s ϵ the circle with radius δ is s δ and the red curve is the fitness function f x s δ and f x intersect at x 1 x 2 from the convergence of the l shade algorithm it can be seen that when x i is in the area where s δ and f x intersect the solution of eq 13 will only approach the function value corresponding to x m i n and will not escape the circle s δ which is 26 f x t x 0 t 0 f x m i n ϵ it can be seen that the solution x t x 0 t 0 of the system is located in the circle s ϵ with x m i n as the center and with arbitrarily prescribed radius δ as t so the equilibrium state of the algorithm x m i n is stable in the lyapunov sense 4 simulation results and discussion the de algorithm includes five types according to different mutation strategies d e r a n d 1 d e r a n d 2 d e b e s t 1 de current to best 1 and de current to rand 1 it is difficult to select the optimal control parameters when applying evolutionary algorithms to the diving path planning problem we determined suitable parameters through simulation experiments and we compared the effects of ppm bbd with l shade and the five types of de algorithm in simulation experiments the starting point of auv was set to s 10 10 20 and the target point was set to t 0 5 1 the resistance coefficient was k r c 3 and the position of the vortex field center was p x p y 5 5 the propulsion speed of the auv v c was set to 1 5 which is equal to v g the motion constraints d φ m a x and θ m a x were set to π 4 the attitude must be adjusted n 1 time when auv achieves depth with 1 meter in order to prove that the algorithm can keep stable and the result is convincing the maximum number of iterations was set to 500 in practice the maximum number of iterations should be selected according to the requirements of calculation time and optimization results the important control parameters of de in diving path planning are random target probability br population size np mutation factor f and crossover probability cr the optimal control parameters are those that minimize the energy consumption of the diving path the optimal value of br was selected in 0 1 with a sampling interval of 0 1 the population size np was selected from 10 200 with an interval of 10 the value range and sampling interval of f and cr were the same as for br the sampling value of each parameter was calculated 15 times and the optimal value was selected according to a box plot the results are as follows energy consumption from different parameters of d e r a n d 1 is shown in fig 6 fig 6 a d show the effects of different values of br np f and cr when applied to de a mark indicates an outlier and the red line in the middle of a box indicates the median of energy consumption it can be seen that when br 0 4 there are no outliers in the algorithm results and the median energy consumption is relatively low when br 1 there is only one line in the box plot indicating that the results of 15 calculation are the same this is because br 1 means that a temporary target point cannot be generated randomly and there is only one feasible solution in the population hence the diversity of the population is lost under this parameter the chance of mutation is limited and the energy consumption of a feasible path generated by mutation is not as low as that of the original population which leads to the same results from repeated calculation when the population size np increases from 10 to 200 the energy consumption of the path in the population becomes increasingly lower until np is greater than 60 the results tend to be stable and the difference is not significant since the consumption of computing resources increases with np we choose np 60 similarly the optimal f and cr are 0 5 and 0 6 respectively fig 7 shows that when d e r a n d 2 is selected as the evolutionary strategy the parameter mutation factor f has a greater impact on the calculation results and other parameters have less influence after observation a group of optimal parameters was selected br 0 4 np 90 f 0 3 cr 0 6 unlike the results of d e r a n d 1 and d e r a n d 2 the results of d e b e s t 1 show that f has little effect on energy consumption of the diving path as shown in fig 8 we choose br 0 5 np 90 f 0 5 and cr 0 3 as the optimal parameters of this evolutionary strategy the performance of strategy de current to best 1 is different from that of other strategies and each parameter has distinct influence on the results as shown in fig 9 from the figure the optimal set of parameters is br 0 4 np 90 f 0 5 and cr 0 3 the de current to rand 1 and de current to best 1 strategies are similar and the optimal parameters are br 0 4 np 90 f 0 7 and cr 0 7 as obtained from fig 10 the optimal parameters corresponding to the five evolutionary strategies are summarized in table 1 ppm bbd with l shade has seven control parameters which is more than de has they are random target probability br population retention percentage p population size np h which is the size of array mf and mcr the initial value of mf and mcr and the minimum size of population after iteration np m i n we obtained a set of optimal control parameters in the same way as for de with results as shown in table 2 to compare the effects of ppm bbd with l shade and five types of de the optimal combination of control parameters was applied to calculate the energy consumption of the diving path each group of parameters was calculated 15 times the box plot for comparison is shown in fig 11 as can be seen in the figure the optimization results of de current to rand 1 and de current to best 1 were not as good as the others ppm bbd with l shade had a slight advantage over the other three types of de the important thing is that its distribution interval span was small which shows that ppm bbd with l shade was more stable than the other algorithms this method is based on heuristic search algorithm which can only get the optimized path but not the optimal path it is the common limitation of heuristic methods in addition the mutation and crossover process is random which results in obtaining different solutions every time fig 11 shows that the results obtained by ppm bbd are not always the same but stable in a very small range if the diving depth is small the method is able to get the optimal solution in a short time and the result is stable and reliable otherwise it takes a long time to search for more accurate and stable results therefore increasing the calculation time can effectively improve the accuracy and stability of the algorithm it is for this reason that we should pay attention to the trade off between real time and accuracy in the application of this method fig 12 shows that the minimum energy consumption decreased as the number of iterations increased when the number of iterations exceeded 300 the energy consumption of the diving path generated by ppm bbd with l shade was the lowest of the six algorithms the average fitness of the population is another important index to measure an evolutionary algorithm fig 13 shows the change of the average energy consumption of the six algorithms during iteration ppm bbd with l shade converges most quickly to a stable state and the average energy consumption is lower than that of other algorithms ppm bbd with l shade reaches a stable state after 30 iterations while other algorithms need 50 60 iterations after 500 iterations the average energy consumption of ppm bbd with l shade is 17 71 and that of other algorithms are respectively 20 11 19 92 19 65 45 75 and 39 25 it can be calculated that our method saves at least 9 8 of energy compared to other algorithms the behavioral sequence obtained by ppm bbd is shown in table 3 the variation of θ is very small all below the critical value φ has a relatively large change at each time when diving because the final target point t can only be reached following the spiral trajectory fig 14 shows the relationship between the behavior results generated by ppm bbd and the motion constraint the solid line represents the motion constraint which means d φ m a x π 4 and θ m a x π 4 and the histogram shows the values of δ φ and θ where 27 δ φ i 1 φ i φ i 1 i 2 3 m the results indicate that the adjustment of the pitch and yaw angles is not more than π 4 which shows that the behavior of the auv satisfies the motion constraint the location of the path point during the diving process can be deduced from these angles the three dimensional diving path calculated from the behavior is shown in fig 15 the red circle and red square indicate the starting point s and the final target point t the black arrows represent the current direction and the blue solid line is the diving path obtained by ppm bbd the pitch angle required from s to t is greater than π 4 which means that the auv cannot be reached directly due to the motion constraints the three dimensional diving path planned by ppm bbd rotates along the current direction and reaches the target point t with optimized energy consumption fig 16 is a top view of the diving path from which it is seen that the auv is rotating in the direction of the current which is in line with the actual situation we tested the generation of an optimized path with 20 path points 500 iterations which took 29 7 s for 15 times calculation on average an optimized path can be generated every 1 98 s as can be seen from figs 12 and 13 the results generated by l shade are stable after 50 iterations therefore we tested the time required for 50 iterations and also calculated 15 times which took 3 6 s on average an optimized path can be generated every 0 24 s therefore the proposed method is efficient in real time planning comparisons to three other methods strengthen the case of ea these are a the firefly algorithm fa and rapidly exploring random tree rrt the starting point and target point are set as in the simulation experiment above and these methods are used to plan the diving path of the auv the results are shown in fig 17 according to eq 13 the energy consumption of the four paths generated by ppm bbd a fa rrt are 21 46 25 71 24 19 39 93 respectively it can be seen that fa comes closest to the ppm bbd result and its energy consumption is 1 12 times that of ppm bbd the energy consumption of the path obtained by ppm bbd is 16 53 11 28 and 46 25 less than that of a fa and rrt respectively to fairly compare the differences between ppm bbd and the other three algorithms we performed 15 calculations using the four algorithms and made overall comparisons a box plot is shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the energy consumption of ppm bbd and fa is less than that of a and rrt and the results are more stable the average energy consumption of ppm bbd is similar to that of fa and the result is more stable 5 sea trials and experimental evaluation the performance of ppm bbd was evaluated by a set of real world test in the form of sea trials which took place at tuandao bay shandong province china in november 2020 fig 21 shows a schematic diagram of the trial locations and experimental conditions the depth of the sea area was about 10 m the utm coordinate of the starting point was 256420 41 3992581 49 0 and the target point was 4 m underwater east of the starting point 256470 41 3992581 49 4 the auv sailed at a speed of 1 5 kn our experimental platform is the sailfish 210 auv independently developed by ocean university of china the shape and main technical indicators are shown in fig 19 the structure of the platform is shown in fig 20 usbl is used in underwater acoustic positioning lifting ring is used for lifting operation when placing and recycling antenna is used to communicate with shore based platform when the power of auv is low it is necessary to connect the power supply from the charging socket to charge the battery the rudder is divided into vertical rudder and horizontal rudder which are used to control the course and depth respectively the auv is equipped with doppler velocity log dvl attitude and heading reference system ahrs and pressure sensor to measure speed attitude and current depth respectively according to the velocity and attitude data we use the navigation algorithm to calculate the horizontal position of auv under the water it takes a short time to dive so the horizontal coordinates are accurate the pressure sensor meets the factory standard so the vertical coordinate is also accurate ppm bbd pso and the general diving method were used to perform the experiment the general method is to dive to the target depth first and then sail to the target point at a constant depth for auv security and to ensure successful trials we conducted experiments and set the minimum depth from the bottom when the depth was less than 5 m the auv would float up in emergency state the motion constraints were d φ m a x and θ m a x which were set to π 4 and π 160 respectively the other parameters were set to the values in table 2 the experimental results are shown in figs 22 and 23 which show the navigation paths of the three algorithms from different perspectives it can be seen that ppm bbd and pso generated spiral diving paths while the path using the general method reached the specified depth first and then moved to the target point when diving in a real marine environment the auv is affected by current and waves and its path has some fluctuations the path energy consumption is obtained by substituting the path point coordinates in eq 13 the path point coordinates were generated in real time by the methods the path energy consumption of ppm bbd pso and general method are 2562 85 2828 91 and 5292 68 respectively it can be seen that ppm bbd used 9 4 less energy than pso and 51 57 less than the general method the proportion of energy saved in the sea trial is similar to the simulated results results of simulation and sea trial indicated that ppm bbd was reliable however if the sea state is severe in practice especially when currents make the auv unable to be controlled the results will become unreliable therefore the method needs to work in the appropriate sea state in general the larger the auv mass the better it can adapt to the severe sea state 6 conclusion we presented an approach to auv path planning using l shade to optimize a diving trajectory with motion constraints this approach is especially interesting with computing appropriate path points through behavioral decision making of auv which effectively avoids the generation of unreachable path points it is of economic value for marine investigation tasks that require frequent dives we used rrt as a reference to generate an initial diving path and proposed a modification strategy for population generation and evolution the advanced evolutionary algorithm l shade was applied to compute the yaw and pitch angle sequence to determine the behavior of auv the optimal control parameters of six algorithms were determined by simulation experiments and the energy consumption of their generated by diving paths was compared comparisons of ppm bbd and three other methods bolstered the case for using ea sea trials were conducted for evaluation results showed that ppm bbd with l shade is performed better than five forms of de owing to the population reduction mechanism the convergence rate was faster the modified strategy makes the population evolve within the feasible solution space which is the key to the practicability of the method in the future we plan to explore the application of more evolutionary algorithms to the

20561,seabed sediments are inherently heterogeneous and present different fabric patterns including rotated anisotropy this work aims to investigate the effects of rotated anisotropy in seabed properties on the hydromechanical responses of seabed and pipelines rotated anisotropic seabed property fields e g hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus fields are generated using the random field theory and are then coupled with finite element models to simulate the hydromechanical responses of seabed pipelines under dynamic nonlinear wave induced loadings monte carlo simulations are performed to approach a probabilistic analysis of the effects of heterogeneous seabed fields the pore pressure liquefaction seabed displacement and pipeline stress are analyzed for systematic varying rotation angles the results show that the upper bounds of the liquefied area would decrease by about 15 and 8 with increasing rotated anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus fields respectively for rotated anisotropic shear modulus fields the von mises stress is minimum when the rotation angle is 45 the transverse anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity or shear modulus is the most unfavorable situation the results of which could be relied upon for a conservative design if the rotated anisotropy of a seabed property is unknown in a field project keywords wave seabed pipeline interaction hydromechanical responses spatial variability random field models rotated anisotropy 1 introduction submarine pipelines have been widely used in offshore oil and gas exploitation and submarine transportation a submarine pipeline together with its surrounding seabed soils form a seabed pipeline system whose hydromechanical responses could be rather complex under the influence of dynamic wave induced loadings one typical problem associated with a seabed pipeline system is liquefaction sumer 2014 a situation in which excess pore pressure builds up significantly and the seabed soil loses its strength ye and wang 2016 yang and ye 2017 2018 during liquefaction the structural safety and serviceability of submarine pipelines begin to suffer in view of the importance of submarine pipelines and the complexity of their hydromechanical responses research on seabed pipeline behavior has gained tremendous popularity among the petroleum civil and ocean engineering communities generally the behavior of a seabed pipeline system is a coupled multi physics process which includes fluid flow processes seawater and solid deformations seabed skeleton and pipeline thus far the finite element method fem has been shown to be a pre eminent numerical tool for solving such a coupled multi physics problem jeng and lin 1999 zhou et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b tong et al 2017 many advanced fem numerical models and tools e g the dyne3wac ou 2009 the pastor zienkiewicz mark iii pastor et al 2011 and the fssi cas zhang et al 2019 have been developed to simulate the complex hydromechanical response of seabed pipeline system under the effects of seismic wave and current wave in fem based seabed pipeline analysis the model responses are heavily influenced by the input parameters such as soil permeability shear modulus and degree of saturation a comprehensive evaluation of the seabed pipeline responses requires a complete characterization of the seabed soil properties seabed soils however are heterogeneous with different properties at different locations over the years various models have been developed to characterize heterogeneous seabed soils and these models can be grouped into three classes 1 multi regional models hsu et al 1995 zhou et al 2011 in which the seabed is divided into a number of sub regions with each sub region being assumed to have uniform permeability porosity shear modulus etc 2 trend models jeng and seymour 1997 sui et al 2018 which describe the seabed parameters using continuous depth dependent functions and 3 random field models zhang et al 2016a lai et al 2019 in which the seabed soil properties at every location are quantified as a set of random variables and the values of these variables are described by a joint probability distribution these models can be combined as well e g the multi regional and trend function model zhang et al 2016b sui et al 2019 the trend function and random field model peng et al 2017 among these models random field models can effectively capture and model the heterogeneous features of soil properties in nature and thus there has been an increasing interest in adopting random field models to characterize heterogeneous soils a number of studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of random field soil properties on the seabed responses for example zhang et al 2016a considered the soil permeability shear modulus and degree of saturation as log normally distributed random fields and input them into fem models to simulate seabed responses zhu et al 2019a performed a reliability analysis to evaluate the stability of submarine slopes using the limit equilibrium method and coupled it with the random field theory to model the spatial variability in seabed strength in the case that soil properties are not independent simulations can be further developed with the cross correlated random field method as in the work of peng et al 2017 however it should be noted that these studies mainly focused on seabeds that have a horizontally deposited fabric pattern that is soil properties show smooth variations in the horizontal direction i e the bedding orientation and rapid variations in the vertical direction in reality soils including seabed sediments can exhibit different fabric patterns after processes such as deposition self weight compaction and wave induced loadings fig 1 shows an example of the layering profile of seabed sediment constructed from multi channel seismic reflection data depending on the correlation structure the deposition profile of a soil field can be classified into six typical classes zhu and zhang 2013 isotropy transverse anisotropy rotated anisotropy general anisotropy general rotated anisotropy and their combinations in addition to transverse anisotropic seabeds analyzed in previous studies rotated anisotropic seabeds are also commonly seen in nature e g in coastal slopes but remain a less explored topic in the context of the random field theory the extent of variations in a soil property along one direction can be characterized by the so called scale of fluctuation sof the directions in which the soil properties show smooth variations are generally quantified with larger sof values and vice versa usually soil fabric in the two dimensional case is directional with two principal directions with the major principal direction having the largest sof and the minor principal direction having the smallest sof for heterogeneous soils with transverse anisotropy the principal directions in the fabric are parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes while for rotated anisotropic heterogeneous soils the principal directions are rotated from the cartesian coordinate axes by a certain angle griffiths et al 2009 were among the first to consider rotated anisotropic heterogeneous soils and investigate their effects on slope stability rotated anisotropic heterogeneous shear strength fields were generated by first generating transverse anisotropic random shear strength fields and then rotating them by the desired angle in addition in a recent work by zhu et al 2019b extensive studies with parametric rotation angles were conducted to investigate how the fabric orientation of anisotropically deposited soil influences the stability and failure mechanism of a slope and to identify the critical fabric orientation that is most unfavorable to slope stability motivated by the pioneering work of griffiths et al 2009 and zhu et al 2019b the objective of this study is to evaluate the hydromechanical responses of seabed pipelines considering rotated anisotropic heterogeneous seabed properties and to identify the critical fabric orientation that is most unfavorable to the seabed and pipeline stability this work builds on the previous effort lai et al 2019 which studied the effects of spatially correlated seabed properties on the characteristic hydromechanical responses of seabed pipeline whereas this work puts an emphasis on the effects of rotated anisotropy in the seabed heterogeneity moreover the nonlinear wave theory is implemented is this study which is better suited to large amplitude waves that are more relevant for seabed liquefaction the remainder of the paper is organized as follows first the methodology and simulation procedures of rotated anisotropic heterogeneous soil using the random field theory are presented in section 2 then with the formulation of the coupled hydromechanical problem of seabed pipeline and the framework of the probabilistic analysis described in section 3 an illustrative example of seabed pipeline is set up and analyzed in section 4 in this example the seabed hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus are considered heterogeneous with rotated anisotropy and their effects on pore pressure liquefaction seabed displacement and pipeline stress are investigated finally concluding remarks are drawn in section 5 based upon the results presented 2 random field seabed properties with rotated anisotropy 2 1 correlation structure of rotated anisotropy as mentioned above soils including seabeds are inherently heterogeneous with material properties showing different values at different locations these values however are usually not completely independent but are spatially correlated with each other the random field theory is an effective tool to model such spatially varying but correlated material properties e g chen et al 2016b a liu et al 2017 leung et al 2018 and shen et al 2019 as a result of colluvium processes topples end tipping construction and other processes the spatial distribution of a soil property could exhibit several typical fabric patterns including isotropy transverse anisotropy rotated anisotropy general anisotropy general rotated anisotropy and their combinations zhu and zhang 2013 therefore a rigorous framework for generating a random field with typical fabric patterns was proposed in zhu and zhang 2013 and is employed in this work for the simulation of heterogeneous seabed properties with preferred bedding orientations within the random field theory a material property at various locations is quantified as a set of random variables each random variable follows a probability distribution and the relation between these random variables is characterized by a correlation function supposing that a random field is stationary the probability distributions are constant for all locations and the correlation function depends only on the separation distance regardless of the exact locations the sof in the correlation function characterizes the extent of the variations between random variables at adjacent locations soil properties exhibit a large sof in the major principal direction and a small sof in the minor principal direction for rotated anisotropic heterogeneous soils the major and minor principal directions are not parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes according to the framework proposed in zhu and zhang 2013 the correlation structure of rotated anisotropy in the two dimensional case can be characterized by an extended elliptical function 1 ρ δ x δ z exp δ x cos β δ z sin β θ 1 2 δ x sin β δ z cos β θ 2 2 where ρ is the correlation between soil properties at two locations with separation distances δ x and δ z in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively parameters θ 1 and θ 2 are the sofs in the major and minor principal directions respectively β is the rotational angle of the major principal direction from the x axis the correlation structure of rotated anisotropy in the three dimensional case can be derived from an extended ellipsoidal function and the interested reader is referred to liu and leung 2018 2 2 simulation procedures with the correlation structure of a soil property random fields of these soil properties could be generated using various algorithms such as the moving average method cressie and pavlicová 2002 the local average subdivision method fenton and vanmarcke 1990 the covariance matrix decomposition method chenari and farahbakhsh 2015 and sequential simulation methods chen et al 2012 wang and chen 2018 in this paper the covariance matrix decomposition method is adopted owing to its simplicity and computational efficiency the simulation procedures are briefly described as follows and the interested reader is referred to davis 1987 and sudret and der kiureghian 2000 for more details step 1 discretize the field into a set of grid points which are analogous to nodes in a finite element mesh and the grid can be structured or unstructured values of random field variables will be calculated at the grid locations step 2 calculate the correlation matrix and perform covariance matrix decomposition the correlation matrix denoted by c consists of components ρ i j which characterize the correlation between random variables at locations i and j respectively in this work the correlation is calculated with eq 1 to reproduce the seabed fabric with rotated anisotropy using the cholesky decomposition method the correlation matrix is decomposed as c l l t where the superscript t indicates the transpose of the matrix step 3 generate a random field of standard normally distributed variables z with reference to the covariance matrix decomposition method a random field of the normalized variable z could be sampled from davis 1987 2 z l u where u is a vector of independent random variables obeying a standard normal distribution step 4 transform the standard normally distributed variables z to a specific distribution for a soil property s that obeys a general normal distribution it can be obtained from a standard normal distribution by first multiplying the standard deviation and then adding the mean such that 3 s μ s z σ s where μ s and σ s are the mean and standard deviation respectively of soil property s and z is the normalized variable for log normally distributed soil properties the transformation is given as 4 s exp μ ln s σ ln s z where μ ln s and σ ln s are the mean and standard deviation respectively of the logarithmic variable s i e ln s such that 5 σ ln s ln 1 σ s μ s 2 6 μ ln s ln μ s 1 2 σ ln s 2 where μ s and σ s are the mean and standard deviation respectively of variable s in case that soil properties obey other distributions such as a weibull distribution weibull 1951 lai et al 2003 the transformation can be approached by performing a normal score mapping chen et al 2012 3 probabilistic hydromechanical analysis of seabed pipelines with heterogeneous seabed properties generated using the random field theory stochastic hydromechanical analysis of seabed pipeline can be performed and the seabed pipeline responses could be analyzed probabilistically a simple seabed pipeline system consists of a porous seabed and an embedded pipeline in this work the coupled hydromechanical fem model previously developed in zhou et al 2014 is adopted for the hydromechanical analysis of seabed pipeline for completeness the model formulation as well as the framework for the probabilistic analysis of seabed pipeline responses is briefly described in this section for the detailed implementation and validation tests of the adopted hydromechanical fem model the interested reader is referred to zhou et al 2014 and lai et al 2019 3 1 formulation of the hydromechanical model the seabed pipeline system is modeled as a plane strain problem by neglecting the deformation along the longitudinal direction of the pipeline elastic constitutive relations are assumed for both the seabed solid skeleton and the pipeline concerning the seabed the final governing equations derived from the balances of mass and linear momentum are written as follows zhou et al 2014 lai et al 2019 k x 2 p x 2 k z 2 p z 2 ϕ f ρ f g β f p t ρ f 2 t 2 k x u x k z w z 7 ρ f g t u x w z 8 p x ρ 2 u t 2 g s 2 u x 2 2 u z 2 1 1 2 ν s g s x u x w z ρ b x 9 p z ρ 2 w t 2 g s 2 w x 2 2 w z 2 1 1 2 ν s g s z u x w z ρ b z where u and w are the horizontal x and vertical z displacements respectively p is the excess pore pressure k x and k z are the seabed hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively g s is the seabed shear modulus ν s is the seabed poisson s ratio ϕ f is the void volume fraction of the seabed ρ f is the intrinsic mass density of the fluid i e seawater in this case ρ is the equivalent density of the seabed and pore fluid g is the gravitational acceleration b x and b z are the x and z components of the body force the parameter β f accounts for both the compressibility of the pore fluid and the degree of saturation of the porous seabed and is given as ülker 2015 liao et al 2018 10 β f 1 k f 1 s r p f 0 where s r is the degree of saturation k f is the bulk modulus of the fluid and p f 0 is the static pore pressure which is calculated as p f 0 p a ρ f g d where p a 10 5 pa is the atmospheric pressure and d is the water depth it should be noted that in the governing eqs 7 8 and 9 the spatial derivative terms of the non homogeneous seabed soil properties e g the hydraulic conductivity k x and k z the shear modulus g s are not involved in the random field approach soil properties are characterized by discrete values the spatial derivatives of a random field property i e discrete values are not well defined and thus are not considered in this study in addition seabed soil in a real offshore environment is often loosely deposited soil with complex nonlinear inelastic and history dependent behavior as the focus of this study is on the effects of rotational anisotropy in seabed properties an elastic constitutive model is adopted for the seabed soil examples of more sophisticated constitutive models of seabed soil can be found in pastor et al 2011 and zhao et al 2016 2017 and will be explored in future work for the pipeline the final governing equations are derived from the balance of linear momentum and are written as 11 ρ p 2 u t 2 g p 2 u x 2 2 u z 2 1 1 2 ν p g p x u x w z ρ p b x 0 12 ρ p 2 w t 2 g p 2 w x 2 2 w z 2 1 1 2 ν p g p z u x w z ρ p b z 0 where g p is the pipeline shear modulus ν p is poisson s ratio of the pipeline and ρ p is the density of the pipeline based on the coupled partial differential equations defined by eqs 7 8 9 11 and 12 the hydromechanical responses of seabed pipeline can be solved in this work comsol multiphysics software with the livelink for matlab interface is adopted to implement and solve the partial differential equations in particular the general form pde interface in comsol is used to customize these partial differential equations the hydromechanical fem model is first set up within comsol desktop and then exported as a matlab script which can be easily integrated with the matlab codes for generating random field seabed properties 3 2 framework of the probabilistic analysis as seabeds are considered heterogeneous probabilistic analysis is utilized to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the seabed pipeline behavior the framework of probabilistic analysis of the seabed pipeline hydromechanical responses consists of three main components 1 with the statistics i e the mean variance and scale of fluctuation of a seabed property heterogeneous property fields are generated using the random field theory 2 the hydromechanical fem model of seabed pipeline is set up with the generated random field seabed properties taken as the input and the seabed pipeline responses are solved and analyzed and 3 with the aid of monte carlo simulation mcs the seabed pipeline responses are solved repeatedly with different realizations of random field seabed properties the matrices of interest e g the excess pore pressure liquefaction zone pipeline displacements or stress are analyzed statistically it should be noted that in component 2 the hydromechanical fem model requires the seabed properties at the locations of gaussian points of each element to integrate the random field seabed properties into the fem model one option is to directly simulate the seabed properties at the gaussian points as in lai et al 2019 another option is to first simulate the seabed properties at a set of grid points that cover the entire seabed domain and then interpolate the seabed properties at the gaussian points using algorithms such as the nearest neighbor interpolation or linear interpolation the second option is simple to implement and efficient for fem models with a large number of nodes in this work the second option with linear interpolation is adopted 4 numerical examples to investigate the effects of heterogeneous seabed properties with rotated anisotropy on seabed pipeline behavior an example of a rectangle seabed with an embedded circular cross section pipeline is studied in this section this example has previously been studied in lai et al 2019 where the effects of spatially correlated seabed properties on the characteristic hydromechanical responses of seabed pipeline including parametric studies of the random field parameters e g coefficient of variation cov and scale of fluctuation sof have been analyzed as an extension of that study this work further analyzes the effects of rotated anisotropy on the seabed properties 4 1 model set up 4 1 1 geometries and boundary conditions the seabed as shown in fig 2 is 100 m wide and 30 m deep the pipeline is buried 2 m below the seabed surface with a diameter of 1 m and a thickness of 0 05 m with regard to the boundary conditions of the seabed for the solid phase with respect to the degree of freedom u and w the bottom of the seabed is fixed with no displacements the lateral sides are constrained with rollers i e no horizontal displacements and the top surface is free for the fluid phase with respect to the degree of freedom p both the seabed bottom and lateral sides are specified with no flux while the seabed surface is subject to dynamic wave pressure in this work the wave pressure p b t is approximated by a third order stokes solution given by hsu et al 2009 and ye and jeng 2012 13 p b x t ρ f g h 2 cosh λ d 1 ω 2 λ 2 h 2 2 u 0 λ ω 0 cos λ x ω t 3 ρ f h 2 8 ω 0 ω 0 u 0 λ 2 sinh 4 λ d g λ 3 sinh 2 λ d cos

u 0 λ the wave induced loading on the seabed skeleton is rather complicated due to the changeable interactions between the wave and seabed and is ignored in this work for simplicity in fact the wave induced loadings on the seabed skeleton decreases as the depth to seabed increases yamamoto and suzuki 1980 with regard to the boundary conditions of the pipeline its inner circumferential face is free and its outer circumferential face is assumed to be perfectly bonded with the seabed i e the seabed and the pipeline have the same displacements and the same stresses at the seabed pipeline interface no body force including the gravity is considered in the fem simulations and thus the seabed pipeline responses represent the net effects that are induced by the dynamics wave pressure this is acceptable for elastic seabed however it should be noted that the gravity would affect the seabed pipeline responses and thus should be taken into consideration if an elastoplastic soil model is adopted 4 1 2 model parameters input parameters for the example seabed pipeline problem are listed in table 1 it should be noted that the adopted wave parameters correspond to a fairly large wave representing a fairly extreme environment that may be encountered by the seabed pipeline system nevertheless based on the review in maâtoug and ayadi 2016 the adopted wave parameters are within the applicability range of the adopted third order stokes solution i e eq 13 also no current is considered in the waves the total simulation time is set to 16 s so that the seabed pipeline responses after two complete waves can be captured the seabed hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus are spatially correlated variables with rotated anisotropy and are generated by following the random field simulation procedures presented in section 2 in this work the statistical characteristics i e the mean cov and sof of a seabed soil property are chosen based on typical ranges recommended in previous research in the literature specifically rehfeldt et al 1992 suggested that the vertical sof of hydraulic conductivity is in 0 8 1 6 m and the horizontal sof is in 4 8 12 8 m jiang et al 2014 recommended that the vertical sof of shear modulus is in 0 5 3 0 m and the horizontal sof is in 10 40 m while researches on the statistical characteristics of seabed soil properties are relatively limited the interested reader is referred to zhang et al 2016a and lai et al 2019 for a brief review results of the parametric studies on the cov and sof have also been reported in lai et al 2019 in this example both the hydraulic conductivity and the shear modulus are assumed to obey log normal distributions the hydraulic conductivity has a mean value of 5 0 10 4 m s and a cov of 2 5 and the mean and cov for the shear modulus are 10 mpa and 0 45 respectively the sofs are assumed to be 20 m in the major principal direction and 1 m in the minor principal direction for the rotation angle β a parametric set of values ranging from 0 to 90 half of 180 due to symmetry is considered which is sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of rotated anisotropy on seabed pipeline behavior it is worth noting that in offshore practices the trenching and backfilling may be involved and can disturb the soil around a buried pipe significantly the trenching and backfilling are not considered in this work 4 1 3 simulation scenarios three sets of simulations are considered i a probabilistic case in which the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be heterogeneous and the shear modulus is homogeneous ii a probabilistic case in which the shear modulus is heterogeneous and the hydraulic conductivity is homogeneous and iii a deterministic case in which both the seabed hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus are homogeneous the deterministic case is used for comparison regarding the probabilistic cases the seabed pipeline problem is solved repeatedly for 500 times with 500 different realizations of the random fields it should be noted that in reality both the hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus could be heterogeneous with cross correlations in between zhang et al 2016a peng et al 2017 in this example the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity and of the shear modulus is not incorporated concurrently so that the effects of rotated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus can be investigated independently 4 2 effects of rotated anisotropic hydraulic conductivity field the probabilistic case in which only the hydraulic conductivity is heterogeneous is studied in this section following the random field simulation procedures provided in section 2 and based on the statistics described in the previous section rotated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields are generated first to generate these fields the domain is discretized into a number of 200 60 x by z elements with each element having a length of 0 5 m therefore one heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field would consist of 200 60 values it is worth noting that there is a relationship that sof and the element length of a random field mesh should be satisfied to achieve an acceptable discretization accuracy previous research e g sudret and der kiureghian 2000 allaix and carbone 2009 has suggested that the element length is between 1 4 1 2 of sof typical realizations of the random hydraulic conductivity fields with different rotation angles are shown in fig 3 as the random fields are given distinct sof values in the major and minor principal directions i e 20 m and 1 m respectively the generated hydraulic conductivity fields exhibit clear layered profiles as expected in addition the bedding orientations of these hydraulic conductivity fields are consistent with the desired rotation angles although the hydraulic conductivity is taken as identical in the x and z directions the anisotropy exists as a result of different sof values in the major and minor principal directions and the spatially averaging effects with the generated random hydraulic conductivity fields taken as input the coupled hydromechanical problem is solved and the seabed pipeline responses are analyzed probabilistically of particular interest the results of 1 pore pressure and liquefaction 2 seabed displacements and 3 pipeline stresses are presented in the following it should be noted that the mesh used in the fem is not necessary to be the same as the mesh used in random field generation in this example the mesh in the fem consists of triangular elements with dense elements within the vicinity of the pipeline 4 2 1 pore pressure and liquefaction first the pore pressure and liquefaction situations of the seabed are analyzed fig 4 shows the contours of the normalized excess pore pressure fields at time t 3 s for the cases of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields with different rotation angles note that unless otherwise noted the contours presented in the following represent the results of one typical mcs which corresponds to the random field realizations previously shown in fig 3 at this particular time i e t 3 s the pipeline is close to a wave trough a situation in which the seabed soil around the pipeline would have a high potential to liquefy as will be illustrated later the excess pore pressure is normalized with respect to the amplitude of the wave induced pressure so that one can obtain a more direct sense of the pore pressure build up and dissipation situations in the seabed overall the excess pore pressure fields in these four cases i e β 0 30 60 and 90 exhibit similar patterns the region under the wave troughs experiences negative excess pore pressure while the region under wave crests experiences positive values the magnitudes of the excess pore pressure peak near the seabed surface and decrease quickly with depth to gain a quantitative insight into the effects of rotated anisotropy on pore pressure the excess pore pressure along a vertical cutline x 0 m and z from 30 m to 0 m is probed at this time the results of the 500 mcss are analyzed altogether fig 5 plots the 90 confidence interval of the normalized excess pore pressure together with the results of the deterministic case and of one mcs at time t 3 s for all the rotation angles the normalized excess pore pressure in magnitude decreases quickly from approximately 0 5 to 0 07 with depth going from 0 m to 2 5 m i e the depth of the bottom of the pipeline and the excess pore pressure varies mildly below this depth the uncertainty in the excess pore pressure which is due to soil heterogeneity increases with depth and then vanishes at a depth below the pipeline with the results of pore pressure the liquefaction state at every location of the seabed can be evaluated in this work the transient liquefaction criterion is adopted as follows zen and yamazaki 1990 ye 2012 peng et al 2017 17 ρ ρ f g z p b x t p x z t 0 where p b x t is the dynamic wave pressure defined in eq 13 and p x z t is the excess pore pressure at the location x z and time t if criterion 17 is met the seabed is considered liquefied it should be noted that the liquefaction criterion 17 is an indirect criterion by assuming constant total stress in the seabed soil the total stress in seabed soil could change due to the complex soil and structure interaction effect which has been studied in ye and wang 2015 2016 moreover using a case study of a poroelastic seabed and the analytical solution for wave induced excess pore pressure qi and gao 2018 showed that the pore pressure based liquefaction criterion could lead to an unrealistic upward resultant force which leads to tensile stresses in liquefied non cohesive soil layer zhou et al 2020 these two aspects are not considered in this work it should also be noted that the installation process as well as the structure weight of the pipeline may also have an influence on the material properties and effective stresses of the surrounding seabed and thus affect the liquefaction depth of the seabed sui et al 2017 in this work the effects of stress changes in the seabed due to the installation and structure weight of the pipeline are not considered contours of the liquefaction fields at time t 3 s are shown in fig 6 at this particular time the seabed soils above the pipeline are liquefied the liquefaction zone is limited within the seabed surface vicinity with depth as deep as approximately 2 m and a width of approximately 40 m the boundary of the liquefaction zone shows some winding details e g figs 6b and 6c which might be a result of the soil heterogeneity effects besides that there is no observable patterns in the liquefaction profiles with the increase of rotation angle further investigations on liquefaction will be made based on the results of the mcss based on the results of the mcss the probability of liquefaction at every location of the seabed is evaluated the contour maps of the liquefaction probability during a complete wave period are depicted in fig 7 in this case only the results near the pipeline are shown to get a better view of the seabed response around the pipeline the contour maps are obtained as follows first a grid of points that overlap the entire seabed is created then following the criterion defined in eq 17 the liquefaction state at every grid point in every mcs is evaluated the liquefaction state is denoted as yes if the location could liquefy anytime with the progressive of wave lastly the probability of liquefaction at each grid point is obtained by counting the total number of liquefactions at this point based on the results of all 500 mcss and the contour maps are plotted with an increase in the rotation angle the area of the region with a 95 probability of liquefaction i e the area enclosed by the 95 contour decreases there are fairly significant winding details in the liquefaction profiles when rotation angles are small e g β 0 and 30 indicating a more complex liquefaction situation in these cases as a qualitative analysis of the liquefaction situations the area of the liquefied region at a particular time in each mcs is calculated it is worth noting that due to the heterogeneity of the seabed properties the liquefaction profile as well as the liquefaction depth may vary as the wave progresses thus in this work the liquefied area is chosen as the indicator of the seabed response and is analyzed to gain insights into the liquefaction situation around the pipeline fig 8 plots the statistical results of the liquefied area at time t 3 s based on the results of all 500 mcss as a comparison the liquefied area for the deterministic case is also plotted the mean liquefied area of the probabilistic cases is considerably larger by approximately 11 16 than the liquefied area of the deterministic case and it decreases slightly with the increase of rotation angle the uncertainty in the liquefied area decreases with increasing rotation angle which can be identified by observing the heights of the boxes and the heights of the whiskers in the boxplots the distributions of the liquefied area are skewed to the upper side with a considered number of outliers i e the cases out of the 99 3 probability on the lower side this phenomenon indicates that situations with small liquefied area values are less likely to occur as the design of seabed pipelines is generally referring to the most dangerous cases i e the upper bounds of the liquefied area in this example the results in fig 8 indicate that the liquefaction situation of seabed pipeline would get less severe with increasing rotation angles the upper bound of liquefied area decreases by approximately 15 with the rotation angle increasing from 0 to 90 4 2 2 seabed displacements next the seabed displacements are analyzed figs 9 and 10 present the horizontal and vertical displacements of the seabed at time t 3 s for the cases of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields with different rotation angles the horizontal displacement fields are presented with negative values on the right half and positive values on the left side on either side the horizontal displacement magnitudes peak in the central area and diminish towards the boundary the vertical displacement fields show positive values under the wave troughs and negative values under the wave crests the magnitude of the vertical displacement is largest at the seabed surface and diminishes with depth the rotated anisotropy has no noticeable impact on the distribution patterns of the seabed displacements to quantitatively investigate the effects of rotated anisotropy on seabed displacements the displacements at a location right above the top of the pipeline with coordinates x 0 m and z 1 5 m are probed fig 11 plots the maximum displacements at this location during one complete wave period for the cases of different rotation angles for the horizontal displacement the mean value of the probabilistic cases is smaller by approximately 1 though than the value of the deterministic case and the variation is small with increasing rotation angle the variation of the displacement uncertainty is also relatively small for different rotation angles regarding the vertical displacement the mean value is greater by approximately 1 than the value of the deterministic case and it decreases slightly with the rotation angle the uncertainty first slightly increases and then decreases with increasing rotation angle for both the horizontal and vertical displacements the variations in the upper bounds i e the 99 3 upper whiskers with increasing rotation angles are fairly small less than 2 4 2 3 pipeline stresses the stresses in the pipeline due to waves are important matrices for the engineering design of pipelines fig 12 shows the contours of the von mises stress fields in the pipeline for the cases of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity with different rotation angles overall the distributions of the von mises stress for different rotation angles are similar the top bottom left and right parts of the pipeline are subject to high von mises stresses with the results of the von mises stresses the maximum von mises stresses experienced by the pipeline during one complete wave period are calculated fig 13 shows the relation between the maximum von mises stress and the rotation angle for all the rotation angles the mean of the maximum von mises stress is slightly greater less than 2 than the maximum von mises stress of the deterministic case and it decreases with increasing rotation angle the uncertainty in terms of cov decreases slightly with increasing rotation angle together with the results of liquefaction and seabed displacements it is found that the seabed pipeline responses would get slightly better with increasing rotated anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity fields and the transverse anisotropy i e rotation angle β 0 is a most unfavorable situation 4 3 effects of rotated anisotropic shear modulus field similar to the analysis regarding the rotated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity performed in the previous section this section reports the results of the rotated anisotropic heterogeneous shear modulus based on the statistics described in section 4 1 heterogeneous shear modulus fields with different rotation angles are generated and typical realizations are presented in fig 14 these shear modulus fields show clear layered profiles with bedding orientations aligned with the specified rotation angles 4 3 1 pore pressure and liquefaction corresponding to the realizations of shear modulus fields shown in fig 14 the results of the excess pore pressure fields at time t 3 s are presented in fig 15 similar to the hydraulic conductivity cases the areas with large magnitudes of excess pore pressure are concentrated within approximately 2 5 m below the seabed top surface the excess pore pressure fields for the cases of different rotation angles exhibit similar patterns indicating that the rotated anisotropy would not make a significant difference in the pore pressure distribution profiles fig 16 shows the probabilistic results of the excess pore pressure along the vertical cutline x 0 m based on the 500 mcss for all the rotation angles the excess pore pressure diminishes quickly within the top 2 5 m of the seabed and then varies slowly below this depth with the increase in the rotation angle the uncertainty in the excess pore pressure at a particular depth decreases when the rotation angle increases to 90 i e the bedding orientation becomes vertically aligned the uncertainty becomes relatively insignificant and the excess pore pressure of the heterogeneous cases almost coincides with that of the homogeneous case fig 17 shows the contours of the liquefaction fields at time t 3 s for different rotation angles again at this particular time the liquefaction zone concentrates in the top middle region of the seabed that surrounds the pipeline the liquefaction zones for all four rotation angles exhibit similar profiles with the boundaries smoother than those of the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity cases comparing with the results shown in fig 6 the probabilistic results of the liquefaction zone for a complete wave period are depicted in fig 18 with the increase in rotation angle the area of the region where the liquefaction state is uncertain with a probability between 5 and 95 decreases slightly this phenomenon is consistent with observations made from the results of excess pore pressure fig 15 as expected from relation eq 17 that the uncertainty in the excess pore pressure diminishes with increasing rotation angle fig 19 shows the relation between the liquefied area and the rotation angles at time t 3 s in all cases the mean of the liquefied area of the probabilistic case is smaller than the liquefied area of the deterministic case with an increase in the rotation angle the mean of the liquefied area increases and approaches asymptotically towards the value of the deterministic case regarding the uncertainty in the liquefied area there is a clear trend that the uncertainty decreases with increasing rotation angle the cov decreases from approximately 0 11 to 0 04 with the rotation angle increasing from 0 to 90 for the upper bound of the liquefied area it decreases by approximately 8 with the rotation angle increase from 0 to 30 and then show less significant variations with the rotation angle increase from 30 to 90 4 3 2 seabed displacements figs 20 and 21 present the horizontal and vertical displacement fields respectively of the seabed for different rotation angles in all cases the horizontal and vertical displacement fields exhibit almost the same profiles the mcs results of the maximum displacements right at the top of the pipeline during one complete wave period are plotted in fig 22 for both the horizontal and vertical displacements their mean values are overall greater by approximately 10 on average than the results of the deterministic case there is a trend that the mean values of the horizontal and vertical displacements respectively first slightly increase and then decrease with the increase of rotation angle the uncertainty in the horizontal and vertical displacements due to heterogeneous shear modulus is significantly larger than that due to heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity comparing fig 22 with fig 11 the cov of the horizontal displacement decreases by approximately 25 with the rotation angle increasing from 0 to 90 while the cov of the vertical displacement varies within 10 for different rotation angles 4 3 3 pipeline stresses fig 23 shows the contours of the pipeline von mises stress field at time t 3 s the results indicate that the rotated anisotropy in the shear modulus does not impact the distribution patterns of the von mises stress fields in the pipeline the maximum von mises stress in the pipeline during one complete wave period for the cases of different rotation angles are shown in fig 24 overall the mean of the maximum von mises stress of the probabilistic cases are all fairly close to the maximum von mises stress of the deterministic case the uncertainties in the maximum von mises stresses of the heterogeneous shear modulus cases are significantly greater than those of the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity cases by comparing with the results of the hydraulic conductivity cases shown in fig 13 with an increase in the rotation angle the uncertainty first decreases and then increases the uncertainty in the maximum von mises stress is minimal when the rotation angle is approximately 45 the upper bound of the maximum von mises stresses with the rotation angle at 45 would be as much as 20 less than that with the rotation angle at 0 or 90 together with the results of liquefaction and seabed displacements it is found that the overall seabed pipeline responses would get slightly better with increasing rotated anisotropy in the shear modulus field the transverse anisotropy is the most unfavorable situation and the rotated anisotropy with rotation angle at about 45 is the most favorable one 5 conclusion in this work a probabilistic analysis on seabed pipelines is performed to investigate the effects of rotated anisotropy in seabed properties on the hydromechanical responses of seabed pipelines under dynamic wave induced loadings random field hydraulic conductivity and shear moduli with different rotation angles are generated and imported into the hydromechanical fem model with which the seabed pipeline responses are solved based on the results of mcss the pore pressure liquefaction seabed displacement and pipeline von mises stresses are analyzed in a probabilistic fashion the main findings of this work are as follows 1 the overall distribution profiles of the pore pressure liquefaction seabed displacement and pipeline von mises stresses are not affected much by the heterogeneity of and rotated anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus the effects of rotated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus could be reflected by the analyzed quantitative matrices 2 based on mcs the mean of and the uncertainty in the liquefied areas decrease noticeably with the increasing rotated anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity for shear modulus the mean first decreases and then increases but the uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing rotated anisotropy in terms of the upper bounds of the liquefied area referring to the most dangerous case for engineering design the variations due to the rotated anisotropy effects could be as much as 15 for hydraulic conductivity and 8 for shear modulus 3 the variations in seabed displacements due to the increasing rotated anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity are relatively small and they are within 2 in terms of the upper bounds of the seabed displacements with increasing rotated anisotropy in shear modulus the mean of the seabed displacements first increases and then decreases with the inflection point at about 45 the cov in the horizontal displacement decreases by approximately 25 with increasing rotation angle while it varies within 10 for the vertical displacement 4 for hydraulic conductivity both the mean of and the uncertainty in the maximum von mises stresses in the pipeline decrease by less than 2 though with the increasing rotated anisotropy as to shear modulus the mean slightly increases while the uncertainty first decreases and then increases with increasing rotated anisotropy the variations in the upper bounds for different rotation angles could be as much as 20 and the upper bound is minimal when the rotation angle is approximately 45 5 overall the transverse anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity or shear modulus is the most unfavorable situation the seabed pipeline behavior generally gets better with the increase of rotated anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity and for shear modulus it gets better with the rotation angle changing from 0 or 90 to 45 i e 45 is a most favorable situation if the rotated anisotropy of a seabed property is unknown in a field project the analysis with transverse anisotropy could be relied upon for conservative design lastly it is noted that the influence of the degree of saturation on the seabed pipeline may be comparable to the hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus hsu and jeng 1994 jeng 2012 additional simulations with different extents of rotated anisotropy in the degree of saturation are also conducted while the results are not presented herein it is found that with adopted parameters of degree of saturation i e random field degree of saturation in the range of 0 96 0 99 the effects of rotated anisotropy in degree of saturation on the seabed pipeline responses are fairly small and similar to the conclusions of the hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus cases the transverse anisotropy in degree of saturation is also the most unfavorable situation credit authorship contribution statement zhengshou lai conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft qiushi chen

20561,seabed sediments are inherently heterogeneous and present different fabric patterns including rotated anisotropy this work aims to investigate the effects of rotated anisotropy in seabed properties on the hydromechanical responses of seabed and pipelines rotated anisotropic seabed property fields e g hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus fields are generated using the random field

interaction hydromechanical responses spatial variability random field models rotated anisotropy 1 introduction submarine pipelines have been widely used in offshore oil and gas exploitation and submarine transportation a submarine pipeline together with its surrounding seabed soils form a seabed pipeline system whose hydromechanical responses could be rather complex under the influence of dynamic wave induced loadings one typical problem associated with a seabed pipeline system is liquefaction sumer 2014 a situation in which excess pore pressure builds up significantly and the seabed soil loses its strength ye and wang 2016 yang and ye 2017 2018 during liquefaction the structural safety and serviceability of submarine pipelines begin to suffer in view of the importance of submarine pipelines and the complexity of their hydromechanical responses research on seabed pipeline behavior has gained tremendous popularity among the petroleum civil and ocean engineering communities generally the behavior of a seabed pipeline system is a coupled multi physics process which includes fluid flow processes seawater and solid deformations seabed skeleton and pipeline thus far the finite element method fem has been shown to be a pre eminent numerical tool for solving such a coupled multi physics problem jeng and lin 1999 zhou et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b tong et al 2017 many advanced fem numerical models and tools e g the dyne3wac ou 2009 the pastor zienkiewicz mark iii pastor et al 2011 and the fssi cas zhang et al 2019 have been developed to simulate the complex hydromechanical response of seabed pipeline system under the effects of seismic wave and current wave in fem based seabed pipeline analysis the model responses are heavily influenced by the input parameters such as soil permeability shear modulus and degree of saturation a comprehensive evaluation of the seabed pipeline responses requires a complete characterization of the seabed soil properties seabed soils however are heterogeneous with different properties at different locations over the years various models have been developed to characterize heterogeneous seabed soils and these models can be grouped into three classes 1 multi regional models hsu et al 1995 zhou et al 2011 in which the seabed is divided into a number of sub regions with each sub region being assumed to have uniform permeability porosity shear modulus etc 2 trend models jeng and seymour 1997 sui et al 2018 which describe the seabed parameters using continuous depth dependent functions and 3 random field models zhang et al 2016a lai et al 2019 in which the seabed soil properties at every location are quantified as a set of random variables and the values of these variables are described by a joint probability distribution these models can be combined as well e g the multi regional and trend function model zhang et al 2016b sui et al 2019 the trend function and random field model peng et al 2017 among these models random field models can effectively capture and model the heterogeneous features of soil properties in nature and thus there has been an increasing interest in adopting random field models to characterize heterogeneous soils a number of studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of random field soil properties on the seabed responses for example zhang et al 2016a considered the soil permeability shear modulus and degree of saturation as log normally distributed random fields and input them into fem models to simulate seabed responses zhu et al 2019a performed a reliability analysis to evaluate the stability of submarine slopes using the limit equilibrium method and coupled it with the random field theory to model the spatial variability in seabed strength in the case that soil properties are not independent simulations can be further developed with the cross correlated random field method as in the work of peng et al 2017 however it should be noted that these studies mainly focused on seabeds that have a horizontally deposited fabric pattern that is soil properties show smooth variations in the horizontal direction i e the bedding orientation and rapid variations in the vertical direction in reality soils including seabed sediments can exhibit different fabric patterns after processes such as deposition self weight compaction and wave induced loadings fig 1 shows an example of the layering profile of seabed sediment constructed from multi channel seismic reflection data depending on the correlation structure the deposition profile of a soil field can be classified into six typical classes zhu and zhang 2013 isotropy transverse anisotropy rotated anisotropy general anisotropy general rotated anisotropy and their combinations in addition to transverse anisotropic seabeds analyzed in previous studies rotated anisotropic seabeds are also commonly seen in nature e g in coastal slopes but remain a less explored topic in the context of the random field theory the extent of variations in a soil property along one direction can be characterized by the so called scale of fluctuation sof the directions in which the soil properties show smooth variations are generally quantified with larger sof values and vice versa usually soil fabric in the two dimensional case is directional with two principal directions with the major principal direction having the largest sof and the minor principal direction having the smallest sof for heterogeneous soils with transverse anisotropy the principal directions in the fabric are parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes while for rotated anisotropic heterogeneous soils the principal directions are rotated from the cartesian coordinate axes by a certain angle griffiths et al 2009 were among the first to consider rotated anisotropic heterogeneous soils and investigate their effects on slope stability rotated anisotropic heterogeneous shear strength fields were generated by first generating transverse anisotropic random shear strength fields and then rotating them by the desired angle in addition in a recent work by zhu et al 2019b extensive studies with parametric rotation angles were conducted to investigate how the fabric orientation of anisotropically deposited soil influences the stability and failure mechanism of a slope and to identify the critical fabric orientation that is most unfavorable to slope stability motivated by the pioneering work of griffiths et al 2009 and zhu et al 2019b the objective of this study is to evaluate the hydromechanical responses of seabed pipelines considering rotated anisotropic heterogeneous seabed properties and to identify the critical fabric orientation that is most unfavorable to the seabed and pipeline stability this work builds on the previous effort lai et al 2019 which studied the effects of spatially correlated seabed properties on the characteristic hydromechanical responses of seabed pipeline whereas this work puts an emphasis on the effects of rotated anisotropy in the seabed heterogeneity moreover the nonlinear wave theory is implemented is this study which is better suited to large amplitude waves that are more relevant for seabed liquefaction the remainder of the paper is organized as follows first the methodology and simulation procedures of rotated anisotropic heterogeneous soil using the random field theory are presented in section 2 then with the formulation of the coupled hydromechanical problem of seabed pipeline and the framework of the probabilistic analysis described in section 3 an illustrative example of seabed pipeline is set up and analyzed in section 4 in this example the seabed hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus are considered heterogeneous with rotated anisotropy and their effects on pore pressure liquefaction seabed displacement and pipeline stress are investigated finally concluding remarks are drawn in section 5 based upon the results presented 2 random field seabed properties with rotated anisotropy 2 1 correlation structure of rotated anisotropy as mentioned above soils including seabeds are inherently heterogeneous with material properties showing different values at different locations these values however are usually not completely independent but are spatially correlated with each other the random field theory is an effective tool to model such spatially varying but correlated material properties e g chen et al 2016b a liu et al 2017 leung et al 2018 and shen et al 2019 as a result of colluvium processes topples end tipping construction and other processes the spatial distribution of a soil property could exhibit several typical fabric patterns including isotropy transverse anisotropy rotated anisotropy general anisotropy general rotated anisotropy and their combinations zhu and zhang 2013 therefore a rigorous framework for generating a random field with typical fabric patterns was proposed in zhu and zhang 2013 and is employed in this work for the simulation of heterogeneous seabed properties with preferred bedding orientations within the random field theory a material property at various locations is quantified as a set of random variables each random variable follows a probability distribution and the relation between these random variables is characterized by a correlation function supposing that a random field is stationary the probability distributions are constant for all locations and the correlation function depends only on the separation distance regardless of the exact locations the sof in the correlation function characterizes the extent of the variations between random variables at adjacent locations soil properties exhibit a large sof in the major principal direction and a small sof in the minor principal direction for rotated anisotropic heterogeneous soils the major and minor principal directions are not parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes according to the framework proposed in zhu and zhang 2013 the correlation structure of rotated anisotropy in the two dimensional case can be characterized by an extended elliptical function 1 ρ δ x δ z exp δ x cos β δ z sin β θ 1 2 δ x sin β δ z cos β θ 2 2 where ρ is the correlation between soil properties at two locations with separation distances δ x and δ z in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively parameters θ 1 and θ 2 are the sofs in the major and minor principal directions respectively β is the rotational angle of the major principal direction from the x axis the correlation structure of rotated anisotropy in the three dimensional case can be derived from an extended ellipsoidal function and the interested reader is referred to liu and leung 2018 2 2 simulation procedures with the correlation structure of a soil property random fields of these soil properties could be generated using various algorithms such as the moving average method cressie and pavlicová 2002 the local average subdivision method fenton and vanmarcke 1990 the covariance matrix decomposition method chenari and farahbakhsh 2015 and sequential simulation methods chen et al 2012 wang and chen 2018 in this paper the covariance matrix decomposition method is adopted owing to its simplicity and computational efficiency the simulation procedures are briefly described as follows and the interested reader is referred to davis 1987 and sudret and der kiureghian 2000 for more details step 1 discretize the field into a set of grid points which are analogous to nodes in a finite element mesh and the grid can be structured or unstructured values of random field variables will be calculated at the grid locations step 2 calculate the correlation matrix and perform covariance matrix decomposition the correlation matrix denoted by c consists of components ρ i j which characterize the correlation between random variables at locations i and j respectively in this work the correlation is calculated with eq 1 to reproduce the seabed fabric with rotated anisotropy using the cholesky decomposition method the correlation matrix is decomposed as c l l t where the superscript t indicates the transpose of the matrix step 3 generate a random field of standard normally distributed variables z with reference to the covariance matrix decomposition method a random field of the normalized variable z could be sampled from davis 1987 2 z l u where u is a vector of independent random variables obeying a standard normal distribution step 4 transform the standard normally distributed variables z to a specific distribution for a soil property s that obeys a general normal distribution it can be obtained from a standard normal distribution by first multiplying the standard deviation and then adding the mean such that 3 s μ s z σ s where μ s and σ s are the mean and standard deviation respectively of soil property s and z is the normalized variable for log normally distributed soil properties the transformation is given as 4 s exp μ ln s σ ln s z where μ ln s and σ ln s are the mean and standard deviation respectively of the logarithmic variable s i e ln s such that 5 σ ln s ln 1 σ s μ s 2 6 μ ln s ln μ s 1 2 σ ln s 2 where μ s and σ s are the mean and standard deviation respectively of variable s in case that soil properties obey other distributions such as a weibull distribution weibull 1951 lai et al 2003 the transformation can be approached by performing a normal score mapping chen et al 2012 3 probabilistic hydromechanical analysis of seabed pipelines with heterogeneous seabed properties generated using the random field theory stochastic hydromechanical analysis of seabed pipeline can be performed and the seabed pipeline responses could be analyzed probabilistically a simple seabed pipeline system consists of a porous seabed and an embedded pipeline in this work the coupled hydromechanical fem model previously developed in zhou et al 2014 is adopted for the hydromechanical analysis of seabed pipeline for completeness the model formulation as well as the framework for the probabilistic analysis of seabed pipeline responses is briefly described in this section for the detailed implementation and validation tests of the adopted hydromechanical fem model the interested reader is referred to zhou et al 2014 and lai et al 2019 3 1 formulation of the hydromechanical model the seabed pipeline system is modeled as a plane strain problem by neglecting the deformation along the longitudinal direction of the pipeline elastic constitutive relations are assumed for both the seabed solid skeleton and the pipeline concerning the seabed the final governing equations derived from the balances of mass and linear momentum are written as follows zhou et al 2014 lai et al 2019 k x 2 p x 2 k z 2 p z 2 ϕ f ρ f g β f p t ρ f 2 t 2 k x u x k z w z 7 ρ f g t u x w z 8 p x ρ 2 u t 2 g s 2 u x 2 2 u z 2 1 1 2 ν s g s x u x w z ρ b x 9 p z ρ 2 w t 2 g s 2 w x 2 2 w z 2 1 1 2 ν s g s z u x w z ρ b z where u and w are the horizontal x and vertical z displacements respectively p is the excess pore pressure k x and k z are the seabed hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively g s is the seabed shear modulus ν s is the seabed poisson s ratio ϕ f is the void volume fraction of the seabed ρ f is the intrinsic mass density of the fluid i e seawater in this case ρ is the equivalent density of the seabed and pore fluid g is the gravitational acceleration b x and b z are the x and z components of the body force the parameter β f accounts for both the compressibility of the pore fluid and the degree of saturation of the porous seabed and is given as ülker 2015 liao et al 2018 10 β f 1 k f 1 s r p f 0 where s r is the degree of saturation k f is the bulk modulus of the fluid and p f 0 is the static pore pressure which is calculated as p f 0 p a ρ f g d where p a 10 5 pa is the atmospheric pressure and d is the water depth it should be noted that in the governing eqs 7 8 and 9 the spatial derivative terms of the non homogeneous seabed soil properties e g the hydraulic conductivity k x and k z the shear modulus g s are not involved in the random field approach soil properties are characterized by discrete values the spatial derivatives of a random field property i e discrete values are not well defined and thus are not considered in this study in addition seabed soil in a real offshore environment is often loosely deposited soil with complex nonlinear inelastic and history dependent behavior as the focus of this study is on the effects of rotational anisotropy in seabed properties an elastic constitutive model is adopted for the seabed soil examples of more sophisticated constitutive models of seabed soil can be found in pastor et al 2011 and zhao et al 2016 2017 and will be explored in future work for the pipeline the final governing equations are derived from the balance of linear momentum and are written as 11 ρ p 2 u t 2 g p 2 u x 2 2 u z 2 1 1 2 ν p g p x u x w z ρ p b x 0 12 ρ p 2 w t 2 g p 2 w x 2 2 w z 2 1 1 2 ν p g p z u x w z ρ p b z 0 where g p is the pipeline shear modulus ν p is poisson s ratio of the pipeline and ρ p is the density of the pipeline based on the coupled partial differential equations defined by eqs 7 8 9 11 and 12 the hydromechanical responses of seabed pipeline can be solved in this work comsol multiphysics software with the livelink for matlab interface is adopted to implement and solve the partial differential equations in particular the general form pde interface in comsol is used to customize these partial differential equations the hydromechanical fem model is first set up within comsol desktop and then exported as a matlab script which can be easily integrated with the matlab codes for generating random field seabed properties 3 2 framework of the probabilistic analysis as seabeds are considered heterogeneous probabilistic analysis is utilized to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the seabed pipeline behavior the framework of probabilistic analysis of the seabed pipeline hydromechanical responses consists of three main components 1 with the statistics i e the mean variance and scale of fluctuation of a seabed property heterogeneous property fields are generated using the random field theory 2 the hydromechanical fem model of seabed pipeline is set up with the generated random field seabed properties taken as the input and the seabed pipeline responses are solved and analyzed and 3 with the aid of monte carlo simulation mcs the seabed pipeline responses are solved repeatedly with different realizations of random field seabed properties the matrices of interest e g the excess pore pressure liquefaction zone pipeline displacements or stress are analyzed statistically it should be noted that in component 2 the hydromechanical fem model requires the seabed properties at the locations of gaussian points of each element to integrate the random field seabed properties into the fem model one option is to directly simulate the seabed properties at the gaussian points as in lai et al 2019 another option is to first simulate the seabed properties at a set of grid points that cover the entire seabed domain and then interpolate the seabed properties at the gaussian points using algorithms such as the nearest neighbor interpolation or linear interpolation the second option is simple to implement and efficient for fem models with a large number of nodes in this work the second option with linear interpolation is adopted 4 numerical examples to investigate the effects of heterogeneous seabed properties with rotated anisotropy on seabed pipeline behavior an example of a rectangle seabed with an embedded circular cross section pipeline is studied in this section this example has previously been studied in lai et al 2019 where the effects of spatially correlated seabed properties on the characteristic hydromechanical responses of seabed pipeline including parametric studies of the random field parameters e g coefficient of variation cov and scale of fluctuation sof have been analyzed as an extension of that study this work further analyzes the effects of rotated anisotropy on the seabed properties 4 1 model set up 4 1 1 geometries and boundary conditions the seabed as shown in fig 2 is 100 m wide and 30 m deep the pipeline is buried 2 m below the seabed surface with a diameter of 1 m and a thickness of 0 05 m with regard to the boundary conditions of the seabed for the solid phase with respect to the degree of freedom u and w the bottom of the seabed is fixed with no displacements the lateral sides are constrained with rollers i e no horizontal displacements and the top surface is free for the fluid phase with respect to the degree of freedom p both the seabed bottom and lateral sides are specified with no flux while the seabed surface is subject to dynamic wave pressure in this work the wave pressure p b t is approximated by a

u 0 λ the wave induced loading on the seabed skeleton is rather complicated due to the changeable interactions between the wave and seabed and is ignored in this work for simplicity in fact the wave induced loadings on the seabed skeleton decreases as the depth to seabed increases yamamoto and suzuki 1980 with regard to the boundary conditions of the pipeline its inner circumferential face is free and its outer circumferential face is assumed to be perfectly bonded with the seabed i e the seabed and the pipeline have the same displacements and the same stresses at the seabed pipeline interface no body force including the gravity is considered in the fem simulations and thus the seabed pipeline responses represent the net effects that are induced by the dynamics wave pressure this is acceptable for elastic seabed however it should be noted that the gravity would affect the seabed pipeline responses and thus should be taken into consideration if an elastoplastic soil model is adopted 4 1 2 model parameters input parameters for the example seabed pipeline problem are listed in table 1 it should be noted that the adopted wave parameters correspond to a fairly large wave representing a fairly extreme environment that may be encountered by the seabed pipeline system nevertheless based on the review in maâtoug and ayadi 2016 the adopted wave parameters are within the applicability range of the adopted third order stokes solution i e eq 13 also no current is considered in the waves the total simulation time is set to 16 s so that the seabed pipeline responses after two complete waves can be captured the seabed hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus are spatially correlated variables with rotated anisotropy and are generated by following the random field simulation procedures presented in section 2 in this work the statistical characteristics i e the mean cov and sof of a seabed soil property are chosen based on typical ranges recommended in previous research in the literature specifically rehfeldt et al 1992 suggested that the vertical sof of hydraulic conductivity is in 0 8 1 6 m and the horizontal sof is in 4 8 12 8 m jiang et al 2014 recommended that the vertical sof of shear modulus is in 0 5 3 0 m and the horizontal sof is in 10 40 m while researches on the statistical characteristics of seabed soil properties are relatively limited the interested reader is referred to zhang et al 2016a and lai et al 2019 for a brief review results of the parametric studies on the cov and sof have also been reported in lai et al 2019 in this example both the hydraulic conductivity and the shear modulus are assumed to obey log normal distributions the hydraulic conductivity has a mean value of 5 0 10 4 m s and a cov of 2 5 and the mean and cov for the shear modulus are 10 mpa and 0 45 respectively the sofs are assumed to be 20 m in the major principal direction and 1 m in the minor principal direction for the rotation angle β a parametric set of values ranging from 0 to 90 half of 180 due to symmetry is considered which is sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of rotated anisotropy on seabed pipeline behavior it is worth noting that in offshore practices the trenching and backfilling may be involved and can disturb the soil around a buried pipe significantly the trenching and backfilling are not considered in this work 4 1 3 simulation scenarios three sets of simulations are considered i a probabilistic case in which the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be heterogeneous and the shear modulus is homogeneous ii a probabilistic case in which the shear modulus is heterogeneous and the hydraulic conductivity is homogeneous and iii a deterministic case in which both the seabed hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus are homogeneous the deterministic case is used for comparison regarding the probabilistic cases the seabed pipeline problem is solved repeatedly for 500 times with 500 different realizations of the random fields it should be noted that in reality both the hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus could be heterogeneous with cross correlations in between zhang et al 2016a peng et al 2017 in this example the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity and of the shear modulus is not incorporated concurrently so that the effects of rotated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus can be investigated independently 4 2 effects of rotated anisotropic hydraulic conductivity field the probabilistic case in which only the hydraulic conductivity is heterogeneous is studied in this section following the random field simulation procedures provided in section 2 and based on the statistics described in the previous section rotated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields are generated first to generate these fields the domain is discretized into a number of 200 60 x by z elements with each element having a length of 0 5 m therefore one heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field would consist of 200 60 values it is worth noting that there is a relationship that sof and the element length of a random field mesh should be satisfied to achieve an acceptable discretization accuracy previous research e g sudret and der kiureghian 2000 allaix and carbone 2009 has suggested that the element length is between 1 4 1 2 of sof typical realizations of the random hydraulic conductivity fields with different rotation angles are shown in fig 3 as the random fields are given distinct sof values in the major and minor principal directions i e 20 m and 1 m respectively the generated hydraulic conductivity fields exhibit clear layered profiles as expected in addition the bedding orientations of these hydraulic conductivity fields are consistent with the desired rotation angles although the hydraulic conductivity is taken as identical in the x and z directions the anisotropy exists as a result of different sof values in the major and minor principal directions and the spatially averaging effects with the generated random hydraulic conductivity fields taken as input the coupled hydromechanical problem is solved and the seabed pipeline responses are analyzed probabilistically of particular interest the results of 1 pore pressure and liquefaction 2 seabed displacements and 3 pipeline stresses are presented in the following it should be noted that the mesh used in the fem is not necessary to be the same as the mesh used in random field generation in this example the mesh in the fem consists of triangular elements with dense elements within the vicinity of the pipeline 4 2 1 pore pressure and liquefaction first the pore pressure and liquefaction situations of the seabed are analyzed fig 4 shows the contours of the normalized excess pore pressure fields at time t 3 s for the cases of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields with different rotation angles note that unless otherwise noted the contours presented in the following represent the results of one typical mcs which corresponds to the random field realizations previously shown in fig 3 at this particular time i e t 3 s the pipeline is close to a wave trough a situation in which the seabed soil around the pipeline would have a high potential to liquefy as will be illustrated later the excess pore pressure is normalized with respect to the amplitude of the wave induced pressure so that one can obtain a more direct sense of the pore pressure build up and dissipation situations in the seabed overall the excess pore pressure fields in these four cases i e β 0 30 60 and 90 exhibit similar patterns the region under the wave troughs experiences negative excess pore pressure while the region under wave crests experiences positive values the magnitudes of the excess pore pressure peak near the seabed surface and decrease quickly with depth to gain a quantitative insight into the effects of rotated anisotropy on pore pressure the excess pore pressure along a vertical cutline x 0 m and z from 30 m to 0 m is probed at this time the results of the 500 mcss are analyzed altogether fig 5 plots the 90 confidence interval of the normalized excess pore pressure together with the results of the deterministic case and of one mcs at time t 3 s for all the rotation angles the normalized excess pore pressure in magnitude decreases quickly from approximately 0 5 to 0 07 with depth going from 0 m to 2 5 m i e the depth of the bottom of the pipeline and the excess pore pressure varies mildly below this depth the uncertainty in the excess pore pressure which is due to soil heterogeneity increases with depth and then vanishes at a depth below the pipeline with the results of pore pressure the liquefaction state at every location of the seabed can be evaluated in this work the transient liquefaction criterion is adopted as follows zen and yamazaki 1990 ye 2012 peng et al 2017 17 ρ ρ f g z p b x t p x z t 0 where p b x t is the dynamic wave pressure defined in eq 13 and p x z t is the excess pore pressure at the location x z and time t if criterion 17 is met the seabed is considered liquefied it should be noted that the liquefaction criterion 17 is an indirect criterion by assuming constant total stress in the seabed soil the total stress in seabed soil could change due to the complex soil and structure interaction effect which has been studied in ye and wang 2015 2016 moreover using a case study of a poroelastic seabed and the analytical solution for wave induced excess pore pressure qi and gao 2018 showed that the pore pressure based liquefaction criterion could lead to an unrealistic upward resultant force which leads to tensile stresses in liquefied non cohesive soil layer zhou et al 2020 these two aspects are not considered in this work it should also be noted that the installation process as well as the structure weight of the pipeline may also have an influence on the material properties and effective stresses of the surrounding seabed and thus affect the liquefaction depth of the seabed sui et al 2017 in this work the effects of stress changes in the seabed due to the installation and structure weight of the pipeline are not considered contours of the liquefaction fields at time t 3 s are shown in fig 6 at this particular time the seabed soils above the pipeline are liquefied the liquefaction zone is limited within the seabed surface vicinity with depth as deep as approximately 2 m and a width of approximately 40 m the boundary of the liquefaction zone shows some winding details e g figs 6b and 6c which might be a result of the soil heterogeneity effects besides that there is no observable patterns in the liquefaction profiles with the increase of rotation angle further investigations on liquefaction will be made based on the results of the mcss based on the results of the mcss the probability of liquefaction at every location of the seabed is evaluated the contour maps of the liquefaction probability during a complete wave period are depicted in fig 7 in this case only the results near the pipeline are shown to get a better view of the seabed response around the pipeline the contour maps are obtained as follows first a grid of points that overlap the entire seabed is created then following the criterion defined in eq 17 the liquefaction state at every grid point in every mcs is evaluated the liquefaction state is denoted as yes if the location could liquefy anytime with the progressive of wave lastly the probability of liquefaction at each grid point is obtained by counting the total number of liquefactions at this point based on the results of all 500 mcss and the contour maps are plotted with an increase in the rotation angle the area of the region with a 95 probability of liquefaction i e the area enclosed by the 95 contour decreases there are fairly significant winding details in the liquefaction profiles when rotation angles are small e g β 0 and 30 indicating a more complex liquefaction situation in these cases as a qualitative analysis of the liquefaction situations the area of the liquefied region at a particular time in each mcs is calculated it is worth noting that due to the heterogeneity of the seabed properties the liquefaction profile as well as the liquefaction depth may vary as the wave progresses thus in this work the liquefied area is chosen as the indicator of the seabed response and is analyzed to gain insights into the liquefaction situation around the pipeline fig 8 plots the statistical results of the liquefied area at time t 3 s based on the results of all 500 mcss as a comparison the liquefied area for the deterministic case is also plotted the mean liquefied area of the probabilistic cases is considerably larger by approximately 11 16 than the liquefied area of the deterministic case and it decreases slightly with the increase of rotation angle the uncertainty in the liquefied area decreases with increasing rotation angle which can be identified by observing the heights of the boxes and the heights of the whiskers in the boxplots the distributions of the liquefied area are skewed to the upper side with a considered number of outliers i e the cases out of the 99 3 probability on the lower side this phenomenon indicates that situations with small liquefied area values are less likely to occur as the design of seabed pipelines is generally referring to the most dangerous cases i e the upper bounds of the liquefied area in this example the results in fig 8 indicate that the liquefaction situation of seabed pipeline would get less severe with increasing rotation angles the upper bound of liquefied area decreases by approximately 15 with the rotation angle increasing from 0 to 90 4 2 2 seabed displacements next the seabed displacements are analyzed figs 9 and 10 present the horizontal and vertical displacements of the seabed at time t 3 s for the cases of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields with different rotation angles the horizontal displacement fields are presented with negative values on the right half and positive values on the left side on either side the horizontal displacement magnitudes peak in the central area and diminish towards the boundary the vertical displacement fields show positive values under the wave troughs and negative values under the wave crests the magnitude of the vertical displacement is largest at the seabed surface and diminishes with depth the rotated anisotropy has no noticeable impact on the distribution patterns of the seabed displacements to quantitatively investigate the effects of rotated anisotropy on seabed displacements the displacements at a location right above the top of the pipeline with coordinates x 0 m and z 1 5 m are probed fig 11 plots the maximum displacements at this location during one complete wave period for the cases of different rotation angles for the horizontal displacement the mean value of the probabilistic cases is smaller by approximately 1 though than the value of the deterministic case and the variation is small with increasing rotation angle the variation of the displacement uncertainty is also relatively small for different rotation angles regarding the vertical displacement the mean value is greater by approximately 1 than the value of the deterministic case and it decreases slightly with the rotation angle the uncertainty first slightly increases and then decreases with increasing rotation angle for both the horizontal and vertical displacements the variations in the upper bounds i e the 99 3 upper whiskers with increasing rotation angles are fairly small less than 2 4 2 3 pipeline stresses the stresses in the pipeline due to waves are important matrices for the engineering design of pipelines fig 12 shows the contours of the von mises stress fields in the pipeline for the cases of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity with different rotation angles overall the distributions of the von mises stress for different rotation angles are similar the top bottom left and right parts of the pipeline are subject to high von mises stresses with the results of the von mises stresses the maximum von mises stresses experienced by the pipeline during one complete wave period are calculated fig 13 shows the relation between the maximum von mises stress and the rotation angle for all the rotation angles the mean of the maximum von mises stress is slightly greater less than 2 than the maximum von mises stress of the deterministic case and it decreases with increasing rotation angle the uncertainty in terms of cov decreases slightly with increasing rotation angle together with the results of liquefaction and seabed displacements it is found that the seabed pipeline responses would get slightly better with increasing rotated anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity fields and the transverse anisotropy i e rotation angle β 0 is a most unfavorable situation 4 3 effects of rotated anisotropic shear modulus field similar to the analysis regarding the rotated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity performed in the previous section this section reports the results of the rotated anisotropic heterogeneous shear modulus based on the statistics described in section 4 1 heterogeneous shear modulus fields with different rotation angles are generated and typical realizations are presented in fig 14 these shear modulus fields show clear layered profiles with bedding orientations aligned with the specified rotation angles 4 3 1 pore pressure and liquefaction corresponding to the realizations of shear modulus fields shown in fig 14 the results of the excess pore pressure fields at time t 3 s are presented in fig 15 similar to the hydraulic conductivity cases the areas with large magnitudes of excess pore pressure are concentrated within approximately 2 5 m below the seabed top surface the excess pore pressure fields for the cases of different rotation angles exhibit similar patterns indicating that the rotated anisotropy would not make a significant difference in the pore pressure distribution profiles fig 16 shows the probabilistic results of the excess pore pressure along the vertical cutline x 0 m based on the 500 mcss for all the rotation angles the excess pore pressure diminishes quickly within the top 2 5 m of the seabed and then varies slowly below this depth with the increase in the rotation angle the uncertainty in the excess pore pressure at a particular depth decreases when the rotation angle increases to 90 i e the bedding orientation becomes vertically aligned the uncertainty becomes relatively insignificant and the excess pore pressure of the heterogeneous cases almost coincides with that of the homogeneous case fig 17 shows the contours of the liquefaction fields at time t 3 s for different rotation angles again at this particular time the liquefaction zone concentrates in the top middle region of the seabed that surrounds the pipeline the liquefaction zones for all four rotation angles exhibit similar profiles with the boundaries smoother than those of the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity cases comparing with the results shown in fig 6 the probabilistic results of the liquefaction zone for a complete wave period are depicted in fig 18 with the increase in rotation angle the area of the region where the liquefaction state is uncertain with a probability between 5 and 95 decreases slightly this phenomenon is consistent with observations made from the results of excess pore pressure fig 15 as expected from relation eq 17 that the uncertainty in the excess pore pressure diminishes with increasing rotation angle fig 19 shows the relation between the liquefied area and the rotation angles at time t 3 s in all cases the mean of the liquefied area of the probabilistic case is smaller than the liquefied area of the deterministic case with an increase in the rotation angle the mean of the liquefied area increases and approaches asymptotically towards the value of the deterministic case regarding the uncertainty in the liquefied area there is a clear trend that the uncertainty decreases with increasing rotation angle the cov decreases from approximately 0 11 to 0 04 with the rotation angle increasing from 0 to 90 for the upper bound of the liquefied area it decreases by approximately 8 with the rotation angle increase from 0 to 30 and then show less significant variations with the rotation angle increase from 30 to 90 4 3 2 seabed displacements figs 20 and 21 present the horizontal and vertical displacement fields respectively of the seabed for different rotation angles in all cases the horizontal and vertical displacement fields exhibit almost the same profiles the mcs results of the maximum displacements right at the top of the pipeline during one complete wave period are plotted in fig 22 for both the horizontal and vertical displacements their mean values are overall greater by approximately 10 on average than the results of the deterministic case there is a trend that the mean values of the horizontal and vertical displacements respectively first slightly increase and then decrease with the increase of rotation angle the uncertainty in the horizontal and vertical displacements due to heterogeneous shear modulus is significantly larger than that due to heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity comparing fig 22 with fig 11 the cov of the horizontal displacement decreases by approximately 25 with the rotation angle increasing from 0 to 90 while the cov of the vertical displacement varies within 10 for different rotation angles 4 3 3 pipeline stresses fig 23 shows the contours of the pipeline von mises stress field at time t 3 s the results indicate that the rotated anisotropy in the shear modulus does not impact the distribution patterns of the von mises stress fields in the pipeline the maximum von mises stress in the pipeline during one complete wave period for the cases of different rotation angles are shown in fig 24 overall the mean of the maximum von mises stress of the probabilistic cases are all fairly close to the maximum von mises stress of the deterministic case the uncertainties in the maximum von mises stresses of the heterogeneous shear modulus cases are significantly greater than those of the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity cases by comparing with the results of the hydraulic conductivity cases shown in fig 13 with an increase in the rotation angle the uncertainty first decreases and then increases the uncertainty in the maximum von mises stress is minimal when the rotation angle is approximately 45 the upper bound of the maximum von mises stresses with the rotation angle at 45 would be as much as 20 less than that with the rotation angle at 0 or 90 together with the results of liquefaction and seabed displacements it is found that the overall seabed pipeline responses would get slightly better with increasing rotated anisotropy in the shear modulus field the transverse anisotropy is the most unfavorable situation and the rotated anisotropy with rotation angle at about 45 is the most favorable one 5 conclusion in this work a probabilistic analysis on seabed pipelines is performed to investigate the effects of rotated anisotropy in seabed properties on the hydromechanical responses of seabed pipelines under dynamic wave induced loadings random field hydraulic conductivity and shear moduli with different rotation angles are generated and imported into the hydromechanical fem model with which the seabed pipeline responses are solved based on the results of mcss the pore pressure liquefaction seabed displacement and pipeline von mises stresses are analyzed in a probabilistic fashion the main findings of this work are as follows 1 the overall distribution profiles of the pore pressure liquefaction seabed displacement and pipeline von mises stresses are not affected much by the heterogeneity of and rotated anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus the effects of rotated anisotropic heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus could be reflected by the analyzed quantitative matrices 2 based on mcs the mean of and the uncertainty in the liquefied areas decrease noticeably with the increasing rotated anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity for shear modulus the mean first decreases and then increases but the uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing rotated anisotropy in terms of the upper bounds of the liquefied area referring to the most dangerous case for engineering design the variations due to the rotated anisotropy effects could be as much as 15 for hydraulic conductivity and 8 for shear modulus 3 the variations in seabed displacements due to the increasing rotated anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity are relatively small and they are within 2 in terms of the upper bounds of the seabed displacements with increasing rotated anisotropy in shear modulus the mean of the seabed displacements first increases and then decreases with the inflection point at about 45 the cov in the horizontal displacement decreases by approximately 25 with increasing rotation angle while it varies within 10 for the vertical displacement 4 for hydraulic conductivity both the mean of and the uncertainty in the maximum von mises stresses in the pipeline decrease by less than 2 though with the increasing rotated anisotropy as to shear modulus the mean slightly increases while the uncertainty first decreases and then increases with increasing rotated anisotropy the variations in the upper bounds for different rotation angles could be as much as 20 and the upper bound is minimal when the rotation angle is approximately 45 5 overall the transverse anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity or shear modulus is the most unfavorable situation the seabed pipeline behavior generally gets better with the increase of rotated anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity and for shear modulus it gets better with the rotation angle changing from 0 or 90 to 45 i e 45 is a most favorable situation if the rotated anisotropy of a seabed property is unknown in a field project the analysis with transverse anisotropy could be relied upon for conservative design lastly it is noted that the influence of the degree of saturation on the seabed pipeline may be comparable to the hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus hsu and jeng 1994 jeng 2012 additional simulations with different extents of rotated anisotropy in the degree of saturation are also conducted while the results are not presented herein it is found that with adopted parameters of degree of saturation i e random field degree of saturation in the range of 0 96 0 99 the effects of rotated anisotropy in degree of saturation on the seabed pipeline responses are fairly small and similar to the conclusions of the hydraulic conductivity and shear modulus cases the transverse anisotropy in degree of saturation is also the most unfavorable situation credit authorship contribution statement zhengshou lai conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft qiushi chen

20562,the july 2020 mw7 8 alaska tsunamigenic earthquake was a fresh call for potential large tsunamis associated with the aleutian subduction zone the second largest ever recorded earthquake worldwide mw 9 2 occurred in this zone in 1964 indicating its massive earthquake and tsunami risk our analysis of the july 2020 tsunami revealed that it involves very long period waves 51 64 min which is unusual for an mw7 8 earthquake the tsunami coastal amplitude was small 0 5 m which is much smaller than that usually expected from a tsunamigenic earthquake of this size here through numerical simulations and spectral analyses we explain the ultra long period and small amplitude waves of the tsunami our analysis using an analytical equation showed that the ultra long period of the tsunami 51 64 min can be reproduced using the shallow water depth around the source region 100 200 m and the length of the coseismic deformation area 100 km by comparing the coastal amplitude of this event with four other similar size and similar mechanism earthquakes thrust mw7 8 we attribute the relatively small coastal amplitude of this tsunami to the deep focal depth of the earthquake 28 km and the extremely shallow water around the source region keywords tsunami earthquake pacific ocean alaska aleutian subduction zone numerical simulations 1 introduction offshore alaska was the site of a large mw7 8 earthquake on july 22 2020 which was followed by a small tsunami with a coastal runup of around half a meter fig 1 the united states geological survey usgs located the earthquake at 158 554 w and 55 068 n at the depth of 28 0 km with an origin time of 06 12 44 utc the earthquake was of dominant thrust mechanism with usgs focal parameters of strike angle 232 dip angle 20 and rake angle 73 according to media reports this offshore earthquake did not make significant damage although the shaking was felt across most of the alaska peninsula a tsunami warning was issued by the us tsunami warning system https www tsunami gov following the earthquake however the warning was called off after confirming that the tsunami height was minimal based on the tsunami records on offshore deep ocean assessment and reporting of tsunamis dart devices the dart systems recorded maximum zero to crest amplitudes of less than 1 cm while the nearby coastal tide gauges registered tsunami amplitude of less than 30 cm fig 2 the july 2020 mw7 8 tsunamigenic earthquake was generated in the aleutian subduction zone where the pacific plate is subducting beneath the north american plate at the rate of 5 5 6 0 cm yr li et al 2016 the aleutian subduction zone was responsible for the second largest instrumentally recorded earthquake worldwide the march 1964 mw9 2 alaska earthquake plafker et al 1969 fig 1 based on the usgs earthquake catalogue at least 16 m 7 8 earthquakes were recorded in this zone since 1900 among which the two most notable events are the 1946 mw8 6 and 1964 mw9 2 events fig 1 orange circles the 1946 aleutian tsunami produced 42 m runup and caused five deaths in the near field combined with a runup of 16 m and 159 deaths in the far field i e hawaii lopez and okal 2006 okal et al 2002 johnson and satake 1997 the 1964 alaska tsunami has been reported to have killed 130 people clague et al 1994 and caused extensive damage numerous submarine landslides were reported following the 1964 alaska earthquake which further intensified the damaging impacts of the event by triggering local landslide tsunamis haeussler et al 2014 the objective of this research is to understand the sea level characteristics of the july 2020 alaska tsunami in particular there are two unusual signatures in the sea level data of the 2020 tsunami which motivated this research i the tsunami has a very long period of 60 min fig 2 which is unusual for a tsunami from an mw7 8 earthquake ii the tsunami s coastal amplitude is significantly smaller than those normally generated by an mw7 8 offshore earthquake for comparison a similar magnitude mw7 8 and similar mechanism thrust earthquake at the depth of 15 1 km in kaikoura new zealand generated a tsunami with period of 15 20 min and coastal runup of up to 7 m power et al 2017 heidarzadeh et al 2019 we note that the focal depth of the kaikoura event 15 1 km was shallower than that of the alaska event 28 0 km here we apply sea level data analysis and numerical modeling of tsunami propagation to study the 2020 alaska tsunami and to explain the above two unusual characteristics of the tsunami the innovation of this study is that for the first time we apply analytical equations and numerical simulations to explain the unusual tsunami waves generated by an mw7 8 earthquake 2 data and methods our data comprises sea level records of the tsunami ocean bathymetry and the earthquake fault parameters sea level records are from tide gauge stations in sand point and dutch harbor as well as seven darts fig 2 the sampling interval for all sea level data is 1 min both tide gauge and dart records belong to the national ocean service of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the initial part of the dart data includes under sampled seismic waves which are called here as seismic noise fig 2 although they are not useful for tsunami characterization an et al 2017 demonstrated that they can be helpful for estimating earthquake parameters the least squares method of grinsted 2008 was employed to estimate the tidal signals and to remove them from the original sea level records the bathymetry data comes from the general bathymetric charts of the oceans gebco 2020 digital grid atlas ioc et al 2003 weatherall et al 2015 which has a spatial resolution of 15 arc sec the fault parameters of the july 2020 alaska earthquake is provided by the usgs https earthquake usgs gov earthquakes eventpage us7000asvb finite fault which is in the form of a finite fault model with 345 subfaults of size 10 km 10 km the strike and dip angles of the subfaults were fixed at 232 and 20 respectively their depths were varied in the range of 6 1 54 0 km and the slip on the subfaults was up to 3 7 m the usgs source model is obtained through inversion of worldwide seismic observations of the earthquake here we applied a trial and error approach to adjust the length width and slip of the usgs model in order to reproduce tsunami observations our method is a combination of sea level data analysis and numerical modeling fourier transform and wavelet frequency time analyses were performed on the sea level data for fourier transform the welch algorithm welch 1967 mathworks 2020 was applied considering half window overlaps and hanning windows heidarzadeh et al 2017a the fourier analysis was conducted for both tsunami and the background signal i e part of the waveform before tsunami arrival at each sea level station in order to identify main tsunami energy channels the lengths of the tsunami and background waveforms used for spectral analyses were 150 200 min and 120 150 min respectively for wavelet analysis we used the wavelet package of torrence and compo 1998 considering the morlet mother function with a wavenumber of 6 and a scale width of 0 10 heidarzadeh et al 2020 we employed a well validated tsunami simulation package called jagurs baba et al 2015 to simulate tsunami propagation and coastal amplification we solved shallow water equations on a three level nested grid system with grid sizes of 180 arc sec 60 arc sec and 20 arc sec from the largest domain far from the coast to the smallest domain around the coast respectively fig 5 a among a few numerical packages available for tsunami modeling jagurs is favored due to its nesting grid capability and its flexibility for both serial and parallel computations we run the tsunami for a total simulation time of 9 h with time step of 1 0 s to satisfy the stability condition of the numerical scheme courant et al 1928 heidarzadeh et al 2009 to calculate coseismic crustal deformation due to the earthquake the analytical dislocation modeling approach of okada 1985 was applied an instantaneous coseismic deformation is assumed which implies that the initial sea surface displacement is the same as the crustal deformation this is the common practice for modeling tsunamis generated by earthquakes because the speed of tsunami wave propagation is approximately hundred times lower than the speed of seismic waves e g satake 1987 3 tsunami waveforms and spectral analysis deep ocean and coastal records of the alaska tsunami measured on darts and tide gauges respectively are shown in fig 2 and their characteristics are listed in table 1 the deep ocean zero to crest amplitudes are 0 3 1 0 cm with an average of 0 6 cm whereas the coastal amplitudes are 5 7 24 0 cm averaging 14 9 cm table 1 the tsunami amplitudes decay rapidly on darts while large amplitude waves persist for at least 5 h on two coastal records in sand point and dutch harbor fig 2 longer duration of tsunami waves on coastal tide gauges is attributed to various coastal and shelf features such as reflections resonance of the wave inside harbors as well as trapped edge waves e g saito et al 2014 heidarzadeh satake 2014 satake et al 2020 fourier analysis fig 3 color spectra and comparison with background spectra fig 3 black spectra revealed that the dominant tsunami period is 51 64 min it is noted that the tsunami dominant period is influenced by the azimuthal angle of the dart station from the epicenter we performed fourier analysis only for dart records because they are mostly free from various coastal and shelf features and thus carry mainly tsunami source features e g rabinovich 1997 wavelet plots demonstrate the temporal changes of the tsunami dominant periods at three darts fig 4 it can be seen that the dominant periods of 51 64 min are the main signal available in the dart waveforms we note that the strong signal at the period of 2 7 min in the wavelet plots belong to the under sampled seismic noise of the earthquake recorded on the darts and thus they do not represent the tsunami the short duration 2 h of the energetic tsunami waves on darts is also confirmed on wavelet plots fig 4 4 numerical simulations and validation the purpose of numerical modeling was to confirm the coseismic tsunami source of the july 2020 event and to validate it through dart and tide gauge observation we use the validated source model for further analyses in the next sections the results of tsunami simulation using the usgs source model is shown in fig 5d blue waveforms indicating that the simulated waveforms arrive 10 20 min earlier than the observations in some stations therefore it is necessary to further adjust the tsunami source the main reason for lack of a perfect match between simulations and observation is that the usgs source model is obtained through the inversion of only seismic observations of the earthquake therefore it is natural that such a model does not give a perfect match for tsunami observations although it yields better results for seismic waveforms e g yokota et al 2011 satake and heidarzadeh 2017 it has been noted by several authors that a more accurate tsunami source can be achieved by a joint seismic tsunami inversion e g gusman et al 2015 inspired by the usgs source model we considered a rectangular source model with uniform slip to achieve a better match between observations and simulations through a trial and error approach first the fault length and width are assumed as 110 km and 70 km respectively then the uniform slip of 1 7 m is calculated based on a depth dependent earth rigidity of 4 3 1010 n m2 proposed by sallarès and ranero 2019 similar scaling laws are proposed by an et al 2018 other fault parameters such as strike angle 232 dip angle 20 rake angle 73 and depth 28 km are taken from the usgs model this model is called as uniform fault here in fact our uniform fault is a simplified but improved version of the usgs fault model which is improved through tsunami observations the coseismic crustal deformation due to the usgs and our uniform fault models are given in fig 5b and c respectively the tsunami simulations using our uniform fault model produces good agreement between observation and simulation waveforms fig 5d red waveforms the simulated waves using the usgs model fig 5d blue waveforms arrive earlier and have shorter wave periods whereas those using our uniform fault model match the observation well snapshots of tsunami propagation fig 6 a reveal that tsunami arrives in west canada hawaii and west us within 2 5 h plot of maximum tsunami amplitudes during the entire tsunami simulations fig 6b indicates that most of the far field tsunami amplitudes are directed towards west canada and west usa it is long known that tsunami energy travels along normal direction to the fault orientation in the far field ben menahem and rosenman 1972 okal 1988 synolakis and bernard 2006 given the strike angle of 232 for the 2020 alaska earthquake direction ne sw fig 5b and c the normal direction to the strike angle is 142 which is direction nw se towards west canada and west usa 5 the ultra long period waves of the 2020 alaska tsunami the tsunami waveforms and spectra of the july 2020 alaska event mw7 8 are compared with those of the march 2011 japan event mw9 0 at three dart stations fig 7 despite the much smaller magnitude of the alaska event compared to the 2011 japan earthquake the dominant period of the 2020 alaska tsunami 51 64 min is much longer than the dominant period of the 2011 japan event 20 26 min traditionally it has been thought that the larger the magnitude of the earthquake the longer its tsunami period would be however this is not the case for the 2020 alaska tsunami we attribute the ultra long period of the 2020 alaska tsunami to the rather shallow water depth of the source region depth 100 200 m fig 8 b the dominant period of a tsunami t can be approximated using the length of the main coseismic crustal deformation l and the water depth d at the epicentral area applying the following equation heidarzadeh and satake 2015 1 t 2 l g d where g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 we note that tsunami energy usually occurs over a period band rather than a single period because of the heterogeneous shape and non instantaneous occurrence of coseismic crustal deformation equation 1 gives the dominant tsunami period using the length of the largest deformation area rather than the whole period band for the 2020 alaska tsunami the length of the crustal deformation is 80 100 km at the water depth of 100 200 m based on our validated source model figs 5c and 8b for the 2011 japan tsunami the respective values are 80 120 km and 3000 6000 m fig 8a while the total length of the 2011 event s crustal deformation is 200 km we consider only the length of the largest deformation area as we mainly concern about the dominant tsunami period in this study using such input parameters equation 1 results in dominant period of 17 20 min for the 2011 japan event figs 8c and 60 75 min for the 2020 alaska tsunami fig 8d these values are consistent with real tsunami dominant periods obtained through fourier analysis of tsunami observations for the two events fig 7b therefore our analytical study applying equation 1 explains that the ultra long period of the 2020 alaska tsunami is attributed to the generation of the tsunami in extreme shallow water depth of 100 200 m of the continental shelf 6 the small coastal amplitude of the july 2020 alaska tsunami the coastal amplitudes of the 2020 alaska tsunami were much smaller than other tsunamis generated by similar magnitude and similar mechanism earthquakes for comparison the 2016 kaikoura new zealand and 2012 haida gwaii canada tsunamis were both generated by mw7 8 thrust earthquakes which generated maximum coastal runup of 6 m power et al 2017 heidarzadeh et al 2019 and 13 m gusman et al 2016 respectively we note that the 2020 alaska earthquake occurred at the depth of 28 km while the depths of the 2016 kaikoura and 2012 haida gwaii events were 15 km and 14 km respectively in general several factors may influence coastal amplitude of a tsunami including amplitude of coseismic crustal deformation at the tsunami source or magnitude of the earthquake focal depth of the earthquake fd water depth at the source area d 0 bathymetric features along the tsunami propagation path that may cause several natural interferences such as reflection of the waves potential harbor resonance and edge waves e g raichlen and lee 1991 synolakis 2003 yalciner and pelinovsky 2007 heidarzadeh et al 2009 shimozono et al 2012 saito et al 2014 precise analysis of these effects normally requires numerous numerical simulations which is beyond the scope of this study here we focus on two of the above mentioned factors water depth at the source region and earthquake focal depth the effect of water depth at the source region d 0 on the coastal amplitude of a tsunami η can be explained by green s law sorensen 2010 2 η η 0 d 0 d 1 4 where d is water depth at the coast and η 0 is amplitude of coseismic crustal deformation by assuming constant water depth at the coast d equation 2 indicates that the deeper the water depth at the source area d 0 the larger the coastal amplitude of a tsunami η would be regarding earthquake focal depth fd it is widely known that deeper earthquakes generate smaller tsunamis and vice versa e g synolakis 2003 satake 2014 to quantitatively study the effects of earthquake focal depth fd and water depth at the source region d 0 on coastal amplitude of tsunamis we compare these two parameters for five mw7 8 thrust events fig 9 these events and the respective references are 2006 java fujii and satake 2006 2012 haida gwaii gusman et al 2016 leonard and bednarski 2014 2016 kaikoura power et al 2017 heidarzadeh and satake 2017 and 2016 ecuador heidarzadeh et al 2017b fig 9 indicates that for similar size and similar mechanism earthquakes coastal tsunami height or runup is directly correlated with d 0 fig 9b but is inversely related to focal depth fd fig 9c therefore the small coastal amplitude of the 2020 alaska tsunami can be explained by the relatively deep focal depth of the earthquake fd 28 km and the extremely shallow water depth around the source region d 0 100 200 m 7 conclusions the tsunami generated by july 2020 mw7 8 thrust earthquake was unusual in two ways i the period of the tsunami was very long 51 64 min and ii its coastal amplitude was small 0 5 m this study was motivated to explain these peculiar characteristics of the 2020 tsunami here we applied waveform analysis and numerical simulations and achieved the following conclusions the deep ocean zero to crest amplitude of the tsunami was 0 3 1 0 cm average 0 6 cm whereas the coastal amplitude recorded on tide gauges was 5 7 24 0 cm average 14 9 cm tsunami period from this mw7 8 earthquake was 51 64 min which is much longer than that generated by the 2011 mw9 0 japan earthquake 20 26 min we proposed a source model for this tsunami comprising length and width of 110 km and 70 km respectively with uniform slip of 1 7 m this source model is located at the water depth of 100 200 m our model successfully reproduces the observed tsunami waveforms by applying a simple analytical equation for the period of tsunami waves we showed that the ultra long period of the 2020 alaska tsunami 51 64 min can be reproduced using the water depth around the source region 100 200 m and the length of the coseismic deformation area 100 km comparison of the coastal amplitude of the 2020 alaska event 0 5 m with four other similar size and similar mechanism earthquakes revealed that the smaller coastal amplitude of this tsunami is due to the relatively deep focal depth of the earthquake 28 km and the extremely shallow water around the source region 100 200 m credit author statement the lead author mohammad heidarzadeh initiated the research and conceptualized and organized

20562,the july 2020 mw7 8 alaska tsunamigenic earthquake was a fresh call for potential large tsunamis associated with the aleutian subduction zone the second largest ever recorded earthquake worldwide mw 9 2 occurred in this zone in 1964 indicating its massive earthquake and tsunami risk our analysis of the july 2020 tsunami revealed that it involves very long period waves 51 64 min which is unusual for an mw7 8 earthquake the tsunami coastal amplitude was small 0 5 m which is much smaller than that usually expected from a tsunamigenic earthquake of this size here through numerical simulations and spectral analyses we explain the ultra long period and small amplitude waves of the tsunami our analysis using an analytical equation showed that the ultra long period of the tsunami 51 64 min can be reproduced using the shallow water depth around the source region 100 200 m and the length of the coseismic deformation area 100 km by comparing the coastal amplitude of this event with four other similar size and similar mechanism earthquakes thrust mw7 8 we attribute the relatively small coastal amplitude of this tsunami to the deep focal depth of the earthquake 28 km and the extremely shallow water around the source region keywords tsunami earthquake pacific ocean alaska aleutian subduction zone numerical simulations 1 introduction offshore alaska was the site of a large mw7 8 earthquake on july 22 2020 which was followed by a small tsunami with a coastal runup of around half a meter fig 1 the united states geological survey usgs located the earthquake at 158 554 w and 55 068 n at the depth of 28 0 km with an origin time of 06 12 44 utc the earthquake was of dominant thrust mechanism with usgs focal parameters of strike angle 232 dip angle 20 and rake angle 73 according to media reports this offshore earthquake did not make significant damage although the shaking was felt across most of the alaska peninsula a tsunami warning was issued by the us tsunami warning system https www tsunami gov following the earthquake however the warning was called off after confirming that the tsunami height was minimal based on the tsunami records on offshore deep ocean assessment and reporting of tsunamis dart devices the dart systems recorded maximum zero to crest amplitudes of less than 1 cm while the nearby coastal tide gauges registered tsunami amplitude of less than 30 cm fig 2 the july 2020 mw7 8 tsunamigenic earthquake was generated in the aleutian subduction zone where the pacific plate is subducting beneath the north american plate at the rate of 5 5 6 0 cm yr li et al 2016 the aleutian subduction zone was responsible for the second largest instrumentally recorded earthquake worldwide the march 1964 mw9 2 alaska earthquake plafker et al 1969 fig 1 based on the usgs earthquake catalogue at least 16 m 7 8 earthquakes were recorded in this zone since 1900 among which the two most notable events are the 1946 mw8 6 and 1964 mw9 2 events fig 1 orange circles the 1946 aleutian tsunami produced 42 m runup and caused five deaths in the near field combined with a runup of 16 m and 159 deaths in the far field i e hawaii lopez and okal 2006 okal et al 2002 johnson and satake 1997 the 1964 alaska tsunami has been reported to have killed 130 people clague et al 1994 and caused extensive damage numerous submarine landslides were reported following the 1964 alaska earthquake which further intensified the damaging impacts of the event by triggering local landslide tsunamis haeussler et al 2014 the objective of this research is to understand the sea level characteristics of the july 2020 alaska tsunami in particular there are two unusual signatures in the sea level data of the 2020 tsunami which motivated this research i the tsunami has a very long period of 60 min fig 2 which is unusual for a tsunami from an mw7 8 earthquake ii the tsunami s coastal amplitude is significantly smaller than those normally generated by an mw7 8 offshore earthquake for comparison a similar magnitude mw7 8 and similar mechanism thrust earthquake at the depth of 15 1 km in kaikoura new zealand generated a tsunami with period of 15 20 min and coastal runup of up to 7 m power et al 2017 heidarzadeh et al 2019 we note that the focal depth of the kaikoura event 15 1 km was shallower than that of the alaska event 28 0 km here we apply sea level data analysis and numerical modeling of tsunami propagation to study the 2020 alaska tsunami and to explain the above two unusual characteristics of the tsunami the innovation of this study is that for the first time we apply analytical equations and numerical simulations to explain the unusual tsunami waves generated by an mw7 8 earthquake 2 data and methods our data comprises sea level records of the tsunami ocean bathymetry and the earthquake fault parameters sea level records are from tide gauge stations in sand point and dutch harbor as well as seven darts fig 2 the sampling interval for all sea level data is 1 min both tide gauge and dart records belong to the national ocean service of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the initial part of the dart data includes under sampled seismic waves which are called here as seismic noise fig 2 although they are not useful for tsunami characterization an et al 2017 demonstrated that they can be helpful for estimating earthquake parameters the least squares method of grinsted 2008 was employed to estimate the tidal signals and to remove them from the original sea level records the bathymetry data comes from the general bathymetric charts of the oceans gebco 2020 digital grid atlas ioc et al 2003 weatherall et al 2015 which has a spatial resolution of 15 arc sec the fault parameters of the july 2020 alaska earthquake is provided by the usgs https earthquake usgs gov earthquakes eventpage us7000asvb finite fault which is in the form of a finite fault model with 345 subfaults of size 10 km 10 km the strike and dip angles of the subfaults were fixed at 232 and 20 respectively their depths were varied in the range of 6 1 54 0 km and the slip on the subfaults was up to 3 7 m the usgs source model is obtained through inversion of worldwide seismic observations of the earthquake here we applied a trial and error approach to adjust the length width and slip of the usgs model in order to reproduce tsunami observations our method is a combination of sea level data analysis and numerical modeling fourier transform and wavelet frequency time analyses were performed on the sea level data for fourier transform the welch algorithm welch 1967 mathworks 2020 was applied considering half window overlaps and hanning windows heidarzadeh et al 2017a the fourier analysis was conducted for both tsunami and the background signal i e part of the waveform before tsunami arrival at each sea level station in order to identify main tsunami energy channels the lengths of the tsunami and background waveforms used for spectral analyses were 150 200 min and 120 150 min respectively for wavelet analysis we used the wavelet package of torrence and compo 1998 considering the morlet mother function with a wavenumber of 6 and a scale width of 0 10 heidarzadeh et al 2020 we employed a well validated tsunami simulation package called jagurs baba et al 2015 to simulate tsunami propagation and coastal amplification we solved shallow water equations on a three level nested grid system with grid sizes of 180 arc sec 60 arc sec and 20 arc sec from the largest domain far from the coast to the smallest domain around the coast respectively fig 5 a among a few numerical packages available for tsunami modeling jagurs is favored due to its nesting grid capability and its flexibility for both serial and parallel computations we run the tsunami for a total simulation time of 9 h with time step of 1 0 s to satisfy the stability condition of the numerical scheme courant et al 1928 heidarzadeh et al 2009 to calculate coseismic crustal deformation due to the earthquake the analytical dislocation modeling approach of okada 1985 was applied an instantaneous coseismic deformation is assumed which implies that the initial sea surface displacement is the same as the crustal deformation this is the common practice for modeling tsunamis generated by earthquakes because the speed of tsunami wave propagation is approximately hundred times lower than the speed of seismic waves e g satake 1987 3 tsunami waveforms and spectral analysis deep ocean and coastal records of the alaska tsunami measured on darts and tide gauges respectively are shown in fig 2 and their characteristics are listed in table 1 the deep ocean zero to crest amplitudes are 0 3 1 0 cm with an average of 0 6 cm whereas the coastal amplitudes are 5 7 24 0 cm averaging 14 9 cm table 1 the tsunami amplitudes decay rapidly on darts while large amplitude waves persist for at least 5 h on two coastal records in sand point and dutch harbor fig 2 longer duration of tsunami waves on coastal tide gauges is attributed to various coastal and shelf features such as reflections resonance of the wave inside harbors as well as trapped edge waves e g saito et al 2014 heidarzadeh satake 2014 satake et al 2020 fourier analysis fig 3 color spectra and comparison with background spectra fig 3 black spectra revealed that the dominant tsunami period is 51 64 min it is noted that the tsunami dominant period is influenced by the azimuthal angle of the dart station from the epicenter we performed fourier analysis only for dart records because they are mostly free from various coastal and shelf features and thus carry mainly tsunami source features e g rabinovich 1997 wavelet plots demonstrate the temporal changes of the tsunami dominant periods at three darts fig 4 it can be seen that the dominant periods of 51 64 min are the main signal available in the dart waveforms we note that the strong signal at the period of 2 7 min in the wavelet plots belong to the under sampled seismic noise of the earthquake recorded on the darts and thus they do not represent the tsunami the short duration 2 h of the energetic tsunami waves on darts is also confirmed on wavelet plots fig 4 4 numerical simulations and validation the purpose of numerical modeling was to confirm the coseismic tsunami source of the july 2020 event and to validate it through dart and tide gauge observation we use the validated source model for further analyses in the next sections the results of tsunami simulation using the usgs source model is shown in fig 5d blue waveforms indicating that the simulated waveforms arrive 10 20 min earlier than the observations in some stations therefore it is necessary to further adjust the tsunami source the main reason for lack of a perfect match between simulations and observation is that the usgs source model is obtained through the inversion of only seismic observations of the earthquake therefore it is natural that such a model does not give a perfect match for tsunami observations although it yields better results for seismic waveforms e g yokota et al 2011 satake and heidarzadeh 2017 it has been noted by several authors that a more accurate tsunami source can be achieved by a joint seismic tsunami inversion e g gusman et al 2015 inspired by the usgs source model we considered a rectangular source model with uniform slip to achieve a better match between observations and simulations through a trial and error approach first the fault length and width are assumed as 110 km and 70 km respectively then the uniform slip of 1 7 m is calculated based on a depth dependent earth rigidity of 4 3 1010 n m2 proposed by sallarès and ranero 2019 similar scaling laws are proposed by an et al 2018 other fault parameters such as strike angle 232 dip angle 20 rake angle 73 and depth 28 km are taken from the usgs model this model is called as uniform fault here in fact our uniform fault is a simplified but improved version of the usgs fault model which is improved through tsunami observations the coseismic crustal deformation due to the usgs and our uniform fault models are given in fig 5b and c respectively the tsunami simulations using our uniform fault model produces good agreement between observation and simulation waveforms fig 5d red waveforms the simulated waves using the usgs model fig 5d blue waveforms arrive earlier and have shorter wave periods whereas those using our uniform fault model match the observation well snapshots of tsunami propagation fig 6 a reveal that tsunami arrives in west canada hawaii and west us within 2 5 h plot of maximum tsunami amplitudes during the entire tsunami simulations fig 6b indicates that most of the far field tsunami amplitudes are directed towards west canada and west usa it is long known that tsunami energy travels along normal direction to the fault orientation in the far field ben menahem and rosenman 1972 okal 1988 synolakis and bernard 2006 given the strike angle of 232 for the 2020 alaska earthquake direction ne sw fig 5b and c the normal direction to the strike angle is 142 which is direction nw se towards west canada and west usa 5 the ultra long period waves of the 2020 alaska tsunami the tsunami waveforms and spectra of the july 2020 alaska event mw7 8 are compared with those of the march 2011 japan event mw9 0 at three dart stations fig 7 despite the much smaller magnitude of the alaska event compared to the 2011 japan earthquake the dominant period of the 2020 alaska tsunami 51 64 min is much longer than the dominant period of the 2011 japan event 20 26 min traditionally it has been thought that the larger the magnitude of the earthquake the longer its tsunami period would be however this is not the case for the 2020 alaska tsunami we attribute the ultra long period of the 2020 alaska tsunami to the rather shallow water depth of the source region depth 100 200 m fig 8 b the dominant period of a tsunami t can be approximated using the length of the main coseismic crustal deformation l and the water depth d at the epicentral area applying the following equation heidarzadeh and satake 2015 1 t 2 l g d where g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 we note that tsunami energy usually occurs over a period band rather than a single period because of the heterogeneous shape and non instantaneous occurrence of coseismic crustal deformation equation 1 gives the dominant tsunami period using the length of the largest deformation area rather than the whole period band for the 2020 alaska tsunami the length of the crustal deformation is 80 100 km at the water depth of 100 200 m based on our validated source model figs 5c and 8b for the 2011 japan tsunami the respective values are 80 120 km and 3000 6000 m fig 8a while the total length of the 2011 event s crustal deformation is 200 km we consider only the length of the largest deformation area as we mainly concern about the dominant tsunami period in this study using such input parameters equation 1 results in dominant period of 17 20 min for the 2011 japan event figs 8c and 60 75 min for the 2020 alaska tsunami fig 8d these values are consistent with real tsunami dominant periods obtained through fourier analysis of tsunami observations for the two events fig 7b therefore our analytical study applying equation 1 explains that the ultra long period of the 2020 alaska tsunami is attributed to the generation of the tsunami in extreme shallow water depth of 100 200 m of the continental shelf 6 the small coastal amplitude of the july 2020 alaska tsunami the coastal amplitudes of the 2020 alaska tsunami were much smaller than other tsunamis generated by similar magnitude and similar mechanism earthquakes for comparison the 2016 kaikoura new zealand and 2012 haida gwaii canada tsunamis were both generated by mw7 8 thrust earthquakes which generated maximum coastal runup of 6 m power et al 2017 heidarzadeh et al 2019 and 13 m gusman et al 2016 respectively we note that the 2020 alaska earthquake occurred at the depth of 28 km while the depths of the 2016 kaikoura and 2012 haida gwaii events were 15 km and 14 km respectively in general several factors may influence coastal amplitude of a tsunami including amplitude of coseismic crustal deformation at the tsunami source or magnitude of the earthquake focal depth of the earthquake fd water depth at the source area d 0 bathymetric features along the tsunami propagation path that may cause several natural interferences such as reflection of the waves potential harbor resonance and edge waves e g raichlen and lee 1991 synolakis 2003 yalciner and pelinovsky 2007 heidarzadeh et al 2009 shimozono et al 2012 saito et al 2014 precise analysis of these effects normally requires numerous numerical simulations which is beyond the scope of this study here we focus on two of the above mentioned factors water depth at the source region and earthquake focal depth the effect of water depth at the source region d 0 on the coastal amplitude of a tsunami η can be explained by green s law sorensen 2010 2 η η 0 d 0 d 1 4 where d is water depth at the coast and η 0 is amplitude of coseismic crustal deformation by assuming constant water depth at the coast d equation 2 indicates that the deeper the water depth at the source area d 0 the larger the coastal amplitude of a tsunami η would be regarding earthquake focal depth fd it is widely known that deeper earthquakes generate smaller tsunamis and vice versa e g synolakis 2003 satake 2014 to quantitatively study the effects of earthquake focal depth fd and water depth at the source region d 0 on coastal amplitude of tsunamis we compare these two parameters for five mw7 8 thrust events fig 9 these events and the respective references are 2006 java fujii and satake 2006 2012 haida gwaii gusman et al 2016 leonard and bednarski 2014 2016 kaikoura power et al 2017 heidarzadeh and satake 2017 and 2016 ecuador heidarzadeh et al 2017b fig 9 indicates that for similar size and similar mechanism earthquakes coastal tsunami height or runup is directly correlated with d 0 fig 9b but is inversely related to focal depth fd fig 9c therefore the small coastal amplitude of the 2020 alaska tsunami can be explained by the relatively deep focal depth of the earthquake fd 28 km and the extremely shallow water depth around the source region d 0 100 200 m 7 conclusions the tsunami generated by july 2020 mw7 8 thrust earthquake was unusual in two ways i the period of the tsunami was very long 51 64 min and ii its coastal amplitude was small 0 5 m this study was motivated to explain these peculiar characteristics of the 2020 tsunami here we applied waveform analysis and numerical simulations and achieved the following conclusions the deep ocean zero to crest amplitude of the tsunami was 0 3 1 0 cm average 0 6 cm whereas the coastal amplitude recorded on tide gauges was 5 7 24 0 cm average 14 9 cm tsunami period from this mw7 8 earthquake was 51 64 min which is much longer than that generated by the 2011 mw9 0 japan earthquake 20 26 min we proposed a source model for this tsunami comprising length and width of 110 km and 70 km respectively with uniform slip of 1 7 m this source model is located at the water depth of 100 200 m our model successfully reproduces the observed tsunami waveforms by applying a simple analytical equation for the period of tsunami waves we showed that the ultra long period of the 2020 alaska tsunami 51 64 min can be reproduced using the water depth around the source region 100 200 m and the length of the coseismic deformation area 100 km comparison of the coastal amplitude of the 2020 alaska event 0 5 m with four other similar size and similar mechanism earthquakes revealed that the smaller coastal amplitude of this tsunami is due to the relatively deep focal depth of the earthquake 28 km and the extremely shallow water around the source region 100 200 m credit author statement the lead author mohammad heidarzadeh initiated the research and conceptualized and organized

20563,the hydrodynamic interaction between oblique waves and an arc shaped breakwater and the wave field behind it a three dimensional computational fluid dynamic model was used to simulate the interaction between the oblique waves and arc shaped breakwater the pressure distribution and wave force in the different sections under different wave directions were measured by experiments to validate the numerical results the pressure distribution and wave force in the arc shaped vertical part of the breakwater along the central axis were further analysed using numerical model the maximum positive and negative forces in each section along the central axis were compared the results indicated that the arc curvature exerted little effect on the maximum wave force in the different sections the wave height behind the breakwater was obviously smaller than that at the front with the decrease in the incident angle the influence of diffraction on the wave field gradually decreased under east southeast waves the maximum wave height behind the breakwater caused by overtopping was approximately 0 7 times the incident wave height in the spatial distribution of the wave period behind the breakwater some areas with smaller periods existed which may be caused by the overtopping flow that broke behind the breakwater keywords arc shaped breakwater 3d numerical model wave force pressure distribution wave height and period behind breakwater 1 introduction breakwaters are generally constructed to dissipate and reflect the incident wave energy and protect the coast against erosion prediction of the performance of the interactions between the water waves and breakwater has received large attention from designers the arc shaped bottom mounted breakwater whose horizontal section has an arc form is one of these structures it is fixed at the bottom of the water is impermeable and extends above the free surface of the water the wave force on the structure is an important factor in ocean and coastal engineering design the wave force on a seawall or breakwater has been studied since the 19th century stevenson 1874 minikin 1963 proposed a method to estimate the local pressure when waves impact a vertical wall goda 1974 2010 introduced a formula for pressure distribution and wave force on a vertical wall based on theory and experiments this formula has been widely used in coastal engineering design japan standards 2009 em 1110 2 1100 2011 allsop et al 1996 proposed a new formula to predict the wave impact loading on an upright wall which considered uncertainty and variability in the wave impact process on the breakwater an entrapped air pocket may exist in the water which exerts an important effect of the wave force on a vertical wall bagnold 1939 chan and melville 1988 hattori et al 1994 and obhrai et al 2004 have conducted many studies in real ocean waves the incident waves are often oblique research on oblique wave forces has been mainly performed to determine the reduction coefficient relative to the normal wave force battjes 1982 goda 1985 li et al 2008 however the aforementioned studies focused on proposing formulas and methods for wave forces based on experiments and theory they are only suitable for certain situations and cannot be applied to all types of breakwaters such as arc shaped breakwaters therefore this special type of breakwater has to be studied using physical experiments and numerical simulations the wave state behind an arc shaped breakwater significantly affects the safety of ships in ports therefore the wave field of a breakwater protected area has become the focus of attention the inner harbour wave field of an arc shaped breakwater is affected by diffraction and overtopping for the wave diffraction many scholars have analysed arc shaped breakwaters based on the potential theory miao et al 2005 developed an analytical method to study the wave diffraction effects on an arc shaped breakwater the fluid domain was divided by the arc into two regions the velocity potential in each region was expanded using eigenfunctions because of the continuous pressure and velocity at the common boundary a system of linear equations was developed to obtain the velocity potential and wave height at any point the results show that the wave height in the sheltered area was 20 50 of the incident wave height subsequently miao et al 2006 cheng et al 2007 and duan et al 2012 conducted further research and promotion of this method liu and lin 2013 investigated the interaction between short crested waves and a dual cylindrical bottom mounted system in which the outer layer was an arc shaped porous structure and the inner layer was solid based on the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem this method combined the advantages of the finite and boundary element methods sbfem differed from the method used by cheng et al 2007 in that the fluid region was divided into bounded and unbounded domains with a common interface the hankel and bessel functions were used as the basis functions to solve the unbounded and bounded domains respectively the aforementioned methods based on the potential flow theory are ideal for wave propagation that involves refraction and diffraction owing to their relatively simple equation they are suitable for simulating large domain and time series in a very competitive computational time although this theory has been successful in many cases including wave structure interactions it cannot provide finer details of the flow characteristics near a structure such as wave breaking and overtopping studies on transmitted waves generated by overtopping mainly focus on the transmission coefficient goda 1969 and goda 1985 proposed an empirical formula for transmission coefficient c t of vertical and composite breakwaters tanimoto et al 1987 analysed the influence of dissipation in concrete blocks on the transmission using experiments zhang et al 2016 proposed a c t formula for a submerged breakwater based on a non hydrostatic wave model many studies have been conducted on the transmitted wave period of low crested structures beji and battjes 1993 masselink 1999 sénéchal et al 2001 li and yu 2009 kuznetsov and saprykina 2012 carevis et al 2013 saprykina et al 2015 when waves cross a breakwater the mean period of the transmitted wave is higher than that of the incident wave and the energy transfers to high frequencies the conclusion is that overtopping generates more waves goda 1985 tanimoto et al 1987 van der meer 2000 van der meer et al 2000 proposed a prediction method for spectral shapes after wave overtopping or transmission from smooth structures sénéchal et al 2001 found that wave breaking could weaken the nonlinear coupling at different frequencies however it had little effect on the energy transfer process to high frequencies decoupling process does not entirely occur after the breakwater because of the increase in the water depth and the deshoaling effect sénéchal et al 2002 research on transmitted waves has mainly focused on normal incident waves therefore inner port wave fields affected by the diffraction and transmission in an arc shaped breakwater under oblique waves are being studied with the development in computing technology three dimensional 3d numerical methods based on the navier stokes n s equations have been increasingly applied the methods that describe the fluid domain are divided by the eulerian and lagrangian specification according to their discretisation the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and moving particle semi implicit mps methods as free mesh methods are well known representatives of the latter the main difference between them is the kernel function and pressure calculation method gingold and monaghan 1977 koshizuka and oka 1996 in a 3d simulation the support domain is a sphere and the particle number in support domain is very large which requires significantly more computational resources therefore to improve the calculation speed gpu acceleration is applied to the numerical simulation crespo et al 2011 hori et al 2011 domínguez et al 2013 altomare et al 2014 simulated the interaction between waves and rubble mound breakwater based on sph and the different arrangements of the zeevrugge antifer armour block was discussed buruchenko 2016 simulated a solitary wave run up around a conical island based on weakly compressible sph the main disadvantage of the particle methods is its numerical instability because of particle discontinuity non physical oscillations are generated during the particle interaction although many impressive works have been conducted monaghan 1997 khayyer and gotoh 2011 antuono et al 2012 violeau and leroy 2014 acoustic perturbations in the pressure field continue to occur meringolo et al 2017 the reynolds averaged n s rans model is a representative of the eulerian method the application of rans to model wave structure interactions has significantly evolved in the last few decades the finite volume method fvm and finite difference method fdm are commonly used to solve the rans equations openfoam is an open code that solves the rans model based on fvm and is currently popular within the coastal engineering community higuera et al 2013a 2013b used several physical processes in coastal engineering to verify the accuracy of rans and subsequently developed ihfoam based on the varans model to simulate a 3d porous flow higuera et al 2014a 2014b 2014b li and zhang 2019 studied the interaction between oblique waves and submerged breakwaters using openfoam the flow 3d code is used to solve rans based on fdm flow science 2009 flow 3d is widely used in coastal engineering choi et al 2007 montagna et al 2011 tsai et al 2016 and arabi et al 2019 used the flow 3d model to study the interaction between waves and structures vanneste and troch 2015 simulated large scale physical model tests of waves and a rubble mound breakwater which were verified by experiments wu et al 2016 proposed a piston motion method to generate a ninth order solitary wave and verified it using flow 3d and experiments sogut and yalciner 2019 simulated the solitary wave and vertical breakwater interaction using flow 3d to study the energy dissipation process because the main objective of the present study is to focus on the validation of the numerical model and hydrodynamic characteristics of an arc shaped breakwater and the wave field behind the breakwater instead of code development we decide to use a readily available state of the art computational fluid dynamic cfd model for this purpose in the present study the flow 3d code was developed to simulate the interactions between the waves and an arc shaped breakwater that considered complex phenomena such as wave breaking and overtopping the pressure distribution along the arc was investigated secondary higher harmonics waves generated by overtopping and diffraction were studied this paper is organised as follows section 2 introduces the flow 3d numerical algorithm including the turbulent model boundary conditions and free surface tracking method section 3 describes the physical model experiments of an arc shaped breakwater section 4 presents the establishment process of numerical wave tank nwt section 5 described the characteristics of oblique waves and arc shaped breakwater interaction section 6 provides the wave force verification of numerical and experimental results the wave force and pressure distribution along central axis are further studied the wave height and period behind the breakwater is analysed summary and conclusions are presented in section 7 a brief introduction of the incident and reflection waves separation is reported in appendix a 2 numerical algorithm in the present study commercial cfd code flow 3d was used to simulate the interaction between oblique waves and an arc shaped breakwater flow 3d was developed by hirt and nichols 1981 who pioneered the design of the volume of fluid technique to track a free surface the program solves the 3d rans equation the application of the flow 3d model simulation was tested and verified by choi et al 2007 choi et al 2008 chopakatla et al 2008 montagna et al 2011 wu et al 2016 chen and hsiao 2016 yang et al 2018 and sogut and yalciner 2019 2 1 governing equations the general governing equations for impressible fluid are the rans equations which include the mass and momentum conservation equations the conservation equations are expressed as 1 x i u i a i 0 2 u i t 1 v f u j a j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i f i b i where i 1 2 3 and x i and u i represent the x y z coordinates and velocity in each direction respectively a i is the fractional area open to flow v f is the fractional volume t ρ and p represent the time fluid density and pressure respectively g i is the body acceleration and b i is the flow loss in the porous media f i represents the viscous acceleration which can be expressed as follows 3 f i 1 v f τ b i ρ x i a j s i j where τ b i represents the wall shear stress and s i j υ υ t u j x i u i x j represents the strain rate tensor υ is the kinematic viscosity and υ t is the turbulent kinematic viscosity 2 2 turbulence model turbulence is the chaotic unstable motion of fluids that occurs when viscous forces are unstable and cannot be ignored in numerical modeling due to the limitations of computer memory and power it is not possible to make mesh resolution sufficient to capture such detail therefore it is necessary to simplify the model to describe the mean characteristics of the flows different techniques are employed by flow 3d in order to model turbulent stresses k ϵ model harlow and nakayama 1967 renormalization group rng k ε model yakhot and orszag 1986 yakhot and smith 1992 k ω model wilcox 1998 and les rodi 1980 the k ϵ rng and les model are tested by choi et al 2008 and found that rng and les are more accurate than k ϵ and rng computational cost is much less than les rng model is widely used in wave structure interaction chopakatla et al 2008 montagna et al 2011 tsai et al

the cell volume that is occupied by the liquid in each grid cell the fractional volume is represented by a function f x y z t which varies between 0 and 1 obtained by solving the following equation 8 f t 1 v f x i f a i u i 0 where i 1 2 3 represented the directions of cartesian system f 1 and f 0 indicate that the regions full of liquid or empty if f value is between 0 and 1 the region of this grid is free surface a piston is used to simulated wave making general moving object gmo model used to achieve the movement of piston and the piston moves as user prescribed different mesh domains are connected by continuative condition to avoid reflections along the length of piston the front and back of numerical wave tank nwt are set as symmetrical boundary the bottom of nwt is set as specified pressure which equal to 0 to simulate atmospheric pressure 3 experimental setup the experiments were based in rizhao port in china to reduce the adverse effects of strong waves on the southeast se side we considered establishing an arc shaped breakwater at the south side fig 1 physical model experiments were performed at the tianjin research institute for water transport engineering technology as shown in fig 2 luan et al 2018 by considering the stability of the breakwater and the purpose of maintaining the stability of the port area the near shore section adopted a slope type structure and the far shore section adopted the form of a vertical dike 3 1 arc shaped breakwater model in the model experiments the length width and height of the wave tank were 55 43 and 1 m respectively the 40 m long wave maker piston was movable it could generate waves in different directions by changing its position the arc radius was 12 04 m and the central angle was 107 72 the breakwater could be roughly divided into vertical transition and slope parts and the central angles of each part were 54 41 15 43 and 37 88 fig 3 the vertical part was a caisson and a crown wall was set up on the caisson to minimise overtopping a vertical part of the arc crown wall was adopted the top elevation was 0 5105 m fig 4 the transition part was an arc that transitioned from the vertical to the slope breakwater fig 3 fig 5 is the section of the transition part fig 6 shows the slope part and its size the slope was 1 1 5 and the top elevation was 0 5480 m 3 2 pressure test during the experiments the wave force on three sections 3 7 and 25 were measured as shown in fig 3 11 pressure transducers are installed on each section fig 7 3 and 7 sections are the same as shown in fig 7 a 25 section is different as shown in fig 7 b the weather side of three sections is the same so the pressure measurement point coordinates of three sections are the same as shown in fig 7 a 3 3 wave condition three wave directions were considered in the experiments east northeast ene east e and se the incident angle was defined as the angle between the normal of the line that connected the two endpoints of the arc shaped breakwater and the direction of the incident wave therefore the incident angles in these cases were 64 69 42 19 and 2 81 irregular waves based on jonswap were used in the experiments the wave conditions in the three cases are listed in table 1 according to the designed wave force formula goda 2010 the significant wave period is generally used to calculate the maximum wave pressure on the breakwater in the physical model test 120 waves with mean period were carried out therefore to reduce the computational cost the present study used regular waves with wave height h 1 and period t s for the calculation 4 numerical wave tank establishment 4 1 wave making conditions unwanted spurious secondary waves might be present in regular waves created by the first order wave making theory goda et al 1967 the propagation speed of the spurious wave was slightly lower than that of the primary wave which could be due to the inconsistency between the velocity of the wave maker and orbital velocity of the theoretical wave calabrese et al 2008 goda et al 1967 reported that when h l was less than 0 15 unwanted spurious waves were generated as the wave steepness h l increased and or the relative water depth d l decreased the effect of the spurious waves became more severe therefore we need to use the second order wave making theory to prevent spurious wave generation madsen 1971 derived an explicit expression of a second order wave maker motion to suppress secondary spurious waves using the stokes second order wave surface 9 η 2 h 2 cos k x ω t π h 8 h l cosh k d 2 cosh 2 k d

can be expressed as 11 s 0 h m 1 where 12 m 1 2 sinh 2 k d sinh k d cosh k d k d 4 2 wave absorption porous structure is a commonly used method for wave absorption porosity has an important effect on wave reflection karim et al 2004 cho and kim 2008 the resistance is commonly referred to in porous media modeling as drag the resistance to flow in a porous medium is represented in the navier stokes equations as a drag term proportional to the velocity 13 b i f d u i where f d is the porous media drag coefficient there are many methods to define f d such as through porosity volume fraction and reynolds number considering that the fluid will turbulent in porous medium the method of f d calculated by reynold number is adopted 14 f d μ ρ 1 v f v f a 1 v f v f b re p d where a 180 d 2 b 1 8 4 0 d d is particle diameter v f is porosity of a porous medium according to the research of evans 1990 when the porosity is 0 8 0 9 it has a good wave absorbing effect therefore 0 8 is adopted in this numerical model 4 3 mesh and boundary conditions the program solved the n s equations using fdm with an orthogonal grid system the computational domain i e nwt used in this study was 35 m long 25 m wide and 1 m high it contained a total of 20 000 000 cells the computational domain was divided into four parts as shown in fig 8 part i was under the free surface part ii simulated the free surface wave breaking and overtopping during the wave breakwater interaction part iii represented the top of the nwt a specified pressure boundary was used part iv represented the wave absorption region the region and mesh in each part are listed in table 2 the boundary condition in each part is listed in table 3 4 4 wave making test three wave gauges were set in nwt to measure the wave height and period at the breakwater front the wave gauge arrangement is shown in fig 9 the breakwater is drawn with a dashed line indicating that the breakwater does not exist during the wave making process in this study the direction of the incident wave varied by rotating the breakwater model thus the coordinates of the wave gauges in the different cases were different the position of each gauge in the different wave directions is listed in table 4 the time histories of the surface elevations at wg1 wg3 are shown in fig 10 the vertical and horizontal axes represent the non dimensional surface elevations η h where η is the surface elevation and time respectively the wave height and period of the different gauges could be observed to satisfy the target wave and the wave shapes of the different gauges were almost the same 4 5 arc shaped breakwater arrangement the arc shaped breakwater model was established and is shown in fig 11 in nwt to investigate the effect of the waves in different directions rotation of the breakwater was easier than moving the piston therefore the breakwater model was imported into nwt and the centre position and rotation angle of the breakwater were adjusted according to the different incident angles the arrangement of the breakwater and centre position of the arc is shown in fig 12 and table 5 5 interaction between the waves and arc shaped breakwater 5 1 ene direction fig 13 shows the free surface under case 1 wave condition because the incident angle is large the waves first contact the breakwater head because the height of the wave crest line is higher than that of the breakwater overtopping occurs as the incident wave propagates forward overtopping continues overtopping occurs at the intersection of the crest line and wave crest line during this process because of blocking of the breakwater the reflected waves gradually spread out in a fan shape because of the sudden change in a section of the breakwater head diffracted waves are generated and propagate into the harbour 5 2 e direction fig 14 shows the free surface under case 2 because the water level is close to the top of the breakwater the first wave of the e direction incident waves crosses the breakwater and breaks after the breakwater secondary waves are generated by overtopping because of the barrier in the breakwater the waves are reflected and the reflected waves propagate outwards in an arc shape as the waves continue to propagate forward the waves outside the slope breakwater become chaotic and the effect of the diffracted waves on the inner harbour increases the crest line of the secondary wave lags behind that of the incident wave 5 3 se direction fig 15 shows the free surface under case 3 in this case the angle between the incident wave and normal line of the breakwater is 2 81 which indicates an almost vertical relationship when the first wave hits the breakwater it flows over it the wave simultaneously crosses the vertical transition and slope sections the overtopping flow breaks after the breakwater forms a secondary wave and continues to propagate forward under the action of the e incident waves the diffraction exerts a little effect on the breakwater shielding area the inner port wave state is mainly determined by the overtopping 6 result and analysis in the interaction between the wave and arc shaped breakwater the main factors of concern are the wave force on the breakwater and the wave field behind the breakwater the numerical results and experiments are compared the pressure distribution and wave force of the vertical part are analysed in more detail using numerical simulation the wave height and period behind the breakwater due to the overtopping and diffraction is described 6 1 wave force and pressure distribution the wave force at the weather side is calculated using the integral of the pressure points table 6 lists the pressure distribution results of the experiments and numerical simulation when the wave force reaches maximum the error is calculated by eq 15 the pressure distribution is shown in fig 16 comparison of the experimental and simulation results reveals that the wave force in the numerical simulation is consistent with that in the physical tests the pressure distribution in the numerical simulation is relatively smooth and the overall trend of the pressure curve is consistent with that of the experiment according to the pressure distribution in the experiments some obvious protrusions and depressions occur at some measurement points such as in c3 c5 and c7 in the ene direction and c3 in the e direction which may have been caused by bubble breakage in the wave breaking process in the numerical simulation because the rans model represents the statistical average result the obtained pressure distribution is relatively smooth however it can still reveal the wave force on the structure 15 e r r o r f e x p f n u m f e x p 6 2 pressure distribution along the arc shaped vertical breakwater we study the wave force distribution along the central axis of a vertical breakwater under different incident waves the interaction between the ese waves and arc shaped breakwater is simulated the water depth wave height and period in the ese direction are the same as those in the e direction the centre position of the arc is at 25 7675 m 10 1986 m the incident angle is 19 69 the wave force and pressure distribution are calculated fig 17 shows the pressure distribution in sections 3 7 and 25 under different wave directions fig 17 b shows that the wave force in section 25 is higher than those in the other sections at the upper points in the se direction the wave force in section 3 is slightly higher than those in sections 7 and 25 generally for different wave directions the wave force and pressure distribution in each section are basically the same to study the overall pressure distribution characteristics at the vertical part in the arc shaped breakwater 29 pressure measurement sections s1 s29 are set as shown in fig 18 the arrangement of the pressure measurement points in each section is the same as that shown in fig 9 by measuring these sections the wave force and pressure distribution characteristics at the entire vertical weather side are analysed including the pressure distribution and wave force distribution when the entire weather side of the vertical part of arc shaped breakwater is subjected to maximum or minimum wave force figs 19 22 and that when in each section is subjected to maximum positive and negative wave forces figs 23 26 figs 19 and 20 show that under the action of the waves in different directions the pressure distribution and wave force gradually change along the central axis of the breakwater when the horizontal wave force on the vertical breakwater reaches its maximum value the pressure distribution characteristics in the wave facing upright wall become different with the decrease in the incident angle during the ene wave action the breakwater head is first impacted by the waves because of the large incident angle figs 19 a and 20 a the wave pressure is concentrated in the head area of the breakwater s1 s8 and the force in the other pressure sections is very small under the e direction wave action the wave force is concentrated in s1 s15 negative pressure appears in s16 s25 and a positive force subsequently appears in s26 s29 fig 19 b and fig 20 b this result indicates that the entire vertical part of the breakwater spans from one to two wavelength ranges following the gradual decrease in the incident angle the incident direction of the ese waves is basically perpendicular to the vertical breakwater figs 19 c and 20 c show that a positive force appears in s3 s27 and a negative force exists at both sides the wave pressure and wave force of the breakwater are basically symmetrically distributed the s6 and s24 cross sectional pressure values are maximum under the se wave action the area of force concentration on the breakwater occurs between s17 and s29 negative pressure appears in s8 s12 and s1 s6 are subjected to positive pressure figs 19 d and 20 d figs 21 and 22 show the pressure and wave force distribution characteristics in the vertical part of the arc shaped breakwater at the time of maximum negative wave force under the ene wave action the pressure distribution at the weather side takes the form of alternating positive and negative pressure figs 21 a and 22 a because of the large incident angle the central axis of the breakwater spans two wavelengths during the e direction wave action the breakwater is subjected to negative pressure except at s18 s24 figs 21 b and 22 b when the ese waves act on the breakwater the pressure distribution is basically symmetrical figs 21 c and 22 c as the wave incident angle continues to shift the negative pressure is mainly concentrated at s16 s29 under se waves s1 s16 take the form of alternating positive and negative pressure figs 21 d and 22 d figs 20 and 22 show that for the e ese and se direction waves the wave force distribution characteristics in the upright section of the breakwater when the wave facing side is subjected to maximum positive and negative wave forces are basically symmetrical for example in the ese wave action the wave force in s3 s27 is positive and symmetrical to s15 when the positive force reaches its maximum however the wave force in s3 s27 is negative and symmetrical to s15 when the negative force reaches its maximum because of the incident regular waves the pressure distribution and wave force in each section periodically change therefore the wave force on the vertical breakwater also periodically changes because of the curvature of the arc shaped breakwater the angle between the wave incident and tangential directions in each section varies to study the effect of the arc curvature on the wave force in each section the maximum positive and negative forces and their pressure distributions are calculated the results are shown in figs 23 26 which indicate that the pressure distribution characteristics and wave force in each section are basically the same under different oblique waves it investigated that the arc curvature has little effect on the wave force in the different sections 6 3 wave field behind the breakwater when water waves encounter the breakwater during propagation they pivot around the edge of the obstacle and move into the shadow zone of the obstacle this phenomenon is called diffraction of water waves the spatial distribution of the diffracted wave height of regular waves at a uniform depth can be computed using the sommerfeld solution based on the velocity potential theory goda 1985 for the interaction between the waves and breakwater diffraction is a common phenomenon and has been extensively studied since last century puttnam and arthur 1948 wang 1993 briggs et al 1995 kim 2010 studied the diffraction between the waves and long breakwaters chang et al 2012 derived an accurate solution for the diffraction between oblique waves and a single modified v shaped breakwater miao et al 2005 analysed the wave diffraction effects on arc shaped bottom mounted breakwaters the aforementioned studies were mainly based on the potential theory under the assumptions of no viscous effect and irrotational flow although miao s method succeeded in many cases including wave structure interactions the flow characteristics near the structures such as vortex and overtopping were neglected ji et al 2017 under extreme wave conditions the wave field behind the breakwater is not only affected by the diffraction but also the influence of overtopping cannot be ignored in actual sea conditions the wave field behind the breakwater is affected not only by the diffraction but also by the secondary higher harmonics waves generated by overtopping for the study of secondary higher harmonics waves behind a breakwater to the best of our knowledge existing research mainly focuses on wave and submerged breakwaters and the wave state behind the breakwater is studied using the wave height and period however few studies were conducted on the secondary higher harmonics waves caused by overtopping this section mainly discusses the wave height and wave period behind the breakwater under oblique regular waves by installing a series of surface elevation gauges the wave field behind a breakwater can be defined the layout of the measurement points is shown in fig 27 three rows of measurement points at the front of the breakwater and six rows behind the breakwater are set to measure the wave height and period according to the time history data of the wave measurement gauges the wave height and period at each measurement point are obtained because waves do not initially reach the breakwater the mean wave height and period are obtained using the data after 16 s fig 28 shows the spatial distribution of h h i h i denotes the incident wave height around the breakwater for the ene direction because of the large incident angle the influence of wave diffraction on the harbour is more obvious as shown in fig 13 d the diffracted wave enters the harbour along the edge of the breakwater and the diffracted wave height gradually decreases during propagation into the harbour the wave height behind the breakwater which is main caused by diffraction is approximately 0 5h i 0 7h i fig 13 shows that overtopping often occurs however the effect of overtopping on the wave height behind the breakwater is less than that of the diffraction the shielding area wave height is approximately 0 3h i for the e direction the influence of diffraction on the wave height behind the breakwater is smaller than that in the ene direction the wave height in the sheltered area is approximately 0 05 m which is approximately 0 25 times the incident wave height for the ese waves diffraction only affects the edge area of the arc shaped breakwater a region exists with a wave height of approximately 0 7h i which is behind the first attacked breakwater area it investigates that overtopping might significantly influence the wave height behind the breakwater for the se waves the wave state in the harbour is relatively stable and the wave heights are generally small at any location which are less than 0 5h i owing to the existence of the breakwater the wave height behind the breakwater is obviously smaller than that at the breakwater front which indicates that the arc shaped breakwater provides a great shielding effect on harbours with the decrease in the incident angle the influence of diffraction on the wave height behind the breakwater gradually decreases overtopping may cause a higher wave height behind the breakwater therefore the influence of overtopping should be considered in the study of the wave field behind a breakwater fig 29 shows the spatial distribution of the wave period under different wave directions t i indicates the incident period we can observe that the period at the front of the arc shaped breakwater is basically consistent with the incident period for different directions some regions exist behind the breakwater with periods that are obviously smaller than the incident period during the break in the overtopping flow behind the breakwater the free surface violently fluctuates and some high frequency waves are generated during the break in the overtopping flow resulting in some regions with smaller wave periods behind the breakwater reflection coefficient c r is an important parameter of the coastal structures design the method of ma et al 2011 is adopted to estimate c r details on the incident and reflected waves separation are reported in appendix a then six positions are selected to calculate the reflection coefficient c r as shown in fig 30 the results as shown in fig 31 it can be seen from fig 31 that as the incident angle decreases the c r of position 1 gradually decreases and the c r of position 6 gradually increases for the ene and e wave conditions c r generally increases along the axis of the breakwater under ese wave action c r of position 1 and position 6 are large and c r of position 3 and 4 are smaller this phenomenon indicates that the reflection wave height in the area of position 3 and 4 is small and the waves overtop the breakwater lead the transmission wave height is higher fig 28 for se direction waves c r of the is large in the breakwater head 7 conclusions the flow 3d model is applied to study the interaction between the waves and arc shaped breakwaters the madsen 1971 wave making theory is adopted and porous media are used to absorb the waves the change in the incident wave direction is implemented by moving the breakwater model comparison of the experimental data and numerical results demonstrates that the flow 3d model performs well in the wave breakwater interaction then the pressure distribution and wave force in the vertical part of the arc shaped breakwater along the central axis is investigated and the wave height and period of the wave field behind the breakwater are described the following conclusions are drawn 1 through comparison between the experimental data and numerical results of the pressure distribution and wave force in the different sections under the action of different wave directions the error between them is less than 5 which indicates that the numerical model can simulate the interaction between oblique waves and arc shaped breakwaters 2 the pressure distribution and wave force characteristics in the vertical part of the arc shaped breakwater along the central axis are studied when the entire horizontal wave force on the upright wall in the vertical part reaches the maximum the pressure distribution and wave force along the centre are obtained the wave force and pressure distribution in each section gradually vary along the central line because of the periodicity of the regular waves the pressure distributions at maximum positive and negative wave forces along the vertical part are symmetrical in the e ese and se directions for ene waves with a large incident angle the maximum horizontal positive force on the vertical part occurs when the crest of the first wave impacts the breakwater head area when the negative horizontal force reaches its maximum it takes the form of alternating positive and negative pressure along the central line then the maximum positive and negative wave forces in each section are compared the results show that the maximum positive and negative wave forces in each section are basically equal under different wave conditions we find that the arc curvature has little effect on the wave force in the different sections 3 the wave height and period behind the arc shaped breakwater are studied the wave height behind the breakwater is obviously smaller than that at the front with the decrease in the incident angle the influence of diffraction on the wave field behind the breakwater gradually decreases under ese waves the maximum wave height behind the breakwater caused by overtopping is approximately 0 7 times the incident wave height therefore the influence of overtopping should be considered in the design of breakwaters and arrangement for ship berthing in the spatial distribution of the wave period behind the breakwater some areas with a smaller period exist which may have been caused by the overtopping flow breaking behind the breakwater and high frequency waves are generated

20563,the hydrodynamic interaction between oblique waves and an arc shaped breakwater and the wave field behind it a three dimensional computational fluid dynamic model was used to simulate the interaction between the oblique waves and arc shaped breakwater the pressure distribution and wave force in the different sections under different wave directions were measured by experiments to validate the numerical results the pressure distribution and wave force in the arc shaped vertical part of the breakwater along the central axis were further analysed using numerical model the maximum positive and negative forces in each section along the central axis were compared the results indicated that the arc curvature exerted little effect on the maximum wave force in the different sections the wave height behind the breakwater was obviously smaller than that at the front with the decrease in the incident angle the influence of diffraction on the wave field gradually decreased under east southeast waves the maximum wave height behind the breakwater caused by overtopping was approximately 0 7 times the incident wave height in the spatial distribution of the wave period behind the breakwater some areas with smaller periods existed which may be caused by the overtopping flow that broke behind the breakwater keywords arc shaped breakwater 3d numerical model wave force pressure distribution wave height and period behind breakwater 1 introduction breakwaters are generally constructed to dissipate and reflect the incident wave energy and protect the coast against erosion prediction of the performance of the interactions between the water waves and breakwater has received large attention from designers the arc shaped bottom mounted breakwater whose horizontal section has an arc form is one of these structures it is fixed at the bottom of the water is impermeable and extends above the free surface of the water the wave force on the structure is an important factor in ocean and coastal engineering design the wave force on a seawall or breakwater has been studied since the 19th century stevenson 1874 minikin 1963 proposed a method to estimate the local pressure when waves impact a vertical wall goda 1974 2010 introduced a formula for pressure distribution and wave force on a vertical wall based on theory and experiments this formula has been widely used in coastal engineering design japan standards 2009 em 1110 2 1100 2011 allsop et al 1996 proposed a new formula to predict the wave impact loading on an upright wall which considered uncertainty and variability in the wave impact process on the breakwater an entrapped air pocket may exist in the water which exerts an important effect of the wave force on a vertical wall bagnold 1939 chan and melville 1988 hattori et al 1994 and obhrai et al 2004 have conducted many studies in real ocean waves the incident waves are often oblique research on oblique wave forces has been mainly performed to determine the reduction coefficient relative to the normal wave force battjes 1982 goda 1985 li et al 2008 however the aforementioned studies focused on proposing formulas and methods for wave forces based on experiments and theory they are only suitable for certain situations and cannot be applied to all types of breakwaters such as arc shaped breakwaters therefore this special type of breakwater has to be studied using physical experiments and numerical simulations the wave state behind an arc shaped breakwater significantly affects the safety of ships in ports therefore the wave field of a breakwater protected area has become the focus of attention the inner harbour wave field of an arc shaped breakwater is affected by diffraction and overtopping for the wave diffraction many scholars have analysed arc shaped breakwaters based on the potential theory miao et al 2005 developed an analytical method to study the wave diffraction effects on an arc shaped breakwater the fluid domain was divided by the arc into two regions the velocity potential in each region was expanded using eigenfunctions because of the continuous pressure and velocity at the common boundary a system of linear equations was developed to obtain the velocity potential and wave height at any point the results show that the wave height in the sheltered area was 20 50 of the incident wave height subsequently miao et al 2006 cheng et al 2007 and duan et al 2012 conducted further research and promotion of this method liu and lin 2013 investigated the interaction between short crested waves and a dual cylindrical bottom mounted system in which the outer layer was an arc shaped porous structure and the inner layer was solid based on the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem this method combined the advantages of the finite and boundary element methods sbfem differed from the method used by cheng et al 2007 in that the fluid region was divided into bounded and unbounded domains with a common interface the hankel and bessel functions were used as the basis functions to solve the unbounded and bounded domains respectively the aforementioned methods based on the potential flow theory are ideal for wave propagation that involves refraction and diffraction owing to their relatively simple equation they are suitable for simulating large domain and time series in a very competitive computational time although this theory has been successful in many cases including wave structure interactions it cannot provide finer details of the flow characteristics near a structure such as wave breaking and overtopping studies on transmitted waves generated by overtopping mainly focus on the transmission coefficient goda 1969 and goda 1985 proposed an empirical formula for transmission coefficient c t of vertical and composite breakwaters tanimoto et al 1987 analysed the influence of dissipation in concrete blocks on the transmission using experiments zhang et al 2016 proposed a c t formula for a submerged breakwater based on a non hydrostatic wave model many studies have been conducted on the transmitted wave period of low crested structures beji and battjes 1993 masselink 1999 sénéchal et al 2001 li and yu 2009 kuznetsov and saprykina 2012 carevis et al 2013 saprykina et al 2015 when waves cross a breakwater the mean period of the transmitted wave is higher than that of the incident wave and the energy transfers to high frequencies the conclusion is that overtopping generates more waves goda 1985 tanimoto et al 1987 van der meer 2000 van der meer et al 2000 proposed a prediction method for spectral shapes after wave overtopping or transmission from smooth structures sénéchal et al 2001 found that wave breaking could weaken the nonlinear coupling at different frequencies however it had little effect on the energy transfer process to high frequencies decoupling process does not entirely occur after the breakwater because of the increase in the water depth and the deshoaling effect sénéchal et al 2002 research on transmitted waves has mainly focused on normal incident waves therefore inner port wave fields affected by the diffraction and transmission in an arc shaped breakwater under oblique waves are being studied with the development in computing technology three dimensional 3d numerical methods based on the navier stokes n s equations have been increasingly applied the methods that describe the fluid domain are divided by the eulerian and lagrangian specification according to their discretisation the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and moving particle semi implicit mps methods as free mesh methods are well known representatives of the latter the main difference between them is the kernel function and pressure calculation method gingold and monaghan 1977 koshizuka and oka 1996 in a 3d simulation the support domain is a sphere and the particle number in support domain is very large which requires significantly more computational resources therefore to improve the calculation speed gpu acceleration is applied to the numerical simulation crespo et al 2011 hori et al 2011 domínguez et al 2013 altomare et al 2014 simulated the interaction between waves and rubble mound breakwater based on sph and the different arrangements of the zeevrugge antifer armour block was discussed buruchenko 2016 simulated a solitary wave run up around a conical island based on weakly compressible sph the main disadvantage of the particle methods is its numerical instability because of particle discontinuity non physical oscillations are generated during the particle interaction although many impressive works have been conducted monaghan 1997 khayyer and gotoh 2011 antuono et al 2012 violeau and leroy 2014 acoustic perturbations in the pressure field continue to occur meringolo et al 2017 the reynolds averaged n s rans model is a representative of the eulerian method the application of rans to model wave structure interactions has significantly evolved in the last few decades the finite volume method fvm and finite difference method fdm are commonly used to solve the rans equations openfoam is an open code that solves the rans model based on fvm and is currently popular within the coastal engineering community higuera et al 2013a 2013b used several physical processes in coastal engineering to verify the accuracy of rans and subsequently developed ihfoam based on the varans model to simulate a 3d porous flow higuera et al 2014a 2014b 2014b li and zhang 2019 studied the interaction between oblique waves and submerged breakwaters using openfoam the flow 3d code is used to solve rans based on fdm flow science 2009 flow 3d is widely used in coastal engineering choi et al 2007 montagna et al 2011 tsai et al 2016 and arabi et al 2019 used the flow 3d model to study the interaction between waves and structures vanneste and troch 2015 simulated large scale physical model tests of waves and a rubble mound breakwater which were verified by experiments wu et al 2016 proposed a piston motion method to generate a ninth order solitary wave and verified it using flow 3d and experiments sogut and yalciner 2019 simulated the solitary wave and vertical breakwater interaction using flow 3d to study the energy dissipation process because the main objective of the present study is to focus on the validation of the numerical model and hydrodynamic characteristics of an arc shaped breakwater and the wave field behind the breakwater instead of code development we decide to use a readily available state of the art computational fluid dynamic cfd model for this purpose in the present study the flow 3d code was developed to simulate the interactions between the waves and an arc shaped breakwater that considered complex phenomena such as wave breaking and overtopping the pressure distribution along the arc was investigated secondary higher harmonics waves generated by overtopping and diffraction were studied this paper is organised as follows section 2 introduces the flow 3d numerical algorithm including the turbulent model boundary conditions and free surface tracking method section 3 describes the physical model experiments of an arc shaped breakwater section 4 presents the establishment process of numerical wave tank nwt section 5 described the characteristics of oblique waves and arc shaped breakwater interaction section 6 provides the wave force verification of numerical and experimental results the wave force and pressure distribution along central axis are further studied the wave height and period behind the breakwater is analysed summary and conclusions are presented in section 7 a brief introduction of the incident and reflection waves separation is reported in appendix a 2 numerical algorithm in the present study commercial cfd code flow 3d was used to simulate the interaction between oblique waves and an arc shaped breakwater flow 3d was developed by hirt and nichols 1981 who pioneered the design of the volume of fluid technique to track a free surface the program solves the 3d rans equation the application of the flow 3d model simulation was tested and verified by choi et al 2007 choi et al 2008 chopakatla et al 2008 montagna et al 2011 wu et al 2016 chen and hsiao 2016 yang et al 2018 and sogut and yalciner 2019 2 1 governing equations the general governing equations for impressible fluid are the rans equations which include the mass and momentum conservation equations the conservation equations are expressed as 1 x i u i a i 0 2 u i t 1 v f u j a j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i f i b i where i 1 2 3 and x i and u i represent the x y z coordinates and velocity in each direction respectively a i is the fractional area open to flow v f is the fractional volume t ρ and p represent the time fluid density and pressure respectively g i is the body acceleration and b i is the flow loss in the porous media f i represents the viscous acceleration which can be expressed as follows 3 f i 1 v f τ b i ρ x i a j s i j where τ b i represents the wall shear stress and s i j υ υ t u j x i u i x j represents the strain rate tensor υ is the kinematic viscosity and υ t is the turbulent kinematic viscosity 2 2 turbulence model turbulence is the chaotic unstable motion of fluids that occurs when viscous forces are unstable and cannot be ignored in numerical modeling due to the limitations of computer memory and power it is not possible to make mesh resolution sufficient to capture such detail therefore it is necessary to simplify the model to describe the mean characteristics of the flows different techniques are employed by flow 3d in order to model turbulent stresses k ϵ model harlow and nakayama 1967 renormalization group rng k ε model yakhot and orszag 1986 yakhot and smith 1992 k ω model wilcox 1998 and les rodi 1980 the k ϵ rng and les model are tested by choi et al 2008 and found that rng and les are more accurate than k ϵ and rng computational cost is much less than les rng model is widely used in wave structure interaction chopakatla et al 2008 montagna et al 2011 tsai et al

the cell volume that is occupied by the liquid in each grid cell the fractional volume is represented by a function f x y z t which varies between 0 and 1 obtained by solving the following equation 8 f t 1 v f x i f a i u i 0 where i 1 2 3 represented the directions of cartesian system f 1 and f 0 indicate that the regions full of liquid or empty if f value is between 0 and 1 the region of this grid is free surface a piston is used to simulated wave making general moving object gmo model used to achieve the movement of piston and the piston moves as user prescribed different mesh domains are connected by continuative condition to avoid reflections along the length of piston the front and back of numerical wave tank nwt are set as symmetrical boundary the bottom of nwt is set as specified pressure which equal to 0 to simulate atmospheric pressure 3 experimental setup the experiments were based in rizhao port in china to reduce the adverse effects of strong waves on the southeast se side we considered establishing an arc shaped breakwater at the south side fig 1 physical model experiments were performed at the tianjin research institute for water transport engineering technology as shown in fig 2 luan et al 2018 by considering the stability of the breakwater and the purpose of maintaining the stability of the port area the near shore section adopted a slope type structure and the far shore section adopted the form of a vertical dike 3 1 arc shaped breakwater model in the model experiments the length width and height of the wave tank were 55 43 and 1 m respectively the 40 m long wave maker piston was movable it could generate waves in different directions by changing its position the arc radius was 12 04 m and the central angle was 107 72 the breakwater could be roughly divided into vertical transition and slope parts and the central angles of each part were 54 41 15 43 and 37 88 fig 3 the vertical part was a caisson and a crown wall was set up on the caisson to minimise overtopping a vertical part of the arc crown wall was adopted the top elevation was 0 5105 m fig 4 the transition part was an arc that transitioned from the vertical to the slope breakwater fig 3 fig 5 is the section of the transition part fig 6 shows the slope part and its size the slope was 1 1 5 and the top elevation was 0 5480 m 3 2 pressure test during the experiments the wave force on three sections 3 7 and 25 were measured as shown in fig 3 11 pressure transducers are installed on each section fig 7 3 and 7 sections are the same as shown in fig 7 a 25 section is different as shown in fig 7 b the weather side of three sections is the same so the pressure measurement point coordinates of three sections are the same as shown in fig 7 a 3 3 wave condition three wave directions were considered in the experiments east northeast ene east e and se the incident angle was defined as the angle between the normal of the line that connected the two endpoints of the arc shaped breakwater and the direction of the incident wave therefore the incident angles in these cases were 64 69 42 19 and 2 81 irregular waves based on jonswap were used in the experiments the wave conditions in the three cases are listed in table 1 according to the designed wave force formula goda 2010 the significant wave period is generally used to calculate the maximum wave pressure on the breakwater in the physical model test 120 waves with mean period were carried out therefore to reduce the computational cost the present study used regular waves with wave height h 1 and period t s for the calculation 4 numerical wave tank establishment 4 1 wave making conditions unwanted spurious secondary waves might be present in regular waves created by the first order wave making theory goda et al 1967 the propagation speed of the spurious wave was slightly lower than that of the primary wave which could be due to the inconsistency between the velocity of the wave maker and orbital velocity of the theoretical wave calabrese et al 2008 goda et al 1967 reported that when h l was less than 0 15 unwanted spurious waves were generated as the wave steepness h l increased and or the relative water depth d l decreased the effect of the spurious waves became more severe therefore we need to use the second order wave making theory to prevent spurious wave generation madsen 1971 derived an explicit expression of a second order wave maker motion to suppress secondary spurious waves using the stokes second order wave surface 9 η 2 h 2 cos k x ω t π h 8 h l cosh k d 2 cosh 2 k d

can be expressed as 11 s 0 h m 1 where 12 m 1 2 sinh 2 k d sinh k d cosh k d k d 4 2 wave absorption porous structure is a commonly used method for wave absorption porosity has an important effect on wave reflection karim et al 2004 cho and kim 2008 the resistance is commonly referred to in porous media modeling as drag the resistance to flow in a porous medium is represented in the navier stokes equations as a drag term proportional to the velocity 13 b i f d u i where f d is the porous media drag coefficient there are many methods to define f d such as through porosity volume fraction and reynolds number considering that the fluid will turbulent in porous medium the method of f d calculated by reynold number is adopted 14 f d μ ρ 1 v f v f a 1 v f v f b re p d where a 180 d 2 b 1 8 4 0 d d is particle diameter v f is porosity of a porous medium according to the research of evans 1990 when the porosity is 0 8 0 9 it has a good wave absorbing effect therefore 0 8 is adopted in this numerical model 4 3 mesh and boundary conditions the program solved the n s equations using fdm with an orthogonal grid system the computational domain i e nwt used in this study was 35 m long 25 m wide and 1 m high it contained a total of 20 000 000 cells the computational domain was divided into four parts as shown in fig 8 part i was under the free surface part ii simulated the free surface wave breaking and overtopping during the wave breakwater interaction part iii represented the top of the nwt a specified pressure boundary was used part iv represented the wave absorption region the region and mesh in each part are listed in table 2 the boundary condition in each part is listed in table 3 4 4 wave making test three wave gauges were set in nwt to measure the wave height and period at the breakwater front the wave gauge arrangement is shown in fig 9 the breakwater is drawn with a dashed line indicating that the breakwater does not exist during the wave making process in this study the direction of the incident wave varied by rotating the breakwater model thus the coordinates of the wave gauges in the different cases were different the position of each gauge in the different wave directions is listed in table 4 the time histories of the surface elevations at wg1 wg3 are shown in fig 10 the vertical and horizontal axes represent the non dimensional surface elevations η h where η is the surface elevation and time respectively the wave height and period of the different gauges could be observed to satisfy the target wave and the wave shapes of the different gauges were almost the same 4 5 arc shaped breakwater arrangement the arc shaped breakwater model was established and is shown in fig 11 in nwt to investigate the effect of the waves in different directions rotation of the breakwater was easier than moving the piston therefore the breakwater model was imported into nwt and the centre position and rotation angle of the breakwater were adjusted according to the different incident angles the arrangement of the breakwater and centre position of the arc is shown in fig 12 and table 5 5 interaction between the waves and arc shaped breakwater 5 1 ene direction fig 13 shows the free surface under case 1 wave condition because the incident angle is large the waves first contact the breakwater head because the height of the wave crest line is higher than that of the breakwater overtopping occurs as the incident wave propagates forward overtopping continues overtopping occurs at the intersection of the crest line and wave crest line during this process because of blocking of the breakwater the reflected waves gradually spread out in a fan shape because of the sudden change in a section of the breakwater head diffracted waves are generated and propagate into the harbour 5 2 e direction fig 14 shows the free surface under case 2 because the water level is close to the top of the breakwater the first wave of the e direction incident waves crosses the breakwater and breaks after the breakwater secondary waves are generated by overtopping because of the barrier in the breakwater the waves are reflected and the reflected waves propagate outwards in an arc shape as the waves continue to propagate forward the waves outside the slope breakwater become chaotic and the effect of the diffracted waves on the inner harbour increases the crest line of the secondary wave lags behind that of the incident wave 5 3 se direction fig 15 shows the free surface under case 3 in this case the angle between the incident wave and normal line of the breakwater is 2 81 which indicates an almost vertical relationship when the first wave hits the breakwater it flows over it the wave simultaneously crosses the vertical transition and slope sections the overtopping flow breaks after the breakwater forms a secondary wave and continues to propagate forward under the action of the e incident waves the diffraction exerts a little effect on the breakwater shielding area the inner port wave state is mainly determined by the overtopping 6 result and analysis in the interaction between the wave and arc shaped breakwater the main factors of concern are the wave force on the breakwater and the wave field behind the breakwater the numerical results and experiments are compared the pressure distribution and wave force of the vertical part are analysed in more detail using numerical simulation the wave height and period behind the breakwater due to the overtopping and diffraction is described 6 1 wave force and pressure distribution the wave force at the weather side is calculated using the integral of the pressure points table 6 lists the pressure distribution results of the experiments and numerical simulation when the wave force reaches maximum the error is calculated by eq 15 the pressure distribution is shown in fig 16 comparison of the experimental and simulation results reveals that the wave force in the numerical simulation is consistent with that in the physical tests the pressure distribution in the numerical simulation is relatively smooth and the overall trend of the pressure curve is consistent with that of the experiment according to the pressure distribution in the experiments some obvious protrusions and depressions occur at some measurement points such as in c3 c5 and c7 in the ene direction and c3 in the e direction which may have been caused by bubble breakage in the wave breaking process in the numerical simulation because the rans model represents the statistical average result the obtained pressure distribution is relatively smooth however it can still reveal the wave force on the structure 15 e r r o r f e x p f n u m f e x p 6 2 pressure distribution along the arc shaped vertical breakwater we study the wave force distribution along the central axis of a vertical breakwater under different incident waves the interaction between the ese waves and arc shaped breakwater is simulated the water depth wave height and period in the ese direction are the same as those in the e direction the centre position of the arc is at 25 7675 m 10 1986 m the incident angle is 19 69 the wave force and pressure distribution are calculated fig 17 shows the pressure distribution in sections 3 7 and 25 under different wave directions fig 17 b shows that the wave force in section 25 is higher than those in the other sections at the upper points in the se direction the wave force in section 3 is slightly higher than those in sections 7 and 25 generally for different wave directions the wave force and pressure distribution in each section are basically the same to study the overall pressure distribution characteristics at the vertical part in the arc shaped breakwater 29 pressure measurement sections s1 s29 are set as shown in fig 18 the arrangement of the pressure measurement points in each section is the same as that shown in fig 9 by measuring these sections the wave force and pressure distribution characteristics at the entire vertical weather side are analysed including the pressure distribution and wave force distribution when the entire weather side of the vertical part of arc shaped breakwater is subjected to maximum or minimum wave force figs 19 22 and that when in each section is subjected to maximum positive and negative wave forces figs 23 26 figs 19 and 20 show that under the action of the waves in different directions the pressure distribution and wave force gradually change along the central axis of the breakwater when the horizontal wave force on the vertical breakwater reaches its maximum value the pressure distribution characteristics in the wave facing upright wall become different with the decrease in the incident angle during the ene wave action the breakwater head is first impacted by the waves because of the large incident angle figs 19 a and 20 a the wave pressure is concentrated in the head area of the breakwater s1 s8 and the force in the other pressure sections is very small under the e direction wave action the wave force is concentrated in s1 s15 negative pressure appears in s16 s25 and a positive force subsequently appears in s26 s29 fig 19 b and fig 20 b this result indicates that the entire vertical part of the breakwater spans from one to two wavelength ranges following the gradual decrease in the incident angle the incident direction of the ese waves is basically perpendicular to the vertical breakwater figs 19 c and 20 c show that a positive force appears in s3 s27 and a negative force exists at both sides the wave pressure and wave force of the breakwater are basically symmetrically distributed the s6 and s24 cross sectional pressure values are maximum under the se wave action the area of force concentration on the breakwater occurs between s17 and s29 negative pressure appears in s8 s12 and s1 s6 are subjected to positive pressure figs 19 d and 20 d figs 21 and 22 show the pressure and wave force distribution characteristics in the vertical part of the arc shaped breakwater at the time of maximum negative wave force under the ene wave action the pressure distribution at the weather side takes the form of alternating positive and negative pressure figs 21 a and 22 a because of the large incident angle the central axis of the breakwater spans two wavelengths during the e direction wave action the breakwater is subjected to negative pressure except at s18 s24 figs 21 b and 22 b when the ese waves act on the breakwater the pressure distribution is basically symmetrical figs 21 c and 22 c as the wave incident angle continues to shift the negative pressure is mainly concentrated at s16 s29 under se waves s1 s16 take the form of alternating positive and negative pressure figs 21 d and 22 d figs 20 and 22 show that for the e ese and se direction waves the wave force distribution characteristics in the upright section of the breakwater when the wave facing side is subjected to maximum positive and negative wave forces are basically symmetrical for example in the ese wave action the wave force in s3 s27 is positive and symmetrical to s15 when the positive force reaches its maximum however the wave force in s3 s27 is negative and symmetrical to s15 when the negative force reaches its maximum because of the incident regular waves the pressure distribution and wave force in each section periodically change therefore the wave force on the vertical breakwater also periodically changes because of the curvature of the arc shaped breakwater the angle between the wave incident and tangential directions in each section varies to study the effect of the arc curvature on the wave force in each section the maximum positive and negative forces and their pressure distributions are calculated the results are shown in figs 23 26 which indicate that the pressure distribution characteristics and wave force in each section are basically the same under different oblique waves it investigated that the arc curvature has little effect on the wave force in the different sections 6 3 wave field behind the breakwater when water waves encounter the breakwater during propagation they pivot around the edge of the obstacle and move into the shadow zone of the obstacle this phenomenon is called diffraction of water waves the spatial distribution of the diffracted wave height of regular waves at a uniform depth can be computed using the sommerfeld solution based on the velocity potential theory goda 1985 for the interaction between the waves and breakwater diffraction is a common phenomenon and has been extensively studied since last century puttnam and arthur 1948 wang 1993 briggs et al 1995 kim 2010 studied the diffraction between the waves and long breakwaters chang et al 2012 derived an accurate solution for the diffraction between oblique waves and a single modified v shaped breakwater miao et al 2005 analysed the wave diffraction effects on arc shaped bottom mounted breakwaters the aforementioned studies were mainly based on the potential theory under the assumptions of no viscous effect and irrotational flow although miao s method succeeded in many cases including wave structure interactions the flow characteristics near the structures such as vortex and overtopping were neglected ji et al 2017 under extreme wave conditions the wave field behind the breakwater is not only affected by the diffraction but also the influence of overtopping cannot be ignored in actual sea conditions the wave field behind the breakwater is affected not only by the diffraction but also by the secondary higher harmonics waves generated by overtopping for the study of secondary higher harmonics waves behind a breakwater to the best of our knowledge existing research mainly focuses on wave and submerged breakwaters and the wave state behind the breakwater is studied using the wave height and period however few studies were conducted on the secondary higher harmonics waves caused by overtopping this section mainly discusses the wave height and wave period behind the breakwater under oblique regular waves by installing a series of surface elevation gauges the wave field behind a breakwater can be defined the layout of the measurement points is shown in fig 27 three rows of measurement points at the front of the breakwater and six rows behind the breakwater are set to measure the wave height and period according to the time history data of the wave measurement gauges the wave height and period at each measurement point are obtained because waves do not initially reach the breakwater the mean wave height and period are obtained using the data after 16 s fig 28 shows the spatial distribution of h h i h i denotes the incident wave height around the breakwater for the ene direction because of the large incident angle the influence of wave diffraction on the harbour is more obvious as shown in fig 13 d the diffracted wave enters the harbour along the edge of the breakwater and the diffracted wave height gradually decreases during propagation into the harbour the wave height behind the breakwater which is main caused by diffraction is approximately 0 5h i 0 7h i fig 13 shows that overtopping often occurs however the effect of overtopping on the wave height behind the breakwater is less than that of the diffraction the shielding area wave height is approximately 0 3h i for the e direction the influence of diffraction on the wave height behind the breakwater is smaller than that in the ene direction the wave height in the sheltered area is approximately 0 05 m which is approximately 0 25 times the incident wave height for the ese waves diffraction only affects the edge area of the arc shaped breakwater a region exists with a wave height of approximately 0 7h i which is behind the first attacked breakwater area it investigates that overtopping might significantly influence the wave height behind the breakwater for the se waves the wave state in the harbour is relatively stable and the wave heights are generally small at any location which are less than 0 5h i owing to the existence of the breakwater the wave height behind the breakwater is obviously smaller than that at the breakwater front which indicates that the arc shaped breakwater provides a great shielding effect on harbours with the decrease in the incident angle the influence of diffraction on the wave height behind the breakwater gradually decreases overtopping may cause a higher wave height behind the breakwater therefore the influence of overtopping should be considered in the study of the wave field behind a breakwater fig 29 shows the spatial distribution of the wave period under different wave directions t i indicates the incident period we can observe that the period at the front of the arc shaped breakwater is basically consistent with the incident period for different directions some regions exist behind the breakwater with periods that are obviously smaller than the incident period during the break in the overtopping flow behind the breakwater the free surface violently fluctuates and some high frequency waves are generated during the break in the overtopping flow resulting in some regions with smaller wave periods behind the breakwater reflection coefficient c r is an important parameter of the coastal structures design the method of ma et al 2011 is adopted to estimate c r details on the incident and reflected waves separation are reported in appendix a then six positions are selected to calculate the reflection coefficient c r as shown in fig 30 the results as shown in fig 31 it can be seen from fig 31 that as the incident angle decreases the c r of position 1 gradually decreases and the c r of position 6 gradually increases for the ene and e wave conditions c r generally increases along the axis of the breakwater under ese wave action c r of position 1 and position 6 are large and c r of position 3 and 4 are smaller this phenomenon indicates that the reflection wave height in the area of position 3 and 4 is small and the waves overtop the breakwater lead the transmission wave height is higher fig 28 for se direction waves c r of the is large in the breakwater head 7 conclusions the flow 3d model is applied to study the interaction between the waves and arc shaped breakwaters the madsen 1971 wave making theory is adopted and porous media are used to absorb the waves the change in the incident wave direction is implemented by moving the breakwater model comparison of the experimental data and numerical results demonstrates that the flow 3d model performs well in the wave breakwater interaction then the pressure distribution and wave force in the vertical part of the arc shaped breakwater along the central axis is investigated and the wave height and period of the wave field behind the breakwater are described the following conclusions are drawn 1 through comparison between the experimental data and numerical results of the pressure distribution and wave force in the different sections under the action of different wave directions the error between them is less than 5 which indicates that the numerical model can simulate the interaction between oblique waves and arc shaped breakwaters 2 the pressure distribution and wave force characteristics in the vertical part of the arc shaped breakwater along the central axis are studied when the entire horizontal wave force on the upright wall in the vertical part reaches the maximum the pressure distribution and wave force along the centre are obtained the wave force and pressure distribution in each section gradually vary along the central line because of the periodicity of the regular waves the pressure distributions at maximum positive and negative wave forces along the vertical part are symmetrical in the e ese and se directions for ene waves with a large incident angle the maximum horizontal positive force on the vertical part occurs when the crest of the first wave impacts the breakwater head area when the negative horizontal force reaches its maximum it takes the form of alternating positive and negative pressure along the central line then the maximum positive and negative wave forces in each section are compared the results show that the maximum positive and negative wave forces in each section are basically equal under different wave conditions we find that the arc curvature has little effect on the wave force in the different sections 3 the wave height and period behind the arc shaped breakwater are studied the wave height behind the breakwater is obviously smaller than that at the front with the decrease in the incident angle the influence of diffraction on the wave field behind the breakwater gradually decreases under ese waves the maximum wave height behind the breakwater caused by overtopping is approximately 0 7 times the incident wave height therefore the influence of overtopping should be considered in the design of breakwaters and arrangement for ship berthing in the spatial distribution of the wave period behind the breakwater some areas with a smaller period exist which may have been caused by the overtopping flow breaking behind the breakwater and high frequency waves are generated

20564,this study presents the experimental and numerical investigation on the ventilated partial cavity vpc under the influence of the 3 d flow effect i e the flow non uniformity induced by the lateral space the vpc is generated from the backward facing step of a flat plate in water tunnel the computational fluid dynamics together with the vof method is applied to simulate the cavity flow four cavity regimes are clarified referred to as two branch cavity tbc single tail cavity stc intermittent fully covered cavity ifcc and fully covered cavity fcc the cavity length of tbc in current experiments is much smaller than that observed in experiments of 2d wall mounted cavitators this contradictory observation is attributed to the stream wise vortexes induced by the 3 d flow effects the stream wise vortexes induce local low pressure cores and make cavity branches easier to extend downstream the cavity length and drag reduction of vpc are both found to first increase linearly and then plateaus with ventilation rate for tbc and stc the drag reduction is only determined by the cavity coverage for fcc and ifcc no clear relevance of cavity length and drag reduction is observed which means the stability of ifcc and fcc should be taken into consideration keywords ventilated partial cavity backward facing step vof cavity regime cavity length drag reduction 1 introduction the cavity flow is a common flow phenomenon encountered in the flow control field for applications of drag reduction perlin et al 2016 mäkiharju et al 2013 ceccio 2010 heat reduction sun et al 2019a sudarshan and saravanan 2018 and mixing augmentation huang et al 2016 2019 ventilated partial cavity flows beneath the bottom of hulls are created to reduce the skin friction drag cucinotta et al 2017 2019 and control the hydrodynamic characteristics wang et al 2021 the partial cavity separates the solid surface from liquid and results in a high skin friction drag reduction more than 95 for the area covered mäkiharju et al 2012 referred to as the ventilated partial cavity drag reduction pcdr perlin et al 2016 for pcdr flow separation devices connected to the air ventilation system usually named as cavitators i e backward facing step cavitator butterworth et al 2015 slyozkin et al 2014 arndt et al 2009 wedge cavitator matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 and fence cavitator barbaca et al 2017 2019 are often used to form the partial cavity beneath the hull by continuously ventilating air into the partial cavity or even without ventilation for the high speed stepped planing hull bilandi et al 2020 dashtimanesh et al 2020a a stable air cavity can be formed resulting in a considerable reduction of wet surface and corresponding drag since only low cost compressed air is needed the pcdr has been considered as an effective and environmentally friendly technology comparing with other drag reduction methods e g polymer drag reduction white and mungal 2008 xi 2019 the pcdr together with other air

considered as the more viable skin friction reduction method for marine vehicles peren et al 2017 extensive researches in theoretical studies and lab scale experiments have been conducted in the context of understanding cavity flow characteristics and corresponding drag reduction features to date most previous lab scale experiments carried out in the water tunnel have applied 2d wall mounted cavitators mäkiharju et al 2013 arndt et al 2009 qin et al 2019 zverkhovskyi 2014 barbaca et al 2018 that cover the entire tunnel width it is worth noting that the underlying assumption of 2 d wall mounted cavitators experiments is that the cavity flow only undergoes the two dimensional flow without span wise variation however contrary to this assumption for the ventilated cavity ship the cavity flow usually bears non uniform span wise flow structures due to the presence of the bow and boards both experimental and theoretical work without considering the non uniform span wise variation including authors previous experimental studies qin et al 2019 have shown their limitations in practical applications as revealed by previous studies fureby et al 2016 foeth 2008 for the application of pcdr in marine vehicles partial cavities usually undergo effects of 3 d flow underneath the hull it is found fureby et al 2016 foeth 2008 fureby et al 2016 foeth 2008 that the cavity flow regimes and drag reduction features are different from fundamental lab scale pcdr experiments with the 2 d incoming flow and theoretical analysis matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 1967 using potential flow theory to the best knowledge of the authors though several studies have investigated the cavity flow and the corresponding drag under the ship boat matveev et al 2009 jin ho 1999 dashtimanesh et al 2017 2020b de marco et al 2017 or flat plate with lateral space butterworth et al 2015 slyozkin et al 2014 wu et al 2019 no clear clarification has been made on the flow regime the geometrical characteristics and the corresponding drag reduction features the aforementioned knowledge gap between fundamental cavity flow studies and pcdr vehicles has limited the application of pcdr in practice foeth foeth 2008 has reported the negative effect of such 3 d flow effect on the cavity geometry and the corresponding drag reduction based on their prototype trials in their initial series of model tests without looking into the effect of 3 d incoming flow caused by the bow no reduction of resistance is obtained even changing the number and size of the cavities along the stream wise and span wise of the vessel this could be the reason why results from many previous full scale ship trials are often frustrating as reported in previous prototype trials foeth 2008 hoang et al 2009 takahashi et al 2003 only a few percentages of net energy saving are achieved or even no energy saving is observed in lab scale experiments barbaca et al 2017 2018 barbaca et al 2017 2018 have demonstrated the influence of 3 d incoming flow on the cavity geometry by comparing partial cavity flows between 2 d and 3 d wall mounted fences in their study due to the 3 d flow effect caused by the fence the break up of the cavity in flanks and the occasionally shedding of large gaseous clouds have been found proofs regarding the influence of such non uniform span wise variation on the cavity shape and length have also been observed in experiments of ventilated partial cavity under simplified hulls matveev et al 2009 jin ho 1999 i e causing non uniform span wise flow or flat plate with lateral space butterworth et al 2015 slyozkin et al 2014 in these experiments the cavity length is always smaller than the theoretical result i e the half wave length and cavity topologies showing an evident influence from the non uniform span wise flow are obtained though several studies have obtained some interesting phenomena of the partial cavity in the presence of 3 d flow effects far too little attention has been paid to the effect of 3 d flow on the ventilated partial cavity flow the partial cavity regime the geometrical characteristics and the corresponding drag reduction due to 3 d flow effects need to be further investigated to instruct the development of pcdr vehicles thus in this study the cavity regime the cavity length and the corresponding drag reduction of vpc under the influence of the 3 d flow effect i e the flow non uniformity induced by the lateral space are investigated by water tunnel experiments and numerical simulations the rest of the paper is structured as follows 2 introduces the experimental and numerical methods 3 provides the different ventilated partial cavity regimes the characteristic of equivalent cavity length of vpc and the feature of partial cavity drag reduction summary and conclusions are subsequently presented in 4 2 experimental and numerical methods 2 1 experimental setup and procedures experiments were conducted at shanghai ship and shipping research institute s high speed water tunnel the rectangular test section of the water tunnel has nominal dimensions of 2 6 m 0 6 m 0 6 m length height and width with side and bottom walls are made of plexiglas for flow visualization as described in previous studies qin et al 2017 sun et al flow speeds and pressures of the test section can vary from 1 to 12 m s and from 0 to 200 kpa respectively the uncertainties of flow speed and pressure measurements in the water tunnel experiments are around 0 1 fs the free stream turbulence intensity is below 0 5 as shown in fig 1 the vpc model the flat plate with a backward facing step is installed by four posts from the tunnel ceiling the ventilation lines for the air supplement and signal wires for the drag measurement are connected to the flat plate through these posts shown in fig 1 the vpc model is located in the center of the test section stream wise and span wise while the vertical distance from the ceiling of the water tunnel to the flat plate s upper surface is 0 22 m details of the vpc model the close up view of the cavitator and ventilation slot are shown in fig 2 a the nominal size of the plate is 1 4 m 0 4 m 0 04 m length width and thickness excluding the bfs portion i e the thickness of the cavitator is 10 mm or 15 mm the combination of a 4 1 elliptic curve and a straight line is applied as the transition from the leading edge to the bfs the distance from the leading edge to the bfs is 0 16 m while air is delivered in the stream wise direction through the horizontal slot that spans the aft end of the bfs the side view and the bottom view of the flat plate installation in situ are shown in fig 2 b and fig 2 c respectively mass flow rates of ventilated air are measured by two mass flow controllers with different measuring ranges alicat scientific model mcr 200slpm d and mcr 1000slpm d which guarantees the precise measurement of both low and high airflow rates the full scales of the mass flow controller are 200 slpm and 1000 slpm and the uncertainties of airflow measurements are around 1 fs the generation and maintaining of the vpc are observed visually from recorded videos while the corresponding partial cavity drag reductions are captured by the integrated skin friction force balance measurements the lower surface of the flat plate i e the surface covered by vpc is connected to four floating force balances to measure integrated skin friction the full scale of the force balance in stream wise is 50 n and the uncertainty of the measurement is within 0 1 fs the force balance is calibrated in situ during the measurement narrow span wise gaps around 0 1 mm are left for the stream wise free movement of the lower surface the front and rear gaps of the lower surface are covered by copper foils i e similar to the method used by zverkhovskyi zverkhovskyi 2014 the usage of copper foils allows the stream wise movement of the lower surface but blocks stream wise non uniform pressure videos of the vpc are recorded continuously with two high resolution cameras point grey gs3 u3 51s5m c controlled by flycapture2 the combined view of two cameras covers the entire cavity except for the middle portion of the cavity within 10 of the entire cavity length blocked by the wall of the water tunnel the resolution of the video is set around 1800 2000 pixels with a pixel dimension of 3 3 mm 3 3 mm here the resolution is calibrated from the width and the length plate for each flow condition more than 300 frames are saved at a frame rate of 75 fps experiments are conducted by keeping the free stream velocity constant while gradually increasing the ventilation rate by adjusting the mass flow controller for each experimental condition the integrated skin friction and the video of vpc are captured together with the ventilation rate and free stream velocity using the national instruments daqs all the flow and ventilation parameters as well as bfs heights are listed in table 1 the froude number based on step height in current experiments ranges from 2 8 to 8 0 while the airflow coefficient ranges from 2 8 10 2 to 8 2 10 1 2 2 numerical methods the computational fluid dynamics is carried out using the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method the interface tracking method volume of fluid vof is applied to simulate air water interface of the ventilated partial cavity based on the commercial solver fluent 18 0 under the hypothesis of adiabatic conditions the ensemble averaged mass and momentum equations can be written as 1 u j x j 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j p x i g i x i ρ x i x j μ u i x j u j x i f s where u i g i and p refer to the velocity acceleration of gravity and dynamics pressure respectively here ρ is the density μ is the dynamics viscosity and f s is the surface tension force given the value of volume fraction as α the local material properties of the fluid can be expressed as 3 ρ α ρ 1 1 α ρ 2 μ α μ 1 1 α μ 2 where indices 1 and 2 refer to the air and water phase for f s the continuous force model is applied as follows 4 f i s σ κ α x i κ n i f x i n i f α x i α x i δ n here κ is the curvature of the interface between the two phases σ is the surface tension coefficient n i f is the interface unit normal and δ n is a small number for numerical stability for the rans method a turbulent model is required to close the terms of effective viscosity in the n s equation the turbulent model has been ascertained to have a significant effect on the numerical result in previous numerical studies of the flow control problems sun et al 2019b kaiping et al 2010 ou et al 2018 huang et al 2012 for the ventilated cavity flow from a bfs it encounters separated flows and complex secondary flows as reported and validated in literature ansys 2018 shih et al 1995 the realizable k ε model provides good estimation of the separated flows and complex secondary flows due to the implementation of specific eddy viscosity formula and dissipation equation based on the dynamic equation of the mean square vorticity fluctuation thus in this work the realizable k ε turbulent model is applied as described above equations of 1 and 2 need to be complemented with the interface capturing approach i e vof method hirt and nichols 1981 to obtain the distribution of α the vof method designate a volume fraction α of each phase in the cell and capture the interface by calculating this variable in the whole flow field the second order reconstruction scheme based on the slope limiter i e the compressive scheme is adopted together with the sharp dispersed interface model enabling both sharp and dispersed interface modeling the advantage of the vof method is that it can model complex interface geometries in the flow field without regeneration of the grid the reliability of the vof method in simulating the ventilated partial cavity has been proven in previous literature zhang et al 2019 cucinotta et al 2018 fig 3 displays the computational grid as well as boundary conditions applied in the current simulation the wall normal grid size especially for the grids within the boundary layer is mainly determined by the turbulent model so we first get the appropriate wall normal grid size by initial calculations in the grid sensitivity investigation the wall normal grids remain unchanged and refine the mesh density in span wise and stream wise directions four levels of computational grids have been adopted in the grid sensitivity investigation as can be seen from the results shown in table 2 the difference of cavity length between grids of case 3 and case 4 can be neglected thus a total of over 5 21 million hexahedral elements are constructed and used in the current simulation it is estimated that the y at the bottom wall of the plate is around 30 60 which is located within the appropriate range of the realizable k ε turbulent model more details regarding the numerical method as well as the validation of the simulation result based on the cavity length please refer to the author s previous work sun et al et al for the convergence criterion the numerical results are considered to be converged when the residuals drop below 10 5 the simulations were conducted on the hpc of zhejiang university with 45 intel skylake gold 6132 processors 28 physical cores 2 6 ghz per processor for each case 2 processors with 56 physical cores were run about 40 h to get a converged result of the cavity flow 3 results and discussion 3 1 the ventilated partial cavity regime in the author s previous work qin et al 2019 four different kinds of cavity regimes are observed based on small scale ventilated cavity experiments in saint anthony falls laboratory s high speed water tunnel referred to as foamy cavity transition cavity open cavity and two branch cavity the two branch cavity which would be particularly interested in the application of ventilated cavity ship whose length is found to be only related to the froude number within the limited range of incoming velocities and ventilated rates however the cavity regime and the corresponding length remain unknown for much larger scale experiments when flow velocities are higher or ventilation increases tremendously therefore in current ventilated partial cavity experiments the cavity regime is investigated across much higher flow velocities and ventilation rates applying a much larger flat plate 3 1 1 the cavity regime fig 4 shows four typical cavity regimes observed in the current experiment except for the two branch cavity tbc three new regimes are clarified referred to as single tail cavity stc intermittent fully covered cavity ifcc and fully covered cavity fcc the classification of different cavity regimes is based on the variation of cavity shape within experimental flow conditions the two branch cavity shown in fig 4 a occurs when the ventilation is low at a certain freestream velocity in the tbc regime the closure in the center of the cavity is in smooth contact with the plate while two air branches extend downstream on both sides the tbc has been observed in the author s previous small scale vpc experiments qin et al 2019 i e model span width 200 mm without lateral spaces it is treated as the final stage of the ventilated partial cavity within previous flow conditions qin et al 2019 since both the cavity topology and length remain unchanged even with more than one order magnitude increases in ventilation however in current meso scale experiments i e model span width 400 mm with lateral spaces other than the tbc three more cavity regimes are obtained by increasing the ventilation tremendously as shown in fig 4 b c and d the stc shown in fig 4 b is the cavity with single tail branches out and extends further downstream near the center of the plate showing a single tail cavity pattern it is noteworthy that the stc regime has also been observed in the air ventilated cavity under the model hull encountering a non uniform incoming flow caused by boards from matveev matveev et al 2009 they observed that the stc only exists at the two lowest velocities at zero trim i e water velocities equal to 0 28 and 0 37 m s with a 0 406 m hull this observation is consistent with current experiments that the stc occurs only at the lowest flow velocity at u 1 1 m s i e the half wave length of water is much smaller than the length of the flat plate as shown in fig 4 c the ifcc almost covers the whole plate except the intermittent local patches these local patches are mainly located in the rear portion of the cavity since the ventilation is not high enough to support an entire cavity film with further increased ventilation the cavity interface stability of ifcc increases forming a fully covered cavity fcc as shown in fig 4 d fcc lubricates the whole plate and the wet area of the flat plate is significantly reduced by the ventilated partial cavity though the appearances of fccs are almost identical under different flow conditions their cross section profiles are different as revealed by the numerical result shown in fig 5 as can be seen in fig 5 b the fcc can be further classified into three different types of fcc characterized by the cross section profile of the cavity for the case when the length of the plate l p is larger than the half gravitational wave length λ 2 the fcc is a multi crest cavity with the distance between the first crest and bfs being equal to λ 2 i e correspond to 0 414 m from the semiempirical formulation of butuzov butuzov 1966 for l p λ 2 only one crest exists and the whole cavity is the combination of a partial cavity and a flat air layer it is worth noting that the distance between the crest is also equal to λ 2 i e 0 832m while for l p λ 2 the length of the cavity is limited by the length of the flat plate and the entire cavity is in a wave form while comparing with the cavity regimes obtained in previous small scale experiments qin et al 2019 those newly observed cavity regimes i e stc ifcc fcc occur at much higher ventilation coefficients shown in fig 6 in small scale experiments the cavity regime transits from the foamy cavity to the two branches cavity as the ventilation coefficient increases from 7 10 4 to 7 10 2 in current mesoscale experiments the cavity regime further changes from the two branches cavity to a fully covered cavity as the ventilation coefficient increases from 4 10 2 to 7 10 1 the fcc should be the final stage of the cavity regime as the cavity overshoots the whole length of the plate however special attention should be paid to identify different types of fcc based on the half gravitational wave length and the length of the plate or hull 3 1 2 the formation of cavity regime fig 7 to fig 10 further show the time series snapshots of each cavity regime during the formation of vpc as can be seen from fig 7 for the tbc the cavity develops almost uniformly in the span wise with the cavity length gradually extending downward in stream wise direction i e from t0 to t0 1 59 s once the cavity grows to a certain length i e t0 2 12 s the cavity length keeps almost unchangeable and only two air branches in flanks extent downstream as illustrated in the last two sequences in fig 7 the air leaks from the cavity through the pinch off of branches for stc as shown in fig 8 both the cavity length and branches increase after ventilation happens the width of the air branch expands being comparable to the half width of the plate during the growth of the cavity i e from t0 0 27 to t0 0 81 s once the branch on each side contacts each other two branches merge into a single tail and extend downstream then the stc forms and air leaks from the continuous tail of stc for ifcc and fcc as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 cavity shapes during the generation are more irregular in appearance than that of tbc and stc as can be seen in figs 9 and 10 from t0 to t0 0 81s cavity shapes of the ifcc and fcc are similar to the same stage of tbc but the size of branches are much larger than that of tbc for ifcc branches merge and fragment due to insufficient ventilation during the formation of the cavity the air leakage of ifcc is achieved in the form of broken air patches however for fcc the cavity interface is almost smooth after the merging of branches it covers the whole plate and extends beyond the flat plate the air leaks in the form of a continuous cavity film extending beyond the flat plate 3 2 the equivalent cavity length of the vpc to further investigate the geometrical characteristic of different cavity regimes the equivalent cavity length corresponding to the area covered by the air cavity divided by the span width of the plate is extracted and analyzed the equivalent cavity length l c of vpc is computed using the image processing and calculating steps illustrated in fig 11 here fig 11 a is the raw image captured by the high resolution camera and fig 11 b is the averaged image by the superimposition of time series of vpc images then the boundary of the vpc is captured by firstly subtracting the background and then manually edge detecting as shown in fig 11 c since the middle portion of the cavity is visually blocked by the tunnel wall the entire cavity area is calculated by the summary of the front rear and interpolation area the interpolation area is interpolated using the cavity area in front and rear images shown in fig 11 d finally the l c is obtained by dividing the calculated cavity area by the span wise distance of the plate fig 12 further shows the l c of different cavity regimes from two different cavitators i e h 10 mm and 15 mm over three freestream velocities for varying ventilation coefficients c q in the ordinates l c is normalized by l m i e the distance from the bfs to the end of skin friction measurement in order to further discuss drag reduction of vpc as can be seen from fig 12 different regimes of vpc exhibit different characteristics of l c with increasing of c q but no significant difference of l c is observed between the results of 10 mm and 15 mm cavitators in the tbc regime the l c l m increases almost linearly with the increment of c q however the cavity length plateaus and remains unchanged in the fcc regime while l c l m of the stc and ifcc fill in the range between tbc and fcc as can be further seen from fig 12 by comparing the slope of the l c l m versus the c q across different freestream velocities the slope decreases with the freestream velocity increases i e slopes of dashed lines decrease from 0 918 to 0 598 with u increase from 1 1 to 2 5 m s moreover the minimum and maximum l c l m of tbc increase with the increasing of freestream velocity i e the minimum l c l m increases from 0 21 to 0 61 and the maximum l c l m increases from 0 48 to 0 89 when u grows from 1 10 m s to 2 50 m s it is worth noting that the maximum l c of tbc in current experiments is much smaller than the half gravitational wave length i e λ 2 0 832 m for u 1 56 m s although this finding differs from some published studies matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 qin et al 2019 it is consistent with those of matveev et al 2009 and jin ho 1999 who measured the length of the air ventilated cavity under the model hull cavity lengths of vpc in matveev et al 2009 and jin ho 1999 are both found to be smaller than the half wave length from potential theory matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 as well as that observed in experiments with 2d wall mounted cavitators qin et al 2019 zverkhovskyi 2014 vpc studies under model hulls of matveev et al 2009 and jin ho 1999 undergo the 3 d incoming flow such flow conditions are similar to current vpc experiments with the 3 d incoming flow i e induced by the lateral space on the side of the flat plate thus this rather contradictory result is considered to be attributed to the presence of 3 d incoming flow this argument is further supported by the comparison between the flow filed with and without lateral spaces as shown in fig 13 a the near wall pressure is almost uniform in the span wise for the flow without lateral spaces however for the flow with lateral spaces i e fig 13 b as a result of the presence of stream wise vortexes the non uniformity of span wise pressure near the wall is obvious as compared to that of fig 13 a as clearly demonstrated in fig 13 b similar to the fore body bilge vortexes around the hull generating at the bow and extending towards sides of the hull fureby et al 2016 a pair of stream wise vortexes initially generating from the leading edge of the plate and extending towards the sides of the plate are observed for the case with lateral spaces such stream wise vortexes induce local low pressure cores at the side of the flat plate and make cavity branches easier to extend downstream resulting in the shorter cavity as compared to the case without lateral spaces due to the earlier leakage of air branches for tbc the appreciable elongation of the cavity due to the increment in c q is illustrated more clearly in fig 14 a d both experimental and numerical tbc over a range of c q from 0 0684 to 0 273 at u 1 56 m s are shown for comparison as demonstrated in fig 14 the cavity shapes of experimental and numerical tbc are almost consistent in appearance both experimental and numerical results show that the termination location of the cavity in the center grows stream wise and the cavity branches broaden as ventilation increases it is noteworthy that the l c l m only grows from 0 384 to 0 532 increases 38 5 for u 1 56 m s when the c q increases from 0 0684 to 0 273 increases 3 times for u 1 56 m s such observation indicates that most of the increased air does not benefit the cavity length but just leaks in the form of branches a possible explanation for this might be that the high pressure as can be seen from the pressure contour in fig 14 in the center portion of the plate blocks the further elongation of the cavity the increment of the ventilation just slightly raises the cavity pressure corresponding to the minor elongation of cavity length whereas most ventilated air just leaks from the corner of the plate and no further benefits on the development of cavity length however due to further ventilation the accumulated cavity pressure increases beyond the high pressure in the center of the plate and the cavity develops into new regimes such as ifcc and fcc so there is a critical ventilation rate for the vpc to cross the center high pressure and this critical value is considered to be much higher than the necessary ventilation rate used for maintaining the ifcc or fcc 3 3 the drag reduction 3 3 1 time traces of drag reduction the drag reduction features of aforementioned cavity regimes in the generation and stabilization stages are studied by measuring the integrated skin friction drag of the flat plate fig 15 shows typical time traces of ventilation rate and drag reduction under different cavity regimes for all cavity regimes a strong correlation between the ventilation rate q and the skin friction ratio c f c f 0 can be observed in fig 15 the c f c f 0 decreases immediately once the ventilation starts and then plateaus and remains around a particular value despite the fact that variation of c f c f 0 is appreciable the pertinent statistical quantity is stable as can be seen from the long time trace of c f c f 0 in generally higher q gains lower c f c f 0 for a given freestream velocity i e c f c f 0 is around 0 89 for q 12 5 l min while c f c f 0 decreases to approximately 0 33 for q 300 l min it is noteworthy that higher ventilation generally exhibits larger levels of skin friction variation such variation is not fully clear but one possible explanation is speculated due to the periodical break up of the cavity interface at the rear portion of the flat plate the continuous cavity interface is cut off due to the break up of the cavity interface such variation of the cavity coverage makes the variation of the drag reduction thus for ifcc and fcc more attention should be paid to the variation motion of the cavity except for cavity coverage 3 3 2 the mean feature of drag reduction in order to further study drag reduction features of the vpc under different flow conditions drag reduction ratios i e dr in the stabilization stage are presented in fig 16 here dr in the ordinates is the drag reduction ratio formulated as c f 0 c f c f 0 where c f f 1 2 ρ u 2 s f is the integrate skin friction drag measured by force balances and s is the area of skin friction drag measurement provided in the abscissas c q is the ventilation coefficient as has been described in table 1 as shown in fig 16 the height of bfs seems to have no appreciable influence on the drag reduction feature of vpc within the range of current experiments trends of the drag reduction are coincidence for h 10 mm and 15 mm as can be seen in fig 16 the drag reduction first increases almost linearly with increasing ventilation coefficient and then plateaus with the ventilation rate different cavity regimes generally exhibit different drag reduction features for the tbc regime the dr almost increases linearly with the increase of c q and the slope decreases with the increase of freestream velocity i e the slope of dashed lines decreases from 1 166 to 0 917 as freestream velocity increases from 1 1 to 2 5 m s moreover the minimum and maximum drs of tbc increase with the increasing freestream velocity i e the minimum dr increases from 0 45 to 38 1 and the maximum dr increases from 37 9 to 71 3 when freestream velocity grows from 1 10 to 2 50 m s however the dr is saturated and almost unchangeable for the fcc regime with a further increase of c q other cavity regimes referred to as the stc ifcc fill in the tbc and fcc band while comparing the saturated value of drag reduction among different freestream velocities as illustrated in fig 16 the saturated drag reduction generally raises with the increasing freestream velocities i e it increases from 0 621 to 0 818 as the freestream velocity increases from 1 10 to 2 5 m s the aforementioned observations accord with the feature of the equivalent cavity length discussed in section 3 2 which confirms the necessity for analyzing the cavity regime and geometrical characteristics of the vpc fig 17 further quantitatively shows the relationship between the drag reduction and cavity length over different cavity regimes as it demonstrated there are mainly two distinct regions with different features of l c l m and dr for the tbc and stc across different freestream velocities the drag reduction increases almost linearly with the rising of l c l m corresponding to the dashed line of a slope of 0 965 in fig 17 however for ifcc and fcc no distinct correlation between l c l m and dr is observed the values of drag reduction vary between 0 56 and 0 82 with similar cavity lengths this comparison indicates that the drag reduction of ifcc and fcc is not only determined by the cavity length other factors such as the pulsating of the cavity interface and the intermittent break up of the cavity should be taken into consideration for the estimation of potential drag reduction of vpc more attention regarding the variations of the ifcc and fcc should be paid in future studies 4 summary and conclusion the current study presents the experimental and numerical investigation on cavity regime cavity length and the corresponding drag reduction of the vpc under the influence of 3 d flow effect i e the flow non uniformity induced by the lateral space within current experimental flow conditions four cavity regimes are clarified in the presence of the 3 d flow effect except for the two branch cavity tbc observed from the vpc of 2 d cavitators three new regimes are revealed referred to as single tail cavity stc intermittent fully covered cavity ifcc and fully covered cavity fcc for the fcc though being identical in appearance it is noteworthy that there are three different types of fcc with different cross section profiles based on the difference between the half gravitational wave length and the length of the plate named as the multi crest cavity i e l p λ 2 single crest and air layer cavity i e l p λ 2 and single crest waveform cavity l p λ 2 respectively the second point is about the cavity length of vpc generally different regimes of vpc exhibit different features of cavity length with increasing ventilation coefficient the cavity length increases almost linearly with the increment of ventilation coefficient in the tbc regime but gradually plateaus and remains unchanged from the stc to fcc regime slopes of the increment of cavity length decrease with increasing freestream velocity but the minimum and maximum cavity length of tbc increase with increasing freestream velocity it is worth noting that the maximum cavity length of tbc in current experiments is much smaller than the half gravitational wave length matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 and the cavity length measured from vpc of 2d wall mounted cavitators qin et al 2019 zverkhovskyi 2014 however it is consistent with the length of the air ventilated cavity under model hulls matveev et al 2009 jin ho 1999 that undergo the 3 d incoming flow i e being similar to current vpc experiments with 3 d incoming flow such a rather contradictory result is attributed to the presence of 3 d incoming flow as supported by the numerical comparison between the flow filed with and without lateral spaces the 3 d incoming flow induces stream wise vortexes i e being similar to the fore body bilge vortexes around the hull generating at the bow and extending towards sides of the hull and the corresponding non uniformity of span wise pressure near the wall the pressure in flanks is much lower than the pressure in the center which makes cavity branches being much easier to extend downstream and results in a shorter cavity compared to the case without lateral spaces thus in the application of vpc ship the cavity lengths estimated from the half gravitational wave length or the empirical formulate of vpc from 2d wall mounted cavitators are inappropriate for the designing of vpc ship special attention should be paid to the 3 d flow effect on the length and the corresponding drag reduction of the cavity further time traces of drag reduction and ventilation have shown a strong correlation between the ventilation rate and skin friction ratio the skin friction drag decreases immediately once the ventilation starts and plateaus for the continuously ventilating the distribution of drag reduction across the wide range of flow conditions is found to be consistent with that of the cavity length for the tbc and stc the cavity length is the only factor that determines the drag reduction however for ifcc and fcc no distinct correlation between cavity length and drag reduction is observed other factors such as the pulsating of the cavity interface and the intermittent break up of the cavity should be taken into consideration for the estimation of the potential drag reduction of vpc more attention regarding the variations of the ifcc and fcc should be paid in future studies credit authorship contribution

20564,this study presents the experimental and numerical investigation on the ventilated partial cavity vpc under the influence of the 3 d flow effect i e the flow non uniformity induced by the lateral space the vpc is generated from the backward facing step of a flat plate in water tunnel the computational fluid dynamics together with the vof method is applied to simulate the cavity flow four cavity regimes are clarified referred to as two branch cavity tbc single tail cavity stc intermittent fully covered cavity ifcc and fully covered cavity fcc the cavity length of tbc in current experiments is much smaller than that observed in experiments of 2d wall mounted cavitators this contradictory observation is attributed to the stream wise vortexes induced by the 3 d flow effects the stream wise vortexes induce local low pressure cores and make cavity branches easier to extend downstream the cavity length and drag reduction of vpc are both found to first increase linearly and then plateaus with ventilation rate for tbc and stc the drag reduction is only determined by the cavity coverage for fcc and ifcc no clear relevance of cavity length and drag reduction is observed which means the stability of ifcc and fcc should be taken into consideration keywords ventilated partial cavity backward facing step vof cavity regime cavity length drag reduction 1 introduction the cavity flow is a common flow phenomenon encountered in the flow control field for applications of drag reduction perlin et al 2016 mäkiharju et al 2013 ceccio 2010 heat reduction sun et al 2019a sudarshan and saravanan 2018 and mixing augmentation huang et al 2016 2019 ventilated partial cavity flows beneath the bottom of hulls are created to reduce the skin friction drag cucinotta et al 2017 2019 and control the hydrodynamic characteristics wang et al 2021 the partial cavity separates the solid surface from liquid and results in a high skin friction drag reduction more than 95 for the area covered mäkiharju et al 2012 referred to as the ventilated partial cavity drag reduction pcdr perlin et al 2016 for pcdr flow separation devices connected to the air ventilation system usually named as cavitators i e backward facing step cavitator butterworth et al 2015 slyozkin et al 2014 arndt et al 2009 wedge cavitator matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 and fence cavitator barbaca et al 2017 2019 are often used to form the partial cavity beneath the hull by continuously ventilating air into the partial cavity or even without ventilation for the high speed stepped planing hull bilandi et al 2020 dashtimanesh et al 2020a a stable air cavity can be formed resulting in a considerable reduction of wet surface and corresponding drag since only low cost compressed air is needed the pcdr has been considered as an effective and environmentally friendly technology comparing with other drag reduction methods e g polymer drag reduction white and mungal 2008 xi 2019 the pcdr together with other air lubrication methods i e bubble drag reduction paik et al 2016 qin et al 2017 sanders et al 2006 air layer drag reduction wu et al 2019 2020 matveev 2019 zhang et al 2019 elbing et al 2013 has been considered as the more viable skin friction reduction method for marine vehicles peren et al 2017 extensive researches in theoretical studies and lab scale experiments have been conducted in the context of understanding cavity flow characteristics and corresponding drag reduction features to date most previous lab scale experiments carried out in the water tunnel have applied 2d wall mounted cavitators mäkiharju et al 2013 arndt et al 2009 qin et al 2019 zverkhovskyi 2014 barbaca et al 2018 that cover the entire tunnel width it is worth noting that the underlying assumption of 2 d wall mounted cavitators experiments is that the cavity flow only undergoes the two dimensional flow without span wise variation however contrary to this assumption for the ventilated cavity ship the cavity flow usually bears non uniform span wise flow structures due to the presence of the bow and boards both experimental and theoretical work without considering the non uniform span wise variation including authors previous experimental studies qin et al 2019 have shown their limitations in practical applications as revealed by previous studies fureby et al 2016 foeth 2008 for the application of pcdr in marine vehicles partial cavities usually undergo effects of 3 d flow underneath the hull it is found fureby et al 2016 foeth 2008 fureby et al 2016 foeth 2008 that the cavity flow regimes and drag reduction features are different from fundamental lab scale pcdr experiments with the 2 d incoming flow and theoretical analysis matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 1967 using potential flow theory to the best knowledge of the authors though several studies have investigated the cavity flow and the corresponding drag under the ship boat matveev et al 2009 jin ho 1999 dashtimanesh et al 2017 2020b de marco et al 2017 or flat plate with lateral space butterworth et al 2015 slyozkin et al 2014 wu et al 2019 no clear clarification has been made on the flow regime the geometrical characteristics and the corresponding drag reduction features the aforementioned knowledge gap between fundamental cavity flow studies and pcdr vehicles has limited the application of pcdr in practice foeth foeth 2008 has reported the negative effect of such 3 d flow effect on the cavity geometry and the corresponding drag reduction based on their prototype trials in their initial series of model tests without looking into the effect of 3 d incoming flow caused by the bow no reduction of resistance is obtained even changing the number and size of the cavities along the stream wise and span wise of the vessel this could be the reason why results from many previous full scale ship trials are often frustrating as reported in previous prototype trials foeth 2008 hoang et al 2009 takahashi et al 2003 only a few percentages of net energy saving are achieved or even no energy saving is observed in lab scale experiments barbaca et al 2017 2018 barbaca et al 2017 2018 have demonstrated the influence of 3 d incoming flow on the cavity geometry by comparing partial cavity flows between 2 d and 3 d wall mounted fences in their study due to the 3 d flow effect caused by the fence the break up of the cavity in flanks and the occasionally shedding of large gaseous clouds have been found proofs regarding the influence of such non uniform span wise variation on the cavity shape and length have also been observed in experiments of ventilated partial cavity under simplified hulls matveev et al 2009 jin ho 1999 i e causing non uniform span wise flow or flat plate with lateral space butterworth et al 2015 slyozkin et al 2014 in these experiments the cavity length is always smaller than the theoretical result i e the half wave length and cavity topologies showing an evident influence from the non uniform span wise flow are obtained though several studies have obtained some interesting phenomena of the partial cavity in the presence of 3 d flow effects far too little attention has been paid to the effect of 3 d flow on the ventilated partial cavity flow the partial cavity regime the geometrical characteristics and the corresponding drag reduction due to 3 d flow effects need to be further investigated to instruct the development of pcdr vehicles thus in this study the cavity regime the cavity length and the corresponding drag reduction of vpc under the influence of the 3 d flow effect i e the flow non uniformity induced by the lateral space are investigated by water tunnel experiments and numerical simulations the rest of the paper is structured as follows 2 introduces the experimental and numerical methods 3 provides the different ventilated partial cavity regimes the characteristic of equivalent cavity length of vpc and the feature of partial cavity drag reduction summary and conclusions are subsequently presented in 4 2 experimental and numerical methods 2 1 experimental setup and procedures experiments were conducted at shanghai ship and shipping research institute s high speed water tunnel the rectangular test section of the water tunnel has nominal dimensions of 2 6 m 0 6 m 0 6 m length height and width with side and bottom walls are made of plexiglas for flow visualization as described in previous studies qin et al 2017 sun et al flow speeds and pressures of the test section can vary from 1 to 12 m s and from 0 to 200 kpa respectively the uncertainties of flow speed and pressure measurements in the water tunnel experiments are around 0 1 fs the free stream turbulence intensity is below 0 5 as shown in fig 1 the vpc model the flat plate with a backward facing step is installed by four posts from the tunnel ceiling the ventilation lines for the air supplement and signal wires for the drag measurement are connected to the flat plate through these posts shown in fig 1 the vpc model is located in the center of the test section stream wise and span wise while the vertical distance from the ceiling of the water tunnel to the flat plate s upper surface is 0 22 m details of the vpc model the close up view of the cavitator and ventilation slot are shown in fig 2 a the nominal size of the plate is 1 4 m 0 4 m 0 04 m length width and thickness excluding the bfs portion i e the thickness of the cavitator is 10 mm or 15 mm the combination of a 4 1 elliptic curve and a straight line is applied as the transition from the leading edge to the bfs the distance from the leading edge to the bfs is 0 16 m while air is delivered in the stream wise direction through the horizontal slot that spans the aft end of the bfs the side view and the bottom view of the flat plate installation in situ are shown in fig 2 b and fig 2 c respectively mass flow rates of ventilated air are measured by two mass flow controllers with different measuring ranges alicat scientific model mcr 200slpm d and mcr 1000slpm d which guarantees the precise measurement of both low and high airflow rates the full scales of the mass flow controller are 200 slpm and 1000 slpm and the uncertainties of airflow measurements are around 1 fs the generation and maintaining of the vpc are observed visually from recorded videos while the corresponding partial cavity drag reductions are captured by the integrated skin friction force balance measurements the lower surface of the flat plate i e the surface covered by vpc is connected to four floating force balances to measure integrated skin friction the full scale of the force balance in stream wise is 50 n and the uncertainty of the measurement is within 0 1 fs the force balance is calibrated in situ during the measurement narrow span wise gaps around 0 1 mm are left for the stream wise free movement of the lower surface the front and rear gaps of the lower surface are covered by copper foils i e similar to the method used by zverkhovskyi zverkhovskyi 2014 the usage of copper foils allows the stream wise movement of the lower surface but blocks stream wise non uniform pressure videos of the vpc are recorded continuously with two high resolution cameras point grey gs3 u3 51s5m c controlled by flycapture2 the combined view of two cameras covers the entire cavity except for the middle portion of the cavity within 10 of the entire cavity length blocked by the wall of the water tunnel the resolution of the video is set around 1800 2000 pixels with a pixel dimension of 3 3 mm 3 3 mm here the resolution is calibrated from the width and the length plate for each flow condition more than 300 frames are saved at a frame rate of 75 fps experiments are conducted by keeping the free stream velocity constant while gradually increasing the ventilation rate by adjusting the mass flow controller for each experimental condition the integrated skin friction and the video of vpc are captured together with the ventilation rate and free stream velocity using the national instruments daqs all the flow and ventilation parameters as well as bfs heights are listed in table 1 the froude number based on step height in current experiments ranges from 2 8 to 8 0 while the airflow coefficient ranges from 2 8 10 2 to 8 2 10 1 2 2 numerical methods the computational fluid dynamics is carried out using the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method the interface tracking method volume of fluid vof is applied to simulate air water interface of the ventilated partial cavity based on the commercial solver fluent 18 0 under the hypothesis of adiabatic conditions the ensemble averaged mass and momentum equations can be written as 1 u j x j 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j p x i g i x i ρ x i x j μ u i x j u j x i f s where u i g i and p refer to the velocity acceleration of gravity and dynamics pressure respectively here ρ is the density μ is the dynamics viscosity and f s is the surface tension force given the value of volume fraction as α the local material properties of the fluid can be expressed as 3 ρ α ρ 1 1 α ρ 2 μ α μ 1 1 α μ 2 where indices 1 and 2 refer to the air and water phase for f s the continuous force model is applied as follows 4 f i s σ κ α x i κ n i f x i n i f α x i α x i δ n here κ is the curvature of the interface between the two phases σ is the surface tension coefficient n i f is the interface unit normal and δ n is a small number for numerical stability for the rans method a turbulent model is required to close the terms of effective viscosity in the n s equation the turbulent model has been ascertained to have a significant effect on the numerical result in previous numerical studies of the flow control problems sun et al 2019b kaiping et al 2010 ou et al 2018 huang et al 2012 for the ventilated cavity flow from a bfs it encounters separated flows and complex secondary flows as reported and validated in literature ansys 2018 shih et al 1995 the realizable k ε model provides good estimation of the separated flows and complex secondary flows due to the implementation of specific eddy viscosity formula and dissipation equation based on the dynamic equation of the mean square vorticity fluctuation thus in this work the realizable k ε turbulent model is applied as described above equations of 1 and 2 need to be complemented with the interface capturing approach i e vof method hirt and nichols 1981 to obtain the distribution of α the vof method designate a volume fraction α of each phase in the cell and capture the interface by calculating this variable in the whole flow field the second order reconstruction scheme based on the slope limiter i e the compressive scheme is adopted together with the sharp dispersed interface model enabling both sharp and dispersed interface modeling the advantage of the vof method is that it can model complex interface geometries in the flow field without regeneration of the grid the reliability of the vof method in simulating the ventilated partial cavity has been proven in previous literature zhang et al 2019 cucinotta et al 2018 fig 3 displays the computational grid as well as boundary conditions applied in the current simulation the wall normal grid size especially for the grids within the boundary layer is mainly determined by the turbulent model so we first get the appropriate wall normal grid size by initial calculations in the grid sensitivity investigation the wall normal grids remain unchanged and refine the mesh density in span wise and stream wise directions four levels of computational grids have been adopted in the grid sensitivity investigation as can be seen from the results shown in table 2 the difference of cavity length between grids of case 3 and case 4 can be neglected thus a total of over 5 21 million hexahedral elements are constructed and used in the current simulation it is estimated that the y at the bottom wall of the plate is around 30 60 which is located within the appropriate range of the realizable k ε turbulent model more details regarding the numerical method as well as the validation of the simulation result based on the cavity length please refer to the author s previous work sun et al et al for the convergence criterion the numerical results are considered to be converged when the residuals drop below 10 5 the simulations were conducted on the hpc of zhejiang university with 45 intel skylake gold 6132 processors 28 physical cores 2 6 ghz per processor for each case 2 processors with 56 physical cores were run about 40 h to get a converged result of the cavity flow 3 results and discussion 3 1 the ventilated partial cavity regime in the author s previous work qin et al 2019 four different kinds of cavity regimes are observed based on small scale ventilated cavity experiments in saint anthony falls laboratory s high speed water tunnel referred to as foamy cavity transition cavity open cavity and two branch cavity the two branch cavity which would be particularly interested in the application of ventilated cavity ship whose length is found to be only related to the froude number within the limited range of incoming velocities and ventilated rates however the cavity regime and the corresponding length remain unknown for much larger scale experiments when flow velocities are higher or ventilation increases tremendously therefore in current ventilated partial cavity experiments the cavity regime is investigated across much higher flow velocities and ventilation rates applying a much larger flat plate 3 1 1 the cavity regime fig 4 shows four typical cavity regimes observed in the current experiment except for the two branch cavity tbc three new regimes are clarified referred to as single tail cavity stc intermittent fully covered cavity ifcc and fully covered cavity fcc the classification of different cavity regimes is based on the variation of cavity shape within experimental flow conditions the two branch cavity shown in fig 4 a occurs when the ventilation is low at a certain freestream velocity in the tbc regime the closure in the center of the cavity is in smooth contact with the plate while two air branches extend downstream on both sides the tbc has been observed in the author s previous small scale vpc experiments qin et al 2019 i e model span width 200 mm without lateral spaces it is treated as the final stage of the ventilated partial cavity within previous flow conditions qin et al 2019 since both the cavity topology and length remain unchanged even with more than one order magnitude increases in ventilation however in current meso scale experiments i e model span width 400 mm with lateral spaces other than the tbc three more cavity regimes are obtained by increasing the ventilation tremendously as shown in fig 4 b c and d the stc shown in fig 4 b is the cavity with single tail branches out and extends further downstream near the center of the plate showing a single tail cavity pattern it is noteworthy that the stc regime has also been observed in the air ventilated cavity under the model hull encountering a non uniform incoming flow caused by boards from matveev matveev et al 2009 they observed that the stc only exists at the two lowest velocities at zero trim i e water velocities equal to 0 28 and 0 37 m s with a 0 406 m hull this observation is consistent with current experiments that the stc occurs only at the lowest flow velocity at u 1 1 m s i e the half wave length of water is much smaller than the length of the flat plate as shown in fig 4 c the ifcc almost covers the whole plate except the intermittent local patches these local patches are mainly located in the rear portion of the cavity since the ventilation is not high enough to support an entire cavity film with further increased ventilation the cavity interface stability of ifcc increases forming a fully covered cavity fcc as shown in fig 4 d fcc lubricates the whole plate and the wet area of the flat plate is significantly reduced by the ventilated partial cavity though the appearances of fccs are almost identical under different flow conditions their cross section profiles are different as revealed by the numerical result shown in fig 5 as can be seen in fig 5 b the fcc can be further classified into three different types of fcc characterized by the cross section profile of the cavity for the case when the length of the plate l p is larger than the half gravitational wave length λ 2 the fcc is a multi crest cavity with the distance between the first crest and bfs being equal to λ 2 i e correspond to 0 414 m from the semiempirical formulation of butuzov butuzov 1966 for l p λ 2 only one crest exists and the whole cavity is the combination of a partial cavity and a flat air layer it is worth noting that the distance between the crest is also equal to λ 2 i e 0 832m while for l p λ 2 the length of the cavity is limited by the length of the flat plate and the entire cavity is in a wave form while comparing with the cavity regimes obtained in previous small scale experiments qin et al 2019 those newly observed cavity regimes i e stc ifcc fcc occur at much higher ventilation coefficients shown in fig 6 in small scale experiments the cavity regime transits from the foamy cavity to the two branches cavity as the ventilation coefficient increases from 7 10 4 to 7 10 2 in current mesoscale experiments the cavity regime further changes from the two branches cavity to a fully covered cavity as the ventilation coefficient increases from 4 10 2 to 7 10 1 the fcc should be the final stage of the cavity regime as the cavity overshoots the whole length of the plate however special attention should be paid to identify different types of fcc based on the half gravitational wave length and the length of the plate or hull 3 1 2 the formation of cavity regime fig 7 to fig 10 further show the time series snapshots of each cavity regime during the formation of vpc as can be seen from fig 7 for the tbc the cavity develops almost uniformly in the span wise with the cavity length gradually extending downward in stream wise direction i e from t0 to t0 1 59 s once the cavity grows to a certain length i e t0 2 12 s the cavity length keeps almost unchangeable and only two air branches in flanks extent downstream as illustrated in the last two sequences in fig 7 the air leaks from the cavity through the pinch off of branches for stc as shown in fig 8 both the cavity length and branches increase after ventilation happens the width of the air branch expands being comparable to the half width of the plate during the growth of the cavity i e from t0 0 27 to t0 0 81 s once the branch on each side contacts each other two branches merge into a single tail and extend downstream then the stc forms and air leaks from the continuous tail of stc for ifcc and fcc as shown in fig 9 and fig 10 cavity shapes during the generation are more irregular in appearance than that of tbc and stc as can be seen in figs 9 and 10 from t0 to t0 0 81s cavity shapes of the ifcc and fcc are similar to the same stage of tbc but the size of branches are much larger than that of tbc for ifcc branches merge and fragment due to insufficient ventilation during the formation of the cavity the air leakage of ifcc is achieved in the form of broken air patches however for fcc the cavity interface is almost smooth after the merging of branches it covers the whole plate and extends beyond the flat plate the air leaks in the form of a continuous cavity film extending beyond the flat plate 3 2 the equivalent cavity length of the vpc to further investigate the geometrical characteristic of different cavity regimes the equivalent cavity length corresponding to the area covered by the air cavity divided by the span width of the plate is extracted and analyzed the equivalent cavity length l c of vpc is computed using the image processing and calculating steps illustrated in fig 11 here fig 11 a is the raw image captured by the high resolution camera and fig 11 b is the averaged image by the superimposition of time series of vpc images then the boundary of the vpc is captured by firstly subtracting the background and then manually edge detecting as shown in fig 11 c since the middle portion of the cavity is visually blocked by the tunnel wall the entire cavity area is calculated by the summary of the front rear and interpolation area the interpolation area is interpolated using the cavity area in front and rear images shown in fig 11 d finally the l c is obtained by dividing the calculated cavity area by the span wise distance of the plate fig 12 further shows the l c of different cavity regimes from two different cavitators i e h 10 mm and 15 mm over three freestream velocities for varying ventilation coefficients c q in the ordinates l c is normalized by l m i e the distance from the bfs to the end of skin friction measurement in order to further discuss drag reduction of vpc as can be seen from fig 12 different regimes of vpc exhibit different characteristics of l c with increasing of c q but no significant difference of l c is observed between the results of 10 mm and 15 mm cavitators in the tbc regime the l c l m increases almost linearly with the increment of c q however the cavity length plateaus and remains unchanged in the fcc regime while l c l m of the stc and ifcc fill in the range between tbc and fcc as can be further seen from fig 12 by comparing the slope of the l c l m versus the c q across different freestream velocities the slope decreases with the freestream velocity increases i e slopes of dashed lines decrease from 0 918 to 0 598 with u increase from 1 1 to 2 5 m s moreover the minimum and maximum l c l m of tbc increase with the increasing of freestream velocity i e the minimum l c l m increases from 0 21 to 0 61 and the maximum l c l m increases from 0 48 to 0 89 when u grows from 1 10 m s to 2 50 m s it is worth noting that the maximum l c of tbc in current experiments is much smaller than the half gravitational wave length i e λ 2 0 832 m for u 1 56 m s although this finding differs from some published studies matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 qin et al 2019 it is consistent with those of matveev et al 2009 and jin ho 1999 who measured the length of the air ventilated cavity under the model hull cavity lengths of vpc in matveev et al 2009 and jin ho 1999 are both found to be smaller than the half wave length from potential theory matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 as well as that observed in experiments with 2d wall mounted cavitators qin et al 2019 zverkhovskyi 2014 vpc studies under model hulls of matveev et al 2009 and jin ho 1999 undergo the 3 d incoming flow such flow conditions are similar to current vpc experiments with the 3 d incoming flow i e induced by the lateral space on the side of the flat plate thus this rather contradictory result is considered to be attributed to the presence of 3 d incoming flow this argument is further supported by the comparison between the flow filed with and without lateral spaces as shown in fig 13 a the near wall pressure is almost uniform in the span wise for the flow without lateral spaces however for the flow with lateral spaces i e fig 13 b as a result of the presence of stream wise vortexes the non uniformity of span wise pressure near the wall is obvious as compared to that of fig 13 a as clearly demonstrated in fig 13 b similar to the fore body bilge vortexes around the hull generating at the bow and extending towards sides of the hull fureby et al 2016 a pair of stream wise vortexes initially generating from the leading edge of the plate and extending towards the sides of the plate are observed for the case with lateral spaces such stream wise vortexes induce local low pressure cores at the side of the flat plate and make cavity branches easier to extend downstream resulting in the shorter cavity as compared to the case without lateral spaces due to the earlier leakage of air branches for tbc the appreciable elongation of the cavity due to the increment in c q is illustrated more clearly in fig 14 a d both experimental and numerical tbc over a range of c q from 0 0684 to 0 273 at u 1 56 m s are shown for comparison as demonstrated in fig 14 the cavity shapes of experimental and numerical tbc are almost consistent in appearance both experimental and numerical results show that the termination location of the cavity in the center grows stream wise and the cavity branches broaden as ventilation increases it is noteworthy that the l c l m only grows from 0 384 to 0 532 increases 38 5 for u 1 56 m s when the c q increases from 0 0684 to 0 273 increases 3 times for u 1 56 m s such observation indicates that most of the increased air does not benefit the cavity length but just leaks in the form of branches a possible explanation for this might be that the high pressure as can be seen from the pressure contour in fig 14 in the center portion of the plate blocks the further elongation of the cavity the increment of the ventilation just slightly raises the cavity pressure corresponding to the minor elongation of cavity length whereas most ventilated air just leaks from the corner of the plate and no further benefits on the development of cavity length however due to further ventilation the accumulated cavity pressure increases beyond the high pressure in the center of the plate and the cavity develops into new regimes such as ifcc and fcc so there is a critical ventilation rate for the vpc to cross the center high pressure and this critical value is considered to be much higher than the necessary ventilation rate used for maintaining the ifcc or fcc 3 3 the drag reduction 3 3 1 time traces of drag reduction the drag reduction features of aforementioned cavity regimes in the generation and stabilization stages are studied by measuring the integrated skin friction drag of the flat plate fig 15 shows typical time traces of ventilation rate and drag reduction under different cavity regimes for all cavity regimes a strong correlation between the ventilation rate q and the skin friction ratio c f c f 0 can be observed in fig 15 the c f c f 0 decreases immediately once the ventilation starts and then plateaus and remains around a particular value despite the fact that variation of c f c f 0 is appreciable the pertinent statistical quantity is stable as can be seen from the long time trace of c f c f 0 in generally higher q gains lower c f c f 0 for a given freestream velocity i e c f c f 0 is around 0 89 for q 12 5 l min while c f c f 0 decreases to approximately 0 33 for q 300 l min it is noteworthy that higher ventilation generally exhibits larger levels of skin friction variation such variation is not fully clear but one possible explanation is speculated due to the periodical break up of the cavity interface at the rear portion of the flat plate the continuous cavity interface is cut off due to the break up of the cavity interface such variation of the cavity coverage makes the variation of the drag reduction thus for ifcc and fcc more attention should be paid to the variation motion of the cavity except for cavity coverage 3 3 2 the mean feature of drag reduction in order to further study drag reduction features of the vpc under different flow conditions drag reduction ratios i e dr in the stabilization stage are presented in fig 16 here dr in the ordinates is the drag reduction ratio formulated as c f 0 c f c f 0 where c f f 1 2 ρ u 2 s f is the integrate skin friction drag measured by force balances and s is the area of skin friction drag measurement provided in the abscissas c q is the ventilation coefficient as has been described in table 1 as shown in fig 16 the height of bfs seems to have no appreciable influence on the drag reduction feature of vpc within the range of current experiments trends of the drag reduction are coincidence for h 10 mm and 15 mm as can be seen in fig 16 the drag reduction first increases almost linearly with increasing ventilation coefficient and then plateaus with the ventilation rate different cavity regimes generally exhibit different drag reduction features for the tbc regime the dr almost increases linearly with the increase of c q and the slope decreases with the increase of freestream velocity i e the slope of dashed lines decreases from 1 166 to 0 917 as freestream velocity increases from 1 1 to 2 5 m s moreover the minimum and maximum drs of tbc increase with the increasing freestream velocity i e the minimum dr increases from 0 45 to 38 1 and the maximum dr increases from 37 9 to 71 3 when freestream velocity grows from 1 10 to 2 50 m s however the dr is saturated and almost unchangeable for the fcc regime with a further increase of c q other cavity regimes referred to as the stc ifcc fill in the tbc and fcc band while comparing the saturated value of drag reduction among different freestream velocities as illustrated in fig 16 the saturated drag reduction generally raises with the increasing freestream velocities i e it increases from 0 621 to 0 818 as the freestream velocity increases from 1 10 to 2 5 m s the aforementioned observations accord with the feature of the equivalent cavity length discussed in section 3 2 which confirms the necessity for analyzing the cavity regime and geometrical characteristics of the vpc fig 17 further quantitatively shows the relationship between the drag reduction and cavity length over different cavity regimes as it demonstrated there are mainly two distinct regions with different features of l c l m and dr for the tbc and stc across different freestream velocities the drag reduction increases almost linearly with the rising of l c l m corresponding to the dashed line of a slope of 0 965 in fig 17 however for ifcc and fcc no distinct correlation between l c l m and dr is observed the values of drag reduction vary between 0 56 and 0 82 with similar cavity lengths this comparison indicates that the drag reduction of ifcc and fcc is not only determined by the cavity length other factors such as the pulsating of the cavity interface and the intermittent break up of the cavity should be taken into consideration for the estimation of potential drag reduction of vpc more attention regarding the variations of the ifcc and fcc should be paid in future studies 4 summary and conclusion the current study presents the experimental and numerical investigation on cavity regime cavity length and the corresponding drag reduction of the vpc under the influence of 3 d flow effect i e the flow non uniformity induced by the lateral space within current experimental flow conditions four cavity regimes are clarified in the presence of the 3 d flow effect except for the two branch cavity tbc observed from the vpc of 2 d cavitators three new regimes are revealed referred to as single tail cavity stc intermittent fully covered cavity ifcc and fully covered cavity fcc for the fcc though being identical in appearance it is noteworthy that there are three different types of fcc with different cross section profiles based on the difference between the half gravitational wave length and the length of the plate named as the multi crest cavity i e l p λ 2 single crest and air layer cavity i e l p λ 2 and single crest waveform cavity l p λ 2 respectively the second point is about the cavity length of vpc generally different regimes of vpc exhibit different features of cavity length with increasing ventilation coefficient the cavity length increases almost linearly with the increment of ventilation coefficient in the tbc regime but gradually plateaus and remains unchanged from the stc to fcc regime slopes of the increment of cavity length decrease with increasing freestream velocity but the minimum and maximum cavity length of tbc increase with increasing freestream velocity it is worth noting that the maximum cavity length of tbc in current experiments is much smaller than the half gravitational wave length matveev 2003 butuzov 1966 and the cavity length measured from vpc of 2d wall mounted cavitators qin et al 2019 zverkhovskyi 2014 however it is consistent with the length of the air ventilated cavity under model hulls matveev et al 2009 jin ho 1999 that undergo the 3 d incoming flow i e being similar to current vpc experiments with 3 d incoming flow such a rather contradictory result is attributed to the presence of 3 d incoming flow as supported by the numerical comparison between the flow filed with and without lateral spaces the 3 d incoming flow induces stream wise vortexes i e being similar to the fore body bilge vortexes around the hull generating at the bow and extending towards sides of the hull and the corresponding non uniformity of span wise pressure near the wall the pressure in flanks is much lower than the pressure in the center which makes cavity branches being much easier to extend downstream and results in a shorter cavity compared to the case without lateral spaces thus in the application of vpc ship the cavity lengths estimated from the half gravitational wave length or the empirical formulate of vpc from 2d wall mounted cavitators are inappropriate for the designing of vpc ship special attention should be paid to the 3 d flow effect on the length and the corresponding drag reduction of the cavity further time traces of drag reduction and ventilation have shown a strong correlation between the ventilation rate and skin friction ratio the skin friction drag decreases immediately once the ventilation starts and plateaus for the continuously ventilating the distribution of drag reduction across the wide range of flow conditions is found to be consistent with that of the cavity length for the tbc and stc the cavity length is the only factor that determines the drag reduction however for ifcc and fcc no distinct correlation between cavity length and drag reduction is observed other factors such as the pulsating of the cavity interface and the intermittent break up of the cavity should be taken into consideration for the estimation of the potential drag reduction of vpc more attention regarding the variations of the ifcc and fcc should be paid in future studies credit authorship contribution
